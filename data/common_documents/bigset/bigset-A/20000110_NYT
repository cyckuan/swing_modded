COWBOYS COLLAPSE, LEAVE GAILEY HANGING
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The Cowboys finally went out and finished
something yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Their season.
</P>
<P>
   They validated nearly four months of mental mistakes, fast
starts/slow finishes, self-destruction and (yesterday's favorite
buzzword) ... underachievement.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter end came in the form of a 27-10 loss to the Minnesota
Vikings in a NFC wild-card game at the Metrodome. The Cowboys gave
up 24 unanswered points after taking 10-3 lead, mostly on the early
running success of Emmitt Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys turned the ball over four times, played their worst
run defense of the season, dropped passes ... and dropped their
eighth consecutive road game to finish 8-9 after a 3-0 start.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Moss caught five passes for 127 yards and a touchdown,
which is a routine game for the Vikings' big-play receiver over the
past two seasons against the Cowboys (three games, 14 catches, 381
yards and six touchdowns). But Robert Smith made the difference in
this game, rushing 28 times for 140 and catching three screen
passes for another 58 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's events seemed to further jeopardize the job security
of second-year coach Chan Gailey, who has three years left on a
contract he signed 23 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was talking ... he
just wasn't providing details.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reserve any comment on \RGailey's status\S for later in the
week,'' said Jones, whose mood seemed less like anger than a
businesslike determination to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no meeting scheduled for assessing the situation,''
Jones assured.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last month, Jones openly supported Gailey on
several occasions. That was before consecutive losses to the New
York Jets and New Orleans Saints.
</P>
<P>
   Jones made it clear yesterday that he is not going to tolerate
what he has witnessed: a losing season and playoff failures. (The
Cowboys are 0-2 in the playoffs under Gailey and haven't won a
postseason game since 1996.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we go and plan for things \Rfree-agent signings and
$41.5 million in signing bonus paid out for this season\S, we can't
operate this way,'' Jones said. ``We have to give ourselves a
better shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be able to come up here and get a win when the
situation calls for it. I'm disappointed. Everybody's disappointed.
We had higher expectations than this. We had much higher
expectations this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much higher expectations,'' he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith summed up the Cowboys' season this way: ``Mediocre,
up and down, nothing consistent \Rwhile\S consistently bad at times
... signs of brilliance, signs of being a very good ball club, but
also a team that couldn't put it all together.''
</P>
<P>
   Deion Sanders simply said, ``We underachieved.''
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman provided a one-word answer when asked if the
Cowboys' talent level weighed against how the team finished
disappointed him. ``Yes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Jones chose to exonerate the players, he didn't once
endorse Gailey with any of his postgame remarks.
</P>
<P>
   As owner and general manager, Jones placed all accountability
``squarely right here. It's right on my shoulders. This is where
the buck stops,'' adding, ``We fell short of the mark. I don't
blame any individual player at all. They have worked. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, they also turned the ball over four times.
</P>
<P>
   The turnovers included three fumbles (Robert Thomas, Jason
Tucker and Deion Sanders) and an interception (Troy Aikman). That's
two young free-agent players, two high-priced veterans, four
players.
</P>
<P>
   When Gailey talked about ``spreading the wealth'' in his
offensive system, he obviously didn't have this in mind.
</P>
<P>
   During the regular season, the Vikings led the NFL in turnovers
with 40. They were turnover-free yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys came in with 10 more takeaways than turnovers. Their
first two giveaways (Sanders' fumble on a punt return, Thomas'
fumble after a catch) led to the Vikings' first 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   Smith gained 65 of his 99 yards rushing on one first-possession
run to the Minnesota 3. The Cowboys had to settle for a chip-shot
field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was big,'' Smith said of the Cowboys' inability to score
a touchdown. ``I think it would've set a nice little tone.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Smith tripped ... and so did the Cowboys. Their
goal-line running game sputtered, and Aikman sailed an errant pass
over the head of David LaFleur, who was wide open in the end zone.
And all the Cowboys could get out of a 65-yard run to the 3 was ...
an 18-yard Eddie Murray field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's 5-yard touchdown run later in the first quarter gave the
Cowboys a 10-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then the game changed.
</P>
<P>
   The ``other'' Smith _ Minnesota's Robert _ took a screen pass
from Jeff George on third-and-25 and turned it into a 26-yard
touchdown play. Safety George Teague missed an open-field tackle on
the play.
</P>
<P>
   Then a 14-yard draw by Robert Smith on third-and-12 set up a
58-yard touchdown pass from George to Moss, who split double
coverage and even drew a pass-interference penalty from Kevin
Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That draw was probably the biggest play of the game,'' Cowboys
defensive coordinator Dave Campo said. ``We just got out of a gap,
and they made a play.''
</P>
<P>
   Campo went into the game with a plan to make sure that Moss and
Cris Carter wouldn't beat them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the approach we took,'' said Campo. ``Under different
circumstances, that would've been a good plan. Obviously, some
other factors are involved. You can't turn the ball over four times
and win.''
</P>
<P>
   Mental mistakes. Self-destruction. Underachievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never would've dreamed that we be as inconsistent as we were
this season,'' Emmitt Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   And now there's plenty of time for the Cowboys to do just that:
dream. nn

RIGHT ANGLE: SIDEWAYS THINKING DOES THE TRICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thaddeus Steele was a man who could think sideways. In fact, he
invented the art.
</P>
<P>
   He was my wife's grandfather, and he was never completely
socialized. He kept rattlesnakes under the house. He fished and
hunted for a living, and although he sometimes held a job, if he
thought the fish were biting, he left the job site for the fishing
pond without a single wince of conscience.
</P>
<P>
   He also believed that traffic signs and stoplights were there to
``instruct those who didn't know how to drive.'' Because he knew
what he was doing, he ignored them.
</P>
<P>
   But it is for his inventive method of problem solving that I
remember him here. Thad Steele never met a problem he couldn't
solve, and in a way no one else might have thought of.
</P>
<P>
   When the corner post of his back porch cracked, and the porch
roof sagged on one side, he lassoed a nearby sapling and pulled it
down under the porch eave, using the natural springiness of the
tree to keep the roof from falling.
</P>
<P>
   STILL THAT WAY &QL; 
``It was still that way the last time I saw it,'' my wife says.
</P>
<P>
   Once, when a neighbor used a shortcut across his lawn,
eventually wearing a path in the grass, Thad Steele knew how to
stop her. He never would have confronted her directly; that wasn't
his style.
</P>
<P>
   No, he dug a person-size hole hip deep in the center of the
path, mixed up a load of pudding-quality mud to fill it in, used
carpet tacks to secure a cloth across the hole and sprinkled it
with dirt and grass to camouflage the hole.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the woman stepped into the hole up to her waist in
brown goo. She stopped shortcutting across his yard.
</P>
<P>
   I especially like the touch of the carpet tacks.
</P>
<P>
   There are many examples of Thad Steele's peculiar approach to
life.
</P>
<P>
   SHOOTING SCARE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His friend Hub Hawkins had a stutter. Thad had said many times
that ``if Hub were frightened enough, he'd talk as plain as the
next man.'' One day, while Thad and Hub's cousin Dewey were sitting
on the front porch, they saw Hub walking toward them on the
railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Thad leveled the pistol he always carried _ as all real men in
Madison, N.C., did in those days _ and fired several times at Hub's
feet, making him dance. Hub yelled back, ``D-D-Dod d-damn you,
D-Dad D-D-Deele!''
</P>
<P>
   That was one solution that didn't take.
</P>
<P>
   But sideways thinking often did work. Thad Steele kept five blue
Dodges in his backyard so he always had parts for the blue Dodge he
drove.
</P>
<P>
   When his wife and her sister argued violently over who owned a
beautiful pitcher and bowl that had belonged to their mother, Thad
Steele took the crockery down to the creek and broke them on the
rocks. It stopped the squabble.
</P>
<P>
   STRAIGHT TO REALITY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He pierced straight through to the reality, to the heart of
the matter,'' my wife says. ``He was not about social acceptance.
He thought it silly.''
</P>
<P>
   She remembers once, when she was about five years old, her
grandfather was asked to baby-sit her. For Thad Steele,
baby-sitting meant the child adapting to him, not the other way
around.
</P>
<P>
   And so, because he had intended to go hunting that day, the
child went hunting with him.
</P>
<P>
   He had seen a bunch of flying squirrels in the woods near the
house, and so the three of them _ Thad Steele, his gun and the
five-year-old girl _ went out shooting.
</P>
<P>
   After he had shot three of them, he wrapped them in a blanket
and handed them to the child, telling her, ``Take care of them like
babies.''
</P>
<P>
   There are perhaps more appropriate ways to deal with a child,
but the old man knew who he was dealing with.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have said, `Watch these while I go down the path
looking for more,' but he didn't. He turned them into baby dolls
for me. He understood me and made me feel like a million dollars. I
was their mother because of what he said to me.''
</P>
<P>
   My wife has learned her lessons from Thad Steele well. She is
also a master of sideways thinking.
</P>
<P>
   When she was young and poor, recently divorced, she couldn't
afford her automobile inspection, so she painted the inspection
sticker on the windshield of the car and used it for the full year.
</P>
<P>
   As an adult and an art teacher in Arizona, she was given an art
room with carpet _ not the best kind of floor for a room full of
second-graders with jars of tempera paint. And when the inevitable
spill happened and she couldn't scrub out the stain, she realized:
``I'm an art teacher; I can mix that color.''
</P>
<P>
   So she matched the color of the original carpet and painted over
the stain.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, in another school, after a month of working with
clay, the dried gray powder was ground into the tile floor. When
she asked the janitor to mop the floor to prevent the clouds of
dust from clay choking the kids, the janitor replied ``mopping is
not in my job description,'' and ignored her.
</P>
<P>
   So, as a master of sideways thinking, she and the kids filled up
a dozen or so 10-gallon buckets with tap water and then, in one
grand cascade, poured it all out onto the floor. She sent one of
the kids to the janitor with the message: ``Help! The room's
flooded!'' And the janitor came and mopped up the mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``The floor was the cleanest it had ever been,'' she notes.
</P>
<P>
   Sideways thinking helps get things done when ordinary thinking
is stymied.
</P>
<P>
   From the evidence of our family, sideways thinking skips
generations, like some genetic traits. My wife's grandfather had it
in spades, but her father did not. He was a thoroughly socialized
man, well-thought of in the community.
</P>
<P>
   My wife got the gene, but her daughter didn't. She is a reporter
on a newspaper in the South, and she has all the people skills
necessary for the job. But although she is very smart, her
intelligence travels in a straight line, not crabwise.
</P>
<P>
   But that daughter is now pregnant, and if the pattern holds
true, the twins she is carrying will turn out to think sideways,
like their grandmother and great-great grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   My wife looks forward to subverting them, showing them the
secrets of sideways life, hoping to explore a world free from
social and cultural expectations.
</P>
<P>
   And she looks forward to baby-sitting them, just like her
grandad baby-sat her.

COMEDY OF ERRORS TYPIFIED COWBOYS SEASON: IT WAS A JOKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ You'd heard it a thousand times lately, from a
wide variety of Cowboy voices.
</P>
<P>
   Just get to the playoffs. Anything can happen.
</P>
<P>
   So welcome to the playoffs, where sure enough, ``anything'' did
happen here yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Anything you ever wanted to know about the total disaster that
was the Cowboys' 1999 season was on playoff-time display at the
Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   In capsule form harking back to October, this was a disorganized
mess of embarrassing futility. In other words, you'd seen it all
before.
</P>
<P>
   In an act of mercy, the Cowboys' season was finally put to rest
yesterday. But as an organization, the questions about 2000 and
beyond have only just begun.
</P>
<P>
   Is Chan Gailey fired? Hearing Jerry Jones talk after this one,
the answer seemed to be yes. And if the general manager wasn't
named Jerry Jones, there's no way he'd keep his job. Plus, player
personnel evaluations will now be extensive, starting with the
high-dollar Nine-Toed Deion at cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   There was a concern after the Cowboys crawled into the playoffs
last week that Jones would sugarcoat how bad the '99 season really
was. But he won't. He can't. Not based on yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys losing by 27-10 to a ripe-to-be-beaten Vikings'
outfit wasn't exactly an NFL news flash. And it also isn't a scoop
that the Cowboys, as the 8-8 record said, came in here void of
postseason credentials.
</P>
<P>
   But this train wreck?
</P>
<P>
   There was so much early sideline confusion that all three
first-half timeouts were burned nine minutes into the game. Twice
it was a communication breakdown on what play was called. The third
was due to a substitution after an injury. Whatever the excuses, it
gave the appearance of uncertainty and of being unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve men on the field for a punt added to the look of
disorganization.
</P>
<P>
   And none of this with the timeouts and extra man on the punt
involved the actual playing of the game, which basically amounted
to a mountain of Cowboys' offensive frustrations. Again, this is
the same ol', same ol'...
</P>
<P>
   It was a given that 30 points would be needed by the offense to
win this one. Slippage by the Cowboys' defense over the past three
weeks left little hope the Vikings' high-octane offense could be
contained.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys would give up the run, and did with Robert Smith
busting loose for 140 yards rushing, in exchange for containing
receivers Randy Moss and Cris Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Moss singlehandedly trashed that plan, and trashed the strategy
of not having Nine-Toed Deion constantly shadow Moss, who had five
catches, 127 yards and possibly the game-breaking touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Still this was a winnable game _ the Cowboys had that many
touchdown opportunities against a weak Vikings' defense.
</P>
<P>
   But costly fumbles by Deion on a punt return and fullback Robert
Thomas after gaining a first down led to the first 10 Vikings'
points. And also led to the Cowboys' defense being under constant
siege.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota, as expected, loaded up to stop Emmitt Smith, and did
except for two plays, which left the game in the hands of Troy
Aikman and his receivers. Those were not good hands.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cowboys still had a chance in the fourth quarter, Jason
Tucker fumbled inside the 5, and the ball went through the end
zone, resulting in a turnover on the touchback.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Warren, a veteran who played terribly, had a costly
second-quarter drop. So did receiver Chris Brazzell. Both killed
potential drives for points.
</P>
<P>
   But Aikman was quick to praise the Tuckers and the Brazzells.
``At times, we weren't on the same page, but they really hung in
there, and under the circumstances, responded well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Gailey wanted to wait until today to give his
evaluation of the season. Aikman said basically the same thing
with, ``I would prefer to wait until a less emotional time to
answer that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, meanwhile, was talking about the obvious. ``Those answers
will have to come from me,'' he said. ``The buck stops here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, of course, is going nowhere, kind of like the Cowboys'
offense of 1999. Aikman, barring a total surprise, is also
returning.
</P>
<P>
   In an offensive disaster, the quarterback takes the blame, as
does the general manager, as does the head coach. Under Gailey, the
Cowboys have scored 17 postseason points in two years. Somebody has
to take the fall for all this, so guess who?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a team this season that just could never put it all
together,'' said Emmitt Smith, who gave the Cowboys an immediate
boost with a 65-yard, first quarter run to the Vikings' 3-yard
line.
</P>
<P>
   Stop me if you've heard this before: From there, there would be
no touchdown. Only a field goal. How many times and how many ways
have these Cowboys failed to cash in those spots?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's true: Anything can happen in the playoffs. But for
the Cowboys yesterday, the same things happened. Things that
brought a bad season to a close. nn

``NAT KING COLE'' &QL; 
By Daniel Mark Epstein (FSG, $27) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `The kid was wearing a light green gabardine suit that draped
his long, slender frame so loosely it looked like the first
high-note blast of a trumpet might blow his coat off.'' Nat Cole
was 16 then, shy but bold enough to know how good he was. It's this
image of the young Cole in 1935, about to go up against Earl Hines
in the ``Battle of Rhythm'' in Chicago's Savoy Ballroom that begins
Epstein's biography. Cole died of cancer when he was 45, yet his
story is rich enough for several lives. There were his formative
years in Chicago as what Epstein calls ``a kitten on the keys.''
There were his marriages and infidelities, bad business decisions,
and troubles with the IRS. There was the racial tension that
buffeted his career (in 1956, he was attacked onstage by White
assailants during a performance in Birmingham, Ala.). And there
were Cole's affability and pragmatism, which helped him skirt
racial politics, court a White audience, and make an amazing
crossover from jazz to popular (and frequently schlocky) music.
Epstein creates an engaging portrait of this romantic figure in
American music. &QL;

   ``IN THE GLOAMING'' &QL; 
By Alice Elliott Dark (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $23) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In ``Triage,'' a mother and her adult daughter pursue an uneasy
truce as they jockey for position in each other's lives. In ``The
Tower,'' an aging bachelor falls for a young woman whose background
hints at a very unpleasant surprise. In ``Dreadful Language,'' a
woman moves through youthful rebellion to true love and on to
sorrow and resignation. But the big draw in this story collection
is the title piece, which was published in ``The New Yorker'' in
1994, made into a HBO film starring Glenn Close, and chosen by John
Updike for ``The Best American Short Stories of the Century.'' ``In
the Gloaming'' is a story about conversations _ they take place
always at twilight, the time called ``the gloaming'' _ between a
woman and her 33-year-old son, who is dying of AIDS. With austere
precision, Dark charts the mother's heart as she comes to know both
her son and herself and as she begins to understand that these
daily talks are her dying child's way of returning her love to her.
It's a wonderful story _ moving, understated and as true as the
emotional secrets it unveils.

   ``At 4 a.m. every morning for a week, three adults and two
children were sprayed silver and gold from head to toe and driven
from the hotel to the location to await a glorious sunrise that
never happened,'' write Thorgerson and Powell. It rained, it was
cold, it was boring, and after the makeup ran out, they had to use
car paint, which they removed with turpentine. In the end, the
adult models were dumped (they used just the naked children, a
brother and sister who had already appeared nude in a Japanese
version of ``Alice in Wonderland'') and the sunrise was faked, but
the album cover for Led Zeppelin's ``Houses of the Holy'' is
memorable enough to appear here, a full 26 years later. Also
included are the stories behind the covers for Santana's

``FLU'' &QL; 
By Gina Kolata (FSG, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The flu of 1918 came in two waves. The first showed up in the
spring, bringing its victims chills and fevers but rarely lasting
more than three days. It was, Kolata writes, ``banal, and easily
forgotten.'' In September, however, it came back with a vengeance,
and this time it was a killer that altered countless lives.
Children were orphaned, families were destroyed. Thousands of
people die horribly. More than 25 percent of the United States
population became ill, and between 20 million and 100 million
people died worldwide. If a similar plague were to strike today, it
would kill more people in a single year than heart disease,
cancers, strokes, pulmonary disease, AIDS and Alzheimer's disease
combined. But is this possible? Are authorities prepared to fight
the outbreak of another virus with such mysterious and deadly
power? Kolata, a science writer for the ``New York Times,'' looks
at the history of the 1918 flu and at the lessons it offers for
averting a similar disaster today. It's fascinating but sobering
reading _ if you feel a chill coming on, save it for another day.  &QL;

SURFSIDE WINS AT SANTA ANITA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Not shy about comparing star fillies of
different generations, D. Wayne Lukas says Surfside is a better
candidate to handle the rigors of the Kentucky Derby than Winning
Colors was in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   And that's saying a lot, because Winning Colors won the Derby in
1988, the most recent of the race's three female champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surfside has already shown dimensions that Winning Colors did
not have,'' their Hall of Fame trainer said after Surfside and
jockey Pat Day ran away with the $102,704 Santa Ysabel Stakes at
Santa Anita on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This filly can lay last (early in a race), be second, be third
or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning Colors was a committed front-runner, and took advantage
of a paceless field to beat colts in the 1-mile Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of her style and pedigree, Surfside looks more like a
1-mile horse or even a 1-mile horse than Winning Colors was,''
Lukas said.
</P>
<P>
   William T. Young's Surfside, blessed with a
championship-quality, Seattle Slew-Flanders pedigree, won for the
fifth time in seven starts, crushing three other 3-year-old fillies
by eight lengths at 1-5 odds. Rings a Chime ran down She's Classy
for second in the 1 1/16-mile race.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas brought the nation's leading 3-year-old filly back quickly
after the seven-length victory in the Dec. 19 Hollywood Starlet,
believing this would be easier than using workouts to prepare for
the Feb. 12 Las Virgenes. He's hoping she'll keep winning through
the March 12 Santa Anita Oaks, so he can try her against males in
the April 8 Santa Anita Derby and the May 6 Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thinking grandioso ideas,'' admitted Lukas, who has run
four fillies in the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert setback: Bob Baffert, the nation's leading trainer, has
lost one of his major clients, the husband-and-wife owner
partnership of Aaron and Marie Jones of Eugene, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   The Jones have moved four active horses, including 1999 Santa
Anita Derby runner-up Prime Timber and Del Mar Futurity winner
Forest Camp, and nine as-yet-unraced 2-year-olds to trainer Eduardo
Inda.

SANDERS UNSURE OF FUTURE WITH COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If this was the last game in a Cowboys uniform for cornerback
Deion Sanders, then he went out in style, literally.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, whose contract will be voided in June, making him a
free agent, walked out of the Metrodome with a top hat and a
floor-length black mink coat.
</P>
<P>
   Before boarding the Cowboys' bus, Sanders gave an assessment of
the most frustrating season of his career. He missed the first two
games because of a toe injury. He was hampered in several other
games with hamstring and groin strains.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, his stellar reputation took a slight hit because
teams were able to make plays against him for the first time in
five years with the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who fumbled a punt return, deflected pass and allowed
two completions to Vikings receiver Randy Moss yesterday,
acknowledged that he was not up to his usual standards in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give myself a `B,' '' Sanders said. ``An `A' is my usual
standard. I played as good other cornerbacks, but people expect
excellence. I expect that from me as well, even though I had to
overcome a lot with my injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding his future with the Cowboys, Sanders said he is going
to pray about it. His contract will be voided because the $12.7
million cap figure for next season is too high.
</P>
<P>
   When he signed the five-year, $52.5-million deal last spring,
Sanders and the Cowboys did it with the understanding that they
would renegotiate it this year. Money is going to be the sticking
point, as Sanders is not looking to get less than the $8 million
per year he has averaged the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   However, the question is whether giving Sanders that much money
is best for the Cowboys, both football-wise and financially
considering their failures in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has the same issues. He said winning Super Bowls is all
he has left to play for and wants to be with a team capable of
contending for a title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to come back,'' Sanders said. ``But there are
things that need to be addressed.'' nn

VIKINGS SMOTHER EMMITT SMITH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Foge Fazio
gambled and won yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Join the crowd. It became real easy to beat the odds against the
punchless Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings stacked eight and sometimes nine defenders close to
the line of scrimmage to stop Emmitt Smith's running, daring the
Cowboys to consistently make big plays with their passing game. As
was the case all season, the Cowboys couldn't, and didn't in their
27-10 wild-card loss at the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want Emmitt to beat us,'' said Fazio, whose unit
forced four turnovers and held the Cowboys scoreless the final 50
minutes. ``Our fear was that their big offensive line would start
pounding on us and wear us down. We'd rather have them passing
against us, and it worked out okay.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings' defense, ranked 27th in the regular season, started
out shaky. Despite the focus on Smith, he bolted 65 yards through
the left side to the Minnesota 3-yard line on the game's third
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little in shock,'' said Fazio, noting that Smith ran
for 140 yards in the first half of the teams' Nov. 8 game before
leaving with a broken right hand. ``We were on our heels, no doubt.
But we made three big plays after that to keep them out of the end
zone. That was huge for our confidence and, really, our plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Smith runs left the Cowboys at the 1-yard line before an
incomplete pass on third down forced the Cowboys to settle for a
field goal. It was the story of the game, and the Cowboys' season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys drove inside the Vikings' 40 six times but scored
only twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sort of dared them to throw every play,'' said safety
Robert Griffith, who made seven tackles and intercepted a Troy
Aikman pass in the end zone late in the game. ``Our deal was to
take away Emmitt. If we got them in second- and third-and-long, we
didn't think they could hurt us on a regular basis.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy couldn't have worked better. Emmitt Smith was not a
factor after his early burst. He gained 72 yards in the first
quarter, but only 27 afterward. Other than his 65-yard dash, he
carried 14 times for 34 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to attack Emmitt, not let him dictate us,'' Vikings
coach Dennis Green said. ``If you take him away, you kind of cut
off their offense's head.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite playing against a secondary with a rookie (Kenny
Wright), an undrafted second-year player (Anthony Bass) and a
converted receiver (Robert Tate), the Cowboys' last two drives
covered 64 and 74 yards only to end in end-zone turnovers. nn

DONOVAN ADDS SOME BITE TO FLORIDA'S BASKETBALL PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ A high-scoring, take-no-prisoners offensive
philosophy. A brash, sometimes cocky young coach who has some of
his peers, um, perturbed.
</P>
<P>
   Check the dateline. Yes, it's football country. But this is
about basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Donovan, who worked himself into a Final Four-worthy
player at Providence, has undertaken a similar construction job
with Florida men's basketball. In his fourth season, Donovan, 34,
has turned the Gators into a team with bite. After Florida made a
strong run in last season's NCAA Tournament, it entered this season
as a Top 10 team and a trendy Final Four pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sky's the limit for us as long as we stay humble but
hungry,'' said Florida's Udonis Haslem, a sophomore who is one of
several young and talented players on the Gators roster. ``Last
year, our goal was just to get in the tournament. We achieved that.
This year, our goal is to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gators are No. 6, with a 12-2 record built mostly against a
soft non-conference schedule. The Southeastern Conference schedule
will show whether or not Florida has the toughness and seasoning
necessary to be an elite team capable of reaching the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Under Donovan, the Gators love to run-and-gun, press and shoot
the 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   They resemble college teams coached by Donovan's mentor, Rick
Pitino. Florida's propensity for offense and Donovan's rattling the
cages of some coaching competitors also provides a neat parallel
with Florida football coach Steve Spurrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the success the football team has had, people would
say that this is totally a football school,'' said Donovan, whose
first team averaged 74 points a game and whose current squad is
third nationally in scoring at 89.4 per game. ``We've been able to
prove that Florida is a total overall athletics program. Most of
the athletic programs here were nationally ranked when I arrived,
except the men's basketball program.''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan, a fast talker from Long Island, had no qualms of trying
to build a successful basketball program at a school that prides
itself as a Southern football power.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've tried to do is embrace the success that football has
had here,'' Donovan said. ``I've always respected the way Steve
Spurrier coaches and the way his teams play. He might be the most
misunderstood coach in the country. He talks or speaks his mind
freely and people think because of that, he's arrogant or cocky. I
respect that he tells it like it is and shoots it straight. He's a
man's man with the way he coaches and way he acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida basketball is not exactly a wasteland. In the 1980s,
former North Carolina State coach Norm Sloan won 138 games and
played in three NCAA Tournaments. Lon Kruger spent six years here,
leading the Gators to a surprise Final Four trip in 1994. However,
two years after that, Kruger bolted for Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic director Jeremy Foley wanted someone who could emulate
Spurrier and build Florida basketball into a national power. It
wasn't long into his first interview with Donovan _ just off his
second year as a head coach at Marshall _ that Foley decided he had
his man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for the right guy, the guy who could change the
basketball culture here,'' Foley said. ``Some thought his age was a
risk, but there's something about him that gives you a comfortable
feeling right away. I really liked his work ethic and his
dedication. I really felt that he'd fit right in.''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan's first exposure to the national scene came in 1987.
Playing for Pitino at Providence, Donovan helped the Friars make a
surprise run to the Final Four. In the process, Donovan transformed
himself from a doughboy bench warmer into an honorable mention
All-American.
</P>
<P>
   That drive to succeed and improve remains in place. Donovan's
days start between 5 and 6 a.m. with a 5-mile run. He tries to get
six hours of sleep each night but rarely accomplishes that goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings it every day, 100 percent intensity,'' sophomore
guard Teddy Dupay said. ``There are players and coaches who some
days you can tell they just don't want to be there. Not him. It's
all out, every practice. I can see him being that way as a player,
full throttle all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan sweats every possession, every dribble, pass and
double-team. He looks young enough to still be playing. With his
widow's peak hair slicked back, he resembles actor Brad Davis.
Opposing fans prefer an Eddie Munster comparison. As a player,
Donovan was a gym rat. Some opposing coaches whisper that he has
become a coaching rat.
</P>
<P>
   Successful basketball programs need players. To move the Gators
up in class, Donovan knew he needed players who could compete and
compare to the ones at Kentucky, North Carolina, Kansas, Duke, etc.
His first recruiting coup was Dupay, a high-scoring guard from Cape
Coral, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Dupay said that Donovan ``overtook'' him during the recruiting
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I talked to him, I was ready to sign,'' said
Dupay, a sophomore who also considered Duke, Georgia Tech, Seton
Hall and North Carolina State. ``Without him, I wouldn't have come
here.''
</P>
<P>
   With Dupay in the fold, Donovan went national. He targeted Mike
Miller from South Dakota. Miller made his recruiting visit to
Gainesville during the weekend of the 1997 Tennessee-Florida
football game. A few hours before kickoff, Donovan knocked on
Spurrier's office door. The Gators' football coach spent about 10
minutes schmoozing a recruit for the Gators' basketball coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I knew I wanted to come here, but meeting with
Spurrier kind of sealed the deal,'' said Miller, a versatile
6-foot-9 forward who leads the team in scoring.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two seasons, Florida has had one of the nation's
top recruiting classes. Miller's signing miffed Kansas coach Roy
Williams, who asked the NCAA to look into Miller's recruitment. The
NCAA found nothing. Eighteen months ago at an SEC media gathering,
South Carolina coach Eddie Fogler took a verbal shot at Donovan and
earned a reprimand from the league office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach D is outworking 'em. I think they're getting jealous,''
Miller said of the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan, whose freshman class this season includes forwards
Donnell Harvey and Matt Bonner, plus guard Brett Nelson, remains
diplomatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be a pecking order. You had your top 10 programs
and they hand-picked your recruits,'' he said. ``I think it's
changed. Those programs were getting the best players in the
country. We've got to recruit those types of players. It was like,
`You're Florida, you're wasting your time.' Then, it was like,
`You're annoying us.' I've just sold Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because we've had some success in recruiting and just
because we went to the NCAA tournament last year doesn't mean
anything as far as today is concerned or down the road. We've still
got to go out there and prove ourselves. But we've got to keep the
mentality that we're hungry and haven't proven anything.'' nn

MUSIC CITY MIRACLE EARNS SPOT AMONG NFL'S GREAT MOMENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMSX 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are no miracles in playbooks. Divine intervention just
happens.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Titans have this special-teams play called ``Home
Run, Throw Back.'' Titans assistant Alan Lowry had drawn it up and
filed it away _ break glass in case of emergency _ after seeing SMU
use it to defeat Texas Tech in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Every Saturday during the regular season, the Titans practiced
it once _ as an afterthought. They never expected to use it, and
they never expected it to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a 100-to-1 shot,'' Titans linebacker Joe Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   As the play is designed, tight end Frank Wycheck is supposed to
catch the ball, run right and toss a lateral to receiver Isaac
Byrd. Receiver Derrick Mason then trails Byrd downfield as a
lateral option.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Titans put out the 9-1-1 call with 16 seconds
remaining Saturday, Mason had been knocked groggy. And Mason's
backup, safety Anthony Dorsett, had cramps. So Lowry quickly
explained the play to Kevin Dyson, who had never practiced it.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans had expected Buffalo kicker Steve Christie to squib
the ball along the ground, so Wycheck was lined up in the middle of
the field. Instead, Christie popped up the kick to fullback Lorenzo
Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Neal handed the ball to Wycheck, who ran right and threw back to
his left to Dyson, not Byrd who was not in position. Dyson sprinted
75 yards down the Titans' sideline to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   It was close whether Wycheck's lateral to Dyson was forward,
which would have made the play illegal. It was reviewed by referee
Phil Luckett, who upheld the on-field ruling of a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Music City Miracle is sure to spark arguments around the
water cooler today just as the Immaculate Reception did in 1972.
The Oakland Raiders still contend that Franco Harris' 60-yard
ricochet touchdown catch came on an illegal touch.
</P>
<P>
   The play also is sure to revive memories of other playoff
miracles. Here is one opinion on the five most memorable
game-winning plays in postseason history:
</P>
<P>
   1. The Immaculate Reception: Terry Bradshaw was throwing to
Frenchy Fuqua when the ball bounced off Oakland's Jack Tatum.
Harris caught the ball off his shoelaces and raced 42 yards to
complete the 60-yard touchdown and a 13-7 victory for the Steelers
in a 1972 divisional playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   2. The Music City Miracle: Wycheck and Dyson have earned their
place in history.
</P>
<P>
   3. The Catch: Flushed out of the pocket, 49ers quarterback Joe
Montana was trying to throw the ball out of the back of the end
zone. Instead, Dwight Clark leaped high to nab a 6-yard touchdown
and a 28-27 victory against the Cowboys in the NFC Championship
Game on Jan. 10, 1982.
</P>
<P>
   4. The Hail Mary: Roger Staubach completed a 50-yard touchdown
pass to Drew Pearson with 24 seconds left as the Cowboys defeated
the Vikings, 17-14, in a 1975 divisional playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   5. The Falling Stabler: In the only miraculous play without a
nickname, Ken Stabler was almost sacked from behind when he tossed
a pass to Clarence Davis, who was triple-teamed. Davis' 8-yard
touchdown with 26 seconds left gave the Raiders a 28-26 victory
against Miami in a 1974 divisional playoff game. nn

TEXAS' TRIP EAST FITS GRAND PLAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ The timing might not be exactly right for
Texas' game here tonight against defending national champion
Connecticut, but it's all a part of the master plan of Longhorns'
coach Rick Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the timing good? Probably not,'' Barnes said. ``But it's a
nationally televised game \R8 p.m., ESPN\S and something I felt we
needed to do because of where we are with our program. For us to be
the kind of team and program that we want to be, we've got to go
play the best.''
</P>
<P>
   No one can question Barnes' desire to play top-notch competition
as he builds his program toward an expressed desire to win a
national championship. Texas (9-3) is 2-1 in games against Top 25
teams this season. The Longhorns have defeated Michigan State and
DePaul and lost by seven to Arizona. They have also lost road games
at Utah and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   But to play the Huskies (11-2) tonight, Texas must break the
concentration of focusing on Big 12 wars. The Longhorns defeated
Baylor Thursday in their Big 12 opener and play at Texas A&AMP;M on
Wednesday. But the desire to play Connecticut overshadowed the
less-than-ideal January road trip to the East.
</P>
<P>
   Texas and Connecticut attempted to work out a date in November
or December, but previously scheduled games and arena availability
left Texas in a take-it-or-leave-it position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're really concentrating on starting the
conference season,'' center Chris Mihm of Texas said. ``But anytime
you get a chance to play a game like this against the defending
national champion in a Big Monday game, it's an exciting time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great chance to see how we stack up against the rest of
the nation again. We're really looking forward to it. And we'll be
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said he would be disappointed if the Longhorns weren't
approaching tonight's tipoff in the Hartford Civic Center with
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you get a chance like this, it's something you've got
to want to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Second-ranked Connecticut bounced back Saturday from last week's
shocking loss against Notre Dame at the Civic Center. The Huskies
recorded their 12th consecutive Big East road victory with a 73-51
triumph at Pittsburgh. The Huskies are deep and talented with
players such as forward Kevin Freeman and guards Khalid El-Amin and
Albert Mourning, whose 22 points led the victory at Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   The exposure will not be anything new for Mihm, Gabe Muoneke and
Ivan Wagner _ the veterans from last season's Big 12 regular-season
championship team. But Barnes is working this season with a lineup
that has expanded to a 10-player rotation. Five of those players
have never played a Big 12 road game and for that reason, Barnes
said this game might fit better into the season's scheme of things
than at first glance.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this \Rnonconference scheduling\S was done with one thing
in mind,'' Barnes said. ``And that's to go on the road to places
where it's as hard as it can be to win because of the tough places
we have to play on the road \Rin the Big 12\S. It will be
interesting to see how we handle this situation. We have a brutal
schedule. But it's going to help us.''

MULLER A BARGAIN FOR STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ In his first nine games since being signed as a
free agent, Stars forward Kirk Muller has averaged 18 minutes and
16 seconds per game.
</P>
<P>
   If he plays in the Stars' remaining 40 games, he'd finish with
around 890 minutes played.
</P>
<P>
   What's the point?
</P>
<P>
   Considering Muller will make $190,000 this season for about $212
a minute, Stars owner Tom Hicks got himself quite a bargain for a
player who was brought in to provide depth and instead has logged
significant time on the first line, second line and power play
because of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still thought I could play, and it would've bothered me if I
hadn't given it another try,'' Muller said. ``So, I said to my
agent, `when you talk to teams, I don't want you to kill any deal
because of the money thing. I just want to play somewhere, and then
it's up to me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Stars general manager Bob Gainey gave Muller a chance to play
somewhere because the Stars needed depth.
</P>
<P>
   Stars injuries gave him a chance to play a big role.
</P>
<P>
   The rest, just like he said, was up to him. He has cashed in on
his chance in every way but cash.
</P>
<P>
   Muller has managed to make an impact in his minutes. He has four
assists and a pair of goals, including a game winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the day he's come in here, he's had to play the role of
a top six forward,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``We didn't
anticipate that when we brought him in at all, but that's the way
it's gone. He's done a real good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knew?
</P>
<P>
   Muller, 33, became a free agent in the summer, and 29 general
managers had his number. Only his phone was about as busy as a Y2K
consultant on Jan. 2. So, Muller had his agent call general
managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still nothing,'' Muller said. ``I told my agent be honest with
me, tell me what they're saying. Well, the feedback we were getting
was that I had lost a step.''
</P>
<P>
   The proof, one general manager after another would point to,
could be found in Muller's past two seasons in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The one-time consistent 30-goal scorer had eight goals in
1997-98 and four goals in 1998-99. The player who had seven
consecutive 70-plus point seasons had 44 points in his the past two
seasons combined.
</P>
<P>
   Muller, they declared, was done.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he was getting six minutes a game, if that, with
Florida didn't seem to matter. The fact that he didn't have a
defined role didn't matter. The fact that he didn't think he was
done definitely didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truthfully, I didn't even know where I stood anymore,'' Muller
said. ``I just knew I could play.''
</P>
<P>
   There were a couple of Stars who thought so, too. Guy
Carbonneau, Mike Keane and Brian Skrudland remembered the player he
had been in Montreal. They had played with him. They had won with
him. And they knew he wasn't the player he looked to be in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard things about him last year that I don't remember,''
Carbonneau said. ``I think the guy you've seen is the guy I
remember from Montreal.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what Muller said. He feels like that player
again.
</P>
<P>
   The role, a combination of scorer and checker, is familiar. The
minutes, big and getting bigger, were nothing he hadn't logged
before. The confidence, lacking in Florida, is back, put there by
every role he's been thrown into and subsequently succeeded in.
</P>
<P>
   In Muller's first game after signing, he played on the first
line with Brett Hull and Mike Modano. He scored the game-winning
goal. When Jere Lehtinen returned and Joe Nieuwendyk didn't, he
bumped down to play wing on the second line with Roman Lyashenko
and Jamie Langenbrunner. Then, he centered the second line with
Langenbrunner and Brenden Morrow and so on and so on ...
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk could be back in the lineup as early as tomorrow
against Edmonton. So what does that do to Muller?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a whole bunch of options here,'' Hitchcock said. ``Do
we want to put the Nieuwendyk line back together or move it around
a bit? I'm not sure we're there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Muller, for his part, doesn't care.
</P>
<P>
   First line, second line, third line, fourth line. Wherever they
need him, he's happy to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously tough this year with all the injuries,'' Muller
said. ``You look around and there is a lot of banged-up guys. So,
if I can carry my load right now and play and give guys a little
extra time to heal I think we all benefit in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, everybody except for Hicks. He's likely to find the price
for minute to be slightly steeper next season.

COMPELLING FIRST LINES DRAW READERS INTO WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LELA STROMENGER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; EDITORS: THERE IS A LIST OF EXAMPLE BELOW STORY ON THIS TAKE:
 &UR; ``Begin at the beginning,'' Alice was advised in Wonderland, ``and
go on till you come to the end: then stop.'' If only it were that
easy in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Writers have been struggling since Homer to find the art of
opening a story. There is pretty general agreement on which ones
have succeeded best. What true reader hasn't thrilled, at some age,
to the passage that begins, ``It was the best of times, it was the
worst of times''? Dickens' ``Tale of Two Cities'' is among the
classic examples.
</P>
<P>
   The question, then, is not so much which, but why.
</P>
<P>
   People who know books have their own answers and, of course,
their own favorites. Anne Stephenson, who writes the New &AMP; Notable
books column for ``The Arizona Republic,'' said she was hooked
immediately by the ``jazzy'' voice of Vladimir Nabokov's Humbert
Humbert: ``Lolita, light of my life,'' and so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lolita,'' indeed, puts the reader right into the grip of its
extraordinary narrator, who, Stephenson said, `` &UR; commands the
reader to look at his obsession.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps there's a clue there.
</P>
<P>
   It is interesting that most of the people polled for this
article named a work spoken in the first person. That directness
seems to grab readers.
</P>
<P>
   A skilled writer can bait the same hook twice, introducing the
character and establishing the mood simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Peters, owner of the Scottsdale bookshop the Poisoned
Pen, cited, among others, Daphne du Maurier's ``Rebecca'': ``Last
night I dreamt I went to Manderly again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a book as a conversation between the author and the
reader,'' Peters said. ``Based on the opening, the reader decides
if he is interested in pursuing the conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   People buy books on the strength of the beginning paragraphs,
she said, and in a competitive field, a ``crackerjack opening'' is
critical.
</P>
<P>
   The most quotable writer in English, needless to say, was not a
novelist at all. Barbara Riggs, public-relations manager of the
Scottsdale Cultural Council, noted that ``the best opening lines
are all in Shakespeare's plays.'' Riggs gave the example of ``Henry
V'': ``O for a muse of fire, that would ascend / The brightest
heaven of invention.'' It's hard to argue with that.
</P>
<P>
   In every discussion of this kind, there is one American
masterpiece that inevitably comes up _ the three-word opening to
Herman Melville's ``Moby Dick.'' And Jay Boyer, a creative writing
instructor at Arizona State University, knows why.
</P>
<P>
   That sentence turns the focus ring for the novel, ``which is not
about going after a white whale but about finding one's place in an
uncertain universe'' in which evil exists, Boyer said. The question
is the most baffling faced by man, and Boyer pointed out that the
very tone of the questioner is uncertain, seeking _ not ``My name
is Ishmael'' or ``I am Ishmael,'' but ``Call me Ishmael.''
</P>
<P>
   From genre writers to literary giants, then, that is how the
masters do it, somewhat like musicians. A note is struck, a tone is
caught, a theme is stated. Good books, it seems, grow out of good
beginnings. Obviously, we'd be unwise to make the first sentence of
any book a litmus test. But it's not a bad guide. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SOME GREAT FIRST LINES: &QL; 
``Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in
its own way.'' &QL; 
_ Leo Tolstoy, ``Anna Karenina.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.
Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down
the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Validmir Nabokov, ``Lolita.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel
Aureliano Buendia was to remember that distant afternoon when his
father took him to discover ice.'' &QL; 
_ Gabriel Garcia Marquez, ``One Hundred Years of Solitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in
possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.'' &QL; 
_ Jane Austen, ``Pride and Prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll
probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy
childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before
they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I
don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   _ J.D. Salinger, ``The Catcher in the Rye.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the saddest story I have ever heard.'' &QL; 
_ Ford Madox Ford, ``The Good Soldier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever my mother talks to me, she begins the conversation as
if we were already in the middle of an argument.'' &QL; 
_ Amy Tan, ``The Kitchen God's Wife''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Tench went out to look for his ether cylinder: out into
the blazing Mexican sun and the bleaching dust. A few buzzards
looked down from the roof with shabby indifference: he wasn't
carrion yet.'' &QL; 
_ Graham Greene, ``The Power and the Glory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am out of my mind, it's all right with me, thought Moses
Herzog.'' &QL; 
_ Saul Bellow, ``Herzog.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was love at first sight. The first time Yossarian saw the
chaplain he fell madly in love with him.'' &QL; 
_ Joseph Heller, ``Catch-22.'' &QL;

   LOS ANGELES -- They're living in the land of sunshine, health
food and 24-hour gyms - but a high percentage of Angelenos still
say they don't feel so good and about half the population is too
fat.
</P>
<P>
   More people in Los Angeles County describe their health as poor
or just fair than in any other of the nation's 50 largest cities
except Fresno, according to a new study from the Public Health
Resource Group of Portland, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The group compiled its findings from surveys taken by the
Centers For Disease Control. The group, which advises hospitals and
municipalities on health policies, intended the findings as a
glimpse at the wellness of American cities, to help them decide
where to focus their attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question we have significant problems in terms of
the health of our residents,'' said Dr. Jonathan Fielding, director
of public health for Los Angeles County. ``There's a lot to do from
a public health standpoint. This reinforces that.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, half of all county residents are obese, he said.
And Los Angeles has a large population of low-income and uninsured
people, who have less access to care and more health problems than
the population as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The Resource Group report tallied responses to random telephone
surveys of 50,000 people nationwide, including about 2,100 in the
Los Angeles area, said the group's director, Ronald Deprez.
</P>
<P>
   The group ranked the top 50 cities in four categories - the
percentage of people with no health problems, those with some risk
factors, those with some health problem and those who were ``not
well'' and had long-standing health problems. The researchers
considered health and risk factors such as smoking, obesity and
age. They also recorded the numbers of respondents who had high
blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity or diabetes, and
chronicled the number who had combinations of the diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The data is taken from countywide surveys, so the Los Angeles
results also include Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles ranked 40th out of 50 in the ``not well'' category,
where it ranked 40th out of 50 with 12.7 percent of the respondents
classified in it. Those are people with at least three long-term
illnesses, or at least one chronic disease and either fair or poor
general health, or significant functional health limitations.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles area ranked second in the percentage of people
who described their health as only fair or poor, second in people
who had a combination of three or more chronic diseases, and third
in the number of people who said they had lost six or more days of
normal activity in the previous month due to poor health.
</P>
<P>
   Deprez said the findings show the differences in health needs
that different cities must address.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he compared Los Angeles with Chicago, noting that
while Chicago has a far greater percentage of its population ``at
risk,'' L.A. has more people under the ``not well'' category.
</P>
<P>
   That indicates that while Chicago may not have as many people
with various diseases, such as high blood pressure or diabetes, it
has more people who smoke, who are overweight or who have other
risk factors that put them in danger of getting such diseases. On
the other hand, a greater number of people in L.A. already have
such diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a bigger job in your community than in some of the other
communities because of that profile,'' Deprez said. The residents
will ``always have those diseases. What's your job now is to help
keep them from developing events like a stroke or a heart attack.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Chicago, on the other hand, should focus more attention
on prevention and on cutting down on its residents' risk factors.
</P>
<P>
   But the news isn't all bleak. Fielding noted that Los Angeles is
close to the national average in many categories, and above it in
some, such as the number of people exhibiting risk factors and the
number of people in the ``well'' category.
</P>
<P>
   Fielding said solutions have to come from a combined effort of
health-care providers, policy makers, educators and employers,
because jobs and health insurance are so tied together.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't an issue of what the Health Department can do
alone,'' Fielding said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the county already provides $2 billion in safety-net
care for those with health care needs who couldn't otherwise afford
it. And it has made substantial efforts at combating tobacco,
alcohol and drug use, and fostering HIV prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to work on better screening, better treatment and
better disease management,'' Fielding said. ``I remain very
optimistic. We're going to keep improving.''

MAYOR QUESTIONS BANNERS ON RACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SHERRY JOE CROSBY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Mayor Richard Riordan has challenged plans to put
up street banners throughout Los Angeles flaunting provocative
messages on race relations and stereotypes, citing their potential
to offend.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan vigorously objected to one banner with a message about
``White suburban kids'' that alludes to prevalent media images of
black urban, gun-toting teens. Others deal with various aspects of
race, ethnicity, gender and socioeconomic status.
</P>
<P>
   The banners, part of a race relations program for teens
administered by the city's Human Relations Commission with public
and private schools and championed by Councilman Michael Feuer,
were supposed to be unveiled Thursday during a ceremony at Grant
High School in Valley Glen.
</P>
<P>
   But the banners will be missing from the event pending the
meeting of Riordan, representatives of the Human Relations
Commission and Feuer who created the program, called
Shoulder-to-Shoulder, two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that there is a public campaign that has
the potential of offending members of the community,'' said Noelia
Rodriguez, deputy mayor and spokeswoman for Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to come knocking on the mayor's door. He
wants the benefit of real information, and until he has that
information he's not going to feel comfortable saying no to those
banners.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the signs' messages follow a series of
controversies over street banners.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council recently voted to outlaw banners with purely
commercial messages, limiting banners to nonprofit groups and
advertisements in the form of small sponsor messages at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest banner controversy, Riordan was personally
disturbed by one stark black-and-white sign with a message reading,
``They were White suburban kids shooting, not Black. I was
relieved.'' Underneath the message is a profile of a black man.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Hicks, executive director of the Los Angeles city Human
Relations Commission, agreed the banner about a shooting should not
be displayed because its message is ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   ``That comes across just a little raw,'' Hicks said. The banner
is one in a series created by teens from across Los Angeles as part
of an art project sponsored by Shoulder-to-Shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The teens created the message and the art, Feuer said, in
conjunction with the Social and Public Art Resource Center, a
nonprofit community art program responsible for many of the city's
murals.
</P>
<P>
   One banner directs viewers to ``See beyond stereotypes,'' and
depicts a dark-skinned boy and light-skinned girl giving each other
sidelong glances. ``She thought I was a revolutionary,'' the
caption reads. ``He thought I was a spoiled White girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Another one depicts two youngsters surrounded by the following
message: ``We're different. It's cool. I am Jewish. I am
Guatemalan.''
</P>
<P>
   Feuer said that while he agrees with the mayor's assessment of
the banner about the ``White suburban kids,'' he said the others
are less explosive and provide a stark and challenging commentary
about the reality of race relations in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The others succeed at creating a very positive and challenging
message for the city. Those banners, which are in the kids' voices
and in the kids' artwork, provide us with thought-provoking
challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   The banners, which briefly hung at Los Angeles International
Airport and in City Hall chambers during the past few months, have
not sparked any controversy, Feuer said.
</P>
<P>
   Until the mayor intervened, the banners were supposed to be hung
from street light poles near schools throughout the city beginning
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks said he agrees with Riordan's decision to postpone
displaying the banners in order to review them further and make
sure their messages are clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor wants to have additional time to review designs and
raise questions legitimately about how these banners would be
perceived,'' said Hicks, who added it will be several weeks before
enough banners are printed to be displayed throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the Human Relations Commission joins the mayor in
that concern. I think we want to do the right thing and give the
right message to anybody who drives by a banner on the street and
looks up and wonders, Well, what is it saying to me?''

ZACARIAS SAYS BREAKUP MAY BE SOLUTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SHERRY JOE CROSBY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES -- Ousted Superintendent Ruben Zacarias said the
Los Angeles Unified School District is beset by such severe
academic and leadership problems that breaking it up may be the
only answer pending a swift and remarkable improvement in student
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that matters to the public is improving student
achievement,'' Zacarias said last week in his first extensive
interview since being stripped of his primary administrative powers
by the Board of Education in October. He will retire Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's one large district or 12 smaller districts or
whatever the number is, if we don't do right, then it's time to
look elsewhere. It's time to look at some other configuration like
smaller districts.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments came during a wide-ranging discussion that touched
on his strained relationship with the board, Mayor Richard Riordan,
the Belmont Learning Center scandal and the events that led to what
his supporters say was his public humiliation in October.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal reached with the school board, the 71-year-old
Chatsworth resident is entitled to as much as $277,000 in salary
compensation for his contract, which extends to June 30, 2001, plus
$150,000 for accrued vacation. He remains eligible for an annual
pension of nearly $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the immigrant kid from Boyle Heights who became a
teacher in his mid-30s will leave the district with about $800,000
in salary and benefits not including retirement, said his attorney,
Joseph F. Coyne Jr.
</P>
<P>
   A product of the school system, Zacarias rose from the barrios
of East Los Angeles to the highest pinnacle of the 710,000-student
school district. But those hard-won achievements began to unravel
this past year with the election of a slate of reform board
members, backed by Riordan and swept into office by a public weary
of waiting and desperate for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wanted miracles, and no one could have provided those
miracles,'' said Julie Korenstein, who helped appoint Zacarias as
superintendent and, with 12 years of experience, is the
longest-serving member on the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of the timing, of the demand for change, the
impatience -- and legitimately so -- of so many people, it would
have been pretty difficult for things not to have come out the way
they did.''
</P>
<P>
   During the interview, Zacarias said he blamed himself and his
staff for not knowing more about the out-of-control finances and
environmental problems plaguing the Belmont Learning Center, a $173
million half-completed school that sits atop an oil field oozing
toxic and explosive gases.
</P>
<P>
   He said his greatest regret is not having had more time to
improve student achievement and reform the district's cumbersome
budget system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, I wished we had had more time,'' said Zacarias who counts
among his achievements the rise of standardized test scores by 2
percentile points each year since he took office, the development
of policies to end social promotion a full year before the state
mandate took effect and an increase in parent involvement. During
his watch, the number of parent centers jumped from less than 100
to 389 across the district.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those accomplishments, test scores still remain mired in
the bottom third, about one-quarter of the district's 36,000
classroom teachers are on emergency permits and breakup efforts are
building across the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel more needs to be done,'' said Zacarias, who feels
his efforts were cut short by the election of board members
Genethia Hayes, Mike Lansing and Caprice Young, who all had a
different vision of the district and of the person to lead it in
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   He said the next six months will prove crucial to restoring the
public's confidence in the beleaguered school system that has been
battered by scandal over the financing and construction of the
nation's costliest high school and now is trying to stave off
district breakup efforts building in the San Fernando Valley and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   He said plans to split the 708-square-mile system into 12
subdistricts, which he initially proposed and interim
Superintendent Ramon C. Cortines now is touting to employees and
the public, is the LAUSD's last, best chance for keeping the
district intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next six months will dictate the future organizational
structure of this district,'' Zacarias said.
</P>
<P>
   Any reorganization of the district, however, must be accompanied
by a rise in student achievement -- and quickly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This board has six months to prove itself,'' Zacarias said.
``They've got six months to show the kind of steps that will make
the public feel like, hey, things will be different.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't have the same momentum we started with --
improving test scores, lowering the dropout rate, increasing
student attendance, increasing the number of Advanced Placement
tests -- the public will say we've had enough promises with
changes, let's break it up.''
</P>
<P>
   While never close to board members, Zacarias said he always
tried to meet with them twice a month to discuss issues of varying
importance. Those meetings no longer take place with the new board,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't talk to them, they don't talk to me. It's not because
we're mad at each other. They're off doing their own thing. They
work very closely with Ray Cortines and Howard Miller,'' he said.
``It's part of their `hey, we stay out of your way, you stay out of
our way' type of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias also criticized Riordan's involvement in education
issues. He said that at times the mayor's participation has acted
as a lightning rod for controversy, diverting attention from the
district's primary mission, improving student achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It lent itself to generating all this divisive dialogue,''
Zacarias said, citing critics who accused Riordan of buying the
school board after he financed the election campaigns of several
reform candidates last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man has every right as a citizen to be involved in
education,'' he added. ``It might have been appropriate, but it ...
raised a lot of issues that I think some would use to create
divisiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias also opposed the notion of the mayor exercising
legislative or municipal control over the school board and its
appointments as Riordan's counterpart enjoys in the city of
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``At my gut level, I have a feeling that the less political
involvement over educational issues, municipal involvement, City
Hall involvement, the better,'' Zacarias said. ``The risk is too
great for politicizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Noelia Rodriguez, deputy mayor of Los Angeles and spokeswoman
for Riordan, said the mayor would have been remiss in his duties as
the city's primary leader had he not gotten involved in education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor is proud of the fact that he placed a spotlight on
what he believes to be a dysfunctional school system,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor's priority is not following the status quo. He did
what he believed was in the best interests of the children, which
is to bring about a reform movement where children become the No. 1
priority instead of the bureaucrats or the status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   His voice weary at times during the interview, he also accepted
limited blame for the Belmont Learning Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``As captain of the ship, you have to bear some
responsibility,'' said Zacarias, one of 15 former and current
district employees accused by Don Mullinax, the district's top
investigator, of failing to properly manage Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, I should have probably asked for more
information,'' Zacarias said. ``Where I accept responsibility is
every individual who did not inform me of some critical issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias said he doesn't intend to be idle in retirement. He
wants to create literacy centers for needy children and continue
his efforts to boost parent involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one stakeholder that is not involved is the parents,'' he
said. ``The other stakeholders have more say than parents. We have
to level the playing field. We have to do a better job of involving
the parents.''

 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
KAPALUA, Hawaii _ And the legend grows.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tiger Woods played his final three holes in 4 under par,
including a 40-foot birdie bomb on the second playoff hole, to win
the Mercedes Championships on Sunday over hard-battling Ernie Els,
as Woods stayed unbeaten in his last five PGA Tour events.
</P>
<P>
   Not since since Ben Hogan, who won six times in a row in 1948,
has anybody had a better run. Hogan also won five in a row in '53
(one of those was the British Open, at the time not an official PGA
event).
</P>
<P>
   The way Woods started 2000 is sure to enhance the ever-growing
legion of fans who are astounded by the 24-year-old superstar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning is kind of a habit for him now,'' Els said. ``He's a
legend in the making, if he's not already. He's probably going to
be bigger than Elvis in his 40s.''
</P>
<P>
   This from somebody who didn't exactly play like a hound dog
Sunday at Kapalua's Plantation Course. Els pressed Woods to the
limit. Woods eagled the 72nd hole, then watched Els roll an eagle
in on top of his to force the playoff. Then Woods had to make a
challenging 10-footer on the first playoff hole to extend the
match. Finally, he drained the 40-footer that clinched the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last two days, I hit the ball better than Tiger did
from tee to green,'' said Els. ``But when you feel like you're
playing better than the guy and he still beats you, you've got to
ask yourself some questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions like, Where does it all end for Woods?
</P>
<P>
   This is a man who has won 16 times in 71 PGA Tour starts as a
professional. He has led, or been tied for the lead, going into the
final round 13 times in his career. He has won in that situation
the last 12 times he has been in it.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Els finished eagle-birdie-par and couldn't win. Woods
benefited from two missed putts by Els on the back nine Sunday, one
from eight feet and another from four feet.
</P>
<P>
   But Woods also did some damage himself, especially down the
stretch, to win again. He has won the NEC Invitational, National
Car Rental Classic, Tour Championship, American Express
Championship and Mercedes Championships in his last five PGA Tour
starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels a lot better to beat the best players,'' Woods said.
``Under these circumstances, we played some beautiful golf. It was
a very competitive atmosphere, just a great fight between us.''
</P>
<P>
   For sheer drama, this was one heck of a way to start the 2000
golf season. Els had lost the lead on No. 10, when he missed the
green and couldn't get up and down. Woods, meanwhile, drilled a
7-foot birdie putt to go 14 under par, compared to 13-under for
Els.
</P>
<P>
   Els knotted things on the following hole when his 8-iron on the
par-3 hit the flagstick and ended four feet from the hole. But Els
missed the two putts within eight feet, either of which could have
tightened the screws on Woods and perhaps swayed the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against a guy like Tiger, you have to make those putts,'' said
Els, who made only one bogey and one double bogey in the 74 holes
he played.
</P>
<P>
   Woods made a birdie at the par-5 15th to go ahead by a shot when
Els stubbed a chip shot that rolled back down the hill in front of
the green.
</P>
<P>
   But Woods gave back the shot on No. 17 when he missed a
six-footer for par.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the 18th, which was a brilliant battle between the two
heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
   Els actually outdrove the long-hitting Woods, who had 300 yards
to the pin. Woods' 3-wood hit on the front of the green, and he
watched it trickle down a slope to within 14 feet of the hole.
</P>
<P>
   With the pressure mounting, Els had 287 yards and answered
superbly with a 2-iron shot down the hill that skittered up the
green and cozied up within eight feet of the pin.
</P>
<P>
   Woods broke out the uppercut fist pump when his putt disappeared
into the cup. But Els again responded with a dead-solid perfect
putt to neutralize Woods' eagle with one of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Els said he didn't think he had any advantage as the pair
reached the 18th green, even though Woods' putt was considerably
longer than Els'.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, he's pretty good from that distance,'' Els said. ``I had a
good feeling about my chances all day, even going down No. 1 (in
the playoff). The putt he made there was unexpected. But the one at
18 wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Both at 16-under through 72 holes, they set out on the playoff
on the 18th again. Two routine birdies ensued. Well, Els' was
routine, although his eagle putt from 20 feet almost curled in.
Woods had to sink a 10-footer after his 50-foot lag from the fringe
didn't break as much as he thought.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on the second playoff hole, both players hit solid drives
and wedged their approaches on No. 1 about 35 feet behind the hole.
Woods, putting first, hit his ball 2{ feet outside the cup, then
watched the grain and the hillside take it directly into the cup.
When Els' putt on the same line stopped a foot short, Woods had win
No. 5 in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody's weighing in with an opinion about whether Woods'
streak over two years is in the same realm as Hogan's five in a
row, Jack Burke's four consecutive in 1952 (in four weeks), or
Byron Nelson's 11 in a row in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ``A record's a record,'' tour commissioner Tim Finchem said. ``I
think Tiger has been very gracious in his comments about not
creating a comparison between himself at 24 years old and somebody
like Ben Hogan. That's understandable, and that's consistent with
the level of his deference and respect for the great players of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think it's relatively safe to say the amount of
competition today is significantly greater than it was 35 years
ago. So I hear what he's saying. But I think it's incredible to win
this many in a row. If you'd have asked me three years ago, `Is
someone ever going to do it again?' I'd have said, `No.' I'm done
predicting what he might and might not do.''
</P>
<P>
   And this is the man charged with leading the PGA Tour, a former
lawyer who must be careful not to appear biased toward any of the
more than 200 players on the PGA Tour.

IT isn't enough for the Buffalo Bills to suffer, to be struck
speechless and sightless, to feel humiliated and heartbroken, just
because the Tennessee Titans beat them in the last 16 seconds with
the greatest gadget play since Rube Goldberg drew his last cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   No, the Bills need this additional punishment: They should
apologize for the illegal touchdown they scored in January 1993,
the one that kept alive their historic comeback. They should give
back the win (41-38 in overtime) and replay it from that point in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The fans of Houston had lived with that nightmare for seven
years. The crazy thing is, the fact Don Beebe went out of bounds
and then ran back onto the field to catch the pass rarely has been
mentioned. Nor did the officials, who had been trying mainly to
keep their hands warm, take any flak for not making the call. The
Oilers, who went on to blow the unblowable lead, were too
embarrassed to mention it.
</P>
<P>
   So, was the Titans' thunderbolt as good for us as it was for the
sweet, innocent, unspoiled fans of Nashville? Do we in some oblique
way feel healed because a franchise that Houston pretty much
laughed out of town rallied to stun the Bills with a play for the
ages?
</P>
<P>
   Naaah. There is only one Houston pro football franchise, and for
the moment it exists only on paper. What happened in Tennessee will
become part of the legend of the Titans and has little to do with
us. It's like disowning a difficult son, who packs his bags and
leaves, then one day wins the lottery. Do you pick up the phone and
chirp, ``Hey, Junior, where you been the last four years?''
</P>
<P>
   But as interested observers, as students of the game, as
ex-relatives _ and as Einstein said, all things are relative _ you
recall the final ticks of the AFC wild-card game with a feeling
close to awe.
</P>
<P>
   On national television, Paul Maguire was saying to fellow
analyst Joe Theismann, ``Don't you know Wade Phillips looks like a
genius now for starting Rob Johnson?'' As he said this, with 16
seconds on the clock, the Bills were kicking off. A Steve Christie
field goal had just given them a 16-15 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But they would not be going to Jacksonville, nor to Disney
World.
</P>
<P>
   When Lorenzo Neal fielded the short kick and handed it to Frank
Wycheck, you looked for one of those silly circus stunts in which
the player being tackled tries to toss it to a teammate before
falling down. But Wycheck, a tight end by trade, ran to his right
and threw the ball across the field to Kevin Dyson, who hugged the
left sideline for 75 yards to the end zone, accompanied by a convoy
of four Titans.
</P>
<P>
   I watched this play unfold as one would watch the next TV
commercial. Not for one instant did I believe Dyson would score,
and not because I thought it was not a true lateral. No, what I
actually thought was that a member of the Houston media would run
onto the field and tackle Dyson to keep him from scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I kept expecting someone in a Buffalo uniform to
materialize and bump one of the Titans, sending all of them
sprawling like bowling pins. But only the kicker, Steve Christie,
even made it into the picture, and the blockers simply brushed
right past him. Nothing interrupted this incredible romp except the
howling, hysterical screams of a crowd of 66,728 and the wild
mutterings of the announcers.
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect payback for the atrocity of 1993, the wrong players
had been in the wrong place at exactly the right time for the
Titans. The Buffalo partisans, and those who in other years enjoyed
watching the Oilers fail when glory seemed to beckon, can argue
until they turn purple that the play was illegal. But Theismann
made the correct call the moment the ABC cameras showed the first
replay: ``He (Wycheck) threw it behind him. It was a lateral.''
</P>
<P>
   Maguire, who played most of his pro career in Buffalo, as a
punter, agreed. Has television ever lied to you?
</P>
<P>
   You can call it the ``Immaculate Deception,'' as many already
have, or ``The Miracle in Music City'' or the ``Titanic
Throwback.'' For the record, this play will rank with the
Immaculate Reception of Franco Harris, Roger Staubach's Hail Mary,
and The Catch by Dwight Clark among the NFL's five greatest
finishes.
</P>
<P>
   It might have happened here, but it did not, because there was
no room at the inn when the Oilers were begging for a place to
play. Bud Adams didn't move the team for a better deal in
Nashville. He left because he had no deal in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans won their 14th game, something no Oilers team ever
did, against three losses. They won a wild-card playoff game,
something no Oilers did since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, the Buffalo coach who is a son of a Bum, and Bills
owner Ralph Wilson didn't deserve this kind of pain. But then,
neither did the city of Houston back in the winter of '93.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SEATTLE _ Dan Marino may be in the twilight of a brilliant career,
but the 38-year-old quarterback proved Sunday that he has a few
game-winning drives left in him.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marino guided Miami on an 85-yard touchdown drive late in the
fourth quarter to lift the Dolphins to a 20-17 victory over the
Seattle Seahawks in a wild-card-round playoff game at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why he's Marino,'' Miami guard Mark Dixon said.
``That's why he's special. That's why he's the best that has ever
done it.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory sends Miami (10-7) to Jacksonville for an AFC
divisional game against the Jaguars on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A sellout crowd of 66,170 watched Seattle end its season 9-8,
with six losses in its last seven games, bringing a close to 26
years of history at the Kingdome. The facility will be imploded in
March, which would be an accurate description of what Marino did to
the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very emotional day for me,'' said Seattle defensive
tackle Cortez Kennedy, who had waited 10 years to participate in a
playoff game. ``I wish we could have closed out the old Kingdome
with a win. I really thought we were going to until the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle led 17-10 late in the third quarter before Miami took
control of the game, culminating with an amazing scoring drive
directed by a future Hall of Fame quarterback who proved to his
detractors he isn't ready for the rocking chair just yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins trailed 17-13 when they took possession at their 15
with 9:09 to play. Seattle was one play away from getting the ball
back in good field position when Miami had third-and 17 from its
eight.
</P>
<P>
   Marino threw a deep square-in to Tony Martin, which gave the
Dolphins a first down at the 31 and appeared to energize Marino.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just looked for a crack in the zone,'' Marino said. ``I
thought if I could hang in there long enough I could get Tony on
the square. He made a great catch, because the throw was a little
high.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino completed three more passes _ for 17, 20 and 24 yards _
on the drive before J.J. Johnson scored the go-ahead touchdown on a
two-yard run with 4:48 to play. Marino finished with 17 completions
in 30 attempts for 196 yards and one TD.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to describe what it was like being out there against
Marino on that last drive,'' Seattle cornerback Willie Williams
said. ``You just knew Dan still had something left. You can't say
enough about the guy's leadership qualities. After the game, I told
him I hoped he made it to the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   The Miami defense helped keep that dream alive. The Dolphins
smothered Seattle quarterback Jon Kitna, who was sacked six times,
including three by Trace Armstrong. The final possession for
Seattle, which started at its 11 with 1:05 to go, ended with an
interception by Terrell Buckley.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks had only 32 yards on offense in the second half,
including three yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just couldn't get anything going,'' Seattle coach Mike
Holmgren said. ``We did some things good early, but we couldn't
sustain it and couldn't convert in some key situations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins and Marino did convert when they needed it, winning
a playoff game on the road for the first time since Dec. 31 1972,
when they won at Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys felt like we got a reprieve getting into the
playoffs,'' Miami coach Jimmy Johnson said. ``We all wanted to
prove we still have a good football team. It's always very
difficult to win on the road in the playoffs, but I told the
players we were going to win the game, so don't worry about it.
Just worry about winning one play at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle led 10-3 at the half by holding Miami to 69 yards of
offense, including 23 yards passing on nine throws by Marino.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to be conservative in the first half and
establish the run,'' Marino said. ``Then we opened it up little
more in the second half and made some plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The Miami offense finally showed some life at the start of the
third quarter when Marino sparked a 60-yard scoring drive to tie
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Marino threw a quick slant in the end zone to Oronde Gadsden on
third-and-goal at the one to make it 10-10 with 8:55 to go in the
third period. Marino was 6-for-6 for 46 yards on the drive, which
was one completion and 23 yards more than he had in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   But the game did not stay tied for long, thanks to one of the
strangest kickoff returns you will ever see.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Rogers dropped the kickoff at the Seattle seven-yard
line and watched the ball bounce in front of him to the 15. He
scooped up the ball, found a seam and raced 85 yards down the
sideline for a touchdown to ignite the crowd and give the Seahawks
a 17-10 lead 18 seconds after the Dolphins had tied the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys could have crumbled at that point,'' Johnson said.
``But we told them bad things happen in a game. That's not what
gets you beat. It's how you react to the bad things.''
</P>
<P>
   Olindo Mare's 50-yard field goal with 2:22 left in the third
quarter made it 17-13 before Marino showed everyone what 17 years
of experience means when a playoff game is on the line. Everyone
was praising Marino after the game, but Seattle punter Jeff Feagles
might have summed it up best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big-time players make big plays,'' Feagles said. ``And Dan
Marino is one of the biggest ever.''

MINNEAPOLIS _ Any Given Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   That's the story line the Cowboys have been trying to pitch all
year long to keep us from throwing our popcorn at the screen and
walking out of the theater.
</P>
<P>
   On any given Sunday, anything can happen.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe if you have Al Pacino as head coach, Cameron Diaz as
the club owner, Jamie Foxx at quarterback and a conspiratorial
script by Oliver Stone.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, they tore your ticket for the Cowboys'
21st-century NFL playoff premiere when you had to know it was like
watching one more overwrought remake of the Titanic story. The ship
goes down in the end.
</P>
<P>
   The only surprise is that anybody really expected a surprise,
rather than the 27-10 wild-card gash in the hull left by the
Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   It was like every other road trip of the season since the
opening-day miracle comeback at Washington, leaving the Cowboys
broken and squashed, their carcasses littered across another
highway like a family of nearsighted armadillos.
</P>
<P>
   Dropped passes, costly penalties, careless fumbles, wasted
timeouts. It was a compendium of every boneheaded mistake the
Cowboys have made since September that turned the false hope of a
3-0 start into the grim reality of a sub-.500 finish.
</P>
<P>
   This was like one of those late-night TV commercials for the
greatest hits of rock 'n' roll. Why buy so many individual albums
to collect all of your favorite songs, when for $19.95 you can get
them all right here on one CD?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we played them well but didn't give ourselves a
chance to win the game,'' said head coach Chan Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, really?
</P>
<P>
   Deion Sanders fumbles a punt. Emmitt Smith is flagged for
illegal motion on third-and-goal at the Minnesota one. Robert
Thomas gains three yards on a swing pass and then fumbles. George
Teague is faked halfway to St. Paul on a sideline move by Robert
Smith that turns third-and-25 into a 26-yard Vikings touchdown.
Jason Tucker gains 13 yards on a slant over the middle from Troy
Aikman and fumbles out of the back of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys blew all three of their first-half timeouts before
the first 10 minutes of the game had been played. They wasted one
timeout when they had only 10 men on the field. They were penalized
on another occasion for having 12 men on the field.
</P>
<P>
   As Gailey might say, Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did you
like the play?
</P>
<P>
   If the famed Four Horsemen had been suited up in Cowboys
uniforms Sunday, their names would have been Groucho, Harpo, Chico
and Zeppo.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Aikman had an accurate day throwing the ball, completing
22 of 38 passes for 286 yards. But there were so many balls in so
many situations that were dropped by the relatives of Edward
Scissorhands.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Emmitt Smith rushed 15 times for 99 yards. But 65 of those
came on a first-possession sprint down the left sideline that came
up three yards short of the end zone when he tripped on the foot of
his blocker, David LaFleur.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Cowboys limited Vikings quarterback Jeff George to a
manageable 212 yards on the day. But the guard-against-the-big-play
strategy of defensive coordinator Dave Campo broke like crystal on
concrete when deep man Kevin Mathis broke the wrong way on a
rainbow heave from George to Randy Moss that turned into a 58-yard
touchdown. And the Cowboys were also bludgeoned on the ground by
Robert Smith for 140 yards on 28 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many other times this season, the Cowboys came from
ahead to lose it, letting a 10-3 lead get blown away in a gale wind
of 24 straight points by the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ``How would I describe our season?'' said Emmitt Smith. ``Just
8-9. Mediocre. Up and down. Consistently bad at times. Signs of
greatness at others. Just up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention in and out, hot and cold, powerful and pitiful.
On the last day of the season, the Cowboys were no more and no less
than they have been from the start _ a tease. All that was missing
was bump-and-grind music and dollar bills stuffed in their garter
belts.
</P>
<P>
   The question now: Who to blame and how to fix it?
</P>
<P>
   All season long, there were so many mistakes and misplays by so
many players.
</P>
<P>
   Does Gailey demand enough discipline? Or does his team simply
lack the overall talent to be a contender?
</P>
<P>
   When Rocket Ismail was sidelined in the second quarter with a
sprained left ankle, the Cowboys were employing at wide receiver
Tucker, Chris Brazzell and Jeff Ogden, not a single one drafted
into the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The dour Aikman said it's too early to evaluate.
</P>
<P>
   Or too late. These Cowboys had just enough to disappoint in the
final reel.
</P>
<P>
   Any Given Sunday.

BELEAGUERED JOHN MCCAIN BACK IN ATTACK MODE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER AND KRIS MAYES  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ True to his background as a combat pilot, Sen. John
McCain's strategy in a crisis is to attack, attack.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, McCain employed that method again. In an attempt
to show he did nothing wrong in writing regulators on behalf of
political donors, the Republican presidential candidate released
letters he wrote to federal regulatory agencies on behalf of major
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, he called for the release of all his correspondence
to federal agencies since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain's general perspective is that information gets out
sooner or later, so you should candidly and honestly tell what you
know when you know it,'' said Scott Celley, a former aide who
weathered the Keating Five scandal with McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The latest controversy may be taking a toll _ a recent ``Boston
Globe'' poll shows McCain's surge against George W. Bush in New
Hampshire appears to have stalled.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has a history of releasing information to the press after
a controversy blows up, though it's not without calculation. In
some cases, McCain chooses selected media; in others, the
information is incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent controversy, McCain gave the Associated Press
a preview of letters written on behalf of 15 large donors, and an
additional 500 letters written for other constituents.
</P>
<P>
   That could allow McCain to blunt the impact of the story, said
Fred Davis, a national political media adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does McCain come off as being forthright, but after the
AP breaks the story, other reporters are less likely to dig through
mountains of records.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, McCain employed the same strategy in releasing his
medical records, to combat allegations that he was emotionally
unfit to be president.
</P>
<P>
   A McCain adviser who asked not to be named acknowledged that the
donor letters were released all at once to avoid fueling a
conflagration of negative stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the letters were written because the individual had
been giving money,'' the adviser said. ``But you have the potential
for 14 different illegitimate-but-still noteworthy stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically, it was the Senate Commerce Committee, not McCain,
who released the records. However, McCain aides were instrumental
in the effort and were present while they were being reviewed by
reporters. McCain chairs the committee.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, Davis said, such moves may backfire, giving the
impression that McCain is trying to manage the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just sounds so suspect,'' Davis said. ``If the goal is to
try to circumvent suspicion, why on earth would you do it in such a
suspicious, sneaky, clandestine way?''
</P>
<P>
   McCain spokesman Dan Schnur disagreed, saying the letters were
released to the AP for expediency's sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took several hours to go through those records with a
single reporter,'' Schnur said. ``In a full press conference, with
50 or 100 reporters, it could have lasted for days. And many of
those reporters understandbly would have left early without a full
explanation of the records.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest controversy was sparked by a ``Boston Globe'' story
that revealed McCain had written a letter to the Federal
Communications Commission on behalf of Paxson Communications, which
had given McCain $20,000 in campaign contributions and reduced-fare
rides on the Paxson corporate jet.
</P>
<P>
   The story could be particularly damaging to McCain because he
has staked himself out as a campaign reformer. He also still
suffers the taint of the Keating Five scandal, in which McCain and
four other senators met with regulators on behalf of developer
Charles H Keating Jr.
</P>
<P>
   During that scandal, McCain also employed the strategy of
releasing information, even if it was negative.
</P>
<P>
   When McCain learned that reporters from ``The Arizona Republic''
were pursuing a tip that he had socialized with Keating, McCain
decided to lay it out for them. He released records showing he had
flown to the Bahamas with Keating, sometimes on Keating's corporate
jet, and had been tardy in paying for the trips.
</P>
<P>
   Celley said McCain's openness paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``(McCain) was able to contrast himself and the way he did
business with the other four, who were stonewalling and
foot-dragging,'' Celley said. ``He provided information as quickly
as he could provide it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's candor in the Keating affair came only after reporters
learned about the trips and discovered that McCain's wife had
invested in a Keating shopping center. Up to that point, McCain had
characterized Keating as just another constituent.
</P>
<P>
   McCain employed a similar strategy in 1994, when news of his
wife's drug problem was in danger of becoming public.
</P>
<P>
   Selected reporters were given interviews with Cindy McCain, in
which she admitted being addicted to painkillers and stealing pills
from the relief agency she had founded.
</P>
<P>
   News coverage was sympathetic. Only later did reporters find out
that a former relief worker, Tom Gosinski, had sued Cindy McCain
and accused her of ordering him to conceal ``improper acts.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; None of his claims was ever proven.
</P>
<P>
   Schnur said McCain has done nothing wrong, so it's important for
him to show he has nothing to hide. &QL;

AS TALKS WIND DOWN, BARAK VISITS SITE OF U.S.' BLOODIEST BATTLE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for new 2nd and 3rd grafs with updating)  (nk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. _ On what appeared to be the last full day
of an initial round of peace talks between Israel and Syria, Prime
Minister Ehud Barak took a lengthy tour of the site of one of the
deadliest single day confrontations in American history, the battle
of Antietam, and spent the evening at a final dinner with President
Clinton and Syria's foreign minister hashing out a path to an
elusive peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's dinner and then separate meetings with the leaders
lasted until 12:30 a.m. on Monday, and as the president returned to
the White House the State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin,
said, ``All the issues came up at dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   While Rubin gave no details, he said, ``clearly we are coming to
the end of the leaders' participation here this week.''
</P>
<P>
   The former general's visit to the Antietam National Battlefield
came at the end of an inconclusive week of negotiations, but one
that all sides said had finally resulted in a framework for
negotiations. And as he roamed the haunted Civil War site, where
more than 23,000 were killed or badly wounded, he turned to his
aides and said in Hebrew, ``It is amazing that more people died
here in one day than in all of Israel's wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he was literally correct depends on how one assesses
what happened to those wounded in the battle, most of whom died
later of their injuries. But his intent in uttering the point in
front of Israeli, Syrian and American reporters, was clearly to
underscore his desire to strike a deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak also underscored to reporters that the talks with
Syria were tough ones. ``There is no doubt it will be a tough
diplomatic battle,'' he said in his first public comments since he
arrived a week ago. ``It is impossible now to forecast how long it
will last, or the results.''
</P>
<P>
   In public, at least, Barak, mindful of the considerable
suspicion in Israel about any peace accord that calls for giving
back the buffer zone seized in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, has never
said here that such an accord is on the way. ``We won't sign an
agreement unless it strengthens Israel's position,'' he said on the
battlefield, which Clinton administration officials said he'd asked
to visit. Barak, a student of military strategy, also offered an
ex-general's analysis of the tactical errors committed by Gen.
Robert E. Lee and his Union opponent, Gen. George B. McClellan.
</P>
<P>
   He then boarded his motorcade and proceeded to a good-sized
working farm in Boonsboro, Md., owned by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright. Albright, who leases out the land, offered
Barak a brief glimpse of American agricultural life.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian negotiator, Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, had
visited the same farm for tea on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Sunday, according to an official at the lunch,
Barak passed a clock, mounted on a barn, that clearly has not
worked for years. ``If we get a peace agreement,'' he said to
Albright, ``I'll come back and fix your clock in two phases.'' It
was a reference to the painfully slow talks here, where the phasing
of a withdrawal from the Golan has been among the many points of
constant argument.
</P>
<P>
   As they dined, Israeli negotiators finally met their Syrian
counterparts on the questions of national borders if the Golan was
returned, and the critical issue of access to water. The two
committees set up to discuss those issues at the beginning of the
talks last week had never actually met, a sign of the depth of the
discord over what issues the two sides felt they could talk about
first.
</P>
<P>
   That the committees met Sunday suggests that both sides now are
confident that they have signaled to their constituencies at home
that they are holding tough and can finally take up the substance
of their disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a long time just to get them to the point where they
could actually have a meaningful discussion,'' one American
official said Sunday. ``It doesn't sound like much progress, but
you should have seen what it looked like five days ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is now in a delicate position. At the dinner he was
holding for Barak and al-Sharaa, he was clearly tempted to bring up
possible ways of bridging the differences that the United States
had put forth in a ``working paper'' given to the Syrians and
Israelis on Friday. But one senior official said Sunday that it was
``too early'' for Clinton to make that move, and suggested that he
might focus instead on a schedule for a second round of talks.
</P>
<P>
   That would allow time for Barak, who intends to leave Monday,
Israeli officials said, to go home and take the temperature on the
likelihood that any deal he strikes would actually pass muster in a
national referendum. And it would give Syria's ailing president,
Hafez el-Assad, time to consider whether getting back the Golan is
a big enough prize to put up with Israel's demands for a pullback
of Syrian forces, more military aid from the United States, and a
more normalized relationship with Syria. The timing of al-Sharaa's
departure remained unclear.

DANDY COMEBACK BY MARINO, DOLPHINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Dan Marino had one left in him Sunday. Or, more
accurately, he had three.
</P>
<P>
   One more drive. Three more throws.
</P>
<P>
   Today, because he had both, he has one more win on his record,
too, a 20-17 comeback over a stunned Seattle Seahawks team at the
Kingdome that sent the sixth-seeded Dolphins to Jacksonville
Saturday for an all-Florida AFC playoff semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   To get there, Miami followed a familiar pattern laid out by
coach Jimmy Johnson. It had to play defense all day and let Dan
play at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Johnson told us all week we were going to win in the
fourth quarter,'' Dolphins linebacker Zach Thomas said. ``Everyone
kept saying it. Dan did a great job. That's why we have him here.''
</P>
<P>
   Why they have Dan Marino there is to do what he did Sunday,
which was complete three of the sweetest throws a man could make in
the most critical of situations. Three throws that saved the day
and his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always believed we'd win,'' Marino said after he'd made that
a reality by completing four more passes with an arm that already
had made 9,014 such throws in the NFL at the time he slipped under
center Tim Ruddy with 8:26 to play and his team trailing, 17-13.
</P>
<P>
   They were trailing a Seahawk team whose offense had been put on
hold by the Dolphin defense throughout the second half, gaining
just 32 total yards and only 3 on the ground over the final 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Seahawks were still clinging to a slim lead because
Charlie Rogers had returned a kickoff 85 yards for a touchdown with
8:37 to play in the third quarter, a touchdown that broke a 10-10
tie and for a long time looked like it would break the Dolphins'
hearts. It might have had Marino not had three minutes when he
played like the quarterback whose career will end in Canton, on the
front stoop of the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Marino doesn't have many minutes like that anymore. Not with an
aging arm that has had trouble pulling the trigger all through a
long, frustrating season that many believe may be his last. At that
point of the day, he had been struggling through such an afternoon,
looking every inch his 38 years as he looked up at a third and 17
at his own 8, trailing, 17-13, with half a quarter to play.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Martin, Marino's fleetest receiver, heard the call at that
moment and he heeded it. When Marino said ``866,'' in the huddle,
calling a pattern on which O.J. McDuffie runs a short square in and
Martin a deeper one, it was obvious where the ball would go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the ball in my hands all the time,'' Martin said not
long after he made a leaping catch to pluck it out of the air for a
23-yard gain that energized the Dolphins. ``I want them to put it
on my back. In the huddle, everybody was looking glum, but that
throw changed our whole demeanor.''
</P>
<P>
   When Marino followed it with two more completions to Martin of
17 and 20 yards, it was the Seahawks' defense that suddenly was
looking glum.
</P>
<P>
   It had held Marino in check all day and controlled Miami's run,
limiting it to 2.9 yards a carry despite allowing 108 yards on the
ground. Now Marino was slipping away from them, throw by throw, and
they knew it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marino was making the plays,'' said Seattle safety Darryl
Williams. ``He's a Hall of Famer. Except for that one drive, we
made some plays. You can't take anything away from him.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the problem. The Seahawks couldn't take anything away
from Marino on that drive but he took everything away from them.
Their lead and their season. Took it with four completions that
covered 84 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The last was a third-down throw that turned back the Seahawks
but also the calendar. It was a Marino throw from the days when his
arm was the most feared in football, a 24-yard completion to Oronde
Gadsden on a third and 10 at the Seahawk 29 that was a perfect
throw against a blitz.
</P>
<P>
   It put the ball on the 5-yard line and two plays later J.J.
Johnson powered over left tackle for a touchdown that provided all
the points Miami needed because the Seahawk offense remained
shackled and going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere but home until next July after two final drives produced
two sacks, five incompletions, and a final interception by Terrell
Buckley that gave Marino one more new beginning next Saturday in
Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to be fairly conservative throughout the whole
first half,'' Marino said. ``We ran it a lot. I don't know how many
times (37) but we ran it a lot. We wanted to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was so much going on I never had time to even think this
might be my last game. I'm not that smart. The only thing I could
think about was the game and our strategy to win. I always believed
we were going to win. You have to stay positive to give yourself a
chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Dolphins did Sunday. They stayed positive,
stayed on defense, and gave Dan Marino a chance to win for them.
</P>
<P>
   Which, like on so many other afternoons, he did.

FAMILIAR FAVORITES PREVAIL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY FRED SHUSTER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- NBC's medical drama ``ER'' -- a hot prime-time
staple especially in this flu season -- won favorite drama series
for the sixth year in a row at the People's Choice Awards -- the
first Hollywood awards extravaganza of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The 26th annual event, hosted by Don Johnson and Cheech Marin
and broadcast Sunday on CBS from the Pasadena Civic Auditorium,
awarded statuettes in 18 categories including movies, TV and music.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ``Friends'' won favorite TV comedy series while Calista
Flockhart was named favorite female television performer for her
role in Fox's ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``ER'' showed once again its resonance with a wide range of
viewers. This year's poll included the votes of more than
200million American critics, ages 12 and over, randomly selected
from across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask us if it's getting stale,'' said ``ER's'' Anthony
Edwards backstage. ``The bottom line is it's a happy set ... and
the writing is always good.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the loss of series star George Clooney, who left
the show last year, Edwards said: ``The great thing about an
ensemble cast is that it doesn't rely on one character.''
</P>
<P>
   Other winners included ABC's Drew Carey for favorite male TV
performer, Billy Campbell for favorite male performer in a new TV
series for ``Once And Again,'' and Jennifer Love Hewitt was named
best female performer in a new TV series for ``Time of Your Life.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in the history of the awards, online voting
was used to determine the outcome of two categories: favorite new
TV dramatic series, which went to NBC's ``Providence,'' and new TV
comedy series, won by NBC's ``Stark Raving Mad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to say thank you to all the computer nerds,'' said
Steven Levitan, executive producer-creator of ``Stark Raving Mad.''
``I've seen how the Internet can change lives and connect people.''
</P>
<P>
   Flockhart told reporters backstage that the People's Choice
Awards gives her a sense of what the public wants from her show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to know some people are enjoying it,'' Flockhart
said. ``I am pretty emotional about this. It has taken me by
surprise. It comes from the heart and the people, and that makes it
special for me. This definitely is an inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   Flockhart said the audience identifies with ``Ally McBeal''
because ``people see themselves in the characters. They see what
they like about themselves and what they hate about themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends'' star David Schwimmer hinted that the series would
continue indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we are having fun and the writing is good, and the
fans are as excited as they've been, we'll be around,'' Schwimmer
said. ``There's a certain chemistry that the six of us have
combined with the writing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the music categories, Latin-pop crooner Ricky Martin was
named best male musical performer, Canadian country star Shania
Twain won for best female musical performer and teen-pop ensemble
the Backstreet Boys were named best musical group or band.
</P>
<P>
   The people spoke about their favorite movies and movie stars,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' won in two categories, best motion picture
and best dramatic motion picture. ``Big Daddy'' won for best comedy
motion picture, and its star Adam Sandler was named best motion
picture star in a comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, perennial favorite Harrison Ford took home a
statuette for best motion picture star in a drama for his role in
``Random Hearts.'' Last year, Ford was named all-time favorite
motion picture star at the 25th anniversary People's Choice Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very gratifying,'' a soft-spoken Ford said backstage.
``The films that I do are successful, and given that I make films,
I do not expect to be commercially successful. I'm especially
gratified that people allow me to have so much freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixth Sense'' star Bruce Willis was voted best motion picture
actor while Julia Roberts, who starred in ``Notting Hill,'' won for
best motion picture actress.

CARROLL POINTS TO BELICHICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Former Patriots coach Pete Carroll believes Bill
Belichick will be the new coach in New England soon.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll, who is expected to formalize his contractual settlement
with Patriots owner Robert Kraft Monday, said, ``I think Bill will
be the new coach. He's not going to coach the Jets now, so I'm sure
the settlement of that will be attractive to the Jets.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a strong possibility the issue of whether Belichick can
be named coach and general manager of the Patriots could be settled
this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots could expedite matters by negotiating directly with
the Jets rather than waiting for the league to make a ruling on the
validity of Belichick's contract with New York, which has three
years to run.
</P>
<P>
   NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said, ``As far as I know, nothing has
happened over the weekend. There's certainly nothing new from the
league's point of view. If the two teams have talked, that's their
business. They are free to settle this on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   There are reports the Jets' situation could be cleared up as
quickly as Tuesday when a new coach _ either Bill Parcells or Al
Groh _ will be named with the blessing of the man who emerges as
the new owner. All signs point to Woody Johnson being that man.
</P>
<P>
   According to Aiello, the Jets have until the end of business
Monday to respond to the grievance filed by Belichick Thursday. At
that point, commissioner Paul Tagliabue would call for a hearing at
which Belichick's representation and that of the Jets would be
heard. The Jets believe the contract Belichick signed is binding,
but Belichick contends that things changed when owner Leon Hess
died.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue may agree with the Jets and rule the contract is
binding, but he would recommend compensation to release Belichick
from the contract. Tagliabue has had cases like this before,
including when Parcells left the Patriots three years ago, when New
England was awarded four draft picks over a three-year period. It
appears Tagliabue wouldn't award the Jets a similar package because
Belichick doesn't have the credentials Parcells has. There has been
speculation he would award the Jets a second-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue also could rule that the contract is not binding and
that Belichick is free to seek employment elsewhere, but that seems
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick has been advised by his attorney, Neil Cornrich, not
to comment on anything regarding his contract, but a source close
to the Belichick family didn't believe any developments were
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   A Jets official said Sunday &UR;  &LR; night he would be surprised if the
teams settled the issue Monday or Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots may continue the interview process early this week,
with Giants defensive coordinator John Fox and New England
defensive line coach Ray Hamilton possibly being called in.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll, who ended his Patriots reign with a 27-21 record,
didn't want to speak about his days in New England yet.
``Everything has gone pretty smoothly and my business should be
settled shortly,'' said Carroll, who plans to live in this area
until his future becomes more clear.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll doesn't believe it's likely he'll work as a head coach
this year, but he has had some discussions with teams. Asked Sunday
if he were going to work with Seattle coach Mike Holmgren, Carroll
said, ``A lot of teams are still playing and need some time to sort
things out. I don't know what will happen yet.'' Seattle was
eliminated from the playoffs later Sunday, 20-17, by Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll understands it's rare when coaches with his winning
percentage get fired, and he's holding out hope others around the
league will recognize that.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll is expected to receive two years' pay, which could be in
excess of $2 million. Other contractual situations, including the
lease on a Jaguar he's had during his Patriots career, have to be
worked out.

ALLISON NURSING ANOTHER INJURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Jason Allison's season is potentially over and the
ironic thing is it won't have anything to do with his right wrist,
which has been plaguing him since last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Allison, who came to terms on a one-year contract extension with
the Bruins Thursday, suffered an injury to his left (and previously
good) hand in Saturday's game against the New York Islanders.
Allison didn't miss any time in the game but said his left hand is
in bad shape. He's expecting to see a doctor Monday to have X-rays
and possibly other tests to determine the extent of the damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first two fingers and the thumb on that hand are like a
balloon,'' said Allison, who was unable to participate in Sunday's
annual Wives Carnival at the FleetCenter. ``They're really swollen.
It could be broken, it could be torn ligaments.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it doesn't bode well. Allison has been nursing his
right wrist along and was hoping to make it through the end of the
season before requiring tendon transplant surgery. Sunday, he said
if the injury to his left hand is going to keep him out for any
significant time, he might as well have the surgery on the right
wrist now. There would still be a chance he'd be able to make it
back for the playoffs. Problem is, the way the Bruins are going
right now, there's a good chance they won't even make the playoffs.
Allison said he expects to have some news Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can't play for however long because of my thumb, I'm not
going to wait until the offseason,'' he said, referring to the
surgery on the right wrist.
</P>
<P>
   With the team in such a downward spiral, it seems very clear
that management is going to have to make a trade in order to shake
things up. And if Allison is out for the year, or most of it, that
makes a deal that much more imperative.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it's been a pretty discouraging season for the
24-year-old. The only good news is that he and his wife, Christine,
are a couple of weeks away from becoming parents for the first
time. Hockey has brought only bad news so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a very lucky year this year, maybe it's good
everything has happened at the same time,'' he said. ``(Before
this) I've been pretty lucky my whole career.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison said the injury came on a freak play. He tried to check
an Islander and missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just jammed my thumb into the boards,'' he said. ``It came
out and was bent all the way back. It was sideways kind of. I went
to hit him and I missed and jammed it in the boards. It's not back
toward you, it's sideways toward you. I thought I broke it. It
looked like it snapped back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really scared for a few seconds. If it's broken, it's a
pretty bad thing. It wasn't, though, it was just separated. I mean,
it could still be broken, but at least it didn't snap in half. I
just hope I don't have to get surgery on it. But if there are torn
ligaments, you might have to.''
</P>
<P>
   What masked Allison's injury was that he didn't miss any time.
He thought he was going to miss a lot more than that, but he wound
up getting the thumb snapped back into place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was done when it happened,'' he said. ``I went to
the hall and the doctor put it back in right away. I asked if it
was going to be OK. I didn't really talk to him. I asked him if it
was going to come back out, if it was going to come back out on its
own.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison said he asked trainer Don Del Negro to tape it up for
him to make sure it didn't. With two bad hands, it wasn't an easy
night for Allison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was holding my stick with my pinky and my other two
fingers,'' he said. ``We were in the game and it was a big game and
I was trying to get through.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, depending on what doctors ascertain, Allison might be
through.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is at a loss to figure why his club is having such a
tough time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think you know and then something else happens,'' he said.
``It's not there, you know? I don't think very often there's a lack
of effort. But stuff snowballs. I think basically that's what has
happened. You're in such a rut that sometimes it's hard to get
out.''

AN HONOR CATCHER FISK WOULD LOVE TO RECEIVE 
</HEADLINE>
 OF FAME-FISK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ If all goes right, the phone will ring in Carlton
Fisk's Florida vacation home around 11 a.m. Tuesday. And he will
smile.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no ring, it means Fisk's dream of joining his peers
in the Baseball Hall of Fame remains on hold and that his support
outside New England and Chicago isn't as great as one would think.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk came close a year ago but fell just just short of joining
inductees George Brett, Nolan Ryan, and Robin Yount in the voting
by the Baseball Writers Association of America. For induction, a
player must be named on 75 percent of the ballots. Fisk was named
on 66.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A case could be made that Tony Perez and Jim Rice, both former
Red Sox stars, also are deserving. We will know Tuesday when the
results are announced.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk, the former Red Sox and White Sox catcher who now is a
special assistant to Boston general manager Dan Duquette, received
330 votes on 497 ballots last year. While there is no guarantee
that any candidate, no matter how popular, can garner the necessary
votes, Fisk would appear to have as good a chance as anyone this
year. However, the BBWAA has been unable to come up with an
inductee seven times since 1936, the last time being in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk is hard to ignore. His 24-year career began with him being
named rookie of the year for Boston in 1972. He caught a major
league record 2,226 games and hit 351 home runs, tops among
catchers. He was on 11 All-Star teams. Fisk's career with Boston
ran through 1980, and despite many accomplishments, he is best
remembered for his dramatic game-winning home run in the 12th
inning of Game 6 of the 1975 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   With Chicago (1981-93), Fisk was primarily a catcher and
designated hitter, but also played first base and left field. If
elected, Fisk's biggest problem might be deciding which team's hat
to wear. He made stormy exits from both clubs, but seems to have
mended fences in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Perez was fifth in last year's balloting with 302 votes (60.8
percent). He played in five World Series, seven league playoffs,
hit 20 home runs nine times, and drove in 100 runs seven times.
Perez also has stints as a coach and a manager at Cincinnati on his
resume.
</P>
<P>
   Perez had 1,652 RBIs and is tied for the lead in career home
runs by a Latin player (379) with Hall of Famer Orlando Cepeda. He
got my vote again. This is his ninth year on the ballot and clearly
many feel as I do that it's time to correct this blight on the
election process. Perez belongs.
</P>
<P>
   So does Rice who, unlike Fisk or Perez, played his entire career
(16 seasons) in Boston and is best remembered for his 1978 MVP
season in which he hit 46 home runs and amassed 406 total bases
(the best since Stan Musial had 429 for St. Louis in 1948).
</P>
<P>
   This is an important year for Rice, who actually lost votes in
the 1999 ballot. This is his sixth year of eligibility, and he
needs to add support beyond New England. Rice, the Red Sox hitting
coach, is a member of the team's Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody sees him as a Hall of Famer. Two years ago,
Rice got more than 200 votes and finished fourth. Last year, he
slipped to eighth (146).
</P>
<P>
   There are others who will find support on the 2000 ballot,
notably Gary Carter, who was as good a catcher in the National
League as Fisk was in the American. Carter has three Gold Gloves to
Fisk's one. He played 19 seasons, and appeared in three league
playoffs and a 1986 World Series we'd all like to forget. Carter
holds two major league records for catchers _ most career putouts
(11,785) and most chances accepted (12,988). This is his third year
on the Hall of Fame ballot.
</P>
<P>
   There are others you might like to see make it, but they come
with mixed credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers Luis Tiant and Jeff Reardon were both great in their
time and in their own way. Bruce Hurst went 3-0 in the 1986
postseason for the Red Sox. Outfielder Dave Henderson had a 36-game
career with Boston but people love him anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Tiant is special, but the outlook is not good. He got just 53
votes a year ago and his eligibility runs out in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Reardon played three of his 16 seasons (1990-1992) in Boston,
the best of which was 1990 when he recorded 40 saves in 49 chances.
Reardon, who pitched for seven teams, ranks fourth in career saves
(367).
</P>
<P>
   Henderson is unlikely to get the five percent of the vote he
needs to stay eligible, but he is a sentimental choice around here.
Red Sox fans always will owe him a debt of gratitude for getting
the club to the '86 Series with an his eye-popping performance in
the American League playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Others who likely will get support: Rich ``Goose'' Gossage, the
Yankee reliever; pitchers Jack Morris, Jim Kaat, and Bruce Sutter;
and former Dodger Steve Garvey.

SPIRITS FLAGGING ABOARD STARS &AMP; STRIPES 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ During a long America's Cup season,
sometimes a single instant becomes a turning point.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of Race 7 here Sunday, as it powered up for the
final six-second approach to the start line, Stars &AMP; Stripes
crossed the line early, though it had plenty of margin for error.
</P>
<P>
   As the white flag from the jury boat flashed, skipper Ken Read
steered the sleek midnight blue boat back to his left, dipping back
over, then recrossing the start line six lengths behind Prada, a
distance it couldn't make up.
</P>
<P>
   The loss to Prada, coupled with the loss of a point by penalty
for breaching Cup protocol with an illegal rudder, puts the first
nail in the coffin for Stars &AMP; Stripes in its bid to become one of
the two finalists for the Louis Vuitton Cup, the winner of which
meets New Zealand in the America's Cup in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got greedy,'' said helmsman Ken Read as Stars &AMP; Stripes was
towed back to Auckland Harbor from the Hauraki Gulf race course,
about an hour away. ``I tried to set a trap for Prada, and they
walked into it. But when they did I pulled the trigger about three
seconds too early and that put us just over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real shame because with the protest (Saturday) and the
race (Sunday), we've lost our own destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Team Dennis Conner, with its legacy of four Cup wins against
two losses over the years, stayed out of trouble over the weekend,
it would be tied with Prada with five wins _ and a race in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Stars &AMP; Stripes fell to 3-3 while Prada improved to
5-2. With just three races left in these challenger semifinals,
Prada has a virtual lock on one of two finalist berths.
</P>
<P>
   The other spot seems destined to fall to Paul Cayard's
AmericaOne, which got a big jump off the start line Sunday and
cruised away from Dawn Riley's America True for a margin of 1:16.
</P>
<P>
   Riley's team, which showed tremendous promise in the round
robins by beating five other boats, has only been able to score a
point so far, when AmericaOne broke its genoa track and could not
hoist a headsail to finish the race.
</P>
<P>
   France was out of the running Saturday, and the Nippon Challenge
(three points) is a long shot to make the top two, though Japan is
not mathematically eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   As the wind rose to 15 knots across a sultry overcast Hauraki
Gulf, Stars &AMP; Stripes worked every trick to try to close the gap
between its bow and the stern of Italy's silver and red Luna Rossa.
</P>
<P>
   But only an error or breakdown would help Stars &AMP; Stripes, which
made up little ground off the start line. By mark three, 43 seconds
behind, the two were out of race contact with the Italian boat
keeping a loose cover on Stars &AMP; Stripes. Prada won by 1:07.
</P>
<P>
   But Tom Whidden, Stars &AMP; Stripes' senior afterguard member, kept
goading the team. ``Come on guys,'' he was heard saying as Stars &AMP;
Stripes fought up the third beat in strengthening wind. ``We're
making some good gains here. Keep it going.''
</P>
<P>
   But as well as the blue boat from San Diego could sail around
the course, even as its favorite wind range of 15 knots piped
across the gulf, Luna Rossa also sailed fast and loose, keeping a
comfortable lead up the last beat and downwind to the finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted desperately to get to the right,'' said Prada's
tactician, Torben Grael. ``We were lucky when they went over early,
and we just sailed our boat and gained upwind on them and lost
downwind. But it was a good day for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obviously pretty pleased about today,'' said Cayard,
``but we're not assuming anything yet. This is still a regatta. We
haven't won anything.''
</P>
<P>
   With shifting conditions, Cayard said Auckland ``is a place for
good weathermen and good tacticians.''
</P>
<P>
   As Riley was leaving the race course, with the reality of
America True's position setting in, she took a longer view of her
performance at this America's Cup, the first campaign in its
150-year history skippered by a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just tried to sail the best we could, be nice and have
some fun here,'' said Riley. ``Everywhere I go people are so nice
and say how much we've done for women. It puts a tear in my eye.''

</HEADLINE>
 CUP-PROTEST-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ Stars &AMP; Stripes, the low-budget racing
team from San Diego that owes its considerable success at this
America's Cup to experience and savvy, may have been undone by what
even members of the team now term a ``stupid mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We screwed up,'' admitted Tom Whidden, the team's senior
afterguard member and rules expert, after arguing Team Dennis
Conner's position before an arbitration panel looking into the
matter of Stars &AMP; Stripes' use of an illegal rudder.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, after all arguments had been heard, the
international jury stripped Stars &AMP; Stripes of one point in the
challenger semifinal round robin.
</P>
<P>
   Whidden had argued that there was no significant advantage in
Stars &AMP; Stripes using a rudder manufactured in Australia _ a breach
of Cup protocol that requires all appendages (keels, rudders,
canards, etc.) be manufactured in a competitor's own country, or in
New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   That the rudder Stars &AMP; Stripes fitted for the first race of
this round had been designed by an American and built from
materials shipped from the US held no sway with the jury, which
found the protocol language clear and unambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   All parties agree to the fact that the rudder was built in
Australia, a ``very serious breach'' of protocol, according to jury
chairman Bryan Willis, who did say the use of the rudder did not
affect the outcome of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Nippon Challenge, the syndicate that first
protested Stars &AMP; Stripes for use of an illegal rudder in the
series-opening race between the two, now has appealed to the jury
to apply the point taken from Stars &AMP; Stripes to its total.
</P>
<P>
   Other syndicates already have begun to grumble about such a
move, arguing that the penalty assessed Stars &AMP; Stripes would _ if
Nippon were awarded the point _ additionally harm Nippon's other
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   That Stars &AMP; Stripes had the rudder built in Australia to begin
with seems, in retrospect, an innocent blunder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a rudder and that's where we could get one for the
best price and the quickest delivery,'' said helmsman Kenny Read
Saturday night. ``That's the way we do things at Stars &AMP; Stripes.''
</P>
<P>
   Since expulsion from the regatta was a possibility, the jury may
have been swayed by Whidden's simple plea for common sense in not
punishing a campaign that had worked so hard to get where it is and
clearly was not seeking an unfair advantage in committing the
infraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you find against us,'' Whidden told the jury, ``we're
dead.'' And in another statement, he had conceded, ``We're at their
mercy.''

   &UR; RETRANSMITTING TO CORRECT BYLINE Here are Anne Stephenson's
capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``NAT KING COLE'' &QL; 
By Daniel Mark Epstein (FSG, $27) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `The kid was wearing a light green gabardine suit that draped
his long, slender frame so loosely it looked like the first
high-note blast of a trumpet might blow his coat off.'' Nat Cole
was 16 then, shy but bold enough to know how good he was. It's this
image of the young Cole in 1935, about to go up against Earl Hines
in the ``Battle of Rhythm'' in Chicago's Savoy Ballroom that begins
Epstein's biography. Cole died of cancer when he was 45, yet his
story is rich enough for several lives. There were his formative
years in Chicago as what Epstein calls ``a kitten on the keys.''
There were his marriages and infidelities, bad business decisions,
and troubles with the IRS. There was the racial tension that
buffeted his career (in 1956, he was attacked onstage by White
assailants during a performance in Birmingham, Ala.). And there
were Cole's affability and pragmatism, which helped him skirt
racial politics, court a White audience, and make an amazing
crossover from jazz to popular (and frequently schlocky) music.
Epstein creates an engaging portrait of this romantic figure in
American music. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``IN THE GLOAMING'' &QL; 
By Alice Elliott Dark (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $23) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In ``Triage,'' a mother and her adult daughter pursue an uneasy
truce as they jockey for position in each other's lives. In ``The
Tower,'' an aging bachelor falls for a young woman whose background
hints at a very unpleasant surprise. In ``Dreadful Language,'' a
woman moves through youthful rebellion to true love and on to
sorrow and resignation. But the big draw in this story collection
is the title piece, which was published in ``The New Yorker'' in
1994, made into a HBO film starring Glenn Close, and chosen by John
Updike for ``The Best American Short Stories of the Century.'' ``In
the Gloaming'' is a story about conversations _ they take place
always at twilight, the time called ``the gloaming'' _ between a
woman and her 33-year-old son, who is dying of AIDS. With austere
precision, Dark charts the mother's heart as she comes to know both
her son and herself and as she begins to understand that these
daily talks are her dying child's way of returning her love to her.
It's a wonderful story _ moving, understated and as true as the
emotional secrets it unveils.

   ``100 BEST ALBUM COVERS: THE STORIES BEHIND THE SLEEVES'' &QL; 
By Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell (DK, $19.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``At 4 a.m. every morning for a week, three adults and two
children were sprayed silver and gold from head to toe and driven
from the hotel to the location to await a glorious sunrise that
never happened,'' write Thorgerson and Powell. It rained, it was
cold, it was boring, and after the makeup ran out, they had to use
car paint, which they removed with turpentine. In the end, the
adult models were dumped (they used just the naked children, a
brother and sister who had already appeared nude in a Japanese
version of ``Alice in Wonderland'') and the sunrise was faked, but
the album cover for Led Zeppelin's ``Houses of the Holy'' is
memorable enough to appear here, a full 26 years later. Also
included are the stories behind the covers for Santana's
``Abraxas,'' the Grateful Dead's ``Aoxomoxoa,'' Big Brother &AMP; the
Holding Company's ``Cheap Thrills'' and John Lennon and Yoko Ono's
``Two Virgins'' and many more.

``FLU'' &QL; 
By Gina Kolata (FSG, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The flu of 1918 came in two waves. The first showed up in the
spring, bringing its victims chills and fevers but rarely lasting
more than three days. It was, Kolata writes, ``banal, and easily
forgotten.'' In September, however, it came back with a vengeance,
and this time it was a killer that altered countless lives.
Children were orphaned, families were destroyed. Thousands of
people die horribly. More than 25 percent of the United States
population became ill, and between 20 million and 100 million
people died worldwide. If a similar plague were to strike today, it
would kill more people in a single year than heart disease,
cancers, strokes, pulmonary disease, AIDS and Alzheimer's disease
combined. But is this possible? Are authorities prepared to fight
the outbreak of another virus with such mysterious and deadly
power? Kolata, a science writer for the ``New York Times,'' looks
at the history of the 1918 flu and at the lessons it offers for
averting a similar disaster today. It's fascinating but sobering
reading _ if you feel a chill coming on, save it for another day.  &QL;

CELTICS' GRIFFIN OUT AT LEAST 5 GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ Time and again this season, Rick Pitino has
openly wished for more Adrian Griffins. Now, he doesn't have even
one.
</P>
<P>
   The valuable swingman, who sprained his right ankle against the
Bulls in Saturday night's 96-79 fiasco, will be out for a while.
Pitino said Griffin's injury is similar to the one suffered by Paul
Pierce, who missed seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin, who started the first 32 games, will miss at least five
because Pitino said he planned to put him on the injured list and
activate Walter McCarty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably would have waited a little bit longer,'' Pitino
said of McCarty, who has missed the last seven games with a foot
injury. ``But we have no choice right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Griffin could hurt. At 6 feet 5 inches, he was the
team's leading rebounder. In five minutes on Saturday, he had three
rebounds, or as many as 6-9 Antoine Walker had in 35 minutes and
one more than 6-10 Vitaly Potapenko had in 21 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Griffin was one of the team's better defenders and
distributors. He was second on the team in assists and steals and
third in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our leading rebounder, a good playmaker, smart
defensively, makes correct plays,'' Pitino said. ``But injuries are
a part of this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin has been a reluctant shooter all season, which, on this
team, isn't necessarily a bad thing. As Pitino noted, ``He doesn't
look for his shot enough. And I think the other people look for it
a little too much.'' The coach didn't name names.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adrian doesn't get as many shots,'' Pitino added. ``He doesn't
complain about it, he just goes with the flow. It's really not the
defense saying, `He's a pretty good player, so I'll concentrate on
him.' It's more that he doesn't get the ball enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Griffin also means Eric Williams again will return
to the starting lineup. He has started seven times, six of them
when Pierce went down with an ankle sprain. The results were
uneventful; he averaged 7 points a game in 29.3 minutes while
shooting 29.8 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is, however, coming off one of his better scoring games
against Chicago. He had 15 points, his third-highest output of the
season, in 33 minutes Saturday. He was 7 for 11 from the field and
also collected five rebounds, two assists, and two steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of maybe Eric, the entire team should have stayed
home,'' Pitino said of the Chicago disaster. ``It's not like you
can say, this guy didn't play up to his potential. Or this guy
didn't play well. Sometimes, one or two guys have off nights. The
entire team (expletive).''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Anderson says he's at a loss to explain why the team plays
so horribly on the road. ``I don't know what to tell you. It's
rough. It's a tough pill to swallow, but you've got to swallow it.
I guess it's going to be win, lose, win, lose until we get tired of
it. But we've got to keep playing.'' . . . As much as anyone,
Potapenko embodies the dual personality of this team. At home, he
is averaging 10.4 points, 6.4 rebounds, and shooting 54.9 percent
from the field. On the road, he's averaging 6.8 points and 5
rebounds, and shooting 41.7 percent. He's also getting to the line
more at home . . . Pitino on the ``young'' tag that sticks to his
team: ``It's extremely frustrating. Very disappointing. But young
players are inconsistent players. I want to get it to the level
where they're consistent. I hope that day will come so I can
survive mentally and physically myself.'' . . . Walker is shooting
34 for 95 over his last five games, including 4 for 21 in treys . .
. Pierce did not attempt a trey against Chicago for just the second
time this season. He also had no attempts from international waters
against the Spurs on Thanksgiving Eve. Since returning from his
ankle injury, Pierce hasn't been shy. He's averaging 19.3 points a
game but is taking 15.8 shots while shooting 38.8 percent. Before
his injury, he was averaging 19 points a game but was shooting 46
percent and taking one less shot a game . . . The Grizzlies are in
town Monday night, but Pitino says that doesn't mean you can pencil
in a win for the home team. ``We're in the same stage they're in.
Our pencils aren't too sharp if we think that way. We're certainly
going to play very hard, we're very good at home, we have to be
ready for them.'' The Grizzlies already have won at Miami, New
Jersey, and Toronto on this Eastern swing. ``They're very
impressive, believe it or not,'' Pitino said. ``They're very
physical inside. They're very difficult to guard. And if you
double-team them, they find the open man.''

DON'T BE TRICKED ABOUT WHY BILLS WERE DEFEATED 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ All pro football fans will remember the shocking finish
of the Tennessee-Buffalo game Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But let us not forget Wade Phillips's stunning decision to take
Doug Flutie out of the lineup and replace him with Rob Johnson
after Flutie had taken the Bills to the doorstep of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how they want to look at it in Buffalo, it was a bad
decision, and the final score (22-16, Titans) showed it.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson played poorly against one of the worst defenses in the
National Football League. Fans get caught up in the flash of rookie
defensive end Jevon Kearse, but the numbers don't lie. Playing one
of the easiest schedules in the league, the Titans finished 25th in
total defense out of 31 teams, and almost dead last against the
pass.
</P>
<P>
   Playing against a unit that yields 231 yards on average in the
air against poor teams, Johnson threw for 96 net yards. Defend
that.
</P>
<P>
   But worse, with the game scoreless in the first half, he tripped
fading back to pass, and stumbled into the end zone, where he was
sacked for a safety. The Titans' 2-0 lead quickly became 9-0 when
Tennessee ran back the ensuing kickoff 41 yards to set up a
touchdown run by Steve McNair. McNair was no bargain, either. He
threw for 55 net yards, and it was obvious his coaches didn't want
him to throw downfield because they called for few attempts.
</P>
<P>
   It was said last week that Buffalo was benching Flutie because
Johnson could hit the deep pass better and spread out opposing
defenses. Johnson, who went just 10 for 22, completed one pass of
more than 20 yards. So much for throwing the deep ball.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo scored just 16 points even with a very good running
attack. Tennessee's strength on defense is against the run (it
ranks 10th in the league), yet the Bills, with a patchwork
offensive line decimated by injury, ran for 123 net yards and two
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was sacked six times; Flutie doesn't get sacked six
times in a month.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills also made a fatal decision at the end of the game,
after they went ahead on a Steve Christie field goal with 16
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone had to know a trick play was coming on the kick return.
The Titans had no other chance. Yet the Bills ``pooched'' the kick,
Christie executing a lob-type kick to the 20-yard line. If he had
sent the ball deep, there would have been no chance for any trick
play but a reverse, which all the cover men would have been able to
see from a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills left themselves opened to be burned, and they were by
the now-famous ``lateral'' from Frank Wycheck to Kevin Dyson.
</P>
<P>
   In this reporter's humble opinion, it was a forward pass and
could have been ruled illegal.
</P>
<P>
   But it was almost an impossible play for the officials to
overturn.
</P>
<P>
   On kickoffs, the referee is in the end zone behind the returner,
and the field judge and line judge are at the goal line. The rest
of the officials are at the 40.
</P>
<P>
   When Christie's kick came down at the 20, the field judge and
line judge both had to sprint 20 yards to get in position. None of
them was close to being at the 25 when Wycheck threw his overhand
`lateral' from the right hash mark to the left sideline, where
Dyson caught it and then raced 75 yards for the score.
</P>
<P>
   If an official had been standing at the 25 when the play
happened, he might have been more likely to call it a forward pass.
As the play happened, it looked like a forward pass to the naked
eye. The television announcers called it a forward pass right away,
and then started backing off when they saw the replay. But keep in
mind the NFL considers a pass that goes straight sideways a
lateral, and it was close.
</P>
<P>
   If an official had thrown a flag on the play, it would have been
virtually impossible for referee Phil Luckett to overturn his call.
The replay rule in the NFL is that a referee overturns a call only
when he is 100 percent sure the first call was in error.
</P>
<P>
   There was no way after watching the replay to say for sure
whether it was a forward pass or a lateral. Therefore, with no
flags thrown, Luckett had to stick with the way the play finished.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's biggest weakness all year was kickoff coverage. It
killed the Bills Saturday when it shouldn't have, as Tennessee was
ranked last in the NFL in kickoff returns. Why would you be afraid
to kick it deep to the Titans?
</P>
<P>
   It was a terrible loss for the Bills, who played a magnificent
defensive game under a lot of pressure, but a blessing in disguise
for the NFL, because the Bills were so banged up physically in the
game, losing five starters, they probably would have been a soft
touch for the next opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie? He didn't say much about his situation after the game,
but Steve Burton of WBZ-TV reported Flutie was so upset about the
way he was treated, he hoped the Bills would trade him. That will
be hard for the Bills to do because of Flutie's high salary, which,
even if he is traded, will count against Buffalo's salary cap.

HUNDLEY: OUT WITH OLD, IN WITH NEW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Last year, Todd Hundley's throws routinely bounced
into center field or sailed into left. Singles became doubles,
doubles were triples. Running on Hundley was a must.
</P>
<P>
   He took the blame, the criticism and the constant rips that came
his way despite being forced into a situation paved for failure.
Hundley and his surgically repaired elbow weren't ready for the
1999 season, nor was his body ready to be the Los Angeles Dodgers'
catcher.
</P>
<P>
   How the season unfolded proved that.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Dodgers, particularly their minor-leaguers, begin
their winter workouts today at USC, a different Hundley should be
there. He's already in better physical condition than at any point
of last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in the best shape since I've known him,'' Dodgers
strength and conditioning coordinator Todd Clausen said. ``His arm
strength is the best I've seen it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than return to his offseason retreat in New York,
Hundley's been working out near his West coast home in Pasadena.
His motivation should be plenty _ including being in the final year
of the guaranteed portion of his contract _ but pride is foremost.
</P>
<P>
   He threw out only 29 of 123 would-be base stealers, made 16
errors and was benched for an eight-game stretch to work with
bullpen coach Rick Dempsey. And problems also existed offensively.
So shaken was Hundley's confidence that he gave up switch-hitting
and hit exclusively left-handed for the final two months of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, not only did he replace Gold Glover Charles Johnson,
but, in a round-about way, Mike Piazza as well. Hundley didn't come
close to proving himself on either side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've taken last year and put it in a case and buried it,''
Hundley said. '`It happens I've taken what I learned last year and
worked this year. I have more to prove to myself and my teammates
than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Six days a week Hundley and Clausen meet for three hours. Three
days a week Hundley does distance running. Twice a week he runs the
Pasadena hills. ``I hate running, but I've been doing a lot of
running,'' Hundley said. ``Man, there's a lot of hills.''
</P>
<P>
   Ninety minutes of the day are spent weight training. There's
also a throwing program in which Hundley long-tosses and throws at
different intervals, from 90 to 150 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday is a day for rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good, feels like I've been in spring training,''
Hundley said. ``Last year at this time my arm wouldn't allow me to
do what I'm doing now. I had a lot of scar tissue and it was real
tight. The nerve was still dead and didn't allow me to do any of
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad taught me there's nothing better than good
old-fashioned hard work, and I've seen it already with my
throwing.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite only a handful of innings behind the plate last spring
training, Hundley was forced into the starting catcher's spot on
opening day.
</P>
<P>
   It was theorized that anything else would have been a
public-relations nightmare. Already taking enormous hits because of
Chase Carey's ego-induced trade of Piazza, Dodgers general manager
Kevin Malone, on the job for mere months, moved Johnson, a
defensive specialist, for a guy coming off major elbow
reconstruction. Didn't Hundley have to be ready?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't ready,'' Hundley said. ``Bottom line, coming out of
spring training, my thing was getting my legs into playing shape.
Right now, I'mway ahead of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Hundley's workout regimen is geared toward improving his
defense: making his legs stronger, improving his cardiovascular and
strengthening his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, work will begin on his offense. Hundley's 24 homers was
the third-highest total of his career, albeit a far cry from the 71
he hit in his two seasons prior to the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   His defensive perils only masked his struggles at the plate. He
batted a career-low .207, struck out 113 times and had only four
hits from the right side. Shortly, Hundley will spend a few days in
Las Vegas with Dodgers hitting coach Rick Down to work on improving
consistency in his left-handed stroke and to begin work on hitting
from the right side again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so committed. Anything I tell him he's got to do, he does
it,'' Clausen said. ``Todd took it as a challenge. He's going to be
bigger, stronger and faster. Cardiovascular, he's made tremendous
strides.''

USC HOLDS ON FOR WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If there's one thing USC's women's basketball is
missing, it might be a killer instinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of a laid-back team,'' forward Tashara Carter said.
``It's just been our nature because we all get along. Our
personalities are easy-going.''
</P>
<P>
   That might explain how the Trojans nearly blew a 22-point
second-half lead Sunday, before Carter stepped up with some huge
plays in the final two minutes to preserve a 77-66 victory over
Washington at the Lyon Center.
</P>
<P>
   USC had been outscored 16-2 and led 69-66 when Carter hit an
8-foot jumper with 2:15 left. She followed up with a layup and then
blocked a shot to end the Huskies' hopes for a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who finished with 21 points, scored seven of USC's final
eight points.
</P>
<P>
   ``That always seems to be a pattern for us. The other teams step
up and we get tentative in our actions,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by USC coach Chris Gobrecht.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of our problem is we're really kind of soft. When people
come and push back, we tend to reel,'' Gobrecht said. ``They're a
real sweet bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   USC (7-5, 2-0) played its best half of the season, building a
48-31 lead over the Huskies. The advantage grew to 22 points
(55-33) before Washington began chipping away.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about the second half we haven't grasped,''
said forward Danielle Golay, who had 17 points and six rebounds.
``We kind of get down. We kept turning it over and they kept
getting layups.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington freshman Loree Payne keyed the comeback with a
game-high 22 points, but the Huskies (4-10, 0-2) did not score in
the final two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The game was reminiscent of Friday's victory over Washington
State,when USC hit a second-half dry spell but held off the
Cougars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to tell you we are not prone to that but we
are,'' Gobrecht said. ``We can be really good or really bad. We're
not in-between too often.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: It's appearing less and less likely that 6-foot-4
freshman center Portia Mitchell will pass conditioning tests and
join the Trojans this season.... USC players are wearing black arm
bands in memory of administrative assistant Barbara Williams, who
died last week.

DON'T FORGET GIL HODGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no bigger supporter of Tony Perez and his candidacy for
baseball's Hall of Fame than the fellow behind this keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   During the reign of the Big Red Machine, Perez was the quiet
slugger in the middle of a lineup that included two Hall of Famers,
Joe Morgan and Johnny Bench, and that guy with his nose pressed
against the Cooperstown glass, Pete Rose.
</P>
<P>
   In a 14-year span (1967-1980) in which he was virtually
injury-free, he drove in 90 or more runs 12 times, and he wasn't
what you would call a classic home run hitter (two seasons with 30
or more). His career numbers -- .279, 379 home runs, 1,652 RBI --
compare well against those of several Hall of Famers.
</P>
<P>
   But I have to admit that I have my own agenda.
</P>
<P>
   When the writer's votes for the Hall of Fame class of 2000 are
announced Tuesday, I want Perez elected because it would help a
former Dodgers great whose Hall candidacy has been unbelievably
vexed.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Hodges had an 18-year career, all but two seasons as a
Dodger, and finished with a .273 average, 370 home runs and 1,274
RBI. Between 1949 and 1959, the latter year featuring the Dodgers'
first World Series title in Los Angeles, Hodges hit 22 or more home
runs each year and had seven consecutive seasons with 102 or more
RBI. He was widely considered one of the best defensive
first-basemen of his era.
</P>
<P>
   Like Perez, Hodges was the quiet man in a lineup that featured
several Hall of Famers, Pee Wee Reese, Jackie Robinson, Roy
Campanella and Duke Snider. The Duke was forever linked with the
great troika of New York centerfielders, but there's no doubt his
career benefited by being the left-handed bat in front of Hodges in
the Dodgers lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges candidacy has been in the hands of the veteran's
committee, which makes its selections in the spring, since 1984.
There's been no malice toward Hodges by those on the committee,
which over the years has included the late Reese and other
contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   But it's unfathomable that Hodges hasn't been installed when you
look at the circumstances surrounding his 15 years on the Baseball
Writers Association ballot.
</P>
<P>
   In that decade and a half, Hodges received 3,010 votes, the most
of any player on the outside. He received more votes than Reese,
Orlando Cepeda, Richie Ashburn, Nellie Fox, Phil Rizzuto, Hal
Newhouser, Red Schoendienst and Enos Slaughter, contemporaries who
have since been inducted by the veteran's committee.
</P>
<P>
   In 12 straight years (1970-81), he finished between third and
fifth on the writer's ballot, and he received 205 or more votes his
last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   That run is in contrast with 11 veterans committee inductees who
played most of their careers in the pre-WWII era -- Earl Averill,
Earle Combs, Bobby Doerr, Rick Ferrell, Chick Hafey, Jess Haines,
Billy Herman, Waite Hoyt, Ernie Lombardi, Heinie Manush and Lloyd
Waner -- and (set ital) never (end) finished in the top ten in any
year on the writer's ballot.
</P>
<P>
   During his 15 years on the ballot, Hodges was competing against
the greatest group of Hall-bound players since the first years of
the Hall, when voters were choosing between the stars of the dead
ball and Babe Ruth era.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two players were inducted between 1969 and 1983,
including 11 first-ballot inductees -- Stan Musial, Sandy Koufax,
Warren Spahn, Mickey Mantle, Ernie Banks, Willie Mays, Al Kaline,
Bob Gibson, Hank Aaron, Frank Robinson and Brooks Robinson. Others
who made it in that span were Campanella, Snider, Yogi Berra,
Whitey Ford, Robin Roberts, Long Beach's Bob Lemon and Eddie
Mathews.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the odd head-to-head comparisons that just don't
make sense.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges received more votes than Cardinals great Enos Slaughter
on eight straight ballots (1970-77), but Slaughter nudged ahead of
him in 1978 and 1979 and was a veteran's committee pick in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges received more votes than Yankees and Cardinals first
baseman Johnny Mize in four years (1970-73) and Mize never finished
higher than sixth, but he was a vet's committee pick in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Among the players who initially finished behind Hodges in
balloting before passing him and being elected by the writers, you
will find Snider, Don Drysdale, Lemon, Mathews, Roberts and Hoyt
Wilhelm. And every other played who finished in the top five in
balloting between 1969 and 1983 is in the Hall.
</P>
<P>
   When you add Hodges' career as a manager, his omission becomes
even greater. He managed one of the dregs of baseball, the
Washington Senators, for five years and improved the team's
performance each year. He then moved to the Mets and was the
foreman of the 1969 Miracle Mets.
</P>
<P>
   His chorus of support has waned by the passage of time, the
passing of teammates like Reese and Drysdale, and the blase
attitude of some who believe there are already enough Brooklyn-era
Dodgers in the Hall of Fame. But that seems punitive. No one
flinched when players like Combs (Yankees), Haines and Hafey
(Cardinals) were swept into the Hall by the tide of support for the
greatness of their teams.
</P>
<P>
   I have others on my wish list, too.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to see the election of one or two of the closers on the
ballot, like Bruce Sutter and Goose Gossage, because it would cast
a spotlight on the first bonafide closer in baseball history, Firpo
Marberry.
</P>
<P>
   Marberry led the American League in appearances six times during
his 14-year career and saves five times. The saves were retroactive
because the save didn't become an official part of baseball until
the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Marberry went 148-88 in his career with 101 saves, posting a win
or a save in 45 percent of his 551 career appearances. He also
completed 86 of 186 career starts. For comparison sakes, Dennis
Eckersley, who was a starter before becoming a closer, had 197 wins
and 390 saves in 1,071 appearances, or 54 percent, and Eck only led
his league in saves twice.
</P>
<P>
   Marberry, who played in three World Series while playing for the
Senators and Tigers, went 19-12 with 11 saves and a 3.06 ERA in
1929, a year when the average A.L. ERA was 4.24 and hitters
averaged .284.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to see catchers Carlton Fisk and Gary Carter in the
Hall, so a campaign for old-time catcher Wally Schang (.284 career
average) could be jump-started. I'd like to resurrect a campaign
for the greatest thief to ever be a Dodger, Maury Wills, as well as
Long Beach's Bobby Grich, who baseball stat savant Bill James
considers one of the finest players overlooked by the Hall.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, I'll settle for admitting the guy who has a Hall of
Fame record, most votes, but isn't in the Hall of Fame.

   LOS ANGELES -- NBC's medical drama ``ER'' -- a hot prime-time
staple especially in this flu season -- won favorite drama series
for the sixth year in a row at the People's Choice Awards -- the
first Hollywood awards extravaganza of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The 26th annual event, hosted by Don Johnson and Cheech Marin
and broadcast Sunday on CBS from the Pasadena Civic Auditorium,
awarded statuettes in 18 categories including movies, TV and music.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ``Friends'' won favorite TV comedy series while Calista
Flockhart was named favorite female television performer for her
role in Fox's ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``ER'' showed once again its resonance with a wide range of
viewers. This year's poll included the votes of more than
200million American critics, ages 12 and over, randomly selected
from across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask us if it's getting stale,'' said ``ER's'' Anthony
Edwards backstage. ``The bottom line is it's a happy set ... and
the writing is always good.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the loss of series star George Clooney, who left
the show last year, Edwards said: ``The great thing about an
ensemble cast is that it doesn't rely on one character.''
</P>
<P>
   Other winners included ABC's Drew Carey for favorite male TV
performer, Billy Campbell for favorite male performer in a new TV
series for ``Once And Again,'' and Jennifer Love Hewitt was named
best female performer in a new TV series for ``Time of Your Life.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in the history of the awards, online voting
was used to determine the outcome of two categories: favorite new
TV dramatic series, which went to NBC's ``Providence,'' and new TV
comedy series, won by NBC's ``Stark Raving Mad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to say thank you to all the computer nerds,'' said
Steven Levitan, executive producer-creator of ``Stark Raving Mad.''
``I've seen how the Internet can change lives and connect people.''
</P>
<P>
   Flockhart told reporters backstage that the People's Choice
Awards gives her a sense of what the public wants from her show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to know some people are enjoying it,'' Flockhart
said. ``I am pretty emotional about this. It has taken me by
surprise. It comes from the heart and the people, and that makes it
special for me. This definitely is an inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   Flockhart said the audience identifies with ``Ally McBeal''
because ``people see themselves in the characters. They see what
they like about themselves and what they hate about themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Friends'' star David Schwimmer hinted that the series would
continue indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we are having fun and the writing is good, and the
fans are as excited as they've been, we'll be around,'' Schwimmer
said. ``There's a certain chemistry that the six of us have
combined with the writing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the music categories, Latin-pop crooner Ricky Martin was
named best male musical performer, Canadian country star Shania
Twain won for best female musical performer and teen-pop ensemble
the Backstreet Boys were named best musical group or band.
</P>
<P>
   The people spoke about their favorite movies and movie stars,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' won in two categories, best motion picture
and best dramatic motion picture. ``Big Daddy'' won for best comedy
motion picture, and its star Adam Sandler was named best motion
picture star in a comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, perennial favorite Harrison Ford took home a
statuette for best motion picture actor. Last year, Ford was named
all-time favorite motion picture star at the 25th anniversary
People's Choice Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very gratifying,'' a soft-spoken Ford said backstage.
``The films that I do are successful, and given that I make films,
I do not expect to be commercially successful. I'm especially
gratified that people allow me to have so much freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixth Sense'' star Bruce Willis was voted best motion picture
star in a drama while Julia Roberts, who starred in ``Notting
Hill,'' won for best motion picture actress.

GORE, BUSH FACE TROUBLE STAYING AHEAD
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  WASHINGTON _ The breathless accounts from the field make
campaign 2000 sound like a good old-fashioned barn burner.
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain are neck
and neck in New Hampshire. Vice President Al Gore and former New
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley are in a pitched battle of their own.
</P>
<P>
   With voting set to begin in Iowa in two weeks and New Hampshire
to follow eight days later, observers say it is the most wide-open
presidential contest in 40 years. Campaign aides can spin out
countless scenarios to make it look like their guy is sure to win.
</P>
<P>
   But as the presidential marathon evolves into a sprint, the
story line remains simple: Gore is the overwhelming favorite to win
the Democratic nomination, and Bush is the overwhelming favorite in
the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't changed after more than a year of campaigning. What
is different is the credibility given to the challengers and the
vulnerability associated with the front-runners. Gore and Bush have
each had trouble maintaining enthusiasm among their supporters.
Bradley and McCain, meanwhile, each have raised substantial sums of
money and, playing on their insurgent appeal, have pulled into the
lead in New Hampshire polls.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans have just begun to tune into a race that already
has seen three credible candidates drop out and tens of millions of
dollars spent. But the whirl of activity in Iowa and New Hampshire
_ frequent rallies, back-to-back political commercials, nightly
candidate debates _ soon will spread to dozens of states.
</P>
<P>
   In the 43 days between the Iowa caucus (January 24) and to &LR;   &LR; the
California primary (March 7), 27 states will hold caucuses or
primaries, and about half of the delegates to the nominating
conventions will be selected. It is hard to imagine a scenario in
which the contests are not decided by mid-March, and it could end
many weeks sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a look at the state of the campaign in the final weeks
before the first ballots are cast.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the vice president looked invincible within his own
party. A lineup of potential challengers, including Minnesota Sen.
Paul Wellstone, Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey and the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, decided not to enter the race, and the entire Democratic
Party establishment lined up on Gore's side.
</P>
<P>
   But his campaign stumbled after a series of miscues. His stump
speech left supporters uninspired. His campaign bled money to
high-priced consultants like author Naomi Wolfe, who helped advise
Gore on how to come across as an ``alpha male.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bradley appealed to the party's liberal base _ with positions
on gun control, health care and campaign finance reform _ Gore
watched his double-digit lead evaporate in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has raised nearly as much money as Gore (about $26
million) and has spent less, giving him more money for the final
push. And despite an 18-year career as a senator, Bradley has
positioned himself as a straight-talking Washington outsider
battling the entrenched powers whose support Gore has monopolized.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hear you talk, Al, it reminds me of a Washington
bunker. And I think you're in a Washington bunker,'' Bradley said
last week at a debate in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I can understand why you're in a bunker,'' he said. ``I
mean, there was Gingrich. There were the fund-raising scandals.
There was the impeachment problem. And I think that the major
objective in the last several years in the White House has been
political survival. I understand that. But the reality is, the
Democratic Party shouldn't be in the Washington bunker with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has fought back by distancing himself from President
Clinton, moving his campaign headquarters from Washington to
Tennessee and telling anyone who will listen that he is better
equipped to roll up his sleeves and carry out the Democratic
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidency is not an academic exercise,'' Gore said in the
same debate. ``It's not an extended seminar on theory. It has to be
a daily fight for the best interests of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the New Hampshire race is tight, Gore leads Bradley
nationwide by nearly a 2-to-1 margin. And although the vice
president has less cash on hand, he does have some institutional
advantages.
</P>
<P>
   It takes 2,169 delegates to clinch the Democratic nomination,
about 800 of whom are party leaders and members of Congress known
as super delegates. Gore already has endorsements from 500 of those
super delegates. This means Bradley needs to win nearly 60 percent
of delegates in caucuses and primaries to capture the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   California might prove pivotal in the Democratic race. After the
New Hampshire primary Feb. 1, Democrats have no further contests
until March 7, when California (where Gore leads), New York (where
Bradley leads), and 13 other states hold votes.
</P>
<P>
   A Bradley victory in New Hampshire and California might
neutralize Gore's institutional advantages and make a race of it. A
Gore victory in New Hampshire could mortally wound Bradley's hopes,
and a Gore victory in California would make it difficult for
Bradley to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   REPUBLICANS
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has insisted all along that its bubble of
popularity wouldn't last forever. After raising a record $70
million and building a huge lead in the polls, Bush watched as John
McCain surged ahead in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bradley, McCain has played upon his credibility and his
maverick stances on issues such as campaign finance reform to
promote himself as a political outsider, despite an 18-year career
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   His accessibility and bluntness with reporters has made him a
hit with the media, earning him a lot of favorable press and making
him popular with New Hampshire voters who cherish a hands-on
relationship with candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The big question for McCain is what will happen if he wins New
Hampshire. The campaign readily admits that it cannot compete with
Bush's resources and national organization.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing an embarrassing defeat in Iowa, McCain chose not to
compete there. But his campaign hopes early victories in New
Hampshire (February 1), South Carolina (February 19) and Arizona
(February 22) will reshuffle a race built on the presumption that
Bush is the party's most electable candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If John McCain breaks out, he's going to ride a news media
tidal wave all the way to California,'' said Dan Schnur, his
communications director. ``This is going to be the ultimate test of
message and momentum versus organization and endorsements.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp says even a series of McCain victories could not
derail its grip on the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to be a candidate of a national party, you have to
be able to demonstrate you are capable of winning everywhere,''
said Carl Rove, Bush's chief strategist.
</P>
<P>
   And so Bush has organizations in 50 states, the District of
Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam and American Samoa.
In California, where McCain has a couple of staffers, Bush already
has divided the state into 18 districts and named chairs and
co-chairs for each. Their headquarters in Los Angeles soon will be
augmented by another in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, McCain's aides admit that if he does not win in New
Hampshire and South Carolina, the campaign will be over.
</P>
<P>
   But there can be no doubt that the race has tightened. When Bushmade his first trip to New Hampshire in June, he took off the first
Sunday, saying he refused to campaign seven days a week and that he
needed to preserve one day for family and rest.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sunday, Bush had two stops on his schedule, including a
youth forum in Manchester and a campaign dinner in Durham.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican field also includes millionaire magazine
publisher Steve Forbes, Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, conservative
activist Gary Bauer and former Reagan administration official Alan
Keyes. Although Forbes has been running for president since 1994 _
and by some estimates has spent close to $100 million of his own
money _ none has shown any base of support in the polls.

 GOODBYE WILLIE, HELLO WILLIE  &HT;     By SCOT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The new mayor used his inauguration Saturday as
a pulpit to bad-mouth the old mayor, and that's just bad
sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Especially since the old mayor is stashed away somewhere and
isn't available to defend himself against the criticism, direct or
implied.
</P>
<P>
   The old mayor, Willie the First, dropped out of sight about two
months ago. The new mayor, Willie da Sequel, has been slinging mud
at his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new administration,'' the new mayor said Saturday.
``This administration intends to be inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheap shot. The last major did his best, given his limitations.
Willie the First had obligations, he had to spend his entire term
doing favors for friends and people who helped him get elected, so
he didn't always have time to reach out to the little people.
</P>
<P>
   The new mayor is determined to do better. He pledges cleaner
streets and says he'll launch a dialogue on homelessness with civic
leaders. Again, the implication: The last guy should have done more
of this stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The last mayor did have his shortcomings, but I'm going to kind
of miss him. Old Willie Brown had a sense of humor and a flamboyant
presence that the new mayor lacks.
</P>
<P>
   Old Willie loved a party. He put up circus tents for his
inauguration festivities. He danced on tables. Willie da Sequel, to
celebrate his inauguration, greeted folks in his office.  &UR; Care &LR; 
 &UR; for a hard candy and a cup of water? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The old mayor took random potshots at everyone; the new mayor
takes cheap shots only at the old mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The old mayor made wild promises that lifted our spirits, gave
us specific time lines for important fixes. The new mayor laughs at
such folly.
</P>
<P>
   I miss the old guy. Free Willie.
</P>
<P>
   THE EXAMINER won't go down without a fight from the new Willie.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Brown wants to form a committee that would form a
committee to buy the Examiner before it merges itself out of
existence.
</P>
<P>
   Brown called the Examiner ``a civic treasure,'' but he stopped
short of the next logical suggestion, which would be to bury the
Examiner on Treasure Island.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor is exactly right. With only one newspaper in town,
there is a potential for monopoly of thought, for ignoring
important segments of the population, for squelching lively debate,
for catering to special interests, for shamelessly cashing in on
its monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   A one-newspaper town, then, is exactly like a one-mayor town.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T WORRY, Willie, the Examiner is good for at least a couple
more years. I'm pretty sure I saw Butterfly setting up camp on the
top ledge of the Examiner building on Fifth Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``People, we can't let corporate greed cut down this ancient
building,'' Butterfly seemed to be saying. ``Even though to some,
this newspaper seems to serve no useful purpose, we need to
remember that it does carry `Dilbert.' ''
</P>
<P>
   MORE COMPASSION, that's what D.A. Terence Hallinan pledges for
his new term.
</P>
<P>
   He said at his swearing-in, ``I will not be swayed by those who
would have us turn back the clock to a revolving door of
incarceration and lock-'em-up, throw-away-the-key approach to
nonviolent offenders.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallinan is really bucking the popular tide there, because as I
move about the city, the complaint I hear most is, ``Why can't we
lock up nonviolent offenders and throw away the key?''
</P>
<P>
   Many people want to turn back the clock to the old system, where
you would get life in prison if you even moved a few steps into the
crosswalk against the light. Remember that program _ ``Three steps
and you're out''?
</P>
<P>
   GETTING BACK to the old Willie Brown: His critics say he was too
arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   The two problems with that sentiment are:
</P>
<P>
   1. It can be construed as racist.
</P>
<P>
   2. Who cares?
</P>
<P>
   Arrogance in the pursuit of excellence is no vice. Using it to
hide shortcomings is a different matter.
</P>
<P>
   Positive arrogance is what I think of as the Oakland Attitude.
Oakland athletic teams achieved much greatness while exhibiting a
noted shortage of humility, and it was fun to be around.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Jackson, Jose Canseco, Rickey Henderson, Dennis
Eckersley, Billy Martin, John Matuszak, Lester Hayes, Al Davis,
Kenny Stabler, Rick Barry ... Arrogance Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Those guys and their teams used their own arrogance like a
locomotive uses coal.
</P>
<P>
   Arrogance is not a necessary component of success. The 49ers
always had a certain smugness that grated on opponents, but
generally it stopped short of flamboyant arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   But if arrogance works ...
</P>
<P>
   MAYBE WILLIE the Humble, once he saves the Examiner, can put
together a committee to save the equally doomed 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody really owns the team, the front office is floundering,
the two star players have, possibly, played their last 49er games,
and the team will definitely get a new stadium, but probably not in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   This would never happen if Willie Brown were around.

   Politics in the New Russian Style &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, perhaps even more than in New Hampshire, politics is
currently everything, and its exemplar is Acting President Vladimir
Putin. He campaigned throughout the week as if he were not the
runaway favorite in presidential elections now scheduled for March
26; he proclaimed tighter foreign currency controls, summoned
parliamentary leaders for a strategy session and, at one point, let
his close-cropped hair down in a nationally broadcast television
interview about what it was like to replace Boris Yeltsin in the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   His principal rival, former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
remained stoic, refusing to say whether he would run for president
as he had indicated he would last month, before Yeltsin resigned
and gave Putin an almost unbeatable head start.
</P>
<P>
   The one cloud on Putin's horizon was a black one indeed: The war
in Chechnya, until now a Russian cakewalk, became pitched. Urban
warfare around Chechnya's capital, Grozny, proved so tough for the
attacking Russians that offensive operations were suspended and the
top command was shuffled.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, meanwhile, seemed only semiretired: visiting Israel to
observe Christmas, he was treated everywhere like a revered head of
state, and seemed to relish it. His spokesman said he was not
Russia's former president, but its first one. Yeltsin underscored
that: ``I haven't retired yet,'' he said, in what may or may not
have been a joke.

   Fighting Sticker Shock
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1990s, top-ranked colleges and universities
across the United States watched their endowments skyrocket along
with the stock market. Still, the cost of attending them kept
climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Now one such college, Williams, has decided not to raise
tuition, room, board or fees _ which total $31,520 annually, about
half the institution's actual cost _ in the next academic year. For
Williams, a 2,000-student campus in western Massachusetts, it is
the first halt in increases since 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Such highly selective institutions operate in a fiercely
competitive environment, and experts predict that others will
follow suit. One criticism of these institutions has been that they
were reluctant to free up money from their rapidly expanding
endowments to hold down costs to students; that, in fact, is the
course Williams now plans to take. Even as tuition and fees
increased 50 percent there, from $20,760, since 1990, the endowment
was tripling, from $333 million to more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is hardly the only institution in such a situation:
Harvard, the leader, has an endowment near $14 billion _ and a
current sticker price of $34,682.

   Another 4-Year Term For Greenspan
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton nominated Alan Greenspan to a fourth term as
chairman of the Federal Reserve, joining Wall Street, economists
and politicians from both parties in crediting him with deftly
nurturing the nation's long run of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's reappointment insured some continuity in economic
policy as Democrats and Republicans fight for control of the White
House and Congress. With the economy steaming along at a
potentially inflationary pace, it also removed the possibility that
Greenspan might feel under pressure to hold off on raising interest
rates in order to ensure he could keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   Investors saw Greenspan's renomination as confirmation of their
fears that the Fed will raise rates aggressively this year,
providing further reason for them to cash in the big profits from
last year's runup in equity prices. Stocks tumbled through much of
the week, led by some of those technology-company high fliers,
before appearing to stabilize.

   Bush and Gore Get Key Endorsements
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George Bush got an enthusiastic endorsement from a
former rival for the Republican presidential nomination, Elizabeth
Dole, and spent his first full day back on the campaign trail in
the new year showcasing Mrs. Dole and hoping that she would bring
over women and independents to help him beat back Sen. John McCain
in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic race, Vice President Al Gore won the backing
of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Washington's reigning
liberal. The Gore campaign was looking for Kennedy to provide a
boost in the Northeast, where support for Gore's rival, former Sen.
Bill Bradley, is the strongest.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of the insurgent McCain and Bradley campaigns was
identical: They said the endorsements showed their rivals were
creatures of the establishment.

currently everything, and its exemplar is Acting President Vladimir
Putin. He campaigned throughout the week as if he were not the
runaway favorite in presidential elections now scheduled for March
26; he proclaimed tighter foreign currency controls, summoned
parliamentary leaders for a strategy session and, at one point, let
his close-cropped hair down in a nationally broadcast television
interview about what it was like to replace Boris Yeltsin in the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   His principal rival, former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
remained stoic, refusing to say whether he would run for president
as he had indicated he would last month, before Yeltsin resigned
and gave Putin an almost unbeatable head start.
</P>
<P>
   The one cloud on Putin's horizon was a black one indeed: The war
in Chechnya, until now a Russian cakewalk, became pitched. Urban
warfare around Chechnya's capital, Grozny, proved so tough for the
attacking Russians that offensive operations were suspended and the
top command was shuffled.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, meanwhile, seemed only semiretired: visiting Israel to
observe Christmas, he was treated everywhere like a revered head of
state, and seemed to relish it. His spokesman said he was not
Russia's former president, but its first one. Yeltsin underscored
that: ``I haven't retired yet,'' he said, in what may or may not
have been a joke.

   Fighting Sticker Shock
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1990s, top-ranked colleges and universities
across the United States watched their endowments skyrocket along
with the stock market. Still, the cost of attending them kept
climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Now one such college, Williams, has decided not to raise
tuition, room, board or fees _ which total $31,520 annually, about
half the institution's actual cost _ in the next academic year. For
Williams, a 2,000-student campus in western Massachusetts, it is
the first halt in increases since 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Such highly selective institutions operate in a fiercely
competitive environment, and experts predict that others will
follow suit. One criticism of these institutions has been that they
were reluctant to free up money from their rapidly expanding
endowments to hold down costs to students; that, in fact, is the
course Williams now plans to take. Even as tuition and fees
increased 50 percent there, from $20,760, since 1990, the endowment
was tripling, from $333 million to more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is hardly the only institution in such a situation:
Harvard, the leader, has an endowment near $14 billion _ and a
current sticker price of $34,682.

   Another 4-Year Term For Greenspan
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton nominated Alan Greenspan to a fourth term as
chairman of the Federal Reserve, joining Wall Street, economists
and politicians from both parties in crediting him with deftly
nurturing the nation's long run of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's reappointment insured some continuity in economic
policy as Democrats and Republicans fight for control of the White
House and Congress. With the economy steaming along at a
potentially inflationary pace, it also removed the possibility that
Greenspan might feel under pressure to hold off on raising interest
rates in order to ensure he could keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   Investors saw Greenspan's renomination as confirmation of their
fears that the Fed will raise rates aggressively this year,
providing further reason for them to cash in the big profits from
last year's runup in equity prices. Stocks tumbled through much of
the week, led by some of those technology-company high fliers,
before appearing to stabilize.

   Bush and Gore Get Key Endorsements
</P>

   Texas Gov. George Bush got an enthusiastic endorsement from a
former rival for the Republican presidential nomination, Elizabeth
Dole, and spent his first full day back on the campaign trail in
the new year showcasing Mrs. Dole and hoping that she would bring

in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   In the Democratic race, Vice President Al Gore won the backing
of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Washington's reigning
liberal. The Gore campaign was looking for Kennedy to provide a
boost in the Northeast, where support for Gore's rival, former Sen.
Bill Bradley, is the strongest.

<P>
   The immediate spark, not that it matters after so many years,
was a series of misunderstandings. One evening, hours after a
prison guard mistakenly thought they had been fighting, two inmates
were taken from their cells for punishment. A rumor, no more true
than the phantom fight, spread through the cellblock that both had
been beaten.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the whole thing was pretty silly. The consequences
were anything but.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, on Sept. 9, 1971, angry inmates at the Attica
Correctional Facility, 30 miles east of Buffalo, N.Y., rioted. They
seized control of an exercise yard and took guards as hostages.
Thus began a chain of often-bizarre events that produced the worst
prison insurrection in U.S. history, indeed the bloodiest single
clash between Americans since street riots in New York City a
century earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, 43 people died at Attica, nearly all _ inmates and
hostages alike _ when state troopers stormed the prison Sept. 13
and fired indiscriminately through a thick haze of tear gas. It
was, a state investigating commission would later conclude, an
assault both ill-conceived and poorly executed, leading to needless
loss of life. One disenchanted state prosecutor ended up calling it
``a turkey shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   As if the mass death were not shocking enough, officials at
first lied about what had happened. They said inmates had killed
the hostages, slitting their throats and castrating them. None of
that was true, as autopsies showed the next day. Arguably worse,
troopers and Attica guards resorted to brutal reprisals. They
forced inmates to strip and crawl over broken glass. One man had a
screwdriver repeatedly shoved into his rectum. Another, forced to
lie naked for hours with a football propped under his chin, was
warned that if he let the ball drop, he would be killed or
castrated.
</P>
<P>
   Why rehash those events now? Because the demons of Attica have
never been exorcised. Memories of them may have faded, but their
shadows are felt just the same.
</P>
<P>
   They were back last week when a federal judge in Rochester
announced a settlement that may at last bring finality to Attica's
painful aftermath. Under the deal, the state will pay $8 million to
inmates who were beaten and tortured, plus $4 million for lawyers'
fees. ``We have all suffered,'' said the judge, Michael A. Telesca.
``The end is in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Some who lived through the 1971 debacle _ inmates,
guards, officials, lawyers, reporters _ wonder.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to exaggerate the body blows that some American
institutions endured. The seemingly endless war in Vietnam had
already taken its toll by 1971. A year earlier, National Guardsmen
in Ohio had opened fire on Kent State students, killing four of
them. Now, at Attica, more than three dozen people were shot dead
within minutes in the name of the state _ and officialdom's first
instinct was to not tell the truth about it.
</P>
<P>
   There was, for many, a queasy feeling that government might be
capable of just about anything. Nor did the news media emerge
looking good. Tales of inmates' atrocities were reported as fact.
There was not nearly adequate attribution to officials who were
spreading the lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little like the Vietnam war coming home,'' recalls
Robert Gangi, executive director of the Correctional Association of
New York, a prison monitoring group. ``You had a brutal application
of government power and then the sheer audacity of government
cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
   For a sense of how deep the cynicism ran, catch ``Dog Day
Afternoon'' the next time it is on television. In that 1975 film,
Al Pacino, playing a loser who takes hostages after a botched bank
robbery, whips up a street crowd to pressure the New York police to
hold their fire. He does it by rhythmically chanting, ``At-ti-ca,
At-ti-ca, At-ti-ca.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet good came out of the 1971 siege. This is separate from
the political good it probably did New York's Republican governor,
Nelson Rockefeller, who ordered troopers to storm the prison. That
action, and tough drug laws that he promoted two years later,
helped make the relatively liberal Rockefeller more palatable to
conservatives. By coincidence or not, President Gerald R. Ford,
invoking the 25th Amendment, named him vice president in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Attica's broader good was that the public could no longer ignore
awful prison conditions. The initial rioting did not really result
from minor misunderstandings. Attica, like other prisons, was
seething because of overcrowding, bad food and medical care, rigid
censorship and meager visiting rights. True, loopy radical demands
were made during the riot, symptomatic of the times; the
authorities were hardly about to provide transportation to a
``nonimperialist'' third world country. But the anger stemmed from
basic conditions, like rules limiting inmates to one shower a week
and one roll of toilet paper a month.
</P>
<P>
   In the years that followed, the situation improved. In New York,
special agencies kept an eye on prison operations. For a while,
some newspapers covered prisons as a regular beat. A new
state-financed group, Prisoners' Legal Services, gave inmates a
voice in court. In time, as the state and the country shifted to
the right, such efforts were ridiculed as whining on behalf of
killers and rapists wanting color TV and pepperoni pizza. But Legal
Services has never had a lawsuit tossed out for being frivolous.
</P>
<P>
   Until Attica, ``a lot of people didn't see the way that
prisoners were dehumanized to no constructive end,'' said David
Leven, who was Legal Services' executive director for years.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, time dulled Attica's shock effect. A ``lock 'em up
and throw away the key'' attitude has sent the prison population
skyrocketing. And rehabilitation is rarely mentioned in political
discourse. Nationwide, there were 198,000 people in federal and
state prisons at the time of Attica. In mid-1998, the figure was
1.2 million, not including 600,000 more held in local jails. The
New York state prison population today is approaching 72,000,
compared with 12,500 in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, aside from advocates like Gangi, you don't hear much about
prisons these days, and even in last week's settlement the state
acknowledged no guilt. Here and there, there has been a prison
riot, but nothing comparable to 1971. It may be that Attica's most
enduring legacy was to make everyone starkly aware of the
terrifying possibilities should there ever be a fire next time.

There was not nearly adequate attribution to officials who were
spreading the lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little like the Vietnam war coming home,'' recalls
Robert Gangi, executive director of the Correctional Association of
New York, a prison monitoring group. ``You had a brutal application
of government power and then the sheer audacity of government
cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
   For a sense of how deep the cynicism ran, catch ``Dog Day
Afternoon'' the next time it is on television. In that 1975 film,
Al Pacino, playing a loser who takes hostages after a botched bank
robbery, whips up a street crowd to pressure the New York police to
hold their fire. He does it by rhythmically chanting, ``At-ti-ca,
At-ti-ca, At-ti-ca.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet good came out of the 1971 siege. This is separate from
the political good it probably did New York's Republican governor,
Nelson Rockefeller, who ordered troopers to storm the prison. That
action, and tough drug laws that he promoted two years later,
helped make the relatively liberal Rockefeller more palatable to
conservatives. By coincidence or not, President Gerald R. Ford,
invoking the 25th Amendment, named him vice president in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Attica's broader good was that the public could no longer ignore
awful prison conditions. The initial rioting did not really result
from minor misunderstandings. Attica, like other prisons, was
seething because of overcrowding, bad food and medical care, rigid
censorship and meager visiting rights. True, loopy radical demands
were made during the riot, symptomatic of the times; the
authorities were hardly about to provide transportation to a
``nonimperialist'' third world country. But the anger stemmed from
basic conditions, like rules limiting inmates to one shower a week
and one roll of toilet paper a month.
</P>
<P>
   In the years that followed, the situation improved. In New York,
special agencies kept an eye on prison operations. For a while,
some newspapers covered prisons as a regular beat. A new
state-financed group, Prisoners' Legal Services, gave inmates a
voice in court. In time, as the state and the country shifted to
the right, such efforts were ridiculed as whining on behalf of
killers and rapists wanting color TV and pepperoni pizza. But Legal
Services has never had a lawsuit tossed out for being frivolous.
</P>
<P>
   Until Attica, ``a lot of people didn't see the way that
prisoners were dehumanized to no constructive end,'' said David
Leven, who was Legal Services' executive director for years.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, time dulled Attica's shock effect. A ``lock 'em up
and throw away the key'' attitude has sent the prison population
skyrocketing. And rehabilitation is rarely mentioned in political
discourse. Nationwide, there were 198,000 people in federal and
state prisons at the time of Attica. In mid-1998, the figure was
1.2 million, not including 600,000 more held in local jails. The
New York state prison population today is approaching 72,000,
compared with 12,500 in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, aside from advocates like Gangi, you don't hear much about
prisons these days, and even in last week's settlement the state
acknowledged no guilt. Here and there, there has been a prison
riot, but nothing comparable to 1971. It may be that Attica's most
enduring legacy was to make everyone starkly aware of the
terrifying possibilities should there ever be a fire next time.

   OSLO, Norway _ To the untrained observer, Swedes and Norwegians
(aka the Olsons and the Olsens) may seem interchangeable. Both are
prosperous, blue-eyed and reserved. On the world stage, they hand
out peace prizes and preach global cooperation while saving their
aggressions, if any, for the ski slope.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the privacy of their snowbound peninsula, Sweden and
Norway have lately resembled ``two blind men slugging it out on a
highway,'' in the words of a Danish commentator.
</P>
<P>
   Officially the countries are having a business disagreement. A
$50 billion merger between the Swedish and Norwegian state-owned
telecommunications companies has unraveled. Unofficially, this
telephone tiff has exposed a dark current of national chauvinism
and aggression _ just the sort of thing the new age of globalism is
said to be rendering obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, a Swedish government minister derided Norway as
``the last Soviet state.'' Top Norwegian officials called the
Swedes liars and questioned whether they could read. The chief
executive of the briefly merged company even shoved a radio
journalist to the sidewalk and kicked him in the back, explaining
later, by form of apology, ``He looked like a drug addict.''
</P>
<P>
   Tension between Sweden and Norway is traditionally defused by
low humor. When a Swedish newspaper columnist denounced Norway over
the fiasco, a Norwegian retorted in print, ``I hope you gain 12
kilos during Christmas and grow a wart on your nose.'' But it
didn't work this time. Millennium's end had been soured by the
re-enactment of painful colonial-era dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegians believed that each side in the enterprise was to have
equal say in strategic matters. So when a dubious double vote by
the Swedish board chairman made cosmopolitan Stockholm rather than
rustic Oslo the headquarters of the all-important cellular
telephony division, Norwegians felt betrayed. They suffered a
collective flashback to a century ago, when Sweden's King Oscar
repeatedly used his veto power to humiliate the provincial
Norwegian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the cell phone grab was cheered in Stockholm, where
the tabloid Expressen headlined its cover story, ``Ha, ha,
Norway!''
</P>
<P>
   In Oslo, the normally fractious Parliament erupted as one to
demand that Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik dynamite the
merger, which he did. It was not clear how that helped Norwegian
telephone customers or the development of Norwegian technology, but
as a battle tactic it had precedent. Twice in earlier centuries,
residents of the Norwegian border town of Halden burned their city
to the ground to drive out the Swedes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 94 years after breaking free of imperial Sweden and 30
years after striking oil in the North Sea, Norway, whose mostly
rural population of 4.4 million is half that of more urbanized
Sweden's, continues to savor independence and to search for its own
identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norway still defines itself in terms of its relationship to
Sweden,'' said the Norwegian author Tor Bomann-Larsen. ``To be free
and independent means to be rid of the Swedes.''
</P>
<P>
   In daily life the rivalry is usually good-natured. Norwegians
love to shop in Swedish stores while Swedes seek serenity in the
mountains of Norway. According to Aake Daun, an ethnologist at the
University of Stockholm, Swedes see Norwegians as ``healthy and
honest, reliable and sporty,'' though not usually business-partner
material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swedes think unreflectively that Sweden is the biggest and
most advanced and most creative of the Scandinavian countries,''
Professor Daun said. ``When they talk to Norwegians about how
things are done in Sweden, it is like a schoolteacher telling how
things are done in the grown-up world.''
</P>
<P>
   Norway's development of vast offshore oil reserves has boosted
its social stock, but most Swedes consider Volvo, Electrolux and
other big Swedish manufacturing companies more worthy of esteem. To
them it was a no-brainer to locate the proposed bi-national mobile
phone service in Stockholm, where the mobile-phone giant Ericsson
would provide synergy.
</P>
<P>
   Norway blames Swedish arrogance rather than Norwegian
nationalism for destroying what could have been a global showcase
for Scandinavia's vaunted wireless technology. But the boundary
between it and the Swedes is now also the fault line of the
burgeoning European Union. Twice Norwegians have rejected EU
membership against sound business advice, and their isolation from
Europe is deepening.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Norman, a Norwegian economist, said the telecom nightmare
could send Norway further into its shell while Sweden turns to
another former colony, Finland, for a telecom partner. If that
merger succeeds it might be deserving of the Nobel Peace Prize.

MCCAIN TAX PLAN STRESSES THOSE IN LOWEST BRACKET
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fighting to build on his popularity among New
Hampshire's Republican voters, Senator John McCain will unveil an
expanded tax plan Tuesday that would increase the number of
taxpayers in the lowest, or 15 percent, tax bracket if there is
additional economic growth and a larger-than-projected budget
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's tax policy address at the Concord Chamber of Commerce
comes as he and Texas Governor George W. Bush have clashed
repeatedly in recent days over who has the better economic
prescription for the nation. While Bush has proposed the larger tax
cut _ $473 billion compared to McCain's $250 billion over five
years _ McCain would put more of the nation's budget surplus toward
shoring up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, the subject of taxes has long been a
touchstone for many voters. The state has no income tax, and even
the governor, a Democrat, has spent the last few years staving off
some members of her own party who would like to institute one.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the New Hampshire Republican Party, I think there's a
pretty strong sentiment that the government that governs least,
governs best,'' said Will Abbott of Holderness, N.H., who served as
political director to Bush's father in 1988. ``And that means that
the lower the taxes, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides arguing over the amount of money that should be set
aside for Social Security, McCain and Bush have also taken opposite
approaches toward flattening the current tax structure. McCain
focuses on vastly increasing the number of people paying the lowest
tax rate by reducing the numbers now in the 28 percent bracket;
Bush, on the other hand, would eliminate the top tax bracket of
39.6 percent for the wealthiest earners, and he would cut the 15
percent bracket to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters like tax cuts and they always will and they always
should,'' said Dan Schnur, a spokesman for McCain. ``But long-term
economic security is just as important. We're providing both.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign, however, views the Arizona senator's tax
proposal as inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how you cut it, people will pay more in taxes under
Senator McCain's plan than they will under Governor Bush's plan,''
said Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman. ``Like Al Gore, Senator
McCain has said Governor Bush's tax plan is too big, which means
people will pay more in taxes under Senator McCain than Governor
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's latest tax proposal would increase the tax deduction
for children from $500 to $1,000, the same as Bush's plan; create a
new tax deduction for the cost of long-term health care insurance;
and provide a package of new savings incentives and plans similar
to the existing 401k plan.
</P>
<P>
   But most important, McCain would expand his tax cut beyond $250
billion, assuming the Congressional Budget Office produces a more
favorable economic forecast. Bush has already used rosier economic
assumptions in his plan.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, McCain first proposed allowing 25 million more people
to qualify for the lowest tax bracket. Couples earning $70,000 a
year would qualify, compared to the current $43,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also said he would eliminate the tax penalty for married
couples; eliminate the inheritance tax on estates valued under $5
million; and eliminate the earnings test for senior citizens who
lose some Social Security payments when they begin to earn more
than $20,000 annually. All of these positions are similar to
Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of taxes will probably define the continued debate
between Bush and McCain during the last three weeks before the
primary. Bush is already broadcasting television commercials about
his plan, and McCain is set to begin doing so shortly. He is
running ads about protecting Social Security for seniors in the
coming years as the number of people drawing on the trust fund
exceeds the number paying into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taxes are the eternal issue in Republican primaries,'' said
Darryl West, a political science professor at Brown University.
``There's hardly been an election over the last 20 years where
taxes have not figured prominently.''
</P>
<P>
   But West said there is no survey evidence from the last year to
show that voters care about the size of a tax cut. Instead, he
said, national polling data show voters care more about Social
Security, health care and education than a massive tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of Social Security, it is McCain who would devote
62 percent of the non-Social Security surplus to shoring up the
program. That comes to about $700 billion over 10 years, according
to his aides. Bush, on the other hand, would set aside the existing
payroll taxes already tagged for Social Security, but not any of
the non-Social Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bush uses most of the non-Social Security surplus for
his tax cut. McCain, on the other hand, would use just 23 percent
for reducing taxes. He would also take 10 percent of the surplus
for reinforcing the Medicare program, and 5 percent for lowering
the national debt, which now totals more than $5 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign officials insisted Sunday that the senator's
expanded tax proposal is not a reaction to Bush's focus on tax
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We laid out a schedule for a series of policy speeches early
this fall,'' said Schnur. ``Our original intention from the
beginning was to schedule those speeches for December and January
when the largest possible number of voters would be paying
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Dec. 1, McCain has delivered policy addresses on
foreign policy, defense, health care and the environment. His
education address will be given Jan. 17 in New Hampshire.

A ROLE MODEL FOR EXECUTIONS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HOUSTON _ The death row and execution chamber in Texas might be
about the last place anyone would willingly want to visit. No state
has executed as many people with such efficiency, yet that is
exactly why Gerges Scott stopped by in September. Scott works for
the Corrections Department in New Mexico, which expects in the next
few months to hold its first execution in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said he came to Texas because he wanted to learn from the
very best.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in Florida, legislators jousted in a special session.
First, they renounced their electric chair for execution by lethal
injection. Then, they wrangled over Gov. Jeb Bush's proposal to put
new limits on death row appeals. On Friday that measure also passed
_ by one vote. The effort to speed the process had a good many
lawmakers saying that Florida seemed more and more like Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're our role model for killing people,'' said state Rep.
Chris Smith, D-Fort Lauderdale, in a hearing that preceded the
special session, according to The St. Petersburg Times.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of Texas as a national role model for capital
punishment is enough to make death penalty opponents shudder, but
the actions of New Mexico and Florida suggest that some regard the
state as a place worth emulating. Whether this shows a growing
national appetite for more executions, though _ carried out more
quickly with fewer appeals _ is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   A national review of capital punishment last year reveals
several conflicting signals. There were 98 people executed, the
highest number since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty
in 1976. For the third straight year, Texas led the nation in
executions with 35. In all, 38 states have the death penalty, and
polls continue to show that a strong majority of Americans favor
it.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the Death Penalty Information Center in
Washington, a nonprofit group often critical of the death penalty,
five governors granted clemency in five cases. Usually one is
average. The center also noted other indicators of public
uncertainty: the Nebraska Legislature voted for a moratorium on
executions, but Gov. Mike Johanns vetoed it. The state later
financed a study of the fairness of its death penalty. Polls in
Illinois and Missouri showed public support for moratoriums in
which capital punishment could be studied.
</P>
<P>
   David Dow, a University of Houston Law Center professor who has
represented death row inmates in appeals, said the contrasting
attitudes reflected a host of factors. The Illinois poll numbers,
he said, may reflect the fact that 12 inmates in the state have
been released from death row since 1976 compared to 11 who have
been executed. Last year, one inmate, Anthony Porter, was spared
hours before his execution when a Northwestern University
journalism class proved his innocence. Seven other people were
freed from death rows nationally last year, bringing the total to
84 since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Florida has executed a total of 44 inmates, the third highest of
any state after Texas, with 199, and Virginia, with 73. The recent
controversy arose after the Supreme Court indicated that the
electric chair might constitute cruel and unusual punishment;
photographs of an execution showed flames shooting from a mask on
one inmate's face. Adding to the debate, Bush, the younger brother
of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, pushed the bill to limit appeals,
legislation not unlike a law his brother signed five years ago. Jeb
Bush has emphasized the suffering of victims' families and
complained that inmates spend about 14 years on death row before
they are executed. ``Justice delayed is justice denied,'' he wrote
in a recent op-ed article. Friday's measure is expected to limit an
inmate's legal appeals to a five-year period. Bush's top policy
adviser on the issue, Brad Thomas, caused a flap last week when he
said in The St. Petersburg Times: ``What I hope is that we become
more like Texas. Bring in the witnesses, put them on a gurney, and
let's rock and roll.'' Thomas has since apologized to the governor,
who has described capital punishment as ``serious and somber.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics in the Florida legislature argued during the special
session that the appeals limits were a hurried proposal, possibly
unconstitutional, that might result in executing wrongly convicted
inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the attractions of Texas to all the other states,''
Professor Dow said, ``is that there is a sense that Texas has
managed to defeat all the death penalty opponents who had managed
for the last 20 years to thwart the state's interest in carrying
out this punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The public often supports efforts to curb appeals, he said,
because of a widely held belief that capital inmates enjoy more
rights than they deserve. ``What Texas has managed to do is whittle
away at criminal defendants' rights,'' Dow said.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Pete Gallego, a Democrat who authored the 1995 law
streamlining the Texas appeals process, denied that any rights were
infringed. He said the law also required, for the first time, that
the state pay for the appeals of indigent defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Maurie Levin, executive director of the Texas Capital Defense
Project, a nonprofit group that helps death row inmates, said
replicating Texas ``would be phenomenally stupid.'' She and other
critics say the state provides inadequate legal aid to poor
defendants. She also criticizes its willingness to execute inmates
who are mentally retarded or mentally ill or who committed murder
at 17, the legal age in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, who is a spokesman for New Mexico Corrections, said his
visit to Texas was to learn how to prepare for the media circus
surrounding an execution. He also saw how the state actually
carried one out. He described death row officials as compassionate
and professional. While executions do not attract much attention in
Texas, he said things will be different in New Mexico. ``It will be
the story of the year for 2000,'' he said.

   Scott said he came to Texas because he wanted to learn from the
very best.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in Florida, legislators jousted in a special session.
First, they renounced their electric chair for execution by lethal
injection. Then, they wrangled over Gov. Jeb Bush's proposal to put
new limits on death row appeals. On Friday that measure also passed
_ by one vote. The effort to speed the process had a good many
lawmakers saying that Florida seemed more and more like Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're our role model for killing people,'' said state Rep.
Chris Smith, D-Fort Lauderdale, in a hearing that preceded the
special session, according to The St. Petersburg Times.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of Texas as a national role model for capital
punishment is enough to make death penalty opponents shudder, but
the actions of New Mexico and Florida suggest that some regard the
state as a place worth emulating. Whether this shows a growing
national appetite for more executions, though _ carried out more
quickly with fewer appeals _ is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   A national review of capital punishment last year reveals
several conflicting signals. There were 98 people executed, the
highest number since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty
in 1976. For the third straight year, Texas led the nation in
executions with 35. In all, 38 states have the death penalty, and
polls continue to show that a strong majority of Americans favor
it.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the Death Penalty Information Center in
Washington, a nonprofit group often critical of the death penalty,
five governors granted clemency in five cases. Usually one is
average. The center also noted other indicators of public
uncertainty: the Nebraska Legislature voted for a moratorium on
executions, but Gov. Mike Johanns vetoed it. The state later
financed a study of the fairness of its death penalty. Polls in
Illinois and Missouri showed public support for moratoriums in
which capital punishment could be studied.
</P>
<P>
   David Dow, a University of Houston Law Center professor who has
represented death row inmates in appeals, said the contrasting
attitudes reflected a host of factors. The Illinois poll numbers,
he said, may reflect the fact that 12 inmates in the state have
been released from death row since 1976 compared to 11 who have
been executed. Last year, one inmate, Anthony Porter, was spared
hours before his execution when a Northwestern University
journalism class proved his innocence. Seven other people were
freed from death rows nationally last year, bringing the total to
84 since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Florida has executed a total of 44 inmates, the third highest of
any state after Texas, with 199, and Virginia, with 73. The recent
controversy arose after the Supreme Court indicated that the
electric chair might constitute cruel and unusual punishment;
photographs of an execution showed flames shooting from a mask on
one inmate's face. Adding to the debate, Bush, the younger brother
of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, pushed the bill to limit appeals,
legislation not unlike a law his brother signed five years ago. Jeb
Bush has emphasized the suffering of victims' families and
complained that inmates spend about 14 years on death row before
they are executed. ``Justice delayed is justice denied,'' he wrote
in a recent op-ed article. Friday's measure is expected to limit an
inmate's legal appeals to a five-year period. Bush's top policy
adviser on the issue, Brad Thomas, caused a flap last week when he
said in The St. Petersburg Times: ``What I hope is that we become
more like Texas. Bring in the witnesses, put them on a gurney, and
let's rock and roll.'' Thomas has since apologized to the governor,
who has described capital punishment as ``serious and somber.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics in the Florida legislature argued during the special
session that the appeals limits were a hurried proposal, possibly
unconstitutional, that might result in executing wrongly convicted
inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the attractions of Texas to all the other states,''
Professor Dow said, ``is that there is a sense that Texas has
managed to defeat all the death penalty opponents who had managed
for the last 20 years to thwart the state's interest in carrying
out this punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The public often supports efforts to curb appeals, he said,
because of a widely held belief that capital inmates enjoy more
rights than they deserve. ``What Texas has managed to do is whittle
away at criminal defendants' rights,'' Dow said.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Pete Gallego, a Democrat who authored the 1995 law
streamlining the Texas appeals process, denied that any rights were
infringed. He said the law also required, for the first time, that
the state pay for the appeals of indigent defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Maurie Levin, executive director of the Texas Capital Defense
Project, a nonprofit group that helps death row inmates, said
replicating Texas ``would be phenomenally stupid.'' She and other
critics say the state provides inadequate legal aid to poor
defendants. She also criticizes its willingness to execute inmates
who are mentally retarded or mentally ill or who committed murder
at 17, the legal age in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, who is a spokesman for New Mexico Corrections, said his
visit to Texas was to learn how to prepare for the media circus
surrounding an execution. He also saw how the state actually
carried one out. He described death row officials as compassionate
and professional. While executions do not attract much attention in
Texas, he said things will be different in New Mexico. ``It will be
the story of the year for 2000,'' he said.

NEW HAMPSHIRE'S GOP ESTABLISHMENT HAS HEART SET ON BUSH
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.H. _ There were no interruptions. No uncomfortable
questions posed by intrusive moderators. No bickering over the
finer points of tax reform.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, each of the six Republican candidates for the
presidential nomination got equal time to plead their cases before
more than 1,000 of the party's faithful at a Republican National
Committee fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Seated on the covered ice at the Whittemore Center at the
University of New Hampshire, bathed in red and blue light, GOP
activists gave each candidate a warm reception, though most of
their hearts were already committed to Texas Governor George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Senator John McCain, who has placed second to Bush in
national polls but is leading among likely Republican voters in
this first primary state, used the occasion to condemn both Vice
President Al Gore and former Senator Bill Bradley for their stances
on gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just in the last few days, the two Democratic candidates
proved they are not qualified to be commander-in-chief of the armed
forces of the United States,'' he said. Who aspires to be the
commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the United States and
says they will only choose a chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
who will support and pursue a social agenda does not qualify?''
</P>
<P>
   McCain vowed to continue the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy if
elected.
</P>
<P>
   He also lamented the lack of discussion on foreign policy in
Republican debates so far. He called the Clinton administration's
policy ``feckless,'' and condemned possible plans to return
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not be driven by polls,'' McCain said. ``I am
completely experienced and prepared to be president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain steered clear of campaign finance reform, a topic which
he has hammered in other forums to date, but which has made some in
the Republican Party angry with him.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has been criticized in New Hampshire for paying too
little attention to voters until recently, opened his speech by
recalling his fond memories of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``My trips to your state have always reminded me that the great
strength of our country lies in hearts and minds of our citizens,
not in the halls of government,'' Bush said, to loud applause.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also criticized the Democrats for their policies on the
military, telling the audience, ``I'll be a commander-in-chief who
respects the military and a commander-in-chief who will earn the
respect of the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also discussed his tax-cut plan, which one of his rivals,
Steve Forbes, has attacked in recent days. While Bush spoke, a
Forbes aide delivered a detailed rebuttal to reporters, arguing
that Bush had broken a no-new-taxes pledge in Texas in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates also hit familiar themes: their opposition to
abortion and to big government, the decline of religion and
morality in American life, the failure of the Clinton-Gore
administration to safeguard national secrets.
</P>
<P>
   But while all six candidates may have gotten equal time, the
evening belonged to Bush. This was a gathering of the Republican
establishment, and, as supporters of other candidates hastened to
explain, the establishment is squarely with the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like his demeanor,'' said Audrey Murphy, a party activist
from Marlborough, Mass. ``He has a feeling of sincerity and
honesty, and warmth.''
</P>
<P>
   And at least one guest was won over to Bush Sunday &UR;  &LR; night. Bill
Kerrigan, who was seated at a Gary Bauer table, had privately
decided to change camps before Bush had even stepped up to the
podium. He picked up a Bush sticker as he walked in, but decided
not to use it until after the dinner, out of respect for Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for his switch? Bush, Kerrigan said, can win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to lose with a thoroughbred,'' Kerrigan said. ``I
want to win with a solid conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're behind enemy lines tonight,'' said Dan Robertson, New
Hampshire press secretary for Steve Forbes. ``Most of the people
here are the establishment. To a man, they're supporting Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   But the night was also about money, raising $200,000 for the
party, a state record. Forbes bought 20 tables, at $2,000 each, to
reward his supporters.

<P>
   When questions surfaced about Sen. John McCain's emotional
stability, he put them to rest last month with a deluge of paper:
1,500 pages of medical records, going back to 1973. And that was
the abridged version.
</P>
<P>
   Americans now know that, psychologically, McCain is a rock, in
the opinion of his doctors. But they also now know about the mole
on his shoulder, about his arthritis, hay fever and intestinal
polyps, as well as the size of his prostate gland.
</P>
<P>
   No law forces candidates to bare their medical histories. But
the news media and political rivals press for revelations, hinting
that those who decline may have something to hide. Some people
maintain that the public interest demands that the usual right to
confidentiality be waived. Others question whether the public
needs, wants or has a right to such information.
</P>
<P>
   When word got out that McCain was planning to release his
records, he was urged not to do so by Dr. Claire Dixon-Lee,
president of the American Health Information Management
Association, whose 40,000 members maintain medical records at
hospitals and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be devastating if releases of health information by
presidential candidates served as a catalyst for demands for this
kind of information from Americans when they apply for jobs or
loans, get married or partake in routine activities,'' Dr.
Dixon-Lee wrote. She suggested instead that candidates have their
doctors write ``comprehensive summaries,'' including only the
information pertinent to running for office.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Bradley has taken that approach, releasing a statement
from his doctor saying that he is in good health and that his
abnormal heart rhythms should not interfere with his work. His
staff has promised more data should he become the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times has regularly sought medical information
about presidential candidates, assigning Lawrence K. Altman, a
reporter who is also a physician, to review medical histories and
to conduct extensive interviews with candidates and their personal
doctors. Joseph Lelyveld, the executive editor, said it was the
newspaper's responsibility to provide readers with information
``pertinent to an individual's ability to do the job of
president.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited former Sen. Paul Tsongas as an example of why medical
information is important, and why a letter from the candidate's
doctor is not sufficient. After telling voters he had been
successfully treated for cancer, Tsongas won the 1992 Democratic
presidential primary in New Hampshire. But he later left the race
and acknowledged under pressure that he and his doctors had
concealed a recurrence. He died of cancer in 1997, after having
publicly endorsed the formation of a presidential commission to
study the issue of how much medical information candidates should
disclose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We happen to have a doctor on our staff who doesn't seek to
examine the candidates themselves but who is qualified to examine
medical records, ask reasonable questions and draw conclusions,''
Lelyveld said. ``We don't need to publish everything he sees.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, candidates who have hidden their illnesses have been
elected and have governed effectively. Beyond his paralysis from
polio, which the press helped to play down by not photographing him
in his wheelchair, Franklin D. Roosevelt suffered from severe heart
disease and hypertension. His doctors knew he was severely ill when
he ran for a fourth term in 1944, but they concealed it, supposedly
as a matter of national security, because the nation was at war.
Roosevelt died a few months into the term.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight D. Eisenhower had heart disease and was secretly advised
by his doctor that he might not live through a second term. John F.
Kennedy did not tell voters he had Addison's disease, a serious
failure of the adrenal glands that required treatment with
steroids. And Abraham Lincoln is widely believed to have suffered
from lifelong bouts with depression.
</P>
<P>
   Would Americans have voted differently in any of those cases had
they known the truth? In Kennedy's case, the 1960 election was so
close that some historians say public knowledge of his health might
have given the victory to Richard M. Nixon. But some would argue
that Lincoln's, Kennedy's and Eisenhower's ability to function in
office prove that candidates should not be disqualified or judged
on the basis of health problems. Roosevelt may have been another
matter, but even if voters had known of his condition, it is hard
to imagine that they would have turned against him in wartime.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Daniel Callahan, an ethicist and co-founder of the Hastings
Center for Bioethics in Garrison, N.Y., argued that medical privacy
should be suspended for presidential candidates.
(MORE)
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're running, you're giving up your privacy, and
justifiably so,'' he said. ``The reason very simply is that the
health of somebody who is going to be president will bear on the
performance of that person once in the job. It's as relevant to
know somebody's health as their positions on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Callahan said he found it hard to think of any exceptions. Even
though millions of people live normal lives with treatable
conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes, they should be
disclosed, he said, along with any other disorder that carries a
higher than average likelihood of illness or death. Genes that
predispose a person to breast cancer or Alzheimer's disease are
also relevant, he said, as well as psychiatric treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recurrent depression would certainly be something you'd want
to know about,'' Callahan said. ``Manic depression would be even
more worrisome, with someone who was hysterical at some times and
flat-out depressed at others. I guess I'd like to see a letter from
a doctor that went over the main features of mental and physical
health, but didn't present the reading of every test that was
taken. But the physician should be neutral, not a crony or pal of
the patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Talmadge King, chief of medicine at San Francisco General
Hospital, questioned the relevance of medical information. ``I
don't know if it helps us make a more learned decision about the
candidates,'' he said. ``It may potentially just play into people's
phobias and biases. We've had a number of amazing leaders who had
disabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   George Annas, chairman of the health law department at Boston
University, said a letter from a doctor vouching for a candidate's
health should be enough. He said the rigors of campaigning would
take their toll on anyone who did not have the stamina to be
president, and that voters would see that for themselves without
the media's examining medical records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have they ever found out anything that mattered?'' he asked.
``I don't think there's any magic in medical records, that we're
going to learn something essential about candidates by rooting
around in their records. If there's a terminal illness, you'd want
to know. That is fair, but that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor should candidates be expected to disclose whether they have
ever consulted a psychiatrist, Annas said, because the stigma
attached to psychiatric treatment might cause politicians who need
it to forgo it rather than risk being forced to admit it. He
pointed to the case of Sen. Thomas Eagleton, who in 1972 was
dropped as the Democratic vice-presidential nominee after it became
known that he had failed to tell his running mate, Sen. George
McGovern, that he had received electroshock treatments for
depression.
</P>
<P>
   King said he was ``willing to bet'' that many people with
depression or manic depression had been successful politicians. He
suggested that if a psychiatric disorder was severe enough to
interfere with a person's ability to function, it would be obvious
to voters anyway.

<P>
   Is making racist and xenophobic remarks a sign of mental
illness?
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball seemed to suggest it was last week when
commissioner Bud Selig demanded that John Rocker, the ace relief
pitcher for the Atlanta Braves, undergo psychological testing,
three weeks after his remarks about immigrants and blacks were
reported in Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   But Selig's move may have more to do with politics and a desire
to save Rocker's career than with worries about his mental health,
say experts who study sports.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus among psychiatrists and psychologists is that
racism in and of itself is not a mental illness, unless combined
with other problems. If it were, a huge swath of American society
would be considered ill, they say..
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have these thoughts but simply don't express
them,'' said Chris Crandall, a social psychologist at the
University of Kansas who studies prejudice. ``I think the guy just
didn't have his mental editor turned on.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, 25, seems to have better control over his 95-mph
fastball than his tongue. During last year's playoffs, he engaged
in vituperative battles with New York Mets fans, spitting at them
and venting his hatred of the city.
</P>
<P>
   But Rocker went even further in comments to a magazine writer
who accompanied him on a recent hunting trip. Among other things,
Rocker called an overweight black team-mate ``a fat monkey,''
complained about what ``degenerates'' New York fans were and said,
``the biggest thing I don't like about New York are the
foreigners.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker also likened riding the subway to Shea Stadium to driving
through Beirut, and described the passengers as ``some kid with
purple hair next to some queer with AIDS right next to some dude
who just got out of jail for the fourth time, right next to some
20-year-old mom with four kids.''
</P>
<P>
   But as abhorrent as those views are to many, they are not
necessarily insane, Dr. Daniel Borenstein, the president-elect of
the American Psychiatric Association, said. ``A tendency toward
bias is a normal human characteristic,'' he said. ``An extreme form
of bias is racism, but none of that is a mental disorder in
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes Rocker's outbursts scary, some sociologists say, is
that many Americans share his views though they know it is
politically verboten to express them. ``Vast majorities of white
Americans hold stereotypical views of people of color that are not
far from Rocker's views,'' said Richard Lapchick, founder of the
Center for the Study of Sport in Society.
</P>
<P>
   Lapchick said the center's surveys suggest racism is on the rise
among young Americans over the last 15 years. To expect sports to
remain insulated from such trends is naive. ``We are not going to
get baseball or basketball teams free of people who have the
attitudes of Rocker,'' he said. ``We can at least make our players
and people in our front offices understand there are consequences
for going across certain lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball officials have said Rocker's evaluation is a prelude
toward meting out a fine, a suspension or some other discipline.
Officials said the idea of testing Rocker before deciding how
severe punishment should be was a compromise reached with the Major
League Baseball Players Association, the players' union.
</P>
<P>
   ``The remarks made by Rocker were pretty reprehensible,'' said
Richard Levin, a spokesman for Major League Baseball. ``It's not
something we can overlook. Something has to be done and this is a
first step.''
</P>
<P>
   His mental health aside, Rocker's diatribe has not been good for
baseball's image, which is not good for business. Nor will it be
easy for him to keep working for the Braves, whose starting lineup
last year regularly included black and Hispanic players.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta City Council, which represents a city where
minorities are the majority, has passed a resolution calling on the
Braves to dismiss Rocker. Some team mates have also made it plain
that they do not look forward to working with him this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the pitcher's value may outweigh all that. He was a
dominating closer for the Braves as they won the 1999 National
League Pennant with 38 regular season saves.
</P>
<P>
   While Rocker can exercise his First Amendment rights, the
Constitution shields him only from governmental actions to limit
speech, say civil liberties lawyers. Courts have held a private
company or organization can still discipline or dismiss an employee
for statements if they interfere with an employee's ability to do
his job or damage the employer's image.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps a measure of Rocker's talent that Braves president
Stan Kasten, the son of a Polish immigrant whose family was killed
in a Nazi concentration camp, has said the pitcher deserves ``a
second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of Rocker's case is it gets us talking about racism
again,'' Lapchick said. ``One of the great problems of racism in
America is that we tend, unless it is thrown up in our faces, to
avoid it.''

WEIGHING THERAPY FOR A NARROW MIND

   Is making racist and xenophobic remarks a sign of mental
illness?
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball seemed to suggest it was last week when
commissioner Bud Selig demanded that John Rocker, the ace relief
pitcher for the Atlanta Braves, undergo psychological testing,
three weeks after his remarks about immigrants and blacks were
reported in Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   But Selig's move may have more to do with politics and a desire
to save Rocker's career than with worries about his mental health,
say experts who study sports.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Who's wrong in case of Cuban boy? Everyone
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A six-year-old boy is not a legitimate prize in a political game
of finders-keepers, so of course Elian Gonzales should go home to
his father and this grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody who has had a hand in this case ought to be ashamed of
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration dithered unconscionably instead of
cutting a quick, clear path to the outcome it finally bumped and
lurched its way to. Too typically, the administration seemed to be
searching for an out that would let it have the issue both ways,
satisfying law on the one hand and holding the Miami Cubans at bay
on the other.
</P>
<P>
   That trick was never possible and the delay while the
administration thrashed around in the political underbrush allowed
the ideologues contesting over the small boy to overheat and
inflate the situation beyond all reason.
</P>
<P>
   The energetic promotion of Elian as an anti-Castro showpiece by
his Miami relatives crudely exploited his trauma -- a mother dead
at sea, himself nearly lost -- and set the child up for further
trauma should he be returned to Cuba, as from the start there was a
high likelihood he would be.
</P>
<P>
   By lavishing gifts and amusement-park excursions on him, the
relatives showed Elian to the door of a fabulous childhood that
they had to know there was a good chance he could never enter. (One
so glittering that many American children never live it.) The
pampering, in the circumstance, was indistinguishable from cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Fidel Castro, instead of firmly pressing for the
boy's return through diplomatic channels, set thousands of dutiful
Cubans to marching in the streets, raising the political stakes and
making it all the more difficult for Washington to act
forthrightly, out of worry that it would seem the United States was
bowing to Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Miami Cuban community went ritually bananas, finally
taking to the streets in civic disorder and disruption. Castro must
be chortling. By their reliable excesses, the Miami Cubans are
cumulatively discrediting themselves from being taken seriously in
the post-Castro Cuba they fancy. Their booby prize: the eager
pandering of every Republican presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   And now some in Congress are trying, in effect, to kidnap the
boy for America.
</P>
<P>
   All of these theatrics would be impossible without the
cooperation of Havana and Washington in sustaining the conditions
that allow for them. Blame, fundamentally, Castro's petty tyranny.
The Miami Cubans are certainly right about that.
</P>
<P>
   But blame, too, a quailing U.S. policy that rightly isolated
Castro when he was making bloody mischief in the Caribbean and
Latin American but persists in demonizing him out of all proportion
to his reduced devilry.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. politics remains spooked by an anti-Castro hysteria,
Miami-driven, that every other country in the hemisphere gave up
years ago. In the resulting atmosphere, almost no one could see
Elian Gonzales for what he is. Not a symbol of anything, just a
six-year old kid who should have gone home weeks ago.

DYLANOLOGY: KEATS WITH A GUITAR _ THE TIMES SURE ARE A-CHANGIN'

   Andrew Motion, the British poet laureate, created quite the stir
this fall when he hailed Bob Dylan as one of the greatest artists
of the century and proclaimed ``Visions of Johanna,'' from Dylan's
1966 album ``Blonde on Blonde,'' the best song lyric ever written.
</P>
<P>
   As the queen's official poet, Motion, 47 years old, is the
latest in a long procession of literary lions that includes Dryden,
Wordsworth and Tennyson, so his pronouncement on Dylan's place in
the canon surely raised some eyebrows on both sides of the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing discussion sheds light on a peculiarly British
fascination with a peculiarly American performer. Excerpts follow.
</P>
<P>
   _ TINA KELLEY
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) First, portions of an interview with Motion
in the October edition of The Message, published by the
London-based Poetry Society: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Q: How highly do you rate him?
</P>
<P>
   A: He's one of the great artists of the century. He comes on the
scene at a very high level, then (with a few glitches here and
there) extends himself steadily _ usually staying one step ahead of
his audience.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is it about him you especially like?
</P>
<P>
   A: The concentration and surprise of his lyrics; the beauty of
his melodies (and the rasp of his anger); the dramatic sympathy
between the words and the music; the range of his devotions; the
power of self-renewal; his wit; his surrealism; the truth to
experience.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) British literati have apparently been
arguing for years about whether Dylan is as good a poet as Keats.
Motion, the author of a recent biography titled ``Keats'' (Farrar,
Straus &AMP; Giroux, 1998), weighed in on the issue in The Message:
(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think about the Keats/Dylan debate?
</P>
<P>
   A: In one sense it's important to establish differences, and
these can be described pretty simply. Keats didn't play the guitar,
or write much for music (I mean: his words are free-standing in a
sense that Dylan's aren't), and Dylan hasn't produced any
book-length narrative poems. In other respects I think it's a false
dichotomy. They each have their own brilliant and distinctive
things to say, and neither _ in their greatness _ matters more or
less than the other.
</P>
<P>
   But this doesn't mean that I think that all contemporary rock
music, or . . whatever music, always and inevitably holds its own
when compared to poetry proper. Most song lyrics rely heavily on
their accompanying music; without their music, they're banal,
repetitive, nothing-y. I don't find them rewarding as poems.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't meant to sound crusty or stick-in-the-mud. It just
acknowledges the particular merits and opportunities of different
forms. In other words: Dylan is an exception proving a more-or-less
general rule. He doesn't (as Robert Lowell said he did) ``lean on
the crutch of his guitar.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) On Oct. 7, a group of poets including Roddy
Lumsden and John Burnside joined Motion for an online chat session
on the Web site of the Poetry Society (www.poetrysociety.org),
focusing (if chat sessions can be said to focus) on Dylan's lyrics.
Highlights follow. (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   (andrewm) It's hard to say what direct effect BD has had on
poets _ though there are some who carry echoes of his work in
remembering ways. Mainly, I think it's a question of his being
exemplary in the matter of openness. I mean, showing us in a very
public way that it's ok to merge lyric, narrative, surreal etc.
writing, and to demonstrate that it can be serious fun. . . . john;
we know Keats could sing _ or did sing, at any rate. What do you
think it was like?
</P>
<P>
   (johnb) Not like a nightingale, I imagine. . . .
</P>
<P>
   (andrewm) There's something in all this about how music proper
has its own logic and `meaning' of a non-verbal kind, which adds of
course to the comparatively meaningful and logical words. And how
this connects with the elements of poetry proper which do not
aspire to logic and coherence as their first port of call. . . .
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) True to the medium, the discussion
eventually turned to matters of pairing off: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   (roddyl) I think there should be a `dating' agency for
poets/composers. . . .
</P>
<P>
   (andrewm) Dating agency here we come: Poet Laureate, 46,
non-smoking meat-eater, lyrical, seeks musical ditto with view to
possible etc. etc.. . .
</P>
<P>
   (johnb) Cheers, I'll off and have that toddy now. . . .
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) The discussion prompted online responses
from a variety of Dylan enthusiasts, including this message
directed to Motion from someone who identified himself as Pete
Younger: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Bravo for sticking your head above the parapet on behalf of
Dylan's lyrics. Were they the product of the lyricist half of a
traditional song-writing duo critics would be less reluctant to see
them as literary works in their own right. And the Nobel committee
less perverse in ignoring (one of) the dominant artistic figures of
our century. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Yet another remarkable and unique aspect of Dylan's art is his
willingness to keep performing it and continually re-interpreting
it for anybody who shows up. Never before has the dominant artist
of a generation been available to mass scrutiny . . . Bob is out
there every night (well he will be again in a few weeks) creating
his art afresh _ lyrically and musically. Why doesn't everybody go
to see the person through whom their lives will be remembered to
future generations?
</P>
<P>
   Dylan cannot match Shakespeare's achievement in inventing
several centuries of Western society by defining its complete
emotional lexicon. But he has achieved something similar on a
smaller scale for the second half of this century in establishing
the permissible obsessions of his time. And that has been largely
achieved by the verbal element of his oeuvre.

   Bravo for sticking your head above the parapet on behalf of
Dylan's lyrics. Were they the product of the lyricist half of a
traditional song-writing duo critics would be less reluctant to see
them as literary works in their own right. And the Nobel committee
less perverse in ignoring (one of) the dominant artistic figures of
our century. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Yet another remarkable and unique aspect of Dylan's art is his
willingness to keep performing it and continually re-interpreting
it for anybody who shows up. Never before has the dominant artist
of a generation been available to mass scrutiny . . . Bob is out
there every night (well he will be again in a few weeks) creating
his art afresh _ lyrically and musically. Why doesn't everybody go
to see the person through whom their lives will be remembered to
future generations?
</P>
<P>
   Dylan cannot match Shakespeare's achievement in inventing
several centuries of Western society by defining its complete
emotional lexicon. But he has achieved something similar on a
smaller scale for the second half of this century in establishing
the permissible obsessions of his time. And that has been largely
achieved by the verbal element of his oeuvre.

LOOKING FOR CAMP DAVID ON THE MAP OF SHEPHERDSTOWN

   JERUSALEM _ Before President Clinton left Washington for his
first meeting with Israeli and Syrian leaders at a Shepherdstown,
W.Va., retreat, his aides requested a copy of the Camp David
agreement to review the formulations that forged peace between
Egypt and Israel some 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in Jerusalem, Israeli officials feverishly studied
the negotiations with Jewish settlers evacuated from the Sinai as a
result of that accord. Clearly, that first evacuation, which broke
the Zionist taboo against abandoning a settlement, would serve as
the historical template _ complete with do's and don'ts _ for what
may be Israel's next one, from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole Camp David process is the yardstick, whether it
should be or shouldn't be,'' said Gerald Steinberg, a diplomacy
expert at Bar-Ilan University.
</P>
<P>
   Even in quaint Shepherdstown itself, the memory of Camp David
asserted itself in the 20-year-old Hebrew-Arabic-English peace
posters that decorated the store windows last week. Following the
Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, a Jewish grandmother had given the
posters to her granddaughter, now a town resident. Save them for
the day that Israel makes peace with the rest of its enemies, she
had said.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the comparison is unfair. Camp David _ 12
excruciatingly long days in which Jimmy Carter, Menachem Begin and
Anwar Sadat hammered out a framework of peace _ was the climax of a
process. Shepherdstown, where bilateral contact has been limited to
clipped utterances of ``Lobby, please'' in the hotel elevator, is
an opening scene.
</P>
<P>
   But the comparing and contrasting of Camp David and
Shepherdstown is inevitable, because parallels are so explicit.
</P>
<P>
   For Israel, the parallel begins with the basic formula of
trading peace for land occupied during a war _ then the Sinai, now
the Golan Heights. There is the uprooting of Jewish settlements
planted by the Israeli government _ then some 5,800 residents, now
17,000. And there is the attempt to not just declare
non-belligerency but to normalize relations with the most
influential foe of the Jewish homeland in the Arab world _ then
Egypt, now Syria.
</P>
<P>
   For Syrian President Hafez Assad, the Camp David deal is
something to equal or best, especially since he declined Sadat's
invitation to join in his peace negotiations with Israel in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to trump Sadat, or else why has he waited 20 years,
especially after criticizing Sadat so strongly for making too many
concessions,'' said Shibley Telhami, who holds the University of
Maryland's Anwar Sadat Chair for Population, Development and Peace.
</P>
<P>
   For both sides, there is the American purse that bankrolls the
effort. After Camp David, that meant $3 billion in annual aid to
Israel and $2.3 billion to Egypt over 20 years, and an
understanding that the amounts were linked, to rise or fall
together.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, despite the cold peace that emerged from the
beginnings of a more promising relationship, there is the fact that
the fundamental peace stuck: There have been no conflicts, no
skirmishes, no large military exercises on the Israeli-Egyptian
border.
</P>
<P>
   The world has changed much, of course, since the Camp David
talks in September 1978. Egypt was a key client state of the Soviet
Union, and the cold war hovered over the forging of that first
melting of hostilities in the Middle East. That was a factor
crucial for the avid American participation.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, besides the breakup of the Soviet Union, peace has
been forged with Jordan. The peace effort with the Palestinians,
which tentatively began with agreement at Camp David that the
Palestinians had a right to full autonomy, has chugged into its
final stages. Camp David itself broke up Egypt's alliance with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Headlines from Israeli newspapers in the late 1970s bear an
eerie resemblance to current ones. Right-wing parties threaten to
quit the governing coalition; settlers mobilize rallies in their
own defense; Israelis express anxiety about increasing dependence
on the Americans, and some accuse the government of ignoring
domestic concerns in its focus on peace.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, one Jerusalem newspaper, after sneaking a
correspondent into Syria, gave in to pages of rapture about Syria
itself _ the warmth of the people, the smoothness of the hummus. It
recalled the euphoria that Sadat engendered in the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   But in general, this time, there is very little enthusiasm for
the prospects of what peace will bring beside an end to war. That
is a product of Assad's tough persona. But it is a lesson of Camp
David, too. The fact that the peace with Egypt remains so cool
fuels some of the opposition to the negotiations with Syria. And
even for supporters, it mutes expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned our lesson not to expect too much from a major Arab
power that has its own internal agenda and problems,'' said Joseph
Alpher, director of the American Jewish Committee in Israel. ``The
inclination is to build a kind of equation. Despite Sadat's warmth,
we got a cold peace with Egypt. So with Assad's coldness, we're
going to have a frigid peace with Syria.''

<P>
   After painful wrangling, the Egyptians got the full Israeli
withdrawal they wanted. Now Syria, too, is pushing for a full
withdrawal. ``For every inch of the Sinai that Sadat got, Assad
wants a little more,'' Professor Steinberg said. But unlike with
Israel and Egypt, where both sides accepted the international
borders, Syria wants Israel to pull back another seven square miles
beyond the international border to the line that stood between them
on June 4, 1967.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike with Egypt, which repossessed a 124-mile stretch of
desert that served as a natural buffer with Israel, the heights of
the Golan confer a military advantage on Syria. This changes the
dynamic of the negotiation over land, with Israel putting a high
value on the security controls that could be provided by early
warning stations.
</P>
<P>
   Those who question the use of Camp David as a model also argue
that Sadat, in braving rifts with the Arab world, was the one who
took the risks and that Assad should not be rewarded for waiting
this long. And they point to what they see as a bitter fruit:
Egypt's sophisticated military capability, a potential threat to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, note the peculiar cooperation that has developed
between Israel and Egypt, which, since their aid levels are linked,
almost jointly lobby Congress every year for continued high levels
of financing. They say that if Syria were brought into the U.S.
orbit, it would give the Americans and Israelis leverage. Assad too
is reportedly looking to establish a close economic, military and
strategic relationship with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That Assad is not present in Shepherdstown could be a reflection
solely of his ill health. But it is likely that it is another
signal of how he wants to do things differently than Sadat at Camp
David. Many Egyptians, and many Arabs in general, were disappointed
with that accord, and believed that Sadat had caved in to U.S.
demands and had sold out the Palestinians to regain the Sinai. .
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak drew a direct parallel with
the Israeli-Egyptian conflict and its resolution before leaving for
Shepherdstown. He visited the spiritual leader of the
ultra-Orthodox Shas party, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, seeking an
endorsement of his peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were once those who said that Sharm el-Sheikh without
peace was preferable,'' he said. ``Then,'' he continued, referring
to the 1973 war, ``we had 3,000 graves and the picture changed.''

   &UR; THE THINGS WE DO TO MAKE IT HOME &LR;  By Beverly Gologorsky.
Ballantine, $12. This generous first novel explores the aftershocks
of the Vietnam War on half a dozen women and their husbands and
lovers who returned from the war scarred and tormented, unable to
blend back into normal civilian life. The dialogue is ``lean and
supple, completely persuasive, full of nuanced turns,'' Jacqueline
Carey wrote in The New York Times Book Review last year.

   &UR; OUR KIND OF PEOPLE: Inside America's Black Upper Class &LR;  By
Lawrence Otis Graham. HarperPerennial, $14. The author explores
that little-known segment of black society that has experienced
generations of material well-being and produced many extraordinary
traditions and personalities. The result is ``a fascinating ...
amalgam of popular history, sociological treatise and memoir,''
Andrea Lee wrote last year. ``He has made a major contribution both
to African-American studies and to the larger American picture.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued  &UR; AMERICAN BEACH: How `Progress'
Robbed a Black Town _ and Nation _ of History, Wealth, and Power &LR; ,
by Russ Rymer ($14), an inquiry into race and politics, cultural
erosion, development and powerlessness in a black resort community
in Florida. ``Rymer is a seasoned journalist, precise, attentive,
thought-provoking,'' Eddy L. Harris wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE MUSIC LESSON &LR;  By Katharine Weber. Picador USA, $12. A New
York art historian is recruited by an Irish cousin to take part in
an IRA plot to steal a Vermeer painting owned by Queen Elizabeth II
and hold it for ransom. Last year in The New York Times Book
Review, Sylvia Brownrigg called this an ``affecting and elegant ...
novel about the dangerous subterfuges of politics and the healing
truths of art.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHOCOLAT &LR;  By Joanne Harris. Penguin, $12.95. When a beguiling
stranger opens a candy shop in a small French town and announces
plans for a chocolate festival that coincides with Easter, the
parish priest is driven to sabotage by what he sees as an assault
on the church's teachings. Last year the reviewer Nancy Willard
called this an ``accomplished novel'' that ``few readers will be
able to resist.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE COUSINS' WARS: Religion, Politics, and the Triumph of
Anglo-America &LR;  By Kevin Phillips. Basic Books, $16.50. In this
audacious demographic inquiry into the causes and effects of the
English Civil War, the American Revolution and the American Civil
War, Cavalier aristocrats keep losing out to republican Roundheads.
``Phillips' details are as marvelous as they are copious,'' Richard
Brookhiser wrote last year. ``He has given us a juicy, provocative
account of where we have come from.''
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; 1898: The Birth of the American Century &LR; , by David Traxel
(Vintage, $15), a historian argues that the year of the
Spanish-American War was a watershed in time that thrust the United
States into world-power status. In 1998 the reviewer Stanley
Weintraub found this to be an uneven popular history that
nevertheless contains ``a fund of good stories.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SECRETS &LR;  By Nuruddin Farah. Penguin, $12.95. All the characters
in this Somali novel, which takes place on the eve of the nation's
brutal civil war in the early 1990s, are transformed by magical
intervention and walk the line between the human and animal worlds.
In 1998 the reviewer George Packer admired ``the daring, lush,
urbane voice of the author.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE ART OF SHAKESPEARE'S SONNETS &LR;  By Helen Vendler.
Belknap/Harvard University, $18.95. An impassioned critic dissects
Shakespeare's 154 sonnets and makes a persuasive case that they
``remain intelligible, moving and beautiful'' to contemporary
readers. ``Hers is the most intricately inquiring and ingeniously
responding study of these poems yet to be undertaken,'' Richard
Howard wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE WIDOW KILLER &LR;  By Pavel Kohout. Picador USA, $14. Set in
Prague near the end of World War II, this novel is about a Czech
detective and a Gestapo agent pursuing a serial killer who sees
himself as the avenger of an occupied nation. What begins as ``a
taut and suspenseful thriller ... turns into a powerful and
gripping allegory,'' Richard Bernstein wrote in The New York Times
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BRINGING THE HEAT &LR;  By Mark Bowden. Atlantic Monthly, $15. A
reporter at The Philadelphia Inquirer explores the professional
football industry through the lens of the Eagles' 1992 season.
``His book overflows with stories of pro football dreams,'' Keith
Dixon wrote in 1994. ``Yet it also unflinchingly tells of the
darker side of life in the National Football League: uncontrollable
egos, ruined families, marital infidelity.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE STILLEST DAY &LR;  By Josephine Hart. Overlook, $13.95. A
novelist obsessed with obsession spins a turn-of-the-century tale
about an English art teacher who becomes increasingly preoccupied
with her new neighbor. ``In mood, Hart is something of a
present-day Daphne du Maurier: She writes ominously, creating an
atmosphere laden with mystery,'' Carol Peace Robins wrote in 1998.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Jan. 9, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-INTERNET-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Internet was supposed to be
a global medium and a stateless realm, a kind of cyber-Pangaea. But
its innovations have flourished primarily in the United States. The
generally cited reasons include America's entrepreneurial climate _
venture capital financing, close ties between business and
universities, flexible labor markets, a deregulated business
environment, and a culture that celebrates risk-taking, ambition
and getting rich. By Steve Lohr. (Moved in `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-TALKS-REVIEW (Jerusalem) _ In some ways, comparison
between the 1978 Camp David talks and the current talks in
Shepherdstown is unfair. Camp David _ 12 excruciatingly long days
in which Jimmy Carter, Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat hammered out
a framework of peace _ was the climax of a process. Shepherdstown,
where bilateral contact has been limited to clipped utterances, is
an opening scene. But the comparisons and contrasts are inevitable,
because parallels are so explicit. By Deborah Sontag. (Moved in `i'
category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   ROCKER-RACISM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Is making racist or xenophobic
remarks a sign of mental illness? Major League Baseball seemed to
suggest it was last week when it demanded that John Rocker undergo
psychological testing following his rantings about immigrants and
blacks. But the consensus among psychiatrists and psychologists is
that racism in and of itself is not a mental illness, unless
combined with a host of other problems. If it were, then a huge
swath of society would be considered mentally ill. By James C.
McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   FOOTBALL-COACHES-REVIEW (Undated) _ The history of the rising
power and prestige of football coaches. In the early years, coaches
were not venerated figures; in fact, players sometimes ejected them
from the field when they became too dictatorial. Today, a top coach
like Bill Parcells _ who turned three losing franchises into
winners _ has achieved the superstar free-agent status that team
owners have succeeded in denying the players. By Allan Barra. (Also
moved in `s' category as FBN-COACHES-REVIEW)
</P>
<P>
   ATTICA-REVIEW (Undated) _ Why rehash the bloody Attica prison
uprising of 1971 almost 29 years later? Because its demons have
never been exorcised. Memories of them may have faded, but their
shadows are felt just the same. They were back last week when a
federal judge announced a settlement that may at last bring
finality to Attica's painful aftermath. By Clyde Haberman. WITH
GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATES-MEDICAL-REVIEW (Undated) _ No law forces candidates
to bare their medical histories. But the news media and political
rivals press for revelations, hinting that those who decline may
have something to hide. Some people maintain that the public
interest demands that the usual right to confidentiality be waived.
Others question whether the public needs, wants or has the right to
such information and whether it serves a legitimate purpose. By
Denise Grady.
</P>
<P>
   DEATH-PENALTY-REVIEW (Houston) _ The thought of Texas as a
national role model for capital punishment is enough to make death
penalty opponents shudder, but at least a few places regard the
state worth emulating. Yet whether this suggests a growing national
appetite for more executions, carried out more quickly with fewer
appeals, is unclear. A national review of capital punishment last
year reveals several conflicting signals. By Jim Yardley.
</P>
<P>
   BRAND-NAMES-REVIEW (Undated) _ In today's cluttered and
confounding marketplace, brand identification has never been more
important. The topic is ultra-hip, both in the realms of style and
business. But ``branding'' is easier said than done. By Douglas
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   BRAND-CLAIMS-REVIEW (Undated) _ What if Dominos or Chevrolet had
to prove that their advertising slogans are true? Pizza Hut was
recently awarded damages from Papa Johns for the latter's claim
that its pizza was ``better.'' By Jayson Blair.
</P>
<P>
   DYLAN-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ British poet laureate Andrew
Motion recently created a stir when he proclaimed Bob Dylan's
``Visions of Johanna'' the best song lyric ever written. A look at
some of the discussions outlining a peculiarly British fascination
with a peculiarly American performer.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-ISLAM-REVIEW (Gusau, Nigeria) _ A look at the way Islam
must bend in Nigeria and other sub-Saharan African countries, where
it exists alongside Christianity and indigenous traditional
beliefs. In recent years, Sudan's Islamic rulers have grabbed the
West's attention in this region, as Khartoum became a harbor for
anti-American terrorists and a long-running civil war against a
mostly Christian and animist south killed 2 million people. But it
would be wrong to think that Sudan represents the attitude taken by
Muslims elsewhere in Africa. By Norimitsu Onishi.
</P>
<P>
   NORWAY-SWEDEN-REVIEW (Oslo) _ Norway and Sweden are both
prosperous, blue-eyed and reserved. On the world stage, they hand
out peace prizes and preach global cooperation while saving their
aggressions, if any, for the ski slope. However, in the privacy of
their snowbound peninsula, Sweden and Norway have lately been
slugging it out. By Walter Gibbs.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Jan. 1 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.

   GUSAU, Nigeria _ Alongside a dark and deserted highway, a few
dozen Nigerian soldiers and civilians sat at rickety tables on a
Saturday night, their faces barely visible under the flickering
lightbulbs powered by a weak generator.
</P>
<P>
   The night, most emphatically, was slow in Gusau, the capital of
Zamfara state in northwestern Nigeria, where elected officials had
recently announced the introduction of Islamic law, or sharia. A
lone man sang mournfully at his table and women were few and
cheerless. But the beer flowed, plenty of warm, cheap Nigerian
beer, more than enough for a few thrills.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Zamfara state? This is sharia? This is amazing!'' said
a Christian man who, after crossing state lines earlier that day,
had made a beeline for this highway spot, which sits next to the
army barracks and, with the officers' mess across town, is one of
two places in Zamfara where alcohol is now sold.
</P>
<P>
   According to the story going around this dusty town in the Sahel
region south of the Sahara desert, the governor sent an emissary
with a written request that the military commanders stop serving
alcohol in the barracks. The messenger was told to leave, though
not before he was forced to swallow the letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a fantasy,'' said Mahmud Aliyu Shinkafi, the deputy
governor. He added, however, that the soldiers would henceforth not
be asked to refrain from drinking, sharia or no sharia.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise was typical of the way Islam must bend in
Nigeria, as it has to in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa,
where the religion exists alongside Christianity and strongly held
traditional beliefs, say experts on religion in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Sudan's Islamic rulers have grabbed the West's
attention in this region, as Khartoum became a harbor for
anti-American terrorists and a long-running civil war against a
mostly Christian and animist south killed 2 million people. More
recently, Jordanian and U.S. officials have linked terrorist plots
to Islamic militants from the North African country of Algeria. But
while the West's encounter with Sudan's rulers and Algeria's rebels
seems to fit with its experience of antagonism from Islamic
militants in Lebanon, Iran, Afghanistan and Libya, it would be a
mistake to think that such militance represents the attitude taken
by Muslims throughout Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Islam in Nigeria _ indeed, Islam in most of sub-Saharan
Africa _ is an easygoing affair, religion scholars say. To be sure,
religion is a fissure in this country and one often exploited by
politicians to divide, but it ranks far behind other factors like
ethnicity and geography. So while many Nigerians say Zamfara's
politicians are using Islam to unite a Muslim north against a
predominantly Christian south, they regard it as a dangerous and
calculated political threat, not an expression of nascent religious
extremism. And few believe Zamfara's decision could lead to the
rise of the anti-Western and xenophobic Islam associated with
Sudan, Libya, Afghanistan or the Algerian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   As such, experts say, Nigeria is much more representative of the
more tolerant kind of Islam found in sub-Saharan Africa and, at the
other end of the Islamic world, in the vast reaches of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   After all, nearly half of Nigeria's 110 million people describe
themselves as Muslims, outnumbering by far the Muslims found in any
other country in the region. There are more Muslims here, in fact,
than in North African countries like Morocco, Algeria and Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Africa, in general, tends to be more Islamic in the north and
largely Christian in the south. Nigeria reflects that divide
internally, though half the Yoruba, the dominant ethnic group in
the southwest, are believed to be Muslim. Islam arrived in what is
now northern Nigeria in the 11th century. The British practiced
indirect rule in the region, leaving in place Islamic rulers and
allowing them to retain sharia for civil matters like marriage and
inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Muslims in the south tend to be the most liberal.
Among the Yoruba, it is common to find Muslims and Christians in
the same family; some Yoruba even practice both religions, with a
dash of traditional Yoruba beliefs. Even in the north, traditional
customs and beliefs have adapted Islam to fit local needs, said
Aisha Abdul-Ismail, an expert on Islam at Bayero University in
Kano. ``Because of the mixture of indigenous beliefs and Islam in
Nigeria, what is Islam is often not the real Islam,'' she said.
``It is syncretic.''
</P>
<P>
   The same, of course, can be said of Christianity in Nigeria and
sub-Saharan Africa. Half the cars in Lagos may have bumper stickers
professing the driver's love for Jesus, but polygamy is still
widely practiced among Nigerian and African Christians.
</P>
<P>
   It is partly this syncretism that has prevented the rise of
Islamic extremism here, said Haruna Salihi, a scholar of Islam and
politics in Kano: ``Arabs in particular may feel that Islam is
their unique heritage,'' he said. ``But that is not the case with
us. Here you find various combinations of Muslims, Christians and
traditional beliefs, and it's a restrictive factor against the kind
of eruption you find in the Arab world.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, ethnicity _ not religion _ remains the essential
way most Nigerians and Africans identify themselves. Indeed, the
bloodiest clashes that have occurred since Nigeria inaugurated a
civilian government in May have had less to do with religion than
ethnicity. They have pitted the northern Hausa, who are Muslim,
against the southern Yoruba, who are also Muslim as well as
Christian. The Hausa and the smaller northern groups associated
with them have dominated the military since independence in 1960
and ruled Nigeria. But since the May election of President Olusegun
Obasanjo, a retired general and Yoruba, the northerners have
complained that they are being shut out of power.
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, the northerners accuse Obasanjo of doing so in order
to favor his fellow Yoruba; they never mention the fact that he is
a born-again Christian.

   ``Kee-ripes,'' lamented W.W. ``Pudge'' Heffelfinger in his 1954
book ``This Was Football.'' ``How different modern football is from
the old days when the coach wouldn't dare make a decision without
first consulting the team captain.''
</P>
<P>
   Team captain? How quaint. In the current National Football
League, the most important function of a captain is knowing when to
drop the Gatorade bucket on the coach.
</P>
<P>
   Heffelfinger, who was Walter Camp's first All-America selection
back in 1892 and the game's first professional _ $500 for a game
between the Allegheny Athletic Association and the Pittsburgh
Athletic Club _ wouldn't have known what to make of a game where
coaches have come to dominate everything from player drafts to
strategy. Or a game where the serial retirements of the New York
Jets head coach Bill Parcells and his designated successor,
defensive coordinator Bill Belichick, would dominate sports
headlines for days.
</P>
<P>
   Or, for that matter, a game that required something called a
defensive coordinator. ``Your head coach today,'' Heffelfinger
railed in 1954, ``has become an absolute dictator. He not only
picks the team, designs the plays and relegates the captain to a
corporal's status, but during the game he frequently governs the
choice of plays.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early years of the game, not only were coaches not the
venerated figures we know today; they were, on occasion, forcibly
ejected from the field by players when they became too dictatorial.
But by the end of the century, a top football coach like Parcells _
who turned three successive losing teams, the Giants, Patriots and
Jets, into winners _ had achieved the superstar free-agent status
that team owners succeeded in denying the players.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? Most historians pinpoint the 1920s, when football
began to change from a sporting contest organized for the enjoyment
of college athletes and spectators to a money-making proposition
for the universities _ and later, of course, for the owners of
professional teams.
</P>
<P>
   A century after Pudge Heffelfinger's exploits for Yale, football
has all but ceased to exist outside of an organized structure.
Travel the country and you'll see pickup games of basketball and
baseball, but outside of a high school field, where do children
still play football?
</P>
<P>
   It is not even clear that they would know how. The game has
gotten so complex that no one but the coaches truly understands it.
The head coach has evolved from a man who carried a bucket and
helped the captain to a man who coaches coaches, a swarm of
coordinators and assistants and quarterback coaches and line
coaches and receiver coaches from whom consensus must be drawn
before a single play can be allowed. Forget Pudge Heffelfinger _
Vince Lombardi wouldn't recognize this game.
</P>
<P>
   In the biggest game of his life, the 1967 ``Ice Bowl'' NFL
Championship against Dallas, with the ball on the 1-yard line and
13 seconds to play, Lombardi was asked by his captain, quarterback
Bart Starr, what he wanted. ``Score a touchdown,'' replied the
greatest coach in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   What Lombardi meant was: ``I've already done my part of the job;
now you do yours. You know better than I do what has to be done.''
(And Starr did. He called his own number and won the game on a
quarterback sneak.)
</P>
<P>
   Compare the Lombardi-Starr moment with that of the head coach at
Alabama a couple of years ago who, when asked why his team had lost
the biggest game of the year on a boneheaded last-minute pass play,
replied, ``I didn't know we were calling a pass.'' He had delegated
a decision on which his job might depend _ not to the quarterback
(heaven forbid), but to a sub-coach.
</P>
<P>
   The only alternative to such chaos seems to be coaches like
Parcells, who are too much in control, so much so that their
players often appear as automatons. There may be a law to the
modern game, something to the effect that the better the coach, the
duller his team.
</P>
<P>
   There may be a second law: the more in control the coach
becomes, the faster he burns out. Bill Parcells has now burned out
three times.

<P>
   What if Domino's had to prove that it was really ``delivering a
million smiles a day'' or if Chevrolet had to demonstrate that its
trucks were actually ``like a rock''?
</P>
<P>
   What if Kentucky Fried Chicken had to prove that its chicken was
really fried in Kentucky?
</P>
<P>
   Those were some of the questions Syl Sosnowski, Papa John's
International's vice president for marketing, said he asked himself
last week after a federal magistrate in Dallas ordered the company
to drop its slogan ``Better Ingredients. Better Pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling from Magistrate William Sanderson Jr. prohibits Papa
John's from using the word ``better'' to describe its pizza,
because the company could not prove that it used fresher and
tastier ingredients than that of its chief competitor, Pizza Hut.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Papa John's argued that its advertising slogan, like
those of most American companies, was the kind of harmless boast
that consumers expect in television ads. But Sanderson, whose
decision applied only to the Papa John's case, ruled that if
something is not true, one should not say it and awarded Pizza Hut
$467,619 in damages.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the federal courts and the Federal Trade Commission
have been the ultimate arbiters in defining the thin line where
puffery ends and consumer fraud begins. Still, most scholars find a
generic answer elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to generalize about what the FTC and the courts
would consider puffery,'' said Kent Middleton, an advertising
professor and the chairman of the journalism department at the
University of Georgia. ``But the test is: would the average reader
or viewer be deceived by this?''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, companies cannot make inaccurate statements about
facts that can be proven or are not obvious jokes, said Middleton,
a co-author of ``The Law of Public Communication'' (Addison-Wesley,
1999). But there is nothing wrong with making vague and ridiculous
claims to goad people into buying products, he added.
</P>
<P>
   It is all right for Breath Savers to say its mints give
``ultimate fresh breath'' and Snapple to contend its products are
``made from the best stuff on earth'' because few would take those
claims literally, experts say. Similarly, Pepsico is allowed to air
commercials that show a student receiving a Harrier jet as a part
of the ``Get Pepsi Stuff'' challenge because most reasonable people
would take it as a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the rule is: the more ridiculous the claim, the better,
said Ross Perry, an advertising professor at Babson College in
Wellesley, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Isuzu, for example, could say, as it did in the 1980s, that its
cars are ``faster than a speeding bullet.'' But it would land in
hot water if it made the far more modest claim that they were
faster than a Porsche.

   Americans spent an estimated record $185 billion this holiday
season, on dolls and games, sneakers, power tools and skateboards.
In effect, they bought brands.
</P>
<P>
   As Peter Arnell, the chief creative officer of AG Brand
Consulting, who trademarked the term power-branding, notes, the
7-year-old girl who unwrapped her Millennium Barbie exclaiming,
``It's just what I wanted!'' was unwittingly saying, ``This is the
brand I wanted!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The system that allowed Barbie to live is the brand,'' Arnell
said.
</P>
<P>
   That system, which endows products with profound psychological
meaning, is rooted deep in America's history and psyche. In the
19th century, Alexis de Tocqueville noted that citizens of the
young democracy craved badges of personal identity to distinguish
themselves as individuals and to bring order to a society that
lacked formal class distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 20th century , brands were an important part of
American commerce and culture. A number of them, including American
Express traveler's checks, Ivory Soap, Kodak, Lipton and others
still carry instant recognition. It is doubtful, however, that even
the most zealous shill could have foreseen the prominence brands
have assumed in contemporary life.
</P>
<P>
   Successful brands work by carving out a niche in our
subconscious _ what advertisers call a ``mind share.'' They do this
by connecting themselves to universal human needs and desires _ for
security, say, or for love, status, power, beauty or even God. A
minister once said to a Coca-Cola bottler, ``I see a strange
connection between your slogan, `The pause that refreshes,' and
Christ's own words, `Come unto me all ye that travail, and I will
refresh you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Roy Spence, owner of the advertising agency GSD&AMP;M in Austin,
Texas, says a brand must be built and portrayed as ``a sacred
promise of what you stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What you stand for as a brand is going to be as important as
what you sell,'' he said, ``because everybody's selling the same
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines, one of Spence's clients, promises
``freedom.'' Another client, Fannie Mae, the federal agency that
guarantees home loans, promises ``the American dream.'' Wal-Mart
stands for ``trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the product, the goal is always emotional
identification between it and the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   At this level of abstraction, ``the brand becomes a nexus for
people for whom fulfilling similar aspirations is a major life
theme,'' according to a recent paper by Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton. That
may mean joining the crowds in Las Vegas at a Coca-Cola fantasy
land, which offers the curious experience of walking inside a
fizzing soda bottle. Or, to cite a Booz Allen example, it might
entail buying a Harley-Davidson motorcycle and indulging in a
collective Easy Rider fantasy with other Harley owners.
</P>
<P>
   No distinction need be made between people and things. Both are
equally brandable, says Spence. President Clinton, whom he has
advised, has managed to stay in the ``hope business.'' And Sen.
John McCain has a story that Spence thinks might be unbeatable:
``I've been tested under fire, and the fire lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Securing consumer devotion, however, is becoming increasingly
difficult, as the number of new products inundating the consumer
each year climbs toward 50,000, and as the volume of advertisements
swells to help each one reach its intended audience. Forrester
Research, a market research group, notes that by age 16, the
typical American ``will have seen almost 6 million ads; that's more
than one per waking minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Naomi Klein, a columnist for The Toronto Star, and author of the
newly published ``No Logo: Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies''
(Picador), says companies are responding to this clutter by
extending the brand experience itself. ``The power of marketing was
always associative,'' Ms. Klein said. ``Through an ad, something
positive was associated with your product. But branding is now
incarnating those associations.''
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite example is Roots, a Canadian clothing company that
seeks to evoke the happy experiences its founders had at summer
camp. The company built a logo-festooned camp on the western coast
of British Columbia, where grown-up ``campers'' pay hundreds of
dollars a day to experience a luxurious version of their camping
years, swathed in Roots-brand imagery and language. Barnes &AMP; Noble
stores, which self-consciously recreate the ambience of a
19th-century bookshop, attempt to place customers inside the brand,
just as Niketowns try to recreate the feeling of being a high
school athlete.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, says Ms. Klein, all brands use cherished memories to
create commercial cocoons and encourage people to live in them.
</P>
<P>
   And just like the girl with the Barbie doll, Americans begin to
weave those cocoons from an early age, said Alan Manevitz, a
psychiatrist at New York Presbyterian Hospital. The Jolly Green
Giant and the Pillsbury Doughboy live in the same cozy psychic
space as Santa Claus. ``If you can get a kid at an early age,''
Manevitz said, ``you can imprint a brand on him.''

WELCOME TO THE INTERNET, THE FIRST GLOBAL COLONY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
(bl) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the beginning, there was Pangaea. It was the Earth's great
land mass, the mother of all seven continents, which broke up 240
million years ago as Earth's tectonic plates moved apart. That was
the last global continent, until now.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is the new one, a cyber-Pangaea. But unlike the
original, this global realm is not really stateless. In many
respects, it is U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
   The odd thing is that many of the pioneering breakthroughs of
the Internet came from abroad, especially Europe. The World Wide
Web, for example, was created by an Oxford-educated physicist, Tim
Berners-Lee, while working in the shadow of the Swiss Alps at the
CERN physics laboratory outside Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   But Berners-Lee, like so many emigrant technologists, soon
departed for the more fertile soil of America, where the
innovations of the Internet have flourished remarkably. The causes
cited by way of explanation are all ingredients that contribute to
the entrepreneurial climate in the United States _ venture capital
financing, close ties between business and universities, flexible
labor markets, a deregulated business environment, and a culture
that celebrates risk-taking, ambition and getting very, very rich.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that the technology, economics and culture of the
Internet feel awfully American. The companies that have cashed in
on the Internet from newcomers like Amazon.com and Yahoo to the
established technology suppliers like IBM, Sun Microsystems, Cisco
and Microsoft are American. By one estimate, U.S. corporations
collect 85 percent of the revenues from the Internet business and
represent 95 percent of the stock market value of Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   English is the dominant language of the Internet, found on most
Web sites and used in most e-mail. Perhaps most important, the
culture of the Net tends to be informal and individualistic,
decentralized and hard to control. This makes it the preferred
medium of dissident groups in countries around the world, and it
also makes it feel just like home to American net surfers. ``The
Internet is profoundly disrespectful of tradition, established
order and hierarchy, and that is very American,'' observed Fareed
Zakaria, the managing editor of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Economically, the Internet is a transmitter of the kind of
relentless, consumer by consumer competition that can be volatile
and destabilizing. It has the astringent flavor of free-market
economics embraced in America more than elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the United States government had tried to come up with a
scheme to spread its brand of capitalism and its emphasis on
political liberalism around the world, it couldn't have invented a
better model than the Internet,'' said Don Heath, president of the
Internet Society, an international organization.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the values of the United States nor its faith in their
universal applicability are universally welcome, however, and the
same may be said of the Internet. France and Germany, among other
nations, are concerned that the Internet economy may prove
impossible for nations to regulate, and create such vast inequality
and rootlessness among its citizens that they will lose their sense
of social cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reasonable people understand the Internet is a technology
platform, not some form of American imperialism,'' noted Gerhard
Schulmeyer, who heads the U.S. arm of the big German company
Siemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the Internet moves rapidly and is a disruptive technology
that threatens institutions of all kinds, companies and trade
unions, so it has added to the sense in Europe that people's backs
are to the wall,'' Schulmeyer added.
</P>
<P>
   Like much of America's influence on the world, the Internet lies
in the arena of what Joseph Nye, dean of Harvard University's
Kennedy School of Government terms ``soft power.'' It's like rock
'n' roll or American movies, which earn lots of money, to be sure,
but mainly influence other nations by offering an irresistible
alternative culture.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite America's early Internet lead, the Web is a vast
expanse, accommodating significant national and linguistic
differences. ``There is a lot more diversity on the Internet than
just looking at the English-language Web pages might suggest, and
it's getting more diverse all the time,'' said Esther Dyson, editor
of Release 1.0, a newsletter that focuses on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There is diversity, too, in how people believe the Internet
should be allowed to function. Europe, in particular, has offered
plenty of resistance to the U.S. self-regulatory approach for
handling personal data on the Internet. The Europeans believe that
Internet commerce poses a potentially alarming threat to privacy,
and after two years of negotiation, the two sides have been unable
to reach agreement on common principles.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings
Institution, calls the Internet privacy talks represent a ``new-era
trade dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, nearly half of the global online population resides in
the United States. Forty four percent of Americans have Internet
access at home or at work, more than double the percentages in
Germany and Britain, according to Jupiter Communications. Only a
few Scandinavian countries, notably Sweden, approach the American
level of Internet access, the research firm reports.
</P>
<P>
   This edge in Internet use is expected to decline steadily as
other countries, especially Europe and Japan, close the gap. And
some industry executives believe Europe could quickly catch,
perhaps even surpass America, in Internet technology as the world
moves beyond the personal computer as the primary device for
cruising the Net. In the coming ``post-PC era,'' they say, people
will increasingly use wireless devices like ``smart'' cell phones
for e-mail, shopping and information services over the Internet.
European companies like Nokia hold the global lead in the cell
phone market largely because they rallied around a unified European
technology standard, known as GSM (Global System for Mobile
Communications), while U.S. companies competed with a handful of
incompatible standards.
</P>
<P>
   But it is culture _ not raw technology alone _ that will
determine whether the United States retains its status as the
pre-eminent Internet nation. David Braunschvig, a managing director
of Lazard Freres &AMP; Co., is optimistic about Europe and he insists
``there is no logical reason why the U.S. should have this de facto
monopoly on Internet innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   Braunschvig, whose doctorate in computer science is from the
University of Paris, says he tells his friends at dinner parties in
France that all Europe with its 350 million people really needs to
produce is 30 or 40 entrepreneurs like Marc Andreessen, who left
college to co-found Netscape, the Internet browser pioneer. ``My
European friends say, Of course, we've produced such people, but
they have moved to America,'' said Braunschvig, who lives in New
York.

UNION LEADER SEEN KEEPING TO LOEB FAMILY COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nineteen years ago, when the fiery publisher William Loeb died,
his widow, Nackey, emerged from mourning to make a promise in his
front-page editorial spot: ``Bill Loeb will live because the Union
Leader will live.''
</P>
<P>
   Nackey Loeb died Saturday at the age of 75, passing control of
the Union Leader of Manchester and the New Hampshire Sunday News to
employees her husband had picked before his death. In his own
editorial, publisher Joe McQuaid promises to carry out her wishes,
just as she had promised to carry out her husband's.
</P>
<P>
   Principal among the Loebs' wishes was the guarantee that the
Union Leader remain independently owned, despite ``plenty of
interest'' from newspaper conglomerates over the years, McQuaid
said.
</P>
<P>
   Under William Loeb, the Union Leader threw its enormous weight
behind some candidates while declaring war on others, such as
Senator Edward Muskie, whose bid for the presidency faltered under
Loeb's invective. For 35 years, William Loeb imbued the paper with
an outright partisanship that David Moore, a former University of
New Hampshire political science professor, described as ``almost
19th-century.'' News stories were made to fall into line with
arch-conservative editorials. Even those who disagreed with Loeb's
positions _ such as the no-tax pledge he built into presidential
politics _ said he transformed the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still can't have an honest discussion of (the no-tax
pledge) because of William Loeb, and he's been dead for two
decades,'' said Mike Pride, editor-in-chief of the Concord Monitor,
a more liberal competing daily. ``Politicians are afraid of the
ghost of William Loeb.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Nackey Loeb's watch, the Union Leader lost her husband's
vitriolic editorials, but improved its reporting, said readers from
the political world. Today's paper may not be the kingmaker it was
in the 1970s, but, said Republican political consultant David M.
Carney, ``people know they have to get their p's and q's together
when they go into the Union Leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan called Nackey Loeb his ``godmother'' after she
endorsed him in the 1996 Republican presidential primary. Mrs. Loeb
was a vociferous critic of President George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Loeb had used a wheelchair since she was injured in a 1977
auto accident, and retired for health reasons last May. She tapped
as her successor McQuaid, a third-generation newspaperman who
arrived at the paper as a 15-year-old copy boy and never left.
McQuaid said he also had a warm personal relationship with Nackey
Loeb, who ``played an immense part in my growth as a human being.''
They spoke at least on a weekly basis up until her death.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was still engaged in the business,'' McQuaid said. ``She
made it clear she didn't want us backing any guys named Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   She also didn't want the paper falling into the hands of
outsiders. Since their children did not go into the newspaper
business, the Loebs made plans for the Union Leader and Sunday News
succession 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   With Nackey Loeb's death, 24 percent of the corporation's voting
stock will come under control of eight or nine trusted employees,
said Greg Sullivan, an attorney for the newspaper. When all but one
of those trustees is dead, those shares will be distributed among
the paper's employees. He said there are eight or nine trustees
still living, and that McQuaid is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 75 percent of the corporation's stock was owned by
Nackey Loeb individually. In an announcement Sunday, McQuaid said
those shares will go into a separate trust.
</P>
<P>
   Within the paper, there's little concern about ideological
drift. Jim Finnegan, who wrote editorials at the paper for more
than 38 years, said he's heard declarations of the end of the Loeb
era too many times to take them seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were watching after Mr. Loeb died, and then again when
I retired, and didn't see any major changes in philosophy. I think
now the game has started again _ `Is it going to change?' '' said
Finnegan. ``I would be very, very surprised.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Waiting for the other shoe
 &HT;    (For immediate release.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ This is a city held hostage. It lives moment to moment
for someone else to say this about 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, or
that about him. Held above the heads of an area of close to 2
million is the threat of bottling up Miami's airport, of closing
Miami's shipping and cruise port, of obstructing the city's streets
_ of paralyzing Miami.
</P>
<P>
   It is a situation that has grown out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Is it all because of a 6-year-old boy whose mother drowned
trying to get here from Cuba to the U.S.?
</P>
<P>
   I doubt it. It is more about frustration, 41 years of it. That's
how long Fidel Castro has been in power. That's how long it has
been since exiles began abandoning Cuba for Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe Castro's mortality will soon come to play and that
will be it. I'm not one of them. Castro's political legacy is
steeped in four decades of communist indoctrination and a
deep-rooted hatred of the U.S. as a result of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   The average exile is frustrated by his inability to create
change in Cuba, either by force or by ballot. Those who expect to
return to Havana on white horses the day after Castro is dead are
in for a surprise. Most exiles would rather stay in the U.S.
anyway; life is too good here, it never will be equal or better in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   When little Elian was rescued from the ocean while floating in
an inner tube, he was seized upon as an icon for the exile
community. They look for icons as people look for messages from
Above; and don't think that hasn't been mentioned in the case of
this child.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the complexities of a family matter, the
politicians have made a show of it. And so have the exiles. (It is
remarkable that people here 30 or 40 years _ and citizens of the
U.S. _ still call themselves ``exiles.'' So do some who were born
here.)
</P>
<P>
   Little Elian is an icon all right; an icon of the Cuban exiles
and an icon of the Cuban communists. Were this a different time, a
biblical time, we would have a Solomon sit in judgment of the two
feuding parties and offer to split the child in two. First one to
agree loses.
</P>
<P>
   Always hangs the threat. If matters do not go their way _ i.e.,
the boy is returned _ then Miami gets caught in the backlash.
Demonstrations promised for Monday were delayed while politicians
jabbered back and forth, but the threat lingers.
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured that if the boy is sent back, the demonstrations
will resume and, likely, be violent.
</P>
<P>
   This is a city torn in half. Polls show that the exiles
overwhelmingly want the child to stay in Miami; non-exiles think he
belongs with his father in Cuba. Cross-ethnic friendships are
shattered over this horrendously emotional problem.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, the exile position was to let the matter be
settled in family court. Then, the Immigration and Naturalization
Service weighed in and said Elian should go home. Bill Clinton,
early in the child's presence here, said the case should be solved
through a legal process. Then, last week, he said he agreed with
the INS decision. Puzzling? Not when it's Bill Clinton talking:
remember? ``I did not have sexual relations with that woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami has been my home for more than a half-century. It has seen
its share of racial unrest and of crime. It also has embraced
hundreds of thousands of Cubans who came here for a better life.
And a better life it has been. Presently, Cuban-Americans hold all
the high governmental posts in Miami and environs. They preside
over banks and schools, have the highest-rated TV station. They
have made a deep financial impact on Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In a disagreement with U.S. policy, however, they choose to
disable the infrastructure of a complex city. Obviously, nothing
has been learned from those awful racial unrest days, when an
exasperated black America burned its own neighborhoods in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Exiles here would shut down the airport, the streets, the port,
the commerce of the community _ and put a flock of fellow Cubans
out of work; something akin to cutting off your nose to spite your
face.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Who's wrong in case of Cuban boy? Everyone
 &HT;    (Eds: Fixes spelling of Gonzalez.)
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A 6-year-old boy is not a legitimate prize in a political game
of finders-keepers, so of course Elian Gonzalez should go home to
his father and his grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody who has had a hand in this case ought to be ashamed of
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration dithered unconscionably instead of
cutting a quick, clear path to the outcome it finally bumped and
lurched its way to. Too typically, the administration seemed to be
searching for an out that would let it have the issue both ways,
satisfying law on the one hand and holding the Miami Cubans at bay
on the other.
</P>
<P>
   That trick was never possible and the delay while the
administration thrashed around in the political underbrush allowed
the ideologues contesting over the small boy to overheat and
inflate the situation beyond all reason.
</P>
<P>
   The energetic promotion of Elian as an anti-Castro showpiece by
his Miami relatives crudely exploited his trauma _ a mother dead at
sea, himself nearly lost _ and set the child up for further trauma
should he be returned to Cuba, as from the start there was a high
likelihood he would be.
</P>
<P>
   By lavishing gifts and amusement-park excursions on him, the
relatives showed Elian to the door of a fabulous childhood that
they had to know there was a good chance he could never enter. (One
so glittering that many American children never live it.) The
pampering, in the circumstance, was indistinguishable from cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Fidel Castro, instead of firmly pressing for the
boy's return through diplomatic channels, set thousands of dutiful
Cubans to marching in the streets, raising the political stakes and
making it all the more difficult for Washington to act
forthrightly, out of worry that it would seem the United States was
bowing to Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Miami Cuban community went ritually bananas, finally
taking to the streets in civic disorder and disruption. Castro must
be chortling. By their reliable excesses, the Miami Cubans are
cumulatively discrediting themselves from being taken seriously in
the post-Castro Cuba they fancy. Their booby prize: the eager
pandering of every Republican presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   And now some in Congress are trying, in effect, to kidnap the
boy for America.
</P>
<P>
   All of these theatrics would be impossible without the
cooperation of Havana and Washington in sustaining the conditions
that allow for them. Blame, fundamentally, Castro's petty tyranny.
The Miami Cubans are certainly right about that.
</P>
<P>
   But blame, too, a quailing U.S. policy that rightly isolated
Castro when he was making bloody mischief in the Caribbean and
Latin American but persists in demonizing him out of all proportion
to his reduced devilry.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. politics remains spooked by an anti-Castro hysteria,
Miami-driven, that every other country in the hemisphere gave up
years ago. In the resulting atmosphere, almost no one could see
Elian Gonzalez for what he is. Not a symbol of anything, just a
6-year old kid who should have gone home weeks ago.

   RACIAL PROFILING WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED BY ALL. Two years ago, most
white people had not heard of racial profiling, such as DWB
(driving or dining while black), and certainly would not publicly
acknowledge that people of color were suspects of crimes simply
because of their race or ethnicity. But with the advent of video
cameras, the Internet and various cable-television stations and
news services, news stories about racial profiling abound. In this
commentary, columnist Akilah Monifa reports on the results of a
recent Gallup telephone poll of 2,006 people, including 1,001
African-Americans, in which those polled were asked what they
thought about racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   THE RETURN OF JUAN SEGUIN _ This week, columnist Juan Gonzalez
reflects on the life of Juan Seguin, the forgotten father of Latino
politics in the United States. Seguin served as both a senator of
the Texas Republic and mayor of San Antonio. Gonzalez believes that
how our nation comes to terms with Seguin's legacy will determine
much about American politics during the 21st century. The reason is
simple: The political influence of Hispanic-Americans is growing at
breakneck speed. For example, between the 1976 and 1996
presidential elections, Hispanic voter registration in the United
States increased 164 percent compared to only 31 percent among
non-Hispanics. ``Descendants of Juan Seguin _ who will number one
out of every four Americans by 2050 _ are finally ready to write a
new chapter in the story of American democracy,'' Gonzalez writes.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS UP FOR `NUEVA AMERICA.' _ Columnist James Garcia has
always been ambivalent about Geraldo Rivera. ``I sometimes wonder
whether his primary objective is to entertain or to inform,'' he
writes. However, Rivera's latest CNBC documentary, ``Nueva
America,'' merits special recognition. It's an important
achievement because it introduces Rivera's largely white mainstream
viewing audience to the nation's fast-growing, increasingly
powerful and diverse Latino community. In this commentary, Garcia
applauds Rivera's work and highlights the documentary's finer
moments.
</P>
<P>
   `SKEWED' VIEWS OF GAMING REVENUES _ Columnist Tim Giago believes
that there is a skewed tendency by charitable foundations and other
contributors to charities and causes to assume that because there
are some Indian nations that have grown wealthy from their gambling
revenues, these tribes should bear the brunt of contributions to
needy Indian programs or institutions. But only 5 percent of gaming
tribes are amassing 90 percent of the gambling revenues. This
means, of course, that 95 percent of the Indian nations are still
struggling to bring jobs, better schools and improved health care
to their people. In this commentary, Giago presents his solutions
to the financial problems and other ills that Native-Americans now
face.
</P>
<P>
   STAYING ON GUARD: A BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR'S STORY _ For two
years, Jackie Young missed getting her annual mammogram. ``I was
too busy _ running for office, writing my memoirs, traveling,'' she
writes in this feature from KoreAm Journal. But in January 1998,
when she needed a refill for Premarin, an estrogen pill she had
been taking daily since 1980 after her hysterectomy, her doctor
asked her to undergo a routine checkup. A mammogram was included.
``I was aware of the statistics for women in my age group (I'm 65),
but I thought that being Asian was on my side,'' she writes. ``I
had heard that Asian women had a lower incidence of breast cancer.
And besides, my family had no history of cancer.'' Unfortunately,
the test and a subsequent biopsy confirmed her worst fear: She had
cancer. In this feature, Young describes how she coped with the
diagnosis and treatment. A sidebar titled ``The Facts on Breast
Cancer'' is included.

   THUMBS UP FOR `NUEVA AMERICA.' _ Columnist James Garcia has
always been ambivalent about Geraldo Rivera. ``I sometimes wonder
whether his primary objective is to entertain or to inform,'' he
writes. However, Rivera's latest CNBC documentary, ``Nueva
America,'' merits special recognition. It's an important
achievement because it introduces Rivera's largely white mainstream
viewing audience to the nation's fast-growing, increasingly
powerful and diverse Latino community. In this commentary, Garcia
applauds Rivera's work and highlights the documentary's finer
moments.

<P>
   `SKEWED' VIEWS OF GAMING REVENUES _ Columnist Tim Giago believes
that there is a skewed tendency by charitable foundations and other
contributors to charities and causes to assume that because there
are some Indian nations that have grown wealthy from their gambling
revenues, these tribes should bear the brunt of contributions to
needy Indian programs or institutions. But only 5 percent of gaming
tribes are amassing 90 percent of the gambling revenues. This
means, of course, that 95 percent of the Indian nations are still
struggling to bring jobs, better schools and improved health care
to their people. In this commentary, Giago presents his solutions
to the financial problems and other ills that Native-Americans now
face.

   STAYING ON GUARD: A BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR'S STORY _ For two
years, Jackie Young missed getting her annual mammogram. ``I was
too busy _ running for office, writing my memoirs, traveling,'' she
writes in this feature from KoreAm Journal. But in January 1998,
when she needed a refill for Premarin, an estrogen pill she had
been taking daily since 1980 after her hysterectomy, her doctor
asked her to undergo a routine checkup. A mammogram was included.
``I was aware of the statistics for women in my age group (I'm 65),
but I thought that being Asian was on my side,'' she writes. ``I
had heard that Asian women had a lower incidence of breast cancer.
And besides, my family had no history of cancer.'' Unfortunately,
the test and a subsequent biopsy confirmed her worst fear: She had
cancer. In this feature, Young describes how she coped with the
diagnosis and treatment. A sidebar titled ``The Facts on Breast
Cancer'' is included.

   RACIAL PROFILING WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED BY ALL. Two years ago, most
white people had not heard of racial profiling, such as DWB
(driving or dining while black), and certainly would not publicly
acknowledge that people of color were suspects of crimes simply
because of their race or ethnicity. But with the advent of video
cameras, the Internet and various cable-television stations and
news services, news stories about racial profiling abound. In this
commentary, columnist Akilah Monifa reports on the results of a
recent Gallup telephone poll of 2,006 people, including 1,001
African-Americans, in which those polled were asked what they
thought about racial profiling.

   THE RETURN OF JUAN SEGUIN _ This week, columnist Juan Gonzalez
reflects on the life of Juan Seguin, the forgotten father of Latino
politics in the United States. Seguin served as both a senator of
the Texas Republic and mayor of San Antonio. Gonzalez believes that
how our nation comes to terms with Seguin's legacy will determine
much about American politics during the 21st century. The reason is
simple: The political influence of Hispanic-Americans is growing at
breakneck speed. For example, between the 1976 and 1996
presidential elections, Hispanic voter registration in the United
States increased 164 percent compared to only 31 percent among
non-Hispanics. ``Descendants of Juan Seguin _ who will number one
out of every four Americans by 2050 _ are finally ready to write a
new chapter in the story of American democracy,'' Gonzalez writes.

   1. RUSSIAN MILITARY : NOT MIGHTY, NOT RED AND BARELY AN ARMY
</P>
<P>
   By David Plotz - Slate In 1943, the Soviet army saved the world
from Nazism by holding Stalingrad while the Germans pounded it to
rubble. Today, that army's delinquent stepchild, the Russian army,
is fighting a city battle of its own. The Russians are pounding
their own city, Grozny, to rubble and are murdering Russian
civilians in the process. Western analysts now fear that the
generals are using Chechnya to reassert control over national
security and foreign policy. Their militarism and nationalism bode
ill for future relations between Russia and the West. The general
staff, for instance, has essentially forbidden Russia from talking
to NATO. 1,500 words.
</P>
<P>
   2. MANHATTAN GOTHIC, FINAL CHAPTER
</P>
<P>
   By Chip Brown - The New York Times Magazine Woody Woodward's
mother shot his father. His brother killed himself. It was,
perhaps, a legacy too oppressive to escape. Anyone who knew Woody
felt a dreadful pity at how the drama of his life was resolved when
he stepped into the abyss outside the kitchen window of his
Manhattan apartment and fell 14 floors to his death. He left a
6-year-old daughter, an estranged wife and an estate worth upwards
of $60 million. 2,800 words.
</P>
<P>
   3. THE RED AND THE BLACK
</P>
<P>
   By Robert S. Boynton - The New York Times Magazine What a sight
they were, the 22 young African-American artists, writers,
journalists and scholars who boarded the German steamer Europa on
June 14, 1932 for the Soviet Union. The alliance of Harlem
intellectuals and Communist radicals took its most concrete form in
a trip to the Soviet Union led by Louise Patterson, a fiercely
intelligent woman at the centre of New York's African-American
intellectual scene during the final days of the Harlem Renaissance.
1,000 words.
</P>
<P>
   4. WHAT'S DOING IN ISTANBUL
</P>
<P>
   By Stephen Kinzer - The New York Times Way To Go! Turkey has
both European and Asian aspects, but nowhere is it more European
than in Istanbul. The millennium year will probably bring a surge
of visitors who will use Istanbul as a jumping-off point for trips
to sites across Turkey that are related to early Christianity. In
winter they can expect grey, chilly days mixed with days when a
brilliant sun glistens over the Bosphorus. They will also enjoy
bargains from innkeepers and others competing for fewer customers.
2,000 words + photos + map.
</P>
<P>
   5. ASTONISHING MEDICAL FACT : PLACEBOS WORK!
</P>
<P>
   By Margaret Talbot - The New York Times Magazine A sugar pill
for the mildly depressed. Sham surgery for a bad knee. A hand to
hold for the flu-stricken. Placebos aren't real medicine, but they
can often help patients heal. So why not exploit their power?
Full-length (7,800 words) + edited article available.
</P>
<P>
   6. FINLAND'S FORTE
</P>
<P>
   By Geoffrey Wheatcroft - The New York Times Magazine The Finns
speak an unusual idiom that almost nobody else in the world
understands. Surely there has been an incentive to communicate in a
language that needs no translation and knows no boundaries. This
article looks at how a small Scandinavian country conquered the
world of classical music. 2,800 words.
</P>
<P>
   7. THE POLITICAL EDUCATION OF KADI DIALLO
</P>
<P>
   By Ted Conover - The New York Times Magazine She came from
Africa to claim the body of her son Amadou. She ended up with a
fast education in the tortured racial politics of New York.

   1. RUSSIAN MILITARY : NOT MIGHTY, NOT RED AND BARELY AN ARMY
</P>
<P>
   By David Plotz - Slate In 1943, the Soviet army saved the world
from Nazism by holding Stalingrad while the Germans pounded it to
rubble. Today, that army's delinquent stepchild, the Russian army,
is fighting a city battle of its own. The Russians are pounding
their own city, Grozny, to rubble and are murdering Russian
civilians in the process. Western analysts now fear that the
generals are using Chechnya to reassert control over national
security and foreign policy. Their militarism and nationalism bode
ill for future relations between Russia and the West. The general
staff, for instance, has essentially forbidden Russia from talking
to NATO. 1,500 words.
</P>
<P>
   2. MANHATTAN GOTHIC, FINAL CHAPTER
</P>
<P>
   By Chip Brown - The New York Times Magazine Woody Woodward's
mother shot his father. His brother killed himself. It was,
perhaps, a legacy too oppressive to escape. Anyone who knew Woody
felt a dreadful pity at how the drama of his life was resolved when
he stepped into the abyss outside the kitchen window of his
Manhattan apartment and fell 14 floors to his death. He left a
6-year-old daughter, an estranged wife and an estate worth upwards
of $60 million. 2,800 words.
</P>
<P>
   3. THE RED AND THE BLACK
</P>
<P>
   By Robert S. Boynton - The New York Times Magazine What a sight
they were, the 22 young African-American artists, writers,
journalists and scholars who boarded the German steamer Europa on
June 14, 1932 for the Soviet Union. The alliance of Harlem
intellectuals and Communist radicals took its most concrete form in
a trip to the Soviet Union led by Louise Patterson, a fiercely
intelligent woman at the centre of New York's African-American
intellectual scene during the final days of the Harlem Renaissance.

<P>
   4. WHAT'S DOING IN ISTANBUL
</P>
<P>
   By Stephen Kinzer - The New York Times Way To Go! Turkey has
both European and Asian aspects, but nowhere is it more European
than in Istanbul. The millennium year will probably bring a surge
of visitors who will use Istanbul as a jumping-off point for trips
to sites across Turkey that are related to early Christianity. In
winter they can expect grey, chilly days mixed with days when a
brilliant sun glistens over the Bosphorus. They will also enjoy
bargains from innkeepers and others competing for fewer customers.
2,000 words + photos + map.

   5. ASTONISHING MEDICAL FACT : PLACEBOS WORK!
</P>
<P>
   By Margaret Talbot - The New York Times Magazine A sugar pill
for the mildly depressed. Sham surgery for a bad knee. A hand to
hold for the flu-stricken. Placebos aren't real medicine, but they
can often help patients heal. So why not exploit their power?

<P>
   6. FINLAND'S FORTE
</P>
<P>
   By Geoffrey Wheatcroft - The New York Times Magazine The Finns
speak an unusual idiom that almost nobody else in the world
understands. Surely there has been an incentive to communicate in a
language that needs no translation and knows no boundaries. This
article looks at how a small Scandinavian country conquered the
world of classical music. 2,800 words.

 &HT;    Third party's longest shot hits the road
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Robert Bowman does have something of a
presidential look. He is gray at the temples, and at 6-foot-4, he
is quick to remind me he is the same height as Abraham Lincoln. He
was wearing a standard candidate uniform: gray suit, red power-tie,
scuffed black wingtips and a campaign button the size of coaster
saying ``President Bowman 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   You haven't heard of him?
</P>
<P>
   ``My name is not a household word,'' he owns.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman is running for the Reform Party presidential nomination.
Sure, Pat Buchanan, Donald Trump and Jesse Ventura get all the
publicity. But Bowman says he will take them on.
</P>
<P>
   A resident of Melbourne Beach, Fla., Bowman headed north with a
13-year-old motor home he dubbed ``Bertha'' for a five-month,
39-state campaign tour. He plans to speak at churches, libraries,
campuses, civic-group lunches, anywhere he finds an audience.
</P>
<P>
   Daytona Beach was his first stop and I caught up with him
Thursday on a comfy, worn couch at the back of Community Unitarian
Universalist Church.
</P>
<P>
   He has no entourage save Maggie Bowman, his wife of 43 years.
And the talk was informal since, by my count, there were exactly
two people in the audience, excluding press.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman was unfazed. ``We'll do much better tomorrow in
Gainesville,'' he said confidently. ``We're supposed to meet there
with the Coalition for Peace and Justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have a bumper sticker?'' a supporter asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my goodness, we don't have anything like that,'' answers
Maggie Bowman. The campaign depends on a Web site, announcements on
bulletin boards and word of mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Long shot doesn't begin to describe Bowman's candidacy, but he
is living proof of the wide spectrum of political beliefs now
finding their way to the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a critic of the government for 18 years full-time,''
Bowman says. It started with his opposition to the Star Wars
missile-defense program. He says he has spoken against it in 5,000
talks in forums ranging from campus peace group meetings to the
``Larry King Show.''
</P>
<P>
   He is for a single-payer national health care system, shifting
the tax burden to the large corporations and ``ending the
domination of society by transnational corporations and banks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an appeal across the spectrum,'' he said, but he
focuses on issues that resonate with the left. Still, last July, he
joined the party of Buchanan, Trump and Ross Perot and felt right
at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Reform Party is a people's party'' he says
enthusiastically. ``Both major parties are wholly-owned
subsidiaries of the Trilateral Commission.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, perhaps, but what does the Reform Party stand for if
cultural warriors like Buchanan and a peace and justice movement
speaker such as Bowman are both members in good standing?
</P>
<P>
   Bowman sees only two Reform Party litmus tests. ``I was
interested that the Reform Party was taking two good stands:
electoral reform and trade reform. ... It's up to the candidates to
set out any issues beyond those two.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if you're against the World Trade Organization
and for cutting off the flow of special-interest money to political
campaigns, you are Reform Party material. That leaves abortion,
health care, taxation, military strategy, environmental regulation,
education and gun control up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians and media may consider Bowman with his mobile
home and patient explanations of science policy as a fringe
candidate, but he is living evidence of the huge range of concerns
that feel left out of the two major parties and are gravitating to
the
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   How long this may continue will depend a great deal on who the
party nominates this year. A Buchanan win would drive out people
who are in agreement on world trade and campaign clean-up but are
otherwise moderate or liberal. A Trump win would drive out those
who are, well, sensitive to ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an opportunity to steal the spotlight with the
California primary,'' Bowman said. And his next step is to load his
pamphlets back into his mobile home and hit the road to provide
another choice.

 &HT;    Improved education for our kids begins locally, not with
president
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ With apologies to John Wayne, presidential
candidates talk the talk, but they don't walk the walk.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking public education here, pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidates know that the voters care a great deal
about public education because it controls the destinies of their
children and it costs a ton of tax money.
</P>
<P>
   Those conditions are natural fodder for politicians who want to
live rent free at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidates don't do much more than talk about
public education because public education has always been a local
issue.
</P>
<P>
   States, local school boards and local taxpayers have much more
impact on the education of their children than do presidents or
members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 6 percent of the money that funds public education
comes from the federal government. That's a scanty amount. All the
rest comes from local and state taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, President Jimmy Carter kept his promise to establish a
separate department for education and make the secretary a
presidential cabinet member. But federal dollars coming out of
Washington, D.C., have never matched all the talk about public
education.
</P>
<P>
   Paltry school funds come with strings
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of money, presidents and Congress members have attempted
to influence public education by attaching a lot of strings to the
paltry federal funds funneled back to states and local schools.
</P>
<P>
   If states and school districts weren't always strapped for pubic
education funds, they might start telling the feds to keep their
exiguous grants and butt out.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the current presidential candidates, only Republican
candidate Alan Keyes and Reform candidate Pat Buchanan favor
closing the federal Education Department and sending block grants
back to the states with instructions that all education decisions
should be made at the local level.
</P>
<P>
   Neither candidate is likely to occupy the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Republican front-runner Gov. George W. Bush, who unquestionably
has had more influence on public education than all the candidates
of both parties combined, proposes $1,500 annual scholarships for
children in public schools that fail state testing for three years.
</P>
<P>
   The scholarships could be spent for tutoring or private
schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also proposes rewards from a $300 million federal fund to
states that improve schools. In states where public schools fail to
improve, he proposes shifting 5 percent of federal funding to
charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants to let families put up to $5,000 per student annually
into tax-free savings accounts for K-12 expenses, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic candidate Bill Bradley wants to forgive student loans
of 60,000 college students and mid-career professionals who certify
as teachers in poor and urban schools.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has proposed a sweeping $115 billion plan
with plenty of strings attached to provide universal preschool,
reduce class sizes, require higher student standards and increase
the pay of teachers who work in poor schools.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans Gary Bauer, Steve Forbes and Orrin Hatch favor
private school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   GOP candidate Sen. John McCain wants vouchers for disadvantaged
kids under 3, tax-free education savings accounts and a $5.4
billion program to be paid for by eliminating subsidies on oil, gas
and ethanol and the price supports on sugar. He also wants tough
teacher testing.
</P>
<P>
   The merits of these various proposals are worth debating.
</P>
<P>
   But it's important to remember that choosing local school board
members is more important to public education than who is elected
president.

 &HT;    Treat your woes with ugly face therapy
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Television and weekly news magazines brought
us some pretty exciting shots of millennium celebrations around the
world. Paris' Eiffel Tower was the most spectacular of all. Times
Square was impressive, too, because I'd never seen so many people
in one place who had to go to the bathroom and couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   In Athens, Greece, they lit up the crumbling ruins of the
2,500-year-old Parthenon and, for just a minute there, when the
fireworks started blazing, I was afraid the rest of it might all
come tumbling down.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt, apparently unimpressed with the natural majesty of its
ancient wonders, turned the pyramids, Cheops, Khefren, and
Mykerinos, into giant video screens.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas was up to its already glitz-strained eyeballs in
millennium marriages and Elvis impersonators, while Sydney,
Australia, warming up for the September Olympics, set off $3.5
million worth of fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   And the Washington Monument blazed like the Hollywood set for a
'40s musical.
</P>
<P>
   But I must confess, my very favorite celebration photo was the
one I saw in Newsweek taken in Gisborne, New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   There, gathered on the water's edge welcoming the millenium, was
a crowd of Maori men wearing only black and white mini-sarongs and
face paint, their features contorted into comical, almost
childlike, scary faces at something across the way. Their
expressions ranged from Abbot and Costello Meet the Wolfman to an
exaggerated imitation of Puff the Magic Dragon.
</P>
<P>
   Three were thrusting their tongues at whatever it was they were
trying to scare away, while another had screwed his face into a
grimace that suggested the guy directly in front of him might have
suffered a Y2K deodorant blowout.
</P>
<P>
   There was no hint of what this celebration was all about _ maybe
scaring off evil spirits. Or maybe their mothers-in-law were lined
up on the other side of the river and, according to ancient Maori
custom, the young men are given a chance once every thousand years
to let the old ladies know what they think of them.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the meaning of this ritual, I found it impossible as I
studied the photo not to compare the artless simplicity of the
Maori ceremony with the multimillion buck spectaculars whose
pyrotechnics sporadically lit up the sky as midnight slowly inched
its way around the globe, time zone by time zone.
</P>
<P>
   These guys were having a good time and it showed.
</P>
<P>
   But think about it. Wouldn't it be great every once in a while
to slip into a sarong and make some threateningly funny faces at
all of the unseen irritations that have been bugging you?
</P>
<P>
   So, your boss is an out-of-control, know-nothing jerk? Scrunch
up your eyes, stick out your tongue and let him have it: BLAA-AH!
</P>
<P>
   You went to the basketball game last night and the parents
behaved worse than the students? Cross your eyes hard, like your
momma always warned you not to, and hold it. Next, hook your right
pinkie just inside the right corner of your mouth, the left one
just inside the left corner _ and pull until it hurts. Now, stick
out your tongue and go: NYA-AAAH!
</P>
<P>
   You should be feeling better already just from thinking how much
a shrink would charge for this kind of therapy.
</P>
<P>
   And don't be afraid to innovate. Make up ugly faces of your own.
Think back to that raunchy kid who sat in front of you in third
grade _ the one who ate paste and got you in trouble for laughing
when he did his imitation of the frog-eyed music teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The next time you feel life closing in on you, remember the
Maori and their millenium celebration. Call a few friends over,
break out the face paint, and head for the creek. At the same time
you're warding off demons, you might just discover a cure for road
rage.
</P>
<P>
   What could it hurt? The sanity we save could be our own.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Is there anything more annoying than getting a
parking ticket? Only if it's doled out by one the most annoying
gadgets of them all: electronic parking ticketers. If you haven't
seen one, it looks like one of those oversized walkie-talkies they
used to carry around on the TV show ``S.W.A.T.'' All the meter
maids have to do is type your license plate into the gizmo and
perform a few other deft keystrokes and (ARGH!) instant violation.
No muss, no fuss, no ``Gee, you're crying! I'm going to rip up this
ticket.'' Zing, pow. Fine: $10. Technology at its most annoying.
Just the sight of these things makes us cringe, and that's why they
are the annoying gadgets of the week.

 &HT;    How I launched my Web without losing my sanity
 &HT;    By Brenda Watters
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   12/26/99 Noon: My husband is bent over his sewing machine
downstairs, muttering ``stretch stitch.'' Today is my day for
earnest work on my Web site. I want to post my fiction, including
two complete, but unpublished, thrillers, and nonfiction, which is
mostly journalism. In my wildest dreams, my site will attract an
agent who will call (or e-mail) and say ``I want to represent
you!'' So my engineer-husband sews and I compute.
</P>
<P>
   12/26/99 1 p.m.:
</P>
<P>
   I'm reading ``Make Your Own Web Page!'' by Ted Pedersen and
Francis Moss. The subtitle is ``A Guide for Kids.'' I bought this
book from my second-grader's Scholastic Book Club. I'm not a
techie. When my editor, Gretchen Heber, first OK'd this article,
she dropped ``HTML'' into the conversation several times. Finally,
I asked her: ``What is HTML? Hotmail?'' In response, she may have
sputtered. HTML means HyperText Markup Language. I will write HTML
code to create my Web site. So far, the kid advice is simply
stated. The chapter ``Creating Your Web Site,'' is about site
architecture without mentioning the word architecture. Yet the age
gap between me and its intended readers shows up when the book
suggests I use topics like ``Smelly Things That Are in My Closet,''
or ``The Best Roller Coasters I've Been On.''
</P>
<P>
   12/26/99 2 p.m.:
</P>
<P>
   My kids, Jay, 5, and Ellen, 8, are next door in Jay's bedroom
playing with a castle he got for Christmas. The catapult shoots
cannonballs. Jay launches a ball at a silver-armored knight. The
knight topples over. Jay places him in the dungeon. The Web page
book has a picture of a kid painting a castle tower. Synchronicity.
That's a good sign. Or should I pay more attention to the symbolism
of the dungeon?
</P>
<P>
   12/26/99 3 p.m.:
</P>
<P>
   I've done a practice page using HTML. There is a reason for the
 &QL;  and  &QR; , and the slash, or ``/'', keys. They signal how the copy is
displayed on a Web page. Without trouble, I find and launch an
Internet browser. My success ends. I can't seem to call up my
practice page file. I try Windows Explorer. My file is there, on my
hard drive. I key in an exhaustive address, trying to open my file.
Nothing. I call my husband, John, upstairs. He clicks on the browse
box in the Web browser window. My index.html file is listed. I open
it. My first Web page, with one sentence, is done. I feel like a
country hick. I am in a fancy restaurant with a red bandana around
my neck. I use my dirt-grimed fingers to strip a skewer of beef
kabob. Everyone's watching me.
</P>
<P>
   12/26/99 4 p.m.: To continue the country hick analogy, I am
squealing like a stuck pig. I wallow in delight. I'm writing code.
Headlines and text are popping up on my home page. My confidence
soars. Self-loathing knocks on my happy door, though. Why did I
wait so long to do this? It's easier than I thought to write
programming code. I am giddy with my back-and-forth clicking
between the HTML I write in Microsoft's WordPad and the
browser/translator, Microsoft's Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   12/26/99 5 p.m.: I spent the last hour in ``Hicksville USA''
again. I opened the Web designer software I bought at CompUSA. For
a cheap $29.99, I bought ViaPage by ViaGrafix. I loaded a disk
labeled ``DesignCAD Pro 2000, software demo.'' Nothing happened. I
asked John to help. Cleverly, John, Mr. MSEE (master of science
degree in electrical engineering), quickly found the ``real''
CD-ROM. The disk I'd loaded was just a demo for some other piece of
software. The real ViaPage was disguised in an envelope bearing the
license agreement. Who reads those? I check off the registration
screens. ViaGrafix asks me to rate my computer experience. The
scale is one to 10, with 10 being computer genius. Feeling dejected
and dissed by the demo, the arrow flickers to the one. I
reconsider. I know what Windows Explorer is and I e-mail people. I
choose three. DO YOU SEE WHAT A NONTECH I AM? Ha-ha. I know
uppercase print is shouting in cyberworld. Feebly, I ask my
husband, ``Am I cheating by using software instead of writing
code?'' He reassures me. ``No one writes code. They use tools.''
</P>
<P>
   12/26/99 10 p.m.: I've battled ViaPage for hours. Cheap doesn't
mean better. It doesn't even mean good. The program is full of
bugs. Hyphens and semicolons throw the text onto the next line. My
thoughtful words are amputated, butchered. As I edit my page, the
cursor jumps after one letter is typed. So ``Boulder, Colorado''
comes out looking like Boulidkere. The errors are random.
</P>
<P>
   12/27/99 Noon: My ViaPage frame resembles a field goal _ two
side columns left and right make up the poles, and three center
boxes are frames for my fiction, journalism and biography. My
progress is stymied. The help menu sucks. After a dispirited phone
call, my husband comes home and tries to teach me a few things.
Soon, he takes over the keyboard. On my shoulders, the cartoon
begins: The angel on my right shoulder says, ``This is your
article, you should be doing your own Web page. Stick to the kids
book.'' On my left shoulder, the devil says, ``Let your husband
take over your page, you'll have something decent to show for it
and meet your deadline.'' John returns to his job at Agere. I face
ViaPage alone.
</P>
<P>
   12/27/99 4 p.m.: Definitely, the dungeon was the omen.
</P>
<P>
   12/27/99 9 p.m.: I spent the day sucked into the abyss of
ViaPage. Again, I recruited my husband's help. He translated my
fiction excerpts into HTML. But, the text I hyperlinked to from the
home page fiction ``teaser'' box does not appear on the second page
correctly. Instead, the text is crammed into the same little box as
the fiction teaser. Plus, the pages take an eternity to open. (A
few days later, Katherine Jones of Milkshake Media warned me to
keep my Web pages to 60K or less for optimal download time).
Retreating from my defeat, I read Carson McCullers' 1940 book,
``The Heart is a Lonely Hunter.'' One of the characters, Singer,
who is deaf, is ringed by people who tell him their hearts'
deepest, aching thoughts. Once in a while, Singer scratches out a
few words on paper, but mostly, he just reads lips. His eyes, his
brows, the set of his mouth, how his long hands rest on the table _
these are Singer's communication tools. No fancy Web pages on the
Internet. Singer is a master of empathic listening.
</P>
<P>
   12/28/99 2 p.m.: No more Via-Page. Back to HTML. Kyla Kanz of
OliveDesign called. She asked me if I'm on a PC or a Mac. PC is the
wrong answer, but it's what I have. The PC's Windows environment is
tougher. ``Between Mac and Windows,'' she explained, ``Mac is cut
and paste. You're not doing code.'' She recommends Dreamweaver
software. ``It's not the cheapest,'' she said. ``I find, though,
that the nontechies in our office gravitate to Dreamweaver. It does
a nice job.'' It costs $129. I don't have it.
</P>
<P>
   12/28/99 7 p.m.: Little things mean a lot. While writing code, I
learned that I cannot use an apostrophe after my last name to do
this: Brenda Watters' Home Page. If I do, people searching my page
(especially those agent-people) won't find me. They'll be typing
Watters without the apostrophe. It's a quibble _ grammatically
incorrect, but search engine-friendly. Likewise, I add ``writer''
before my name to attract the agent-people.
</P>
<P>
   12/28/99 8 p.m.: I'm finally past the halfway point in the
``Make Your Own Web Page!'' guide for kids. The girl who stars in
the book, Elena, shares the same name as my daughter. (Ellen signs
her schoolwork with her Spanish name.) At this point, Elena is
adding a drawing to her page. I'm adding a photo, and I've measured
it in pixels. It's way too large, so I've reduced it by half. The
book warns that the proportions between height and width must stay
the same. (The angel on my shoulder is patting my back.) I go back
to the Web browser. There's my picture! I'm so excited.
</P>
<P>
   12/28/99 10:20 p.m.: A friend of mine, Mike Gunter of Database
City, has offered to set up my site and let me use a DB City server
for hosting my pages. I had checked into the AOL offering for
domain registration and Web page hosting, and saw that it had a set
form to produce a Web page. (''Here are three borders, choose one.
Here are suggested interests: Dating online?'') Not for me.
</P>
<P>
   12/29/99 10:20 a.m.: One of my Girl Scout moms (I lead a troop),
a programmer, called me this morning. I told her I was writing HTML
code to create my own Web site. She laughed hysterically. Everyone
does. What is it? Could it be the ``NT'' stamped on my forehead for
nontechie? In the old days, the techs and nontechs were separated
by a dress code. Techs wore white dress shirts and pocket
protectors. Nontechs wore black turtlenecks and jeans. Those were
uniforms. Today, I imagine myself wearing a white lab coat. I am a
mad doctor. I am creating my cobbled-together beast, the Web site.
If only I had a brain. Then my pages could walk and talk!
</P>
<P>
   12/29/99 11:40 a.m.: Elena's pages are about her family and
hobbies. I've built five links from my home page _ one to each of
my novels, a journalism link, a novel-in-progress link and a link
to a page of writing tips. I just finished adding an ``absolute''
link. Using the Austin Writers' League URL, I wrote an anchor tag
in HTML. When Web site visitors click on the league's Web address,
they'll link up with the league's site. I've tried it. It's really
cool. Elena of the book links her site with www.Internet4kids.com.
That's cool for a kid. I've tried, but can't link to it. Is it my
old age? Instead of a parental control block, maybe there's a kid
control block.
</P>
<P>
   12/29/99 8:25 p.m.: I've been working on the railroad, all the
live-long day. Sing it! I've toiled all day for days on end. My
office is overheated by computers blowing hot air. As a final
touch, I added my e-mail address to my home page. Now that I've
accompanied Elena on her Web-site journey, I'm glad I learned to
write HTML code. After all, I am the staff who will update my Web
site. Also, there are enhancements I'd like to do: settle on a
consistent font style, use more colors, add a biography, and
regularly add new excerpts onto the other pages. I got a too-late
tip from John: I can select any site on the Web and use my
browser's ``view source'' command to see the HTML code behind the
glitzy graphics. It's OK to copy the code for my own page _ it's in
the category of fair use under copyright law. Also, the members of
my unofficial advisory board recommend that I use a focus group to
test the way I present information. Calling all agents for a focus
group! In my wildest dreams?

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Know thy user! If you don't have good content,
there is absolutely nothing a spinning logo can do to make your
site better.
</P>
<P>
   People go to a Web site with a question. You have about eight
seconds to get viewers' attention before they move on.
</P>
<P>
   Content is king. If you don't have something the audience wants,
they will leave and rarely return.
</P>
<P>
   Design for the user. Research to try to get a feel for how the
viewer will use the site. Build a prototype.
</P>
<P>
   Then get someone representative of your audience, sit that
person down in front of your site and watch. If the design works,
you'll know in a matter of seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations from the user are getting higher. The days of
brochure-ware are numbered.

 &HT;    A home for your domainBy Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service ATLANTA _ After your Web site is
<TEXT>
designed, you need to get it on the Internet so it is available to
the world. This service scales according to the seriousness or
commercial objectives of the site. Internet Service Providers
provide several types of hosting:
<P>
   _ Subdirectory hosting _ no unique domain name, just uses a
subdirectory of the host (such as www.dbcity.com/brendawatters) and
the site is one of many on the server computer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Virtual domain hosting _ has a unique domain name (must be
registered) but is often one of many sites hosted on a given
server.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dedicated server hosting _ usually has a unique domain name
and does not share a server with other Web sites. The ISP owns the
server machine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Co-located server hosting _ same as dedicated server hosting,
only you own the server and locate it on the ISP's big Internet
connection.
</P>
<P>
   For personal or small business Web pages, one of the first two
hosting choices is usually adequate. For high-traffic sites that
get thousands of hits per day, one of the latter two types is used.
</P>
<P>
   How do you know if you've chosen the right ISP? The key elements
of Web site hosting performance are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Bandwidth availability _ look for T3 connectivity, multihomed
on multiple Internet backbones
</P>
<P>
   _ Server performance _ look for modern processors, lots of RAM,
experienced hosts and few light-traffic sites sharing the server.
</P>
<P>
   _ Feature options _ look for what you need, such as
database-hosting options, FrontPage extensions, site statistics,
Cybercash.
</P>
<P>
   _ Technical support _ look for 99.99 percent uptime, monitored
servers, 24x7 support, easy File Transfer Protocol access to your
directory, staff that understands Domain Name Server system,
databases, etc.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Create a storyboard of the site:
</P>
<P>
   For each page of the site, make a sketch; or do a layout using a
graphic design program.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about where everything will be placed; that can come
later.
</P>
<P>
   For the home page, note the details you want _ links to other
pages or other sites, an e-mail link, picture, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Choose a commonly found
</P>
<P>
   typeface:
</P>
<P>
   Arial or Times New Roman are good choices for the body text of
your page.
</P>
<P>
   For a graphic element, you can use whatever font you want, but
it will require additional download time.
</P>
<P>
   Caution _ if you use a rarely found computer font, such as Comic
Sans, for the main text of the page, then the text will be
displayed with whatever font the viewer's browser substitutes for
it. Your text and layout will appear different, and possibly even
messed up, to that user.
</P>
<P>
   METATAGS AND ALT-TAGS TOOLS
</P>
<P>
   MetaTags allow you to associate keywords and a site description,
as well as page descriptions, throughout your site. These also
allow search engines to index your site.
</P>
<P>
   Alt-Tags are the text words that appear when a graphic is still
loading. The text appears when you move your mouse over a graphic
or object. Alt-Tags make your site more accessible to text-only
browsers.

 &HT;    Joke sites: Leave 'em laughing
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You may be ready for a good joke after surviving the
holidays and Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   And most of us have a practical need for jokes from time to
time. If you've ever had to make a speech or presentation, you may
have scurried around trying to find a joke to fit a special
occasion. And, oh yes, it needs to be a clean joke.
</P>
<P>
   The Web can be a funny place. Today we'll take a look at sites
that offer collections of jokes. Most have cataloged the jokes by
category. These sites have been specially selected as offering
clean jokes that should be suitable for almost any family. But
since tastes and standards vary, parents will want to examine each
site closely before recommending it to young family members.
</P>
<P>
   A good starting point is a page called Endless Jokes at jokes
</P>
<P>
   .EMPStudios.com/. This site advertises itself as offering
``1,000s of jokes,'' and it seems to live up to that promise. It
has a nifty feature that will make it popular with those who need a
joke for a specific occasion. That attribute is the ability to
search the joke collection for keywords. So whether you're making a
speech to insurance agents, farmers or airline pilots, you should
get help at this site.
</P>
<P>
   Just A Joke Network is located at justajoke.net/ and, like many
of the sites we'll visit, it also catalogs jokes. But there are
some features here that set this page apart. One is the new-joke
section. Since jokes seem to move faster nowadays _ partially
because of the Internet itself, where jokes are the subject of
countless e-mails each day _ this section gives you a chance to
keep current, to be the first at your office to tell a new joke.
For those who don't want to log on to the site each day but would
like to get a joke, there's a subscription service (free) from the
site. Just sign up, and you'll get a new joke by e-mail every day.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the Clean Joke Page, run by a fellow who seems
to worry that clean jokes are in short supply. In meek tones, he
notes ``the expectation is that this category should grow very
little over time. There just are not that many clean jokes out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a fairly good supply of jokes here, at
www.mjb.org/jokes/clean
</P>
<P>
   /index.shtml. Some of them are funny. The trouble is that the
jokes are not cataloged by subject, so _ if you're looking for a
specific joke _ you'll have to take potluck.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of a site called 123Humor isn't in the quality or
quantity of the jokes, which is adequate in both cases. The thing
that sets this page at www.123humor.com/ apart is a section of
one-liners. While jokes are often lengthy and require a decent
memory and adequate delivery, a one-liner is easy to remember and
often is just the thing needed for a speech. Here are two examples:
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is better than poverty, if only for financial reasons.''
_ Woody Allen
</P>
<P>
   ``If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. Then quit.
There's no use being a damn fool about it.'' _ W.C. Fields
</P>
<P>
   The final site is geared specially to families and kids. That's
important since some jokes _ even clean ones _ are just too
grown-up for some occasions or audiences. So bookmark a place
called Scatty's Place at www.scatty.com/. Like many of the other
sites, the jokes are cataloged by topic, but where else would you
find a selection of ``big cat'' jokes.
</P>
<P>
   What's a ``big cat'' joke? Here's one: What happened when the
lion ate the comedian ? He felt funny.

 &HT;    Many sites adept at covering politics like a spectator sport
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Did you know John McCain has seven children? Did you
know George W. Bush has raised about $57 million for his
presidential campaign? Did you know Time Warner has a political
action committee? Did you know anesthesiologists have a political
action committee? And do you know if any of your neighbors have
donated to any of them?
</P>
<P>
   You would if you were checking out Politicaljunkie.com, a Web
site that's been around a while but only recently shifted into high
gear with so many facts, figures, news and notes about the 2000
elections that they can hardly be crammed onto one page.
</P>
<P>
   Done up in weird shades of blue and bright green, this is
definitely not politics as usual. It's easy, it's accessible and,
for people who really aren't political junkies, it makes
complicated issues comprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   An especially interesting feature of the Politicaljunkie Web
site is a function that allows users to enter a ZIP code or even a
person's last name, for which it will return a list of political
donors in that ZIP code or with that name, how much they've donated
and to whom.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the ``politics as usual'' articles, there are
also quirky tidbits like Dweezil Zappa donating money to Vice
President Al Gore's campaign. Zappa's father, Frank, was one of
Tipper Gore's harshest critics when she proposed banning records
with questionable lyrics in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   This is definitely not your father's election year. Even if you
spend no more than five minutes on the Web, you can have
politicaljunkie.com e-mail you a daily briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing politics to the people was the dream of the late John
F. Kennedy Jr., who founded the hard-copy magazine George. As
George evolved, it was heavier on celebrities than on politics, but
Kennedy was still the first to make the point that politics really
is a spectator sport.
</P>
<P>
   There really is no better year than this one to discover that he
was on to something.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Communications analyst Preston Dodd says that when news
breaks, it will break on the Web. If you want to hear the latest
pop-culture quiz put to Bush or want to witness former Sen. Bill
Bradley and Gore taking their weekly potshots at each other over
Social Security, you'll probably be able to find a transcript and
analysis, or perhaps a video, on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Politicaljunkie.com tries to make politics easy to read and
digest, but it's not the only Web site with an approachable,
readable style that's likely to appeal to Web surfers just looking
for a quick political hit.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the Democratic National Committee has a little bit
of attitude on its Web site, www.democrats.org.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans may not like it, but the ``Bush Stump Speech Search
Engine'' is funny and may actually get people to read selections
from the Republican candidate's stump speeches on the DNC site.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee, www.rnc.com, responds in kind
with ``The World According to Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   These online slings and arrows are not really attack ads, but
they do make their points with a little bit of humor and attitude.
It's always important when reading materials on clearly partisan
Web sites such as those from the RNC, DNC or the candidates
themselves to consider the source before nodding your head in
agreement. There are many, many places to look for alternate
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Many newspapers such as The Washington Post and the Cox chain
have also set up extensive sites devoted to political news,
analysis and opinion designed for the serious political news junkie
who really wants to delve into the intricate workings of
presidential politics. (Cox newspapers include The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, published by Cox Enterprises.)
</P>
<P>
   The Web also brings lots of people into the political process
who don't normally pay much attention until the primary hits their
home state.
</P>
<P>
   However, on the Web, every voter can watch the high jinks going
on up in New Hamphire via local Web sites, such as the legendary
and conservative Manchester Union Leader (www
</P>
<P>
   .unionleader.com) and WMUR-TV (www.wmur.com), which has teamed
up with CNN to provide in-depth analysis of the New Hampshire
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On these sites, voters from all over the country can find out
what messages the candidates are sending to voters in the nation's
first primary, take a look at their TV ads and read commentary from
a wide variety of sources.
</P>
<P>
   The largest newspaper in the region, The Boston Globe at www
.boston.com, also has daily political coverage of the New Hampshire
madness and even has polls everyone can vote in _ not just people
from New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, voting early and often in online polls during the
election season is highly recommended, as it might get one in the
mood for actually getting out of the house to vote for real by the
time November rolls around.

 &HT;    Inexpensive printer targets young girls
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you're a young lady with a new computer or
someone who has such a young lady in the family, you have until the
end of the month to buy a Barbie printer at a significant discount.
</P>
<P>
   Apollo, a division of Hewlett-Packard, normally sells its Barbie
model printer for $89.99. But you can get a $40 rebate on printer
purchases made by Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard, one of the best-known computer accessory
companies, started marketing its inexpensive Apollo line last year.
The Apollo printers use HP Inkjet Technology like models costing
several hundred dollars, but they sell for less than $100.
</P>
<P>
   The Barbie printer is pink and white and comes with Barbie
decals to decorate the printer body. It comes packaged with a
Barbie Hair Styler CD-ROM that allows girls to experiment with
onscreen hairstyles for Barbie characters.
</P>
<P>
   The printer is not as fast and doesn't have the resolution of
more expensive models, but it's designed to handle the homework,
play and craft projects its young owners probably are interested
in. It can produce low-resolution color drafts at a rate of 1.5
pages per minute, and its highest color resolution is 300 by 300
dots per inch.
</P>
<P>
   Apollo printers offer easy set-up through the computer's
parallel port, and the installation process is guided by onscreen
help prompts. Apollo also offers round-the-clock toll free
telephone support.
</P>
<P>
   Apollo printers are being marketed nationally through Office
Depot, Wal-Mart and Best Buy stores. You can get additional
information, including online shopping sources, by visiting
www.myapollo.com.

 &HT;    Y2K provided a painless lesson about preparedness
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There you are with a bathtub full of drinking water,
114 pounds of basmati rice stacked in the basement, sitting beside
the cases of Beanie Weenies. You have more batteries than a Radio
Shack store and a year-and-a-half supply of toilet paper.
</P>
<P>
   Don't feel silly if you prepared for a Y2K disaster that did not
come. Instead, let's all be grateful that the billions of dollars
spent fixing the problem weren't wasted. Remember that some
problems can, and probably will, still crop up.
</P>
<P>
   What I am hoping is that all of us learned some things that will
be more important than the Y2K computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   On the personal side, you learned that the world is still an
iffy place to live and that it's smart to be ready for disaster.
While the trains ran on schedule, the airplanes stayed in the sky
and the ATMs cranked out money, there will be a day when the lights
go off at your home. Whether it's a power outage (caused by a
poorly driven Mustang colliding with a utility pole or a bolt of
lightning), or a tornado (if you live in the South, you've been
around one or know someone who has), or an ice storm, those Beanie
Weenies can come in handy.
</P>
<P>
   And, for a computer user, there were plenty of lessons to be
learned.
</P>
<P>
   One of those lessons is that it's dumb to believe that the
information in your PC is safe.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people who had never backed up the precious data in
their machines did it for the first time, spurred by Y2K fears.
That's a really good idea, because the hard disk that holds all
that information isn't as sturdy as a tablet of stone. Instead,
it's a rather clunky mechanical/electrical device. If hard disks
had tattoos, those tattoos would say ``Born to Die.''
</P>
<P>
   Someday, your hard disk will crash. And when it does, it'll take
all your income tax records, your most precious correspondence and
your family budget with it. So it's just good sense to prepare for
that time by making a backup copy of the information on it.
</P>
<P>
   I know it's popular nowadays to use the built-in backup program
that comes with your PC and to copy all the data onto a tape or Zip
drive or even old-fashioned floppy disks. Don't get me wrong.
That's sure better than nothing. But it only protects you from a
data loss caused by a hard disk problem. If your home burns down,
or is destroyed by a tornado, it's likely that the backup copies of
your information will die with it.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that Y2K did was remind us of how important all that
data are. So maybe it's time for you to imitate businesses and
store the copy of your information off-site. That way if disaster
does strike, you'll still have the information. The good news is
that you can do that at no cost. Web sites are cropping up that
offer free storage on their computers. You just register at one of
these sites and upload your information to their computers. If you
do a search (use the keywords ``free,'' ``storage,'' ``online'' and
``backup''), you'll likely find plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Or, I can steer you toward one free one that I've used, called
FreeBack at www.freeback.com. It offers 50 megabytes of free
storage.
</P>
<P>
   That may not sound like a lot in these days of 10-gigabyte and
larger hard disks, but remember that you only need to store your
data, not the programs themselves.
</P>
<P>
   And 50 megabytes will store more tax records than are generated
in my entire hometown of Arkadelphia, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   So far we've talked about the practical lessons of Y2K. But
there are some philosophical ones, too.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us learned that these technology tools of ours are not
likely to take over all human tasks any time soon. A human is still
needed at the controls.

 &HT;    Dell's direct line to the futureBy Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The story of Dell Computer Corp. and Michael
Dell, its 34-year-old founder, chairman and chief executive, is
sprinkled liberally with superlatives like ``first,'' ``most'' and
``youngest.''
</P>
<P>
   The company was the first big company to sell computers via the
Internet and the most profitable personal computer maker in the
'90s. Along the way, Michael Dell became the youngest CEO to lead
his company into the Fortune 500 and by far the richest American
younger than 40.
</P>
<P>
   Now Dell can add to the list the title of best-performing stock
on the Nasdaq exchange in the 1990s. Shares of the Round Rock,
Texas, company appreciated 88,000 percent in the past decade. One
hundred dollars invested in Dell stock 10 years ago and held
through all seven splits would have grown to $88,000 today. During
the 1990s, which the personal computing industry might remember as
the Decade of Dell, the company evolved from upstart PC maker to
No. 1 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's success forced bigger rivals to copy parts of its direct
sales approach. And Michael Dell, once an introverted entrepreneur
who seemed uncomfortable in front of an audence, is now regarded
as a guru of e-commerce. Even giants of the Industrial Age, such as
Ford Motor Co., are seeking his guidance on doing business over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of exuberant expectations, the question inevitably
comes up: What can Dell do for an encore?
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dell _ intense, driven and curious himself about what
his company can achieve _ has no plans to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   He believes Dell can ship four times as many computers in 2004
as it did in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to increase our market share from only 9 percent
last year to only 20 percent, which is probably a goal that's too
low, that would be 47 million units for Dell in 2004,'' Dell said
in an interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   That goal, modest or not, is based on his expectation that
worldwide personal computer sales will soar 69 percent by 2004 and
that Dell will account for more than half of that growth.
</P>
<P>
   But then Michael Dell, who will be 35 on Feb. 23, may be the
most bullish executive in the personal computer industry. He
derides talk of the ``post-PC era'' as ``nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is whether a company can grow and expand,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   MORE OF A CURIOSITY
</P>
<P>
   These days, it's common to hear about young techheads launching
Internet-based start-ups in cramped offices and becoming
multimillionaires when they sell stock to the public. They are
riding the financial tsunami created by Wall Street's infatuation
with electronic commerce and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dell didn't have the Internet to inspire him for the
first 11 years of Dell Computer's existence. Instead, he invented a
radical new way of doing business that conveniently realizes its
full potential on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He recognized the opportunity early on and seized it. But it was
serendipity, too, a necessary ingredient in every story of
phenomenal success. It didn't hurt that the establishment in the
personal computer industry viewed Dell as more of a curiosity than
a threat in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists believed that the then-Austin company's new idea
to sell computers directly to customers would fail in key segments
of the market, such as corporations. After all, big companies had
never bought computers directly from the manufacturer before.
</P>
<P>
   The nerdy college dropout, complete with pocket protector and
black horn-rimmed glasses, was convinced that companies would grab
the chance to order a computer configured the way they wanted at a
lower cost and with better service than the big companies offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically had the foresight to break the rules of
traditional business, and we came up with a new set of rules that
were very effective for us,'' Dell said last week. ``And we stuck
by them.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time bigger competitors understood the threat, sometime
in the middle of the decade, the Texas upstart was too big _ and
had too much momentum _ to stop.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half of 1999, Dell achieved his goal and overtook
archrival Compaq Computer Corp. as the top seller of personal
computers in the United States, the world's biggest market.
</P>
<P>
   The research and consulting firm, International Data Corp., said
in a report on the third quarter of 1999 that Dell is closing in on
No. 1 worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dell continued its long march to market dominance,'' the
December report said. ``For the first time, the Austin-based dynamo
outstripped Compaq in a worldwide category: the commercial desktop
segment.''
</P>
<P>
   HISTORY OF THE COMPANY
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dell likes to recount a revelation he had in 1982, when
he was still a high school senior in Houston. While upgrading
friends' computers for spending money, he figured out that IBM's
machines were selling for $3,000, but contained less than $700 in
parts. And he could buy the same parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only was there a high price markup from the dealer to the
customer, but there was an even higher markup from the manufacturer
to the dealer,'' Dell recalls in his book ``Direct from Dell:
Strategies that Revolutionized an Industry,'' published last year.
</P>
<P>
   He enrolled in pre-med courses at the University of Texas in the
fall of 1983, where the computer hobby became his life's dream. By
January 1984, a month shy of his 19th birthday, Dell was moving
more than $50,000 a month in upgraded computers and parts through
his dormitory room in Jester Hall. In the spring, he incorporated
his business as PC's Limited and dropped out of college.
</P>
<P>
   As the 1990s began, the company now called Dell Computer Corp.
had sales of $546 million, $27 million in profit and 2,000
Austin-area employees _ a tenth of its current work force.
</P>
<P>
   Like Southwest Airlines, whose lower-cost operation allows it to
undercut prices of traditional carriers, Dell's success highlighted
the shortcomings of its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, computer makers went about their business in
the time-honored fashion: forecast what customers wanted, buy huge
stocks of inventory to build to those forecasts and mark up prices
to cover the costs of buying and holding the inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, meanwhile, was hearing what customers actually wanted
because it dealt with them directly. It avoided costly inventories
of parts and completed machines because it only made computers
ordered and paid for in advance. The result was less-costly
computers and better service. Moreover, working closely with
suppliers allowed Dell to avoid designing and making components
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we hadn't done any one of those, I don't think we would be
where we are today,'' Dell said.
</P>
<P>
   While they scoffed at first, as far back as 1992, Compaq and
others were hedging their bets against Dell and trying to copy
aspects of the direct model.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem was they didn't understand what we were doing, and
they set it up wrong and it failed,'' Dell said. ``I think this
business of continuously not understanding what the threat is has
been going on for a long time. I think it even goes on today.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, other companies have acknowledged that they have to
compete on Dell's terms.
</P>
<P>
   IBM last year pulled its consumer line out of retail. Last week,
Compaq paid $370 million for a distribution system that will allow
some of its biggest customers to order what they want and check
order status on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   In a clear admission of Dell's impact, Compaq President Mike
Capellas said the direct system should increase the company's
sagging profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be better equipped to meet the diverse and changing
needs of our U.S. customers, particularly our major accounts, which
clearly want to go direct,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   IDC, the research firm, said Dell's third-quarter revenue grew
twice as fast as its nearest competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Texas juggernaut continued to be the biggest share taker
of the total dollar pie,'' IDC said. ``Evidence also indicated
that, as a group, direct vendors ... gained ground on indirect
vendors.''
</P>
<P>
   NOT EVERYTHING WORKED
</P>
<P>
   Even in the fiercely intense world of high-tech companies, Dell
stands out. And like its accomplishments, its mistakes stemmed from
a relentless drive to grow.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Michael Dell saw an industry consolidation coming. He
believed smaller companies such as his would be relegated to niche
markets, if they survived at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had stayed a small PC company, we would have been
killed,'' Dell said in his book. He was right about consolidation,
but hypergrowth in 1992 threatened Dell.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq started a price war in 1992 with a new line of computers
that undercut the competition. Dell responded with 49 new products,
including the Dimension line of desktop computers for small
businesses and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue shot up 127 percent and profits doubled. In April 1992,
the board of directors authorized a three-for-two stock split, the
company's first. Dell doubled its worldwide market share to 3.5
percent and elbowed its way from 11th to fifth among computer
makers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, struggling Northgate Computer Corp. was forced to
sell out to a rival, and debt-laden Packard Bell Electronics Inc.
postponed a public stock offering. Several electronics companies,
including the Magnavox division of Philips Electronics N.V. and
Korea's Goldstar, gave up selling PCs under their own labels.
</P>
<P>
   Dell was bigger, but in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit the wall in spectacular fashion and splintered into
thousands of pieces,'' Dell said in the book. ``And we had to pick
them all up and learn some new lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   Scrambling to get overwhelmed systems up to the new speed, the
company ran into more problems in 1993. Cash was tight and Dell was
forced to cancel a planned secondary public stock offering when its
stock price weakened.
</P>
<P>
   PC Magazine named Michael Dell its Man of the Year in the fall
of 1993. It cited Dell Computer's innovative sales, service and
manufacturing systems, which gave customers more choices.
</P>
<P>
   Dell lost $76 million in the spring of 1993, including $39.3
million on notebook computer projects, abandoned because they would
have been behind the curve by the time they hit the market. It
finished the year with a $39.6 million loss _ the only time in the
company's history that it lost money.
</P>
<P>
   Other problems loomed.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1993, the Bureau of Export Administration of the U.S.
Commerce Department subpoenaed records of Dell's sales to Russia,
Iran, Iraq and Ireland. All investigations except the Iran sales
were closed without any findings of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996, Dell paid $50,000 to settle a civil complaint. The
company acknowledged that in 1992, it mistakenly shipped 15 PCs to
Iran, which the U.S. government said had ties to terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to Dell's 1993 woes, Compaq was making a stunning
turnaround by cutting costs and overhauling marketing and
manufacturing strategies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the company paid $13.4 million to settle a lawsuit by a
group of shareholders who alleged that Dell withheld information
when it was losing money in the spring of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But Dell roared back financially in 1994. GOOD CAME OF BAD
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, 1994 was a major turning point for Dell. Seeds
were sown for the unprecedented growth and prosperity of the second
half of the decade, including six two-for-one stock splits.
</P>
<P>
   At 29, Michael Dell knew his company needed stronger management.
He recruited Mort Topfer, recently retired from Motorola Inc., as
vice chairman in May 1994. The avuncular Topfer guided the company
in critical areas such as long-range planning and overseas
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Dell ended its two-year experiment with retail sales.
Sales were strong, the company said, but profit was weak.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Dell started a Web site that allowed Internet-savvy
customers to get technical support. But a number of customers told
Dell they wanted to choose a computer and its specific features and
price alternatives online.
</P>
<P>
   It was another example of how Dell's customers helped it evolve.
</P>
<P>
   Dell allowed that late in 1995, and although it still took a
phone call to close the sale, customers' responses to Dell.com
convinced Michael Dell that the Internet was a natural extension of
the direct model.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing more direct is mental telepathy,'' he has said
more than once.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1996, Dell's online sales were $1 million a day.
Three years later, Dell.com brings in more than $35 million a day.
</P>
<P>
   BUILDING A TEAM
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dell, the longest-tenured CEO of a technology company,
was often dubbed an upstart, wunderkind or enfant terrible for the
way his company made life difficult for seasoned executives at
bigger companies, such as Compaq, IBM and Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's survival at the top and his evolution from entrepreneur
to chief executive is directly related to his willingness to
acknowledge areas where he needs help and to hire people to provide
it.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dell says that trying to hire good managers when the
company was still seen as a high risk was a ``tremendous
obstacle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of going to work for a small company was not very
attractive to a lot of people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stock options, now a common recruiting lure for high-tech
companies, were not well understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people, when you gave them a stock option, thought you
were trying to trick them,'' he said. ``We'd explain it and they
would say, `What was that again?'''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Dell offered options as a way to keep employees. It
gave all employees 200 stock options and said new hires during the
next 10 quarters would also get them. The options allow employees
to buy 20 percent annually for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Senior executives are hired with similar incentives, except
their options run in the hundreds of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years Dell's drive remained, and it has infused the
company's culture, friends and associates said.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Winstead, an Austin lawyer who has done both business and
personal work for Dell, recalls getting an e-mail recently from him
in which he confessed, ``I was born impatient.''
</P>
<P>
   The intensity and the pace at the company _ where Dell works
standing up rather than sitting at a desk _ can be trying for
employees. The company uses precise measurements that compare goals
with actual performance. Raises, bonuses and job security are tied
to meeting ambitious goals.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Gregoire, at the time Dell's senior vice president and
chief information officer, told fellow CIOs at a meeting last year
that Dell is a ``very driven and demanding place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a growth trajectory that has us processing 60 percent
more transactions than we were processing just 12 months ago and
has us growing by at least that over the next 12 months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gregoire had been a chief information officer for about 24
years, including 10 at Pepsi Cola Co., before joining Dell. He
retired in October, at age 47, to raise horses on his Austin-area
ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that anything I have ever done up until now did
much to prepare me for what I'm experiencing at Dell,'' he said
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Topfer recently announced he would retire in two years, but
executive-level turnover has not been a problem. Of 11 vice
presidents in 1995, seven are still with Dell. Steve Dube, of the
New York stock firm Wasserstein Pirella &AMP; Co., says Dell has the
strongest management team in the industry. Compaq, for example,
replaced at least five senior executives in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The stability includes the man at the top. Rod Canion at Compaq
and Steve Jobs at Apple Computer Inc. were fired within 10 years of
starting their companies. Michael Dell, who still owns about 14
percent of the company, has been at the helm for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   DELL VS. COMPAQ
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's rise in the mid-'90s as the No. 1 personal computer
maker made it a natural target for Dell, which wants to be first in
every segment of the industry. The two Texas companies became more
than rivals during the '90s _ they became enemies. Dell's success
played a role in the firing of Canion in 1991, after the company
suffered its first quarterly loss.
</P>
<P>
   Eckhard Pfeiffer, who succeeded Canion as CEO and helped build
Compaq into a global power, seemed at times to be obsessed with
Dell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to use this word `direct' in any form,'' Pfeiffer told
Computer Reseller News in May 1997, when asked about Compaq's plans
to fight Dell on Dell's turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk about trying to duck a problem,'' Dell said last week
about the comment, which he had not heard before.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer was fired last April as Compaq faced huge losses and
damaged credibility on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dell is unfazed by the attacks of his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having an enemy in the business is not all bad. It gives you
some focus,'' he said, ``but I think the primary focus really has
to be on the customers.''
</P>
<P>
   THE INTERNET OPPORTUNITY
</P>
<P>
   While competitors tried to mimic Dell's model, Dell further
exploited the Internet. Suppliers use the Web to monitor orders
from Dell customers as they come in. This link with customers
through Dell tells them when to deliver more components, which in
turn allows Dell to store and pay for minimal inventory.
</P>
<P>
   The server business provides a telling example of the benefits
of what Michael Dell calls ``virtual integration'' and the direct
model.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the company decided to launch a major effort to sell
servers, which are powerful computers that connect networks of
terminals and Web sites. It was an industry secret that Compaq,
which invented the server business, and IBM and Hewlett-Packard
were counting on fat profit margins for servers to subsidize
less-profitable products such as desktops and notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   By the third quarter of 1997, Dell's servers and workstations
accounted for 10 percent of its sales, or nearly $300 million.
Analysts agreed that Dell forced competitors to drop prices on
servers about 15 percent, which further squeezed their profits.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, with results like that, Dell regularly blew past Wall
Street's expectations. The years 1996-98 were most responsible for
the extraordinary appreciation of Dell stock.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, Dell opened a manufacturing plant in Penang,
Malaysia, to serve the Asia-Pacific countries and added a second
plant in Limerick, Ireland, to supply its rapidly growing European
business.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion continued last year. Dell opened new plants in
Austin; Nashville, Tenn; Limerick; Xiamen, China; and Eldorado do
Sul, Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The late entry into the server market underscores another Dell
strategy. It has rarely been a leader in technology, relying on
standard components and features, most notably Intel processors and
Microsoft operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech last year, Dell said standardization makes it
difficult for brands to stand out on performance alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the information industry matures and the companies in it
become more fully developed, product differentiation is becoming
more difficult to achieve,'' he said. ``It will give way to process
innovation as the fundamental source of competitive advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Silicon Valley, which became the birthplace of the
information revolution through technological brilliance and product
innovation, sees Dell as a leader in the Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its responsiveness to customers has been the envy of the
industry out here,'' said Regis McKenna, the Silicon Valley
marketing guru whose clients have included many of the industry's
best-known companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years (Silicon Valley) was focused on engineering,'' he
said. ``In the past five to seven years out here, there's been a
real appreciation for marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   With rapidly growing acceptance of the Internet and new devices
to access it appearing constantly, Michael Dell maintains that the
Internet secures the personal computer's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have every imaginable device known to mankind, because I
like to play with all this stuff,'' he said. ``But devices like
Web-enabled telephones, with tiny inch-high screens,'' he says,
``will not replace the PC.''

 &HT;    Return of software developers the best indication Mac is back
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two years ago this month, Apple announced it had lost
$1 billion and was laying off tens of thousands of workers. Few
expected the company to survive, at least independently.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to the annual MacWorld trade expo held last week in
San Francisco. It attracted a record 70,000 attendees, who heard
Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs say the company was selling iMacs
as fast as it could make them.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, sales in 1999 were up more than 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   No one now is predicting anything but continued success for
Apple and Mac in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest testament to the Mac's comeback is the return of
big-name software developers such as IBM. The computer giant
announced at MacWorld that it would soon release a Mac version of
its Via Voice software, which enables computers to translate the
spoken word into text.
</P>
<P>
   Via Voice, along with Dragon Naturally Speaking, have long been
available for PCs. Dragon also plans to release Naturally Speaking
for the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   While the biggest example, IBM was hardly alone. Fifty of
MacWorld's 500 exhibitors were new to the show. Three-quarters of
them were displaying either a new product or an upgrade to an old
one.
</P>
<P>
   That may not sound like much, but two years ago most developers
had stopped making Mac software altogether.
</P>
<P>
   While Apple has come a long way in the past two years, it still
faces many challenges. For one, playing the loyal opposition _ and
doing so profitably _ is an ever-daunting role.
</P>
<P>
   Apple will have to come up with a sequel to its popular iMac to
remain strong. It's a lot harder than it looks to dream up and make
the next cool computer device.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers believe that Apple's next great computing device
should not be a desktop computer or even a laptop. Rather, they
want the company to build a competitor to the Palm Pilot and other
hand-held computers, which are taking an ever-growing share of the
computing market.
</P>
<P>
   Another big challenge for Apple this year will be the release of
a new operating system called OS X. This is not an incremental
upgrade, such as OS 9, but a radical rebuilding of the software
that runs the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to greatly increase speed and stability. Under OS X,
the Mac will finally get memory protection and pre-emptive
multitasking. It will also be better able to handle video and sound
clips.
</P>
<P>
   Developing OS X has been a huge engineering challenge. Marketing
it will be just as great a challenge for Apple.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it will remain a fun and exciting year to follow both
Apple and the Mac.

 &HT;    In the digital house of the future, gadgets will work from one
console
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Get a sneak preview of the digital house of the
future, at least for the rich, in the January issue of PC
Computing. In an article titled ``The Totally Digital House,'' the
magazine runs down major electronic improvements on the way. They
include things like the Panja 1000. It's a housewide system that
lets you control every electronic device in a home from one place
with the click of a button. Or IBM's Smart Start, a digital network
system built into the house during construction.
</P>
<P>
   As everyone knows, the Internet is changing the way many
companies do business. Authors Arthur B. Sculley and W. William A.
Woods chronicle those changes in a book, ``B2B Exchanges.'' The
authors make the bold claim that the rise of electronic commerce
will force most businesses to reinvent themselves. Published by ISI
Publications, ``B2B Exchanges'' retails for $27.50.
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   DeLorme, publisher of electronic atlases, has released the
latest version of Street Atlas USA for the Macintosh. This version,
labeled 6.0, features updated road information and the highlighting
of one-way roads in major cities. DeLorme has also improved its
door-to-door route instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Test your knowledge of the outdoors with a new computer CD game
titled ``Cabela's Outdoor Trivia Challenge.'' The game lets one to
three people play against each other or the computer. Questions
cover such topics as ecology, fishing, hunting, outdoor survival
and wildlife. Published by Head-Games, ``Outdoor Trivia Challenge''
is available only for PCs with Windows 95 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of museums are putting representations of their
collections online. An example is the Smithsonian Institution's
American Art Museum. It has posted some 4,000 images online. You
can browse these images randomly or by artist. You'll find this
site at AmericanArt.si.edu/.

 &HT;    Online: Just another way to shop?
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ More people are buying things from Web sites, but they
are buying less, according to a study by the Wharton School of
Business.
</P>
<P>
   The study was the subject of an article this week in
Internetnews.com, www
</P>
<P>
   .internetnews.com/ec-news
</P>
<P>
   /article/0,1087,4272011,00
</P>
<P>
   .html, an online magazine.
</P>
<P>
   This week we learned that America Online customers bought $2.5
billion worth of products during the holidays. While that is double
what AOL subscribers spent the year before, it is still a drop in
the bucket compared with the $70 billion to $80 billion worth of
goods bought from traditional catalog retailers. So, is so-called
electronic commerce going to revolutionize retail, or is it just
the next generation of shopping?
</P>
<P>
   The Wharton study found that the amount of money each person is
spending online is dropping. The study also found that not every
person who tries online shopping likes it. About 15 percent of the
people who tried online shopping in 1997 did not do it again in
1998, according to the study. Half of the people who dropped out in
1998 returned in 1999 to shop online again. Privacy and trust were
the reason most people did not come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The implication is that online shopping is just another way of
shopping,'' said Jerry Lohse, research director of the Wharton
Forum on Electronic Commerce, which sponsors the Wharton Virtual
Test Market.
</P>
<P>
   The report tracks more than 23,000 people, 791 of whom have been
on the panel for three years.
</P>
<P>
   WEB SITE TELLS HOW TO DO BASIC TASKS
</P>
<P>
   Moms and dads can be great sources for learning about how things
work. But more and more of us live far from our families. So where
can you turn for tips on how to do basic stuff?
</P>
<P>
   One Web site, www.learn2
</P>
<P>
   .com, offers step-by-step instructions for how to do a variety
of things, including balance a check book, change the icons on your
Macintosh desktop and read the stock pages in your newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The site includes online courses, which can cost from $10 to
$150 and last between one month and one year.
</P>
<P>
   Also included are bits of advice called ``Learnlets.'' A recent
one dealt with how to smooth clothes without an iron.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have access to an iron and need to take out some
wrinkles, hang the clothes in the bathroom while you take a hot
shower, making sure the door is shut. The steam will smooth many
wrinkles, especially in wool fabrics. Or, as an alternative, you
can use a spray bottle to lightly spray the garment, then shake the
wrinkles out.''
</P>
<P>
   FIRST AID FOR PEOPLE WITH DATING PROBLEMS
</P>
<P>
   If you're under 50, Dear Abby and Ann Landers don't quite cut
it. And Dr. Laura, with her hard-line advice, seems to be atoning
for her past.
</P>
<P>
   So where can you turn for relationship advice? One site, www
</P>
<P>
   .dating911.com: Help for the Datefully Clueless, is worth a
look.
</P>
<P>
   The site is divided into sections: Dating Diaries: Who's Dating
Whom?; the Magic D8-Ball: the Totally Objective Confidence Booster;
Dating Disasters: Think Your Date Went Bad? Think Again; Dating
Basics: Everything You Need to Know; the Columnists: Ask Our
Experts.
</P>
<P>
   The advice is doled out in categories, including the top five
dating dilemmas of all time: ``Stuck in the Friend Zone''; ``Don't
Want to be Ditched''; ``Heartbroken''; ``Boring Relationship'';
``Super Dater''; and the No. 1 dating dilemma, ``Friends Forever.''
</P>
<P>
   An excerpt from the Friends Forever section:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm permanently stuck in the friend zone. I am the prince of
platonic, the queen of complacency. I am the anti-stud, inspiring
anti-passion wherever I go. If one more person tells me what a nice
guy/girl I am, I think I'm going to jump off a bridge. How can I
break out of this rut?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, there's good news and there's bad news. The good news is
that the ``nice guy'' disease is curable. The bad news is you're
not going to have as many friends.

 &HT;    TV plus computer equals a wild world
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Here I sit on a Sunday afternoon, watching the mating
ritual of the crested iguana on the Animal Planet channel and
playing solitaire, all on the same screen. Does it get any better
than this?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, it can get a lot better than this, but we needn't go
into that.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt a lot of you are saying something like ``Oh, come on,
TV cards have been around for years.'' It reminds me of an e-mail I
got last week from a reader in Colorado who found it hard to
believe that a computer expert could make such an ordeal out of
formatting his hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   You, sir, have mistaken me for an expert. I am no expert. I am
comparable to the Brazilian tree frog, which I have just learned
may be mistaken for bird droppings until it moves. I'm here to make
the cyber-inept feel comfortable. Together, we muddle through, like
the African bullfrog, which, I see, squirms its ample rump into the
mud until it is completely encased, thus surviving 10 months of
drought.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having established and even justified my incompetence,
let's return to the subject of television on the computer monitor.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not watching it from a card, but by way of a device called
the Lifeview USB LifeTV box, a snazzy little purple-and-gray box
that plugs into your USB port and your TV antenna or cable
connection. After installing the software, it appears in a little
box about 4 by 5 inches. I suppose it could be made larger, but 4x5
is large enough for iguanas and tree frogs. Adjustment may be
required should I encounter Pamela Anderson Lee or some similar,
larger creature.
</P>
<P>
   Audio comes from the box, although it can be fed into the
computer's audio system. An S-video input, such as you would want
for attaching a video camera, is available. So is software that
will capture still pictures from the video image as well as store
video clips in the computer.
</P>
<P>
   All this is very handy for me, since the memsahib recently
appropriated the computer room TV for her quilting room. This was
fine by me, because I seldom watch television.
</P>
<P>
   A long time ago, I spent a year working in television. A few
days after joining the news operation of a local station, the
assistant news director found me asleep in a video editing room,
the video to be observed bubbling along unviewed. A nice lady, she
worried about me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you all right?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, sure, I'm OK,'' I replied. ``I've just got this little
problem. Every time I watch TV, I go to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   The assistant news director looked at me curiously for a moment.
``Then why did you come to work here?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   So you can see how I only lasted a year.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the USB LifeTV doesn't seem to have lasted even
that long. Upon selecting the URL for the Web site listed on the
box, I arrived at the home of a Southern California pipe vendor's
association. Undaunted, I searched for LifeTV and wound up at an
online computer catalog that said ``Sorry, not selling it anymore.
(Too many bugs.)''
</P>
<P>
   I haven't encountered any bugs yet, although after the frogs
there were a lot of surly baboons and some zebras.
</P>
<P>
   So, there you are, a report full of croaks and whinnies,
signifying nothing. Welcome to the millennium.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: It would be interesting to find out when and
where the idea of ``trick or treat'' at Halloween started. Maybe
L.M. Boyd could find out if you have no luck!
</P>
<P>
   _ C. Arnold
</P>
<P>
   A: You don't need to contact syndicated columnist Louis Malcolm
Boyd. Nearly 2000 years ago in Britain, All Souls' Day celebrants
went ``a-souling'' from house to house asking for cakes. In return,
a prayer for the dead was said. Some farmers feared reprisals by
the Druid god Muck Olla (Hey, what's in a name?) if they did not
give food and tithes to parading masked priests. Over time the
celebrants and priests' places were supplanted by children. For
more about this holiday, pick up Donald Dossey's ``Holiday
Folklore, Phobias and Fun.'' Q: I don't understand child safety
seats. In our van, only the middle rear seat has a seat belt that
can be pulled tight. Other shoulder straps remain loose until an
accident occurs. With these, the child seat slides around. A car we
rented recently had passive shoulder restraints and no seat in
which the child seat could be secured. We can't be the only ones in
America with this problem.
</P>
<P>
   _ C. Turner
</P>
<P>
   A: Newer automobiles, such as those in rental fleets
(post-1996), have seat belts with a lock triggered by pulling the
belt all the way out, reports Pauline Abrego, technician for the
Texas Safe Riders program. You will hear a click when the lock has
been activated. Feed the entire belt into the seat and extend it
out all at once to test for this feature. For older cars you might
need a locking clip. Need more information or a demonstration?
Contact the safety seat hotline at (800) 252-8255.

delivers currencies from 75 countries to your door (free if $500 or
more) the next business day (order before 4 p.m. Central time by
phone, by 2 p.m. online). Armed with any Visa or MasterCard, you
may also order foreign currency or U.S. traveler's checks. One less
stop before that mad dash to the airport. Call (888) CHASE84 or

 &HT;    It's quick and it's painful
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Is there anything more annoying than getting a
parking ticket? Only if it's doled out by one the most annoying
gadgets of them all: electronic parking ticketers. If you haven't
seen one, it looks like one of those oversized walkie-talkies they
used to carry around on the TV show ``S.W.A.T.'' All the meter
maids have to do is type your license plate into the gizmo and
perform a few other deft keystrokes and (ARGH!) instant violation.
No muss, no fuss, no ``Gee, you're crying! I'm going to rip up this
ticket.'' Zing, pow. Fine: $10. Technology at its most annoying.
Just the sight of these things makes us cringe, and that's why they
are the annoying gadgets of the week.

there is absolutely nothing a spinning logo can do to make your

<P>
   People go to a Web site with a question. You have about eight

   Content is king. If you don't have something the audience wants,
they will leave and rarely return.
</P>
<P>
   Design for the user. Research to try to get a feel for how the
viewer will use the site. Build a prototype.
</P>
<P>
   Then get someone representative of your audience, sit that
person down in front of your site and watch. If the design works,
you'll know in a matter of seconds.

<P>
   Expectations from the user are getting higher. The days of
brochure-ware are numbered.

 &HT;    Game shows came back _ how about a variety revival?By Diane
Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service AUSTIN, Texas _ In the wake of ``Who
<TEXT>
Wants To Be a Millionaire,'' all the major networks are hustling
game shows onto the air hoping lightning will strike four times in
the same place.
<P>
   C'mon, guys. What are the odds?
</P>
<P>
   Slimmer than Ally McBeal, but that's typical of copycat-mad
network TV. If I were a programmer, besides trading in my bent and
twisted jalopy for an actual car, the lesson I'd take from the
``Millionaire'' phenomenon is that people are sick of sitcoms and
dramas and hungry for something different. So, I'd browse through
television's old bag of tricks and take a stab at reviving another
genre.
</P>
<P>
   How about a prime-time variety show? Surely viewers wouldn't
mind a little mirth and music in the new millennium. TV's very
first genre and the springboard to fame for legends like Red
Skelton and Sid Caesar is still popular in late night, as Leno,
Letterman and ``Saturday Night Live'' can attest. Why not prime
time? Why couldn't variety be the spice of TV life again?
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of baby boomers, I have fond memories of variety
shows. My father and I laughed like maniacs watching Senor Wences
and his Man in the Box on ``The Ed Sullivan Show'' and Mrs.
Whiggins with that enormous fake rump on ``The Carol Burnett
Show.'' We even yucked it up together in the late '60s (a rarity
for parent-child relations in that era) when Henry Gibson fell off
his trike and Ruth Buzzi slapped lecherous old men on ``Laugh-In.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a supposed variety revival in the '70s, but nobody is
likely to include ``Donny &AMP; Marie'' or ``Sonny &AMP; Cher'' in a list
of all-time greats. Subsequent efforts have been disastrous, the
most recent and expensive being ``Dolly,'' ABC's multimillion
dollar extravaganza starring petite-and-perky Dolly Parton. The
network gave Parton a two-year commitment and touted the show with
a splashy news conference aboard a yacht. It debuted in September
'87 and sank a few months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that you can gather everybody in the living room to
listen to the same comics, variety acts and singers was functional
before rock 'n' roll hit,'' says Robert Thompson, director of
Syracuse University's Center for the Study of Popular Television.
``Rock 'n' roll institutionalized the generation gap and changed
everything. I think the variety show depends on an idea that we
have a unified popular culture in America, which we had in the '50s
but certainly don't have now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bummer. All that makes sense, but I'm not sure I'm convinced. Or
maybe I just don't want to be. ``Carol Burnett'' certainly appealed
to a multigenerational audience, and that was well past the '50s.
It was a huge hit from 1967-79, to be exact. She didn't have rock
bands, but she did have her own hilarious musical numbers and
timeless comedy. Isn't there a cross-generational host or comedy
ensemble out there that would appeal to little old me and my
teen-age children?
</P>
<P>
   ``Today you've got a target-marketed demographic culture,''
Thompson insists. ``The challenge of a variety show is to have
comedy and music guests who will appeal to all demographics. What
star would you have host it? Who are your musical guests _ Michael
Bolton or the Backstreet Boys? Would you have comics in the `South
Park' or the Jay Leno tradition? Finding different acts that appeal
across the board is a tough exercise. I don't know how you'd do it.
If you could, it would be a cultural miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   But ... but wait. I distinctly remember my parents looking
horrified when the Rolling Stones came on ``Ed Sullivan,'' but they
didn't leap up and leave the room. And even though I sometimes
nodded off during the circus acts and opera performances, I came
back to the Really Big Shoo week after week to see the things I did
like.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but network TV was setting the agenda back then,''
Thompson counters. ``There were only three networks, and you really
didn't have a choice. Today if some old geezer is watching a
variety show and Nine Inch Nails comes on, he can turn to the
Fishing Channel.''
</P>
<P>
   All right, I'm about ready to give up the variety show ghost
now. But maybe some adventurous programmer could come up with a
variety show that doesn't try to appeal to everybody, one that aims
at a more specific demographic. Like me. Get Dana Carvey or Julia
Louis-Dreyfus to host, hire a first-rate comedy ensemble, book all
kinds of decrepit and semi-decrepit rockers and let the fun begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``A variety show done in a niche form is a gold mine waiting for
someone to pan,'' Thompson finally agrees. ``But it probably
wouldn't work in prime time where you have to get those huge,
across-the-board ratings. That isn't to say it could never happen.
Maybe there's a masterpiece variety show out there that could bring
millions to the electronic hearth, but it'll be a bit of cultural
wizardry if it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe it's a long shot, but last summer people in the TV
industry snickered when ABC announced it had acquired the rights to
an English quiz show. Sure it's a risk, but with millions of bored
and miserable viewers hungry for something new, why not take it?

 &HT;    Inexpensive printer targets young girls
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you're a young lady with a new computer or
someone who has such a young lady in the family, you have until the
end of the month to buy a Barbie printer at a significant discount.
</P>
<P>
   Apollo, a division of Hewlett-Packard, normally sells its Barbie
model printer for $89.99. But you can get a $40 rebate on printer
purchases made by Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard, one of the best-known computer accessory
companies, started marketing its inexpensive Apollo line last year.
The Apollo printers use HP Inkjet Technology like models costing
several hundred dollars, but they sell for less than $100.
</P>
<P>
   The Barbie printer is pink and white and comes with Barbie
decals to decorate the printer body. It comes packaged with a
Barbie Hair Styler CD-ROM that allows girls to experiment with
onscreen hairstyles for Barbie characters.
</P>
<P>
   The printer is not as fast and doesn't have the resolution of
more expensive models, but it's designed to handle the homework,
play and craft projects its young owners probably are interested
in. It can produce low-resolution color drafts at a rate of 1.5
pages per minute, and its highest color resolution is 300 by 300
dots per inch.
</P>
<P>
   Apollo printers offer easy set-up through the computer's
parallel port, and the installation process is guided by onscreen
help prompts. Apollo also offers round-the-clock toll free
telephone support.
</P>
<P>
   Apollo printers are being marketed nationally through Office
Depot, Wal-Mart and Best Buy stores. You can get additional
information, including online shopping sources, by visiting
www.myapollo.com.

 &HT;    How I launched my Web without losing my sanity
 &HT;    By Brenda Watters
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   12/26/99 Noon: My husband is bent over his sewing machine
downstairs, muttering ``stretch stitch.'' Today is my day for
earnest work on my Web site. I want to post my fiction, including
two complete, but unpublished, thrillers, and nonfiction, which is
mostly journalism. In my wildest dreams, my site will attract an
agent who will call (or e-mail) and say ``I want to represent
you!'' So my engineer-husband sews and I compute.
</P>
<P>
   12/26/99 1 p.m.:
</P>
<P>
   I'm reading ``Make Your Own Web Page!'' by Ted Pedersen and
Francis Moss. The subtitle is ``A Guide for Kids.'' I bought this
book from my second-grader's Scholastic Book Club. I'm not a
techie. When my editor, Gretchen Heber, first OK'd this article,
she dropped ``HTML'' into the conversation several times. Finally,
I asked her: ``What is HTML? Hotmail?'' In response, she may have
sputtered. HTML means HyperText Markup Language. I will write HTML
code to create my Web site. So far, the kid advice is simply
stated. The chapter ``Creating Your Web Site,'' is about site
architecture without mentioning the word architecture. Yet the age
gap between me and its intended readers shows up when the book
suggests I use topics like ``Smelly Things That Are in My Closet,''
or ``The Best Roller Coasters I've Been On.''
</P>
<P>
   12/26/99 2 p.m.:
</P>
<P>
   My kids, Jay, 5, and Ellen, 8, are next door in Jay's bedroom
playing with a castle he got for Christmas. The catapult shoots
cannonballs. Jay launches a ball at a silver-armored knight. The
knight topples over. Jay places him in the dungeon. The Web page
book has a picture of a kid painting a castle tower. Synchronicity.
That's a good sign. Or should I pay more attention to the symbolism
of the dungeon?
</P>
<P>
   12/26/99 3 p.m.:
</P>
<P>
   I've done a practice page using HTML. There is a reason for the
 &QL;  and  &QR; , and the slash, or ``/'', keys. They signal how the copy is
displayed on a Web page. Without trouble, I find and launch an
Internet browser. My success ends. I can't seem to call up my
practice page file. I try Windows Explorer. My file is there, on my
hard drive. I key in an exhaustive address, trying to open my file.
Nothing. I call my husband, John, upstairs. He clicks on the browse
box in the Web browser window. My index.html file is listed. I open
it. My first Web page, with one sentence, is done. I feel like a
country hick. I am in a fancy restaurant with a red bandana around
my neck. I use my dirt-grimed fingers to strip a skewer of beef
kabob. Everyone's watching me.
</P>
<P>
   12/26/99 4 p.m.: To continue the country hick analogy, I am
squealing like a stuck pig. I wallow in delight. I'm writing code.
Headlines and text are popping up on my home page. My confidence
soars. Self-loathing knocks on my happy door, though. Why did I
wait so long to do this? It's easier than I thought to write
programming code. I am giddy with my back-and-forth clicking
between the HTML I write in Microsoft's WordPad and the
browser/translator, Microsoft's Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   12/26/99 5 p.m.: I spent the last hour in ``Hicksville USA''
again. I opened the Web designer software I bought at CompUSA. For
a cheap $29.99, I bought ViaPage by ViaGrafix. I loaded a disk
labeled ``DesignCAD Pro 2000, software demo.'' Nothing happened. I
asked John to help. Cleverly, John, Mr. MSEE (master of science
degree in electrical engineering), quickly found the ``real''
CD-ROM. The disk I'd loaded was just a demo for some other piece of
software. The real ViaPage was disguised in an envelope bearing the
license agreement. Who reads those? I check off the registration
screens. ViaGrafix asks me to rate my computer experience. The
scale is one to 10, with 10 being computer genius. Feeling dejected
and dissed by the demo, the arrow flickers to the one. I
reconsider. I know what Windows Explorer is and I e-mail people. I
choose three. DO YOU SEE WHAT A NONTECH I AM? Ha-ha. I know
uppercase print is shouting in cyberworld. Feebly, I ask my
husband, ``Am I cheating by using software instead of writing
code?'' He reassures me. ``No one writes code. They use tools.''
</P>
<P>
   12/26/99 10 p.m.: I've battled ViaPage for hours. Cheap doesn't
mean better. It doesn't even mean good. The program is full of
bugs. Hyphens and semicolons throw the text onto the next line. My
thoughtful words are amputated, butchered. As I edit my page, the
cursor jumps after one letter is typed. So ``Boulder, Colorado''
comes out looking like Boulidkere. The errors are random.
</P>
<P>
   12/27/99 Noon: My ViaPage frame resembles a field goal _ two
side columns left and right make up the poles, and three center
boxes are frames for my fiction, journalism and biography. My
progress is stymied. The help menu sucks. After a dispirited phone
call, my husband comes home and tries to teach me a few things.
Soon, he takes over the keyboard. On my shoulders, the cartoon
begins: The angel on my right shoulder says, ``This is your
article, you should be doing your own Web page. Stick to the kids
book.'' On my left shoulder, the devil says, ``Let your husband
take over your page, you'll have something decent to show for it
and meet your deadline.'' John returns to his job at Agere. I face
ViaPage alone.
</P>
<P>
   12/27/99 4 p.m.: Definitely, the dungeon was the omen.
</P>
<P>
   12/27/99 9 p.m.: I spent the day sucked into the abyss of
ViaPage. Again, I recruited my husband's help. He translated my
fiction excerpts into HTML. But, the text I hyperlinked to from the
home page fiction ``teaser'' box does not appear on the second page
correctly. Instead, the text is crammed into the same little box as
the fiction teaser. Plus, the pages take an eternity to open. (A
few days later, Katherine Jones of Milkshake Media warned me to
keep my Web pages to 60K or less for optimal download time).
Retreating from my defeat, I read Carson McCullers' 1940 book,
``The Heart is a Lonely Hunter.'' One of the characters, Singer,
who is deaf, is ringed by people who tell him their hearts'
deepest, aching thoughts. Once in a while, Singer scratches out a
few words on paper, but mostly, he just reads lips. His eyes, his
brows, the set of his mouth, how his long hands rest on the table _
these are Singer's communication tools. No fancy Web pages on the
Internet. Singer is a master of empathic listening.
</P>
<P>
   12/28/99 2 p.m.: No more Via-Page. Back to HTML. Kyla Kanz of
OliveDesign called. She asked me if I'm on a PC or a Mac. PC is the
wrong answer, but it's what I have. The PC's Windows environment is
tougher. ``Between Mac and Windows,'' she explained, ``Mac is cut
and paste. You're not doing code.'' She recommends Dreamweaver
software. ``It's not the cheapest,'' she said. ``I find, though,
that the nontechies in our office gravitate to Dreamweaver. It does
a nice job.'' It costs $129. I don't have it.
</P>
<P>
   12/28/99 7 p.m.: Little things mean a lot. While writing code, I
learned that I cannot use an apostrophe after my last name to do
this: Brenda Watters' Home Page. If I do, people searching my page
(especially those agent-people) won't find me. They'll be typing
Watters without the apostrophe. It's a quibble _ grammatically
incorrect, but search engine-friendly. Likewise, I add ``writer''
before my name to attract the agent-people.
</P>
<P>
   12/28/99 8 p.m.: I'm finally past the halfway point in the
``Make Your Own Web Page!'' guide for kids. The girl who stars in
the book, Elena, shares the same name as my daughter. (Ellen signs
her schoolwork with her Spanish name.) At this point, Elena is
adding a drawing to her page. I'm adding a photo, and I've measured
it in pixels. It's way too large, so I've reduced it by half. The
book warns that the proportions between height and width must stay
the same. (The angel on my shoulder is patting my back.) I go back
to the Web browser. There's my picture! I'm so excited.
</P>
<P>
   12/28/99 10:20 p.m.: A friend of mine, Mike Gunter of Database
City, has offered to set up my site and let me use a DB City server
for hosting my pages. I had checked into the AOL offering for
domain registration and Web page hosting, and saw that it had a set
form to produce a Web page. (''Here are three borders, choose one.
Here are suggested interests: Dating online?'') Not for me.
</P>
<P>
   12/29/99 10:20 a.m.: One of my Girl Scout moms (I lead a troop),
a programmer, called me this morning. I told her I was writing HTML
code to create my own Web site. She laughed hysterically. Everyone
does. What is it? Could it be the ``NT'' stamped on my forehead for
nontechie? In the old days, the techs and nontechs were separated
by a dress code. Techs wore white dress shirts and pocket
protectors. Nontechs wore black turtlenecks and jeans. Those were
uniforms. Today, I imagine myself wearing a white lab coat. I am a
mad doctor. I am creating my cobbled-together beast, the Web site.
If only I had a brain. Then my pages could walk and talk!
</P>
<P>
   12/29/99 11:40 a.m.: Elena's pages are about her family and
hobbies. I've built five links from my home page _ one to each of
my novels, a journalism link, a novel-in-progress link and a link
to a page of writing tips. I just finished adding an ``absolute''
link. Using the Austin Writers' League URL, I wrote an anchor tag
in HTML. When Web site visitors click on the league's Web address,
they'll link up with the league's site. I've tried it. It's really
cool. Elena of the book links her site with www.Internet4kids.com.
That's cool for a kid. I've tried, but can't link to it. Is it my
old age? Instead of a parental control block, maybe there's a kid
control block.
</P>
<P>
   12/29/99 8:25 p.m.: I've been working on the railroad, all the
live-long day. Sing it! I've toiled all day for days on end. My
office is overheated by computers blowing hot air. As a final
touch, I added my e-mail address to my home page. Now that I've
accompanied Elena on her Web-site journey, I'm glad I learned to
write HTML code. After all, I am the staff who will update my Web
site. Also, there are enhancements I'd like to do: settle on a
consistent font style, use more colors, add a biography, and
regularly add new excerpts onto the other pages. I got a too-late
tip from John: I can select any site on the Web and use my
browser's ``view source'' command to see the HTML code behind the
glitzy graphics. It's OK to copy the code for my own page _ it's in
the category of fair use under copyright law. Also, the members of
my unofficial advisory board recommend that I use a focus group to
test the way I present information. Calling all agents for a focus
group! In my wildest dreams?

 &HT;    A home for your domainBy Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service ATLANTA _ After your Web site is
<TEXT>
designed, you need to get it on the Internet so it is available to
the world. This service scales according to the seriousness or
commercial objectives of the site. Internet Service Providers
provide several types of hosting:
<P>
   _ Subdirectory hosting _ no unique domain name, just uses a
subdirectory of the host (such as www.dbcity.com/brendawatters) and
the site is one of many on the server computer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Virtual domain hosting _ has a unique domain name (must be
registered) but is often one of many sites hosted on a given
server.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dedicated server hosting _ usually has a unique domain name
and does not share a server with other Web sites. The ISP owns the
server machine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Co-located server hosting _ same as dedicated server hosting,
only you own the server and locate it on the ISP's big Internet
connection.
</P>
<P>
   For personal or small business Web pages, one of the first two
hosting choices is usually adequate. For high-traffic sites that
get thousands of hits per day, one of the latter two types is used.
</P>
<P>
   How do you know if you've chosen the right ISP? The key elements
of Web site hosting performance are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Bandwidth availability _ look for T3 connectivity, multihomed
on multiple Internet backbones
</P>
<P>
   _ Server performance _ look for modern processors, lots of RAM,
experienced hosts and few light-traffic sites sharing the server.
</P>
<P>
   _ Feature options _ look for what you need, such as
database-hosting options, FrontPage extensions, site statistics,
Cybercash.
</P>
<P>
   _ Technical support _ look for 99.99 percent uptime, monitored
servers, 24x7 support, easy File Transfer Protocol access to your
directory, staff that understands Domain Name Server system,
databases, etc.

 &HT;    Tips for Web site development
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Create a storyboard of the site:
</P>
<P>
   For each page of the site, make a sketch; or do a layout using a
graphic design program.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about where everything will be placed; that can come
later.
</P>
<P>
   For the home page, note the details you want _ links to other
pages or other sites, an e-mail link, picture, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Choose a commonly found
</P>
<P>
   typeface:
</P>
<P>
   Arial or Times New Roman are good choices for the body text of
your page.
</P>
<P>
   For a graphic element, you can use whatever font you want, but
it will require additional download time.
</P>
<P>
   Caution _ if you use a rarely found computer font, such as Comic
Sans, for the main text of the page, then the text will be
displayed with whatever font the viewer's browser substitutes for
it. Your text and layout will appear different, and possibly even
messed up, to that user.
</P>
<P>
   METATAGS AND ALT-TAGS TOOLS
</P>
<P>
   MetaTags allow you to associate keywords and a site description,
as well as page descriptions, throughout your site. These also
allow search engines to index your site.
</P>
<P>
   Alt-Tags are the text words that appear when a graphic is still
loading. The text appears when you move your mouse over a graphic
or object. Alt-Tags make your site more accessible to text-only
browsers.

 &HT;    Y2K provided a painless lesson about preparedness
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There you are with a bathtub full of drinking water,
114 pounds of basmati rice stacked in the basement, sitting beside
the cases of Beanie Weenies. You have more batteries than a Radio
Shack store and a year-and-a-half supply of toilet paper.
</P>
<P>
   Don't feel silly if you prepared for a Y2K disaster that did not
come. Instead, let's all be grateful that the billions of dollars
spent fixing the problem weren't wasted. Remember that some
problems can, and probably will, still crop up.
</P>
<P>
   What I am hoping is that all of us learned some things that will
be more important than the Y2K computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   On the personal side, you learned that the world is still an
iffy place to live and that it's smart to be ready for disaster.
While the trains ran on schedule, the airplanes stayed in the sky
and the ATMs cranked out money, there will be a day when the lights
go off at your home. Whether it's a power outage (caused by a
poorly driven Mustang colliding with a utility pole or a bolt of
lightning), or a tornado (if you live in the South, you've been
around one or know someone who has), or an ice storm, those Beanie
Weenies can come in handy.
</P>
<P>
   And, for a computer user, there were plenty of lessons to be
learned.
</P>
<P>
   One of those lessons is that it's dumb to believe that the
information in your PC is safe.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people who had never backed up the precious data in
their machines did it for the first time, spurred by Y2K fears.
That's a really good idea, because the hard disk that holds all
that information isn't as sturdy as a tablet of stone. Instead,
it's a rather clunky mechanical/electrical device. If hard disks
had tattoos, those tattoos would say ``Born to Die.''
</P>
<P>
   Someday, your hard disk will crash. And when it does, it'll take
all your income tax records, your most precious correspondence and
your family budget with it. So it's just good sense to prepare for
that time by making a backup copy of the information on it.
</P>
<P>
   I know it's popular nowadays to use the built-in backup program
that comes with your PC and to copy all the data onto a tape or Zip
drive or even old-fashioned floppy disks. Don't get me wrong.
That's sure better than nothing. But it only protects you from a
data loss caused by a hard disk problem. If your home burns down,
or is destroyed by a tornado, it's likely that the backup copies of
your information will die with it.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that Y2K did was remind us of how important all that
data are. So maybe it's time for you to imitate businesses and
store the copy of your information off-site. That way if disaster
does strike, you'll still have the information. The good news is
that you can do that at no cost. Web sites are cropping up that
offer free storage on their computers. You just register at one of
these sites and upload your information to their computers. If you
do a search (use the keywords ``free,'' ``storage,'' ``online'' and
``backup''), you'll likely find plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Or, I can steer you toward one free one that I've used, called
FreeBack at www.freeback.com. It offers 50 megabytes of free
storage.
</P>
<P>
   That may not sound like a lot in these days of 10-gigabyte and
larger hard disks, but remember that you only need to store your
data, not the programs themselves.
</P>
<P>
   And 50 megabytes will store more tax records than are generated
in my entire hometown of Arkadelphia, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   So far we've talked about the practical lessons of Y2K. But
there are some philosophical ones, too.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us learned that these technology tools of ours are not
likely to take over all human tasks any time soon. A human is still
needed at the controls.

 &HT;    Joke sites: Leave 'em laughing
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You may be ready for a good joke after surviving the
holidays and Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   And most of us have a practical need for jokes from time to
time. If you've ever had to make a speech or presentation, you may
have scurried around trying to find a joke to fit a special
occasion. And, oh yes, it needs to be a clean joke.
</P>
<P>
   The Web can be a funny place. Today we'll take a look at sites
that offer collections of jokes. Most have cataloged the jokes by
category. These sites have been specially selected as offering
clean jokes that should be suitable for almost any family. But
since tastes and standards vary, parents will want to examine each
site closely before recommending it to young family members.
</P>
<P>
   A good starting point is a page called Endless Jokes at jokes
</P>
<P>
   .EMPStudios.com/. This site advertises itself as offering
``1,000s of jokes,'' and it seems to live up to that promise. It
has a nifty feature that will make it popular with those who need a
joke for a specific occasion. That attribute is the ability to
search the joke collection for keywords. So whether you're making a
speech to insurance agents, farmers or airline pilots, you should
get help at this site.
</P>
<P>
   Just A Joke Network is located at justajoke.net/ and, like many
of the sites we'll visit, it also catalogs jokes. But there are
some features here that set this page apart. One is the new-joke
section. Since jokes seem to move faster nowadays _ partially
because of the Internet itself, where jokes are the subject of
countless e-mails each day _ this section gives you a chance to
keep current, to be the first at your office to tell a new joke.
For those who don't want to log on to the site each day but would
like to get a joke, there's a subscription service (free) from the
site. Just sign up, and you'll get a new joke by e-mail every day.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the Clean Joke Page, run by a fellow who seems
to worry that clean jokes are in short supply. In meek tones, he
notes ``the expectation is that this category should grow very
little over time. There just are not that many clean jokes out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a fairly good supply of jokes here, at
www.mjb.org/jokes/clean
</P>
<P>
   /index.shtml. Some of them are funny. The trouble is that the
jokes are not cataloged by subject, so _ if you're looking for a
specific joke _ you'll have to take potluck.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of a site called 123Humor isn't in the quality or
quantity of the jokes, which is adequate in both cases. The thing
that sets this page at www.123humor.com/ apart is a section of
one-liners. While jokes are often lengthy and require a decent
memory and adequate delivery, a one-liner is easy to remember and
often is just the thing needed for a speech. Here are two examples:
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is better than poverty, if only for financial reasons.''
_ Woody Allen
</P>
<P>
   ``If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. Then quit.
There's no use being a damn fool about it.'' _ W.C. Fields
</P>
<P>
   The final site is geared specially to families and kids. That's
important since some jokes _ even clean ones _ are just too
grown-up for some occasions or audiences. So bookmark a place
called Scatty's Place at www.scatty.com/. Like many of the other
sites, the jokes are cataloged by topic, but where else would you
find a selection of ``big cat'' jokes.
</P>
<P>
   What's a ``big cat'' joke? Here's one: What happened when the
lion ate the comedian ? He felt funny.

 &HT;    Return of software developers the best indication Mac is back
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two years ago this month, Apple announced it had lost
$1 billion and was laying off tens of thousands of workers. Few
expected the company to survive, at least independently.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to the annual MacWorld trade expo held last week in
San Francisco. It attracted a record 70,000 attendees, who heard
Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs say the company was selling iMacs
as fast as it could make them.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, sales in 1999 were up more than 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   No one now is predicting anything but continued success for
Apple and Mac in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest testament to the Mac's comeback is the return of
big-name software developers such as IBM. The computer giant
announced at MacWorld that it would soon release a Mac version of
its Via Voice software, which enables computers to translate the
spoken word into text.
</P>
<P>
   Via Voice, along with Dragon Naturally Speaking, have long been
available for PCs. Dragon also plans to release Naturally Speaking
for the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   While the biggest example, IBM was hardly alone. Fifty of
MacWorld's 500 exhibitors were new to the show. Three-quarters of
them were displaying either a new product or an upgrade to an old
one.
</P>
<P>
   That may not sound like much, but two years ago most developers
had stopped making Mac software altogether.
</P>
<P>
   While Apple has come a long way in the past two years, it still
faces many challenges. For one, playing the loyal opposition _ and
doing so profitably _ is an ever-daunting role.
</P>
<P>
   Apple will have to come up with a sequel to its popular iMac to
remain strong. It's a lot harder than it looks to dream up and make
the next cool computer device.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers believe that Apple's next great computing device
should not be a desktop computer or even a laptop. Rather, they
want the company to build a competitor to the Palm Pilot and other
hand-held computers, which are taking an ever-growing share of the
computing market.
</P>
<P>
   Another big challenge for Apple this year will be the release of
a new operating system called OS X. This is not an incremental
upgrade, such as OS 9, but a radical rebuilding of the software
that runs the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to greatly increase speed and stability. Under OS X,
the Mac will finally get memory protection and pre-emptive
multitasking. It will also be better able to handle video and sound
clips.
</P>
<P>
   Developing OS X has been a huge engineering challenge. Marketing
it will be just as great a challenge for Apple.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it will remain a fun and exciting year to follow both
Apple and the Mac.

 &HT;    Many sites adept at covering politics like a spectator sport
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Did you know John McCain has seven children? Did you
know George W. Bush has raised about $57 million for his
presidential campaign? Did you know Time Warner has a political
action committee? Did you know anesthesiologists have a political
action committee? And do you know if any of your neighbors have
donated to any of them?
</P>
<P>
   You would if you were checking out Politicaljunkie.com, a Web
site that's been around a while but only recently shifted into high
gear with so many facts, figures, news and notes about the 2000
elections that they can hardly be crammed onto one page.
</P>
<P>
   Done up in weird shades of blue and bright green, this is
definitely not politics as usual. It's easy, it's accessible and,
for people who really aren't political junkies, it makes
complicated issues comprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   An especially interesting feature of the Politicaljunkie Web
site is a function that allows users to enter a ZIP code or even a
person's last name, for which it will return a list of political
donors in that ZIP code or with that name, how much they've donated
and to whom.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the ``politics as usual'' articles, there are
also quirky tidbits like Dweezil Zappa donating money to Vice
President Al Gore's campaign. Zappa's father, Frank, was one of
Tipper Gore's harshest critics when she proposed banning records
with questionable lyrics in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   This is definitely not your father's election year. Even if you
spend no more than five minutes on the Web, you can have
politicaljunkie.com e-mail you a daily briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing politics to the people was the dream of the late John
F. Kennedy Jr., who founded the hard-copy magazine George. As
George evolved, it was heavier on celebrities than on politics, but
Kennedy was still the first to make the point that politics really
is a spectator sport.
</P>
<P>
   There really is no better year than this one to discover that he
was on to something.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Communications analyst Preston Dodd says that when news
breaks, it will break on the Web. If you want to hear the latest
pop-culture quiz put to Bush or want to witness former Sen. Bill
Bradley and Gore taking their weekly potshots at each other over
Social Security, you'll probably be able to find a transcript and
analysis, or perhaps a video, on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Politicaljunkie.com tries to make politics easy to read and
digest, but it's not the only Web site with an approachable,
readable style that's likely to appeal to Web surfers just looking
for a quick political hit.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the Democratic National Committee has a little bit
of attitude on its Web site, www.democrats.org.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans may not like it, but the ``Bush Stump Speech Search
Engine'' is funny and may actually get people to read selections
from the Republican candidate's stump speeches on the DNC site.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee, www.rnc.com, responds in kind
with ``The World According to Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   These online slings and arrows are not really attack ads, but
they do make their points with a little bit of humor and attitude.
It's always important when reading materials on clearly partisan
Web sites such as those from the RNC, DNC or the candidates
themselves to consider the source before nodding your head in
agreement. There are many, many places to look for alternate
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Many newspapers such as The Washington Post and the Cox chain
have also set up extensive sites devoted to political news,
analysis and opinion designed for the serious political news junkie
who really wants to delve into the intricate workings of
presidential politics. (Cox newspapers include The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, published by Cox Enterprises.)
</P>
<P>
   The Web also brings lots of people into the political process
who don't normally pay much attention until the primary hits their
home state.
</P>
<P>
   However, on the Web, every voter can watch the high jinks going
on up in New Hamphire via local Web sites, such as the legendary
and conservative Manchester Union Leader (www
</P>
<P>
   .unionleader.com) and WMUR-TV (www.wmur.com), which has teamed
up with CNN to provide in-depth analysis of the New Hampshire
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On these sites, voters from all over the country can find out
what messages the candidates are sending to voters in the nation's
first primary, take a look at their TV ads and read commentary from
a wide variety of sources.
</P>
<P>
   The largest newspaper in the region, The Boston Globe at www
.boston.com, also has daily political coverage of the New Hampshire
madness and even has polls everyone can vote in _ not just people
from New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, voting early and often in online polls during the
election season is highly recommended, as it might get one in the
mood for actually getting out of the house to vote for real by the
time November rolls around.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Get a sneak preview of the digital house of the
future, at least for the rich, in the January issue of PC
Computing. In an article titled ``The Totally Digital House,'' the
magazine runs down major electronic improvements on the way. They
include things like the Panja 1000. It's a housewide system that
lets you control every electronic device in a home from one place
with the click of a button. Or IBM's Smart Start, a digital network
system built into the house during construction.
</P>
<P>
   As everyone knows, the Internet is changing the way many
companies do business. Authors Arthur B. Sculley and W. William A.
Woods chronicle those changes in a book, ``B2B Exchanges.'' The
authors make the bold claim that the rise of electronic commerce
will force most businesses to reinvent themselves. Published by ISI
Publications, ``B2B Exchanges'' retails for $27.50.

 &HT;    Online: Just another way to shop?
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ More people are buying things from Web sites, but they
are buying less, according to a study by the Wharton School of
Business.
</P>
<P>
   The study was the subject of an article this week in
Internetnews.com, www
</P>
<P>
   .internetnews.com/ec-news
</P>
<P>
   /article/0,1087,4272011,00
</P>
<P>
   .html, an online magazine.
</P>
<P>
   This week we learned that America Online customers bought $2.5
billion worth of products during the holidays. While that is double
what AOL subscribers spent the year before, it is still a drop in
the bucket compared with the $70 billion to $80 billion worth of
goods bought from traditional catalog retailers. So, is so-called
electronic commerce going to revolutionize retail, or is it just
the next generation of shopping?
</P>
<P>
   The Wharton study found that the amount of money each person is
spending online is dropping. The study also found that not every
person who tries online shopping likes it. About 15 percent of the
people who tried online shopping in 1997 did not do it again in
1998, according to the study. Half of the people who dropped out in
1998 returned in 1999 to shop online again. Privacy and trust were
the reason most people did not come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The implication is that online shopping is just another way of
shopping,'' said Jerry Lohse, research director of the Wharton
Forum on Electronic Commerce, which sponsors the Wharton Virtual
Test Market.
</P>
<P>
   The report tracks more than 23,000 people, 791 of whom have been
on the panel for three years.
</P>
<P>
   WEB SITE TELLS HOW TO DO BASIC TASKS
</P>
<P>
   Moms and dads can be great sources for learning about how things
work. But more and more of us live far from our families. So where
can you turn for tips on how to do basic stuff?
</P>
<P>
   One Web site, www.learn2
</P>
<P>
   .com, offers step-by-step instructions for how to do a variety
of things, including balance a check book, change the icons on your
Macintosh desktop and read the stock pages in your newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The site includes online courses, which can cost from $10 to
$150 and last between one month and one year.
</P>
<P>
   Also included are bits of advice called ``Learnlets.'' A recent
one dealt with how to smooth clothes without an iron.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have access to an iron and need to take out some
wrinkles, hang the clothes in the bathroom while you take a hot
shower, making sure the door is shut. The steam will smooth many
wrinkles, especially in wool fabrics. Or, as an alternative, you
can use a spray bottle to lightly spray the garment, then shake the
wrinkles out.''
</P>
<P>
   FIRST AID FOR PEOPLE WITH DATING PROBLEMS
</P>
<P>
   If you're under 50, Dear Abby and Ann Landers don't quite cut
it. And Dr. Laura, with her hard-line advice, seems to be atoning
for her past.
</P>
<P>
   So where can you turn for relationship advice? One site, www
</P>
<P>
   .dating911.com: Help for the Datefully Clueless, is worth a
look.
</P>
<P>
   The site is divided into sections: Dating Diaries: Who's Dating
Whom?; the Magic D8-Ball: the Totally Objective Confidence Booster;
Dating Disasters: Think Your Date Went Bad? Think Again; Dating
Basics: Everything You Need to Know; the Columnists: Ask Our
Experts.
</P>
<P>
   The advice is doled out in categories, including the top five
dating dilemmas of all time: ``Stuck in the Friend Zone''; ``Don't
Want to be Ditched''; ``Heartbroken''; ``Boring Relationship'';
``Super Dater''; and the No. 1 dating dilemma, ``Friends Forever.''
</P>
<P>
   An excerpt from the Friends Forever section:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm permanently stuck in the friend zone. I am the prince of
platonic, the queen of complacency. I am the anti-stud, inspiring
anti-passion wherever I go. If one more person tells me what a nice
guy/girl I am, I think I'm going to jump off a bridge. How can I
break out of this rut?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, there's good news and there's bad news. The good news is
that the ``nice guy'' disease is curable. The bad news is you're
not going to have as many friends.

 &HT;    TV plus computer equals a wild world
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Here I sit on a Sunday afternoon, watching the mating
ritual of the crested iguana on the Animal Planet channel and
playing solitaire, all on the same screen. Does it get any better
than this?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, it can get a lot better than this, but we needn't go
into that.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt a lot of you are saying something like ``Oh, come on,
TV cards have been around for years.'' It reminds me of an e-mail I
got last week from a reader in Colorado who found it hard to
believe that a computer expert could make such an ordeal out of
formatting his hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   You, sir, have mistaken me for an expert. I am no expert. I am
comparable to the Brazilian tree frog, which I have just learned
may be mistaken for bird droppings until it moves. I'm here to make
the cyber-inept feel comfortable. Together, we muddle through, like
the African bullfrog, which, I see, squirms its ample rump into the
mud until it is completely encased, thus surviving 10 months of
drought.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having established and even justified my incompetence,
let's return to the subject of television on the computer monitor.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not watching it from a card, but by way of a device called
the Lifeview USB LifeTV box, a snazzy little purple-and-gray box
that plugs into your USB port and your TV antenna or cable
connection. After installing the software, it appears in a little
box about 4 by 5 inches. I suppose it could be made larger, but 4x5
is large enough for iguanas and tree frogs. Adjustment may be
required should I encounter Pamela Anderson Lee or some similar,
larger creature.
</P>
<P>
   Audio comes from the box, although it can be fed into the
computer's audio system. An S-video input, such as you would want
for attaching a video camera, is available. So is software that
will capture still pictures from the video image as well as store
video clips in the computer.
</P>
<P>
   All this is very handy for me, since the memsahib recently
appropriated the computer room TV for her quilting room. This was
fine by me, because I seldom watch television.
</P>
<P>
   A long time ago, I spent a year working in television. A few
days after joining the news operation of a local station, the
assistant news director found me asleep in a video editing room,
the video to be observed bubbling along unviewed. A nice lady, she
worried about me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you all right?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, sure, I'm OK,'' I replied. ``I've just got this little
problem. Every time I watch TV, I go to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   The assistant news director looked at me curiously for a moment.
``Then why did you come to work here?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   So you can see how I only lasted a year.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the USB LifeTV doesn't seem to have lasted even
that long. Upon selecting the URL for the Web site listed on the
box, I arrived at the home of a Southern California pipe vendor's
association. Undaunted, I searched for LifeTV and wound up at an
online computer catalog that said ``Sorry, not selling it anymore.
(Too many bugs.)''
</P>
<P>
   I haven't encountered any bugs yet, although after the frogs
there were a lot of surly baboons and some zebras.
</P>
<P>
   So, there you are, a report full of croaks and whinnies,
signifying nothing. Welcome to the millennium.

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ MIAMI _ This is a city held hostage. It lives
moment to moment for someone else to say this about 6-year-old
Elian Gonzalez, or that about him. Held above the heads of an area
of close to 2 million is the threat of bottling up Miami's airport,
of closing Miami's shipping and cruise port, of obstructing the
city's streets _ of paralyzing Miami. It is a situation that has
grown out of control. (Kleinberg, Cox News Service) MOVED.

I'm slowing down. In the process, I'm running the risk of getting
run-down. But that's my New Year's resolution, to drive no faster
than 62 mph on the highway, so as not to outpace my aging reflexes.

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ The next time you feel life
closing in on you, remember the Maori and their millenium
celebration. Call a few friends over, break out the face paint, and
head for the creek. At the same time you're warding off demons, you
might just discover a cure for road rage. (Schuett, Cox News

   LANE-COLUMN _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Robert Bowman does have
something of a presidential look. He is gray at the temples, and at
6-foot-4, he is quick to remind me he is the same height as Abraham
Lincoln. He was wearing a standard candidate uniform: gray suit,
red power-tie, scuffed black wingtips and a campaign button the

of him? (Lane, Daytona Beach News-Journal) MOVED

   HEALING-REIKI _ Margaret Knapke is a practitioner of an ancient

cord and the energy flows through her to the person she touches. It
is based on the belief that the human body is more than just
matter; it is an extended energy system. (Dayton Daily News). 30.

   HEALTH-COLUMN _ Time is spent driving to the doctor's office,
waiting in the waiting room, waiting in the exam room for the
nurse, waiting for the doctor, waiting again for the nurse, waiting
to pay, driving to the pharmacy, waiting for the prescription,
driving back to work and catching up with messages from the half
day's lost productivity. Some of this is unavoidable. But the
majority of health care visits are for chronic conditions _
arthritis, diabetes, clogged arteries, that sort of thing _ and our
drive-and-wait method of treating them is inordinately expensive to
patients, health plans and employers. That is where telemedicine
comes in. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News). 22.

   FLU-DO _ Ugh, the crud! You've got it. Coughing, sneezing,
aches, pains, the whole nine yards. So you take the pills and you
drink the fluids and you stay home from work. Even if you fall
asleep every 45 minutes, you still need something to do when you're
conscious. With or without accompanying children, partners, pets. A
few guilty pleasures to distract you from the microbial battle
raging within. (Dayton Daily News). 15. WITH ILLUSTRATION.

   HEALING-REIKI _ Margaret Knapke is a practitioner of an ancient
form of hands-on healing called Reiki, which probably originated in
Tibet. The word means ``universal energy,'' and Knapke uses the
analogy of an extension cord to describe how it works: She is the
cord and the energy flows through her to the person she touches. It
is based on the belief that the human body is more than just
matter; it is an extended energy system. (Dayton Daily News). 30.

<P>
   REIKI-SIDE _ I am not a person who finds it easy to relax. But I
fell asleep on the Reiki table. Under Margaret Knapke's touch, I
drifted pleasantly in and out of consciousness, aware of where and
how I was being touched, but unaware of how much time was passing.
When I finally sat up, I was amazed that an hour and a half had
gone by. (Dayton Daily News). 10.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH-COLUMN _ Time is spent driving to the doctor's office,
waiting in the waiting room, waiting in the exam room for the
nurse, waiting for the doctor, waiting again for the nurse, waiting
to pay, driving to the pharmacy, waiting for the prescription,
driving back to work and catching up with messages from the half
day's lost productivity. Some of this is unavoidable. But the
majority of health care visits are for chronic conditions _
arthritis, diabetes, clogged arteries, that sort of thing _ and our
drive-and-wait method of treating them is inordinately expensive to
patients, health plans and employers. That is where telemedicine
comes in. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News). 22.

   A statue, a plaque, a commemorative chair: Most memorials are a
dime a dozen. In this avaricious age, when a country truly wants to
honor its own, it reaches for something with real face value.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five hundred years ago, when the Greeks first made coins
with portraits of people on them, only gods and goddesses were
considered fit for the tribute. A few centuries later, Caesar had
to seize control of the Roman mints before his portrait could
appear on denarii.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long, though, before mere mortals regularly made the
grade: Sir Edmund Hillary is on New Zealand's five-dollar bill,
William Butler Yeats graced the Irish 20-pound note, and Che
Guevara gazes heroically from the Cuban three-peso note.
</P>
<P>
   Now a few countries have taken to honoring worldshakers of
another kind: physicists.
</P>
<P>
   Of the more than 20 physicists who have appeared on bills around
the world (another 250 have appeared on stamps), only a handful are
household names: Copernicus, Curie, Einstein, Galileo and Newton.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Kristian Birkeland, are a bit more obscure.
Birkeland is honored on Norway's 200-krone note for his pioneering
studies of the aurora borealis and Earth's magnetic sphere.
</P>
<P>
   A cynic might quip that the Norwegians must be hard up for
heroes. Couldn't they think of anyone else?
</P>
<P>
   But the Norwegians might just as easily turn that question
around: Is Birkeland any less obscure or influential than Salmon P.
Chase, secretary of the treasury under Abraham Lincoln, who appears
on the American 10,000 dollar bill?
</P>
<P>
   And whence the American fondness for politicians? Benjamin
Franklin is the only scientist who appears on American money, and
he earned the honor by drafting the Constitution, not by theorizing
about electric charges.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's time, in other words, for Richard Feynman, Robert
Millikan or Murray Gell-Mann to be fiscally immortalized.
</P>
<P>
   True, the regular denominations are taken. But there is one
obvious candidate for another bill, one worth exactly
$3.14159265358979323846 ...
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; MARIE CURIE (1867-1934) and PIERRE CURIE (1859-1906) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CURRENCY: French, 500 francs ($81)
</P>
<P>
   CLAIM TO FAME: The Curies were the first couple to win the Nobel
prize (in 1903, for discovering radioactivity); Marie was the first
woman to receive the prize on her own (in 1911, for isolating
radium and polonium) and the first person, man or woman, to win it
twice.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter, Irene Curie, completed the first Nobel trifecta,
winning the prize for chemistry in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Though Marie was a French citizen, she was born in Poland and
also appeared on the Polish 20,000-zloty note (worth only 83 cents
when last issued, in 1995).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ERNEST RUTHERFORD (1871-1937) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CURRENCY: New Zealand, 100 dollars ($53)
</P>
<P>
   CLAIM TO FAME: A mentor to many of this century's greatest
physicists, Rutherford was the first to show that atoms have a
positively charged nucleus surrounded by a swarm of lighter
particles.
</P>
<P>
   Rutherford also discovered thoron (an isotope of radon),
detected alpha and beta rays in uranium radiation, and with his
research assistant Hans Geiger, helped design what became known as
the Geiger counter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ALBERT EINSTEIN (1879-1955) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CURRENCY: Israeli, 5 pounds (15 cents when last issued, in 1980)
</P>
<P>
   CLAIM TO FAME: A 20th-century icon, Einstein left behind more
than just theories of relativity. He was the first to conceive of
the photon and helped lay the groundwork for quantum theory and
lasers.
</P>
<P>
   German by birth, Jewish by heritage, Swiss by citizenship after
1900, and American by citizenship after 1940, Einstein could
plausibly appear on four different currencies. Nevertheless the
Israelis were the first to claim him.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BENJAMIN FRANKLIN (1706-1790) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CURRENCY: American, 100 dollars
</P>
<P>
   CLAIM TO FAME: In the 18th century, Franklin was nearly as
eminent for his scientific research as for his politics. He was
among the first to recognize that there are two kinds of electric
charges (positive and negative, as we now call them). He also
showed that lightning is a form of electricity and that electric
charges are always conserved in nature.

   Zung Wan Kim, a surgeon in Port Chester, N.Y., preps for surgery
like a prizefighter before a major bout. First he punches a soap
dispenser button with his foot and delivers a low blow to a faucet
switch with his knee. Then he rubs the soap over his hands for more
than a minute and rinses it off with graceful left and right hooks
under the stream of water.
</P>
<P>
   He jabs at his nails with a sterile brush for more than another
minute, rinses, scrubs his hands with a sterile sponge, rinses
again, and then repeats the initial wash and rinse.
</P>
<P>
   Ding! The bell goes off on Kim's timer, ending a full
five-minute ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Seem obsessive? Sure, until you consider that the life of the
hernia patient next door depends on Kim's routine. And recent
events have shown that even ordinary hand-washing may once again
become a matter of getting really sick or staying well.
</P>
<P>
   In August of this year, federal health experts reported that
four children in Minnesota and North Dakota were fatally infected
by Staphylococcus aureus, a bacterium easily passed through
hand-to-hand contact. A strain of S. aureus has in recent years
become resistant to the popular antibiotic methicillin. Yet any
good hand-washing can still send it down the drain.
</P>
<P>
   Lulled by the success of antibiotics in general, Americans have
come to think of compulsory hand-washing as a thing of the past _ a
holdover from the sterile, hyperhygienic 1950s. But more than half
the staph infections caught by hospital patients are now more
resistant to methicillin (up from 1974), and according to some
epidemiologists, the deaths in Minnesota and North Dakota are just
the tip of the iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the possible exception of immunization,'' says Ralph
Cordell, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta, ``hand washing is the most effective
disease-preventing measure anyone can practice.''
</P>
<P>
   To get a sense of just how many bacteria you're carrying around,
consider an interesting experiment performed back in the 1930s by
physician Philip B. Price of Johns Hopkins University. Price set up
14 sterile enamel basins, filled them with warm sterile water and
washed his hands with plain soap for exactly one minute at each
basin.
</P>
<P>
   When he was finished, he totaled up the bacteria in the basins
and estimated their original population on his hands: 4.58 million.
Later studies showed that the full census on a single hand can rise
to as high as 200 million and may include viruses and fungi as well
as bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those organisms, such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, are
native to our hands. Known as resident flora, they can cause
disease but more often help prevent it by crowding out and
combating invaders.
</P>
<P>
   The more dangerous bugs are the transients that lurk on faucets
and toilet-flush levers in airport rest rooms, on subway handholds,
on public telephone receivers and between the thumb and forefinger
of the person you shook hands with at lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Up close, however, the bad guys don't look much different from
the good guys. For instance, when stained and magnified a hundred
times, S. aureus and S. epidermidis both resemble clusters of
merlot grapes.
</P>
<P>
   But some transients clearly don't belong on your hands. The
intestinal bacterium Escherichia coli OI57:H7 (stains pink, looks
from the side like long-grain rice) causes food poisoning in as
many as 20,000 people a year.
</P>
<P>
   E. coli survives all too well outside the intestines,
particularly on food. Patting contaminated ground beef into a
hamburger, for instance, can leave a residue of about 10 million
disease-causing bacteria on your hands.
</P>
<P>
   The fingertips can offer safe harbor to bacteria for up to an
hour, but they are hardly the best hiding places. Just look at your
palms, Cordell suggests, using a 3-D microscope with a
magnification of about 50. At this scale, the handscape is a
territory filled with hideouts. Cold and flu viruses wait until
your hands come in contact with the delicate membranes in your
nose, eyes or mouth, where they can infiltrate cells and duplicate
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Some 400 to 500 sweat glands per square centimeter of skin pour
out moisture onto your palms, irrigating bacteria. The glands have
a shaft leading down through the epidermis, the thickest layer of
the skin, to a mazelike ball where sweat collects. On the backs of
your hands, sebaceous glands and hair follicles make even better
foxholes for bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The safest and most expansive microbial bunkers are under the
fingernails, in ``subungual spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the hand is a continent, the subungual spaces are the
caves,'' says Barry Michaels, a microbiologist with
Georgia-Pacific, which makes paper towels and hygiene products. In
fact, 95 percent of the bacteria found on our hands is under the
fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a full five minutes of washing, researchers estimate,
to flush out, shed or kill 99 percent of the transient organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Most people, even most physicians, still don't wash long enough,
often enough or well enough. In one study a few years ago, doctors
and nurses in an emergency room washed up less than a third of the
time after touching patients. And when they did use soap and water,
the average wash-and-rinse was a mere 9.5 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Hand washers typically fail to clean their fingernails, thumbs,
the creases in their palms and the backs of their hands. Dominant
hands are often underwashed _ if you're right-handed, your left
hand is usually cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   The solution is simple. Start with soap and running water at a
comfortable temperature. (Antimicrobial soaps are unnecessary and
they may help spawn bacteria resistant to antibiotics.)
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the soap hits your skin, islands of grease will begin
to dissolve, exposing dormant viruses and living bacteria. E. coli
and other intestinal transients will get caught up in the tide of
soapy water during the first five seconds of the wash. Plain soap
tears off the outer coating of flu viruses, rendering them inert.
</P>
<P>
   Hand-washing also flushes away yeast and other fungi, and the
grapelike clusters of staph will soon slide away as well.
</P>
<P>
   Keep rubbing your soapy hands for at least 15 seconds before
rinsing. Admittedly, that is likely to seem like a long time. To be
sure you don't give up too soon, hygienists recommend washing for
as long as it takes to sing ``Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.''
</P>
<P>
   If you do all this, you will wipe out as much as 95 percent of
the organisms that were there before you picked up the soap.

   Zung Wan Kim, a surgeon in Port Chester, N.Y., preps for surgery
like a prizefighter before a major bout. First he punches a soap
dispenser button with his foot and delivers a low blow to a faucet
switch with his knee. Then he rubs the soap over his hands for more
than a minute and rinses it off with graceful left and right hooks
under the stream of water.
</P>
<P>
   He jabs at his nails with a sterile brush for more than another
minute, rinses, scrubs his hands with a sterile sponge, rinses
again, and then repeats the initial wash and rinse.
</P>
<P>
   Ding! The bell goes off on Kim's timer, ending a full
five-minute ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Seem obsessive? Sure, until you consider that the life of the
hernia patient next door depends on Kim's routine. And recent
events have shown that even ordinary hand-washing may once again
become a matter of getting really sick or staying well.
</P>
<P>
   In August of this year, federal health experts reported that
four children in Minnesota and North Dakota were fatally infected
by Staphylococcus aureus, a bacterium easily passed through
hand-to-hand contact. A strain of S. aureus has in recent years
become resistant to the popular antibiotic methicillin. Yet any
good hand-washing can still send it down the drain.

   A statue, a plaque, a commemorative chair: Most memorials are a
dime a dozen. In this avaricious age, when a country truly wants to
honor its own, it reaches for something with real face value.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five hundred years ago, when the Greeks first made coins
with portraits of people on them, only gods and goddesses were
considered fit for the tribute. A few centuries later, Caesar had
to seize control of the Roman mints before his portrait could
appear on denarii.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long, though, before mere mortals regularly made the
grade: Sir Edmund Hillary is on New Zealand's five-dollar bill,
William Butler Yeats graced the Irish 20-pound note, and Che
Guevara gazes heroically from the Cuban three-peso note.
</P>
<P>
   Now a few countries have taken to honoring worldshakers of
another kind: physicists.
</P>
<P>
   Of the more than 20 physicists who have appeared on bills around
the world (another 250 have appeared on stamps), only a handful are
household names: Copernicus, Curie, Einstein, Galileo and Newton.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Kristian Birkeland, are a bit more obscure.
Birkeland is honored on Norway's 200-krone note for his pioneering
studies of the aurora borealis and Earth's magnetic sphere.
</P>
<P>
   A cynic might quip that the Norwegians must be hard up for
heroes. Couldn't they think of anyone else?
</P>
<P>
   But the Norwegians might just as easily turn that question
around: Is Birkeland any less obscure or influential than Salmon P.
Chase, secretary of the treasury under Abraham Lincoln, who appears
on the American 10,000 dollar bill?
</P>
<P>
   And whence the American fondness for politicians? Benjamin
Franklin is the only scientist who appears on American money, and
he earned the honor by drafting the Constitution, not by theorizing
about electric charges.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's time, in other words, for Richard Feynman, Robert
Millikan or Murray Gell-Mann to be fiscally immortalized.
</P>

   Zung Wan Kim, a surgeon in Port Chester, N.Y., preps for surgery
like a prizefighter before a major bout. First he punches a soap
dispenser button with his foot and delivers a low blow to a faucet
switch with his knee. Then he rubs the soap over his hands for more
than a minute and rinses it off with graceful left and right hooks
under the stream of water.
</P>
<P>
   He jabs at his nails with a sterile brush for more than another
minute, rinses, scrubs his hands with a sterile sponge, rinses
again, and then repeats the initial wash and rinse.
</P>
<P>
   Ding! The bell goes off on Kim's timer, ending a full
five-minute ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Seem obsessive? Sure, until you consider that the life of the
hernia patient next door depends on Kim's routine. And recent
events have shown that even ordinary hand-washing may once again
become a matter of getting really sick or staying well.
</P>
<P>
   In August of this year, federal health experts reported that
four children in Minnesota and North Dakota were fatally infected
by Staphylococcus aureus, a bacterium easily passed through
hand-to-hand contact. A strain of S. aureus has in recent years
become resistant to the popular antibiotic methicillin. Yet any
good hand-washing can still send it down the drain.
</P>
<P>
   Lulled by the success of antibiotics in general, Americans have
come to think of compulsory hand-washing as a thing of the past _ a
holdover from the sterile, hyperhygienic 1950s. But more than half
the staph infections caught by hospital patients are now more
resistant to methicillin (up from 1974), and according to some
epidemiologists, the deaths in Minnesota and North Dakota are just
the tip of the iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the possible exception of immunization,'' says Ralph
Cordell, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta, ``hand washing is the most effective
disease-preventing measure anyone can practice.''
</P>
<P>
   To get a sense of just how many bacteria you're carrying around,
consider an interesting experiment performed back in the 1930s by
physician Philip B. Price of Johns Hopkins University. Price set up
14 sterile enamel basins, filled them with warm sterile water and
washed his hands with plain soap for exactly one minute at each
basin.
</P>
<P>
   When he was finished, he totaled up the bacteria in the basins
and estimated their original population on his hands: 4.58 million.
Later studies showed that the full census on a single hand can rise
to as high as 200 million and may include viruses and fungi as well
as bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those organisms, such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, are
native to our hands. Known as resident flora, they can cause
disease but more often help prevent it by crowding out and
combating invaders.
</P>
<P>
   The more dangerous bugs are the transients that lurk on faucets
and toilet-flush levers in airport rest rooms, on subway handholds,
on public telephone receivers and between the thumb and forefinger
of the person you shook hands with at lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Up close, however, the bad guys don't look much different from
the good guys. For instance, when stained and magnified a hundred
times, S. aureus and S. epidermidis both resemble clusters of
merlot grapes.
</P>
<P>
   But some transients clearly don't belong on your hands. The
intestinal bacterium Escherichia coli OI57:H7 (stains pink, looks
from the side like long-grain rice) causes food poisoning in as
many as 20,000 people a year.
</P>
<P>
   E. coli survives all too well outside the intestines,
particularly on food. Patting contaminated ground beef into a
hamburger, for instance, can leave a residue of about 10 million
disease-causing bacteria on your hands.
</P>
<P>
   The fingertips can offer safe harbor to bacteria for up to an
hour, but they are hardly the best hiding places. Just look at your
palms, Cordell suggests, using a 3-D microscope with a
magnification of about 50. At this scale, the handscape is a
territory filled with hideouts. Cold and flu viruses wait until
your hands come in contact with the delicate membranes in your
nose, eyes or mouth, where they can infiltrate cells and duplicate
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Some 400 to 500 sweat glands per square centimeter of skin pour
out moisture onto your palms, irrigating bacteria. The glands have
a shaft leading down through the epidermis, the thickest layer of
the skin, to a mazelike ball where sweat collects. On the backs of
your hands, sebaceous glands and hair follicles make even better
foxholes for bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The safest and most expansive microbial bunkers are under the
fingernails, in ``subungual spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the hand is a continent, the subungual spaces are the
caves,'' says Barry Michaels, a microbiologist with
Georgia-Pacific, which makes paper towels and hygiene products. In
fact, 95 percent of the bacteria found on our hands is under the
fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a full five minutes of washing, researchers estimate,
to flush out, shed or kill 99 percent of the transient organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Most people, even most physicians, still don't wash long enough,
often enough or well enough. In one study a few years ago, doctors
and nurses in an emergency room washed up less than a third of the
time after touching patients. And when they did use soap and water,
the average wash-and-rinse was a mere 9.5 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Hand washers typically fail to clean their fingernails, thumbs,
the creases in their palms and the backs of their hands. Dominant
hands are often underwashed _ if you're right-handed, your left
hand is usually cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   The solution is simple. Start with soap and running water at a
comfortable temperature. (Antimicrobial soaps are unnecessary and
they may help spawn bacteria resistant to antibiotics.)
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the soap hits your skin, islands of grease will begin
to dissolve, exposing dormant viruses and living bacteria. E. coli
and other intestinal transients will get caught up in the tide of
soapy water during the first five seconds of the wash. Plain soap
tears off the outer coating of flu viruses, rendering them inert.
</P>
<P>
   Hand-washing also flushes away yeast and other fungi, and the
grapelike clusters of staph will soon slide away as well.
</P>
<P>
   Keep rubbing your soapy hands for at least 15 seconds before
rinsing. Admittedly, that is likely to seem like a long time. To be
sure you don't give up too soon, hygienists recommend washing for
as long as it takes to sing ``Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.''
</P>
<P>
   If you do all this, you will wipe out as much as 95 percent of
the organisms that were there before you picked up the soap.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Freedom is two-faced
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ I have some fifth-grade friends I visit. We talk
about words and their meanings. One is ``independence.'' Simple the
concept may seem, but it stumps every group of fifth-graders I've
known.
</P>
<P>
   What is independence? Is it freedom? Not exactly. You can be
``free'' and not be independent.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say you run away from home. Ah, freedom. But that freedom
quickly proves illusory. You need food. You need shelter. Can you
depend on yourself as a runaway? Hardly. Sooner or later you need
help. Call yourself free, but you're not independent.
</P>
<P>
   Our nation suffers from similar confusion.
</P>
<P>
   What is the nature of freedom in America? Is it something that
rushes in when a newborn first gasps the air? We would like to
believe so.
</P>
<P>
   It's not true. Not even close. Though we presume to be
independent, we are co-dependent. We rely on what others do and
have done, starting with our parents, then our teachers, our
leaders, our engineers, our scientists.
</P>
<P>
   America is the most free of the ``free countries.'' But that
doesn't make Americans automatically free. Don't ever be so fooled.
</P>
<P>
   A man brought his aging mother to live near him in the wide-open
spaces of the Southwest from a more confining Midwest city.
</P>
<P>
   In this land of elbow room and wide-open opportunity, she found
herself confined. Unable to drive, she found she couldn't walk to
the grocery store in a grid that was meant just for autos. Unless
her son could give her a ride, she was stranded from services she
enjoyed before. She was no longer free or independent. She was a
prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen addresses it in his
book Development as Freedom. The title sounds like a capitalist
hymn, something like, ``All You Need is Wal-Mart.'' It is not.
</P>
<P>
   Sen points out that a free market is only part of the equation.
Freedom requires that people be free from mortal fear, be safe and
be well _ have access to health care, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Without these instrumental freedoms, the free market is someone
else's plaything.
</P>
<P>
   But confusion reigns, particularly among those in safe and
sparkling neighborhoods, who have the best health care, fine
wheels, fast computers. Hey, freedom is a great concept. Get some.
</P>
<P>
   In the hurting inner core of Waco this summer, policy makers got
a look at what it means not to be free. By virtue of the building
of a new school in the hurting Brook Oaks Neighborhood, the city
realized how seriously slighted its residents were.
</P>
<P>
   As a most glaring example, city officials considered pedestrian
safety for the children who would walk to this new school. A host
of intersections didn't even have stop signs, which the city
installed. Sidewalks? That's another matter. Where would the weeds
grow? Where would the rats reside?
</P>
<P>
   Had there been no pedestrians before this school? Didn't
children live here? Of course they did. Was it safe to walk
anywhere here, day or night? Or would only fools and thieves take
foot?
</P>
<P>
   With my fifth graders, another word we discuss is ``symbol.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brook Oaks, those stop signs are symbols that mean more than
``stop.'' They mean that for the first time in many years someone
is paying attention to the instrumental freedoms which have been
denied in ways not always appreciated in sparkling cul de sacs and
marble halls.
</P>
<P>
   This year we'll have national elections. Some will say that all
this nation needs is to let that free market crank. Others will say
we must address basic needs like making health care accessible,
redeveloping inner cities and investing in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Likely the result will come down to the two faces of freedom.
Many want to believe it's a birthright, like breathing. Not true.
Only some of us have it. And some of us who have it don't get it.

DON'T BELIEVE THESE FEVER MYTHS
</HEADLINE>
  By STACEY COLINO 
 c.1999 Child 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Very few symptoms worry parents more than a child's high fever.
Why? It may be because they've subscribed to one of the many myths
about fevers that have been circulating for years.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of folk mythology about fever that's passed on
from one generation to the next,'' says David Jaffe, M.D.,
professor of pediatrics at Washington University School of Medicine
in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   We asked pediatricians to debunk five common fictions about
childhood fevers and explain the right way to handle them.
</P>
<P>
   Myth No.1. All fevers need to be treated. This myth is
widespread _ and so is the flip side: that no fever needs to be
treated. ''Fevers should be treated based on the comfort of the
child rather than the number on the thermometer,'' says Mark
Stegelman, M.D., a pediatrician at Egleston Children's Hospital in
Atlanta. (Exception: babies under 3 months, who should always be
treated for a fever; see Myth No. 5.)
</P>
<P>
   ''Fevers are beneficial,'' Dr. Stegelman points out. ''They help
the immune system fight infection by making the body less
hospitable to germs. They also help antibiotics work better.
</P>
<P>
   ''These benefits can occur with fevers of 100 degrees to 101
degrees as well as with higher ones. I advise treating the majority
of fevers over 102 because generally they cause some discomfort,''
Dr. Stegelman says.
</P>
<P>
   If your child has a serious illness, you'll more than likely see
a difference in her demeanor or behavior, even if she's mellow by
nature. If she's playing comfortably despite her fever, you
probably don't need to treat her. But if she's irritable,
lethargic, or obviously uncomfortable, try to bring down the fever.
</P>
<P>
   ''Parents should trust their instincts about when their child's
behavior is really off,'' Dr. Jaffe says.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors recommend treating any fever aggressively if a
child has had a febrile seizure in the past. (See Myth No. 2.) If
yours has, you should discuss the issue with your practitioner.
</P>
<P>
   Myth No. 2. Febrile seizures cause epilepsy in children. Febrile
seizures _ during which a child loses consciousness and control of
his motor functions, resulting in a rhythmic shaking of his arms
and legs _ occur in 2 to 5 percent of all children between the ages
of 6 months and 5 years. Most doctors now believe they have more to
do with the rate at which the body's temperature rises than the
actual height of the fever.
</P>
<P>
   ''Seizures that come with fever often happen before a parent
knows that a child has a fever,'' says Joan Chesney, M.D.,
professor of pediatrics at the University of Tennessee in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   While these convulsions are truly scary for parents to witness
and should always be reported to doctors, they are rarely dangerous
and do not cause brain damage or increase child's risk of
developing a seizure disorder such as epilepsy later in life.
Babies who have these seizures before age 1 have a 50 percent
chance of having another; for children over 1, the likelihood drops
to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, 90 percent of children who go a full year without a
seizure have outgrown the tendency to have them.
</P>
<P>
   Myth No. 3. A fever of 105 can cause brain damage. Fevers of 104
or 105 are actually common in kids of any age and won't cause brain
damage, says Dr. Stegelman.
</P>
<P>
   ''Children tend to run higher fevers than adults do, partly
because their immune systems are less mature. So an infection can
become more widespread before the body jumps on it.'' While its
true that very high fevers can cause brain damage, this occurs only
when the mercury rises to 107 or higher. This is extremely rare in
children and is usually seen with specific disorders, such as
malignant hyperthermia, a brain disorder, or with heat exhaustion
or heat stroke, according to Dr. Stegelman.
</P>
<P>
   ''Parents are afraid of a high fever because they fear that it
will keep rising,'' says Dr. Chesney. ''But the body controls
temperature very well. When a child has a fever, the body resets
its set point from 98.6 to, say, 104. Then the temperature will
hover around 104, but will stabilize while the body fights the
infection.''
</P>
<P>
   Myth No. 4. To lower your child's temperature, give her an ice
or alcohol bath. Wrong. She should have a lukewarm bath, one that
feels like a person's natural body temperature. Or you can dip a
washcloth in lukewarm water and gently rub your child's skin to
dilate the blood vessels on the surface and reduce body heat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything cooler can lower the child's body temperature too
quickly,'' Dr. Stegelman explains. ''And alcohol baths are an
absolute no-no. They can cause skin problems, severe dehydration,
and loss of the skin's cooling mechanism.''
</P>
<P>
   Giving your child acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen
(such as Motrin) also helps to reduce fever. Many doctors prefer
that parents give children acetaminophen because it has a longer
safety record. You should discuss the decision with your
practitioner.

   Myth No.5. The higher the fever, the sicker the child. ''By
itself, fever is not a reliable indicator of serious illness,''
says David Lang, M.D., director of infectious diseases at the
Children's Hospital of Orange County in California. Gauge how your
child is acting. If her behavior suggests she's feeling okay, you
probably don't need to worry.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, when babies under 3 months have a fever
higher than 100.2, call the doctor right away. ''In that age group,
it's very hard to distinguish between children who have something
mild and those who have something serious,'' adds Dr. Jaffe. This
is the reason doctors will normally run a battery of tests on a
newborn who has a fever to determine whether he has a serious
bacterial illness such as meningitis.

DESIGNER NAMES SELL PRODUCTS FROM PAINT TO CARS
</HEADLINE>
  (Includes two color photos of Tommy Hilfinger products) 
 By JOHN KARL 
 c.1999 NYT Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just mention Tommy Hilfiger and an immediate image comes to
mind. Same goes for Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and Donna Karan. Not
only are these some of the most recognizable names in American
fashion design, they're names that mean money in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   They join an elite list of international fashion all-stars, such
as Giorgio Armani, Christian Dior and Coco Chanel. Don't forget
Karl Lagerfeld, Gianni Versace and Hubert de Givenchy. Sometimes,
they are so popular that they are known by their initials, like YSL
(Yves Saint Laurent) or PC (Pierre Cardin).
</P>
<P>
   All of these fashion designers have created empires with their
names emblazoned across them. Everything from cosmetics to
sunglasses, fragrances to home fashions bears the designer's
moniker. Even automobiles, chocolate candy and toilet seats are on
the designer's product list.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about licensing. The designer's name is used for a fee,
usually about 3 to 5 percent of the take, on items other than the
core fashion collection. The name gives the products a national and
sometimes international brand.
</P>
<P>
   ''About 40 percent of our business is done in designer
licensees, representing tens of millions of dollars,'' says Howard
Cohen, president of Host Apparel, which manufactures robes, pajamas
and sleep apparel. ''We have designer names, Christian Dior, Bill
Blass, Alexander Julian and Perry Ellis. We are about to launch our
first underwear line with Kenneth Cole.''
</P>
<P>
   Before designers license their names, they make sure the various
products meet their standards of quality and style. If not, they
stand to lose clients, reputation and market share. Most designers
insist on oversight and input into every detail, from packaging to
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   When Eddie Bauer announced that Fossil, Inc. would be the
exclusive supplier of Eddie Bauer brand watches, Fossil CEO Tom
Kartsotis called it an ''important partnership'' and issued a
statement that said: ''We are honored with the display of
confidence that Eddie Bauer has shown Fossil. Having the entire
watch program will allow us to provide a complete line of products
while keeping the consistency of design, presentation and
quality....''
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, these name-brand products have a common thread: that
signature touch that differentiates one line from another.
</P>
<P>
   ''These designers put their own names on these labels _ which in
its own way is a personal signature or mark on the product,'' says
Karen Koza, director of public relations at The Fashion
Association. ''It states that the designer stands behind his or her
product 100 percent. Just as important as the name on the label is
the heart and soul that goes into making that product, which is
highly evident in branded designers.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there's more than a little hype involved. In
brand names, image is everything.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, Ralph Lauren paint, advertised as ''the
colors of America, bringing spirit and character to the home.
Unique palettes inspired by places and lifestyles that have come to
define Ralph Lauren: sport, country, thoroughbred, Santa Fe and
safari.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all of this branching out, the clothing collection, with
a designer's name on the label, is still the epicenter of the
empire. Original collections are offered four to five times a year,
sometimes more.
</P>
<P>
   They are geared to the market times: spring, summer, transition
(early fall, back to school), fall and holiday with
mini-collections in between. The most important season is fall,
because this is where new silhouette directions are traditionally
launched.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question 'Is it fashionable?' is answered by the label,''
says Sally Schule, manager of publicity and special events at Saks
Fifth Avenue in Sarasota, Fla. ''If the name on the label is
recognizable, the answer is 'Yes.' The average customer naturally
gravitates toward the comfort zone. Choosing a recognizable name
makes for a smooth road.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some of the designers' fashions aren't meant
to be worn. At least, not by ''average'' customers. Designs must be
taken to the catwalks for the designer to be considered part of the
high-fashion scene. It's all about outrageous showmanship and the
stakes are high.
</P>
<P>
   At upscale fashion shows, most of the clothes are pure concept.
They're meant to be photographed, get talked about and keep the
designer's name in the spotlight. Later, companies ship something
wearable, but true to the concept of the collection.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of press and interest generated directly equates to
the expansion of the designer's realm.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate designer's dream _ to dress celebrities _ is
surpassed only by creating fashions for celebrities in highly
visible movies, such as ''The Thomas Crown Affair.''
</P>
<P>
   Milanese master tailor Gianni Campagna snatched this plum
assignment, raising his name awareness to a new level. His client
list already includes Jack Nicholson, Larry Hagman and Sharon
Stone.
</P>
<P>
   Other designers, such as Lenor Romano, are just getting started
in the name game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Initially my objective was to design beautiful clothes,''
Romano says. ''Then one day, before the line was launched, I showed
swatches to a Nordstrom's buyer who loved them. He asked what the
label was going to be. I replied I was thinking of using my
initials, LRK or LR. He said, 'Don't do it. My customer wants a
name, even if they can't pronounce it.' So, my name is on the
label.''

   Nobody can play frustration quite like Bill Macy. You can see it
in Jerry Lundegaard, the pathetic, scheming car salesman he played
in ``Fargo,'' in Little Bill, the cuckolded porno director of
``Boogie Nights'' _ and in William H. Macy, bona fide movie star.
</P>
<P>
   Over a tuna sandwich, Macy is anguishing over what ought to be a
welcome rite of passage: construction of his new house in the
Hollywood Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 14 months and thousands and thousands of dollars, I
basically have a very expensive hole,'' he says dejectedly.
</P>
<P>
   He seems even reluctant to accept the good fortune that his
performance in ``Fargo'' brought him: an Oscar nomination and a
career switched onto the express track.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hit, that's the main thing,'' Macy says with the
caution that comes from working steadily in films for 20 years
before finally _ at nearly 50 _ grasping Hollywood's brass ring.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, it's time to acknowledge that he has indeed taken
hold of that ring _ at least according to his wife of two years,
actress Felicity Huffman.
</P>
<P>
   ``My lovely wife, who is so smart, said to me last year, `You
need new goals,''' says Macy, who has something like half a dozen
films under his belt in the last 12 months _ including ``Mystery
Men,'' ``Happy Texas'' and now ``Magnolia,'' the third film from
``Boogie Nights'' wunderkind Paul Thomas Anderson _ and ought to be
the last person to need career counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't understand what she meant at first, but then I
realized I was operating too long under the assumption all actors
do, the `I've got to get a career' thing. Well,'' he acknowledges,
``I have a career. So now I'm trying to redefine my goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Macy decides to tackle next _ screenwriting (he wrote
TNT's ``A Slight Case of Murder''), directing (HBO's ``Lip
Service'') or finding that elusive role in which he finally gets
the girl _ his performance in ``Magnolia'' as Donnie Smith, a
fading 1950s quiz-show star, can be seen as a step in that new
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote the role of Donnie to bust Macy out of his box,'' says
Anderson, who directed the actor in ``Boogie Nights'' and who
conceived the character, which he describes as ``the smartest loser
of all time,'' specifically with Macy in mind.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Anderson wanted the stage-trained actor to forgo
some of the rigorous, anti-Method acting principles that he's
famous for _ theories that have fueled a career that includes an
Emmy-nominated guest stint on ``E.R.'' and more than two decades of
acclaimed theater work in Chicago and New York, where Macy
occasionally teaches a few lucky students.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such thing as character. It's just a trick we play
on the audience, with their participation, that's based on
scientific principles,'' says Macy, who first earned his acting
chops at the feet of David Mamet nearly 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The playwright and screenwriter, who has since cofounded two
theaters with Macy and remains one of the actor's closest friends,
was working as an acting teacher at Vermont's Goddard College when
Macy enrolled in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't a very good student, and Goddard was an alternative
school in Vermont where the women didn't wear brassieres, and what
more information do you need?'' says Macy, who was born in Miami
but grew up in Virginia and Maryland, where he was the high-school
class president and a folk singer who hoped to become a
veterinarian until he got a good look at the science requirements.
Acting was not only easier, but ``Dave,'' recalls Macy, his voice
tinged with awe, ``made it a calling.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a trade, no different from bricklaying or the
woodworking Macy pursues during his off-hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can be an actor. It's a craft anyone can practice,''
insists Macy, who found ``Magnolia's'' emotion-fraught bar scene _
in which Donnie breaks down, confronting the wreck of his life and
drunkenly declaring his love for the studly bartender _ one of the
most difficult he'd ever encountered. (``Macy still doesn't think
he delivers,'' says Anderson with a chuckle. ``But it's just that
he's uncomfortable with emotions.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard because the objective wasn't clear, and it also
shifted because he was drunk,'' says Macy, who admits his distaste
for playing emotions is part of the fallout from his
``white-bread'' upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest son of a Southern belle mother and a buttoned-down
father _ a World War II hero turned insurance salesman _ Macy grew
up in a household where overt displays of emotion were discouraged.
He can play what he calls ``the imploding WASP'' so beautifully _
all those dispeptic losers that crowd his credits _ because, he
says, he is one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some actors can cry at the drop of a hat, they're so
accessible to themselves,'' he says. ``Felicity is so emotionally
alive she's like a racehorse. Well,'' he concludes, ``I'm a
camel.''

NEW CERVICAL-CANCER TEST CAUSING CONCERN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A low-cost test that can help women over 35 detect early signs
of cervical cancer without a doctor's visit has oncologists and
women's health experts concerned that women may start skipping
annual visits to their gynecologist.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of its convenience and low cost (about $17-$30),
doctors say a new test to detect the human papillomavirus (HPV) _ a
sexually transmitted virus known to cause most cases of cervical
cancer _ should not replace the Pap smear. Skipping an annual exam
also means losing the benefit of a breast, pelvic and vaginal exam
that a $75-$125 office visit includes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A full exam should be performed even if you have had this
test,'' said Dr. Kathryn McGonigle, a gynecologic oncologist at the
UCLA School of Medicine. ``I'd be very careful about saying this
test should replace the Pap smear. That's a dangerous message that
we don't want people taking away from this.''
</P>
<P>
   The HPV test, manufactured by Maryland-based Digene Corp., would
allow women to collect samples of their own vaginal cells for
analysis in a laboratory. The presence of HPV doesn't automatically
mean a woman has cancer. If the HPV virus is detected, researchers
say the woman should see a gynecologist for further tests and
possible treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Results of a study of high-risk populations in South Africa
published last week in the Journal of the American Medical
Association concluded that the HPV test is ``less specific than but
as sensitive as (Pap) smears for detecting high-grade cervical
disease in women aged 35 and over, and HPV testing offers an
important new way to increase screening in settings where cytology
is not readily performed.''
</P>
<P>
   The study's conclusions drew skepticism from City of Hope Cancer
Center's Dr. Sharon Wilczynski, who found the results interesting,
but ultimately ``not ready for prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't change the way women are taking care of
themselves now,'' said Wilczynski, director of cytology at City of
Hope in Duarte. ``The Pap smear has led to a dramatic decrease in
cervical cancer over the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pap smear works.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, doctors in the United States can only conduct HPV
tests to help diagnose cervical cancer in women who have had
abnormal Pap tests. The test is not approved for general screening
of healthy women, either by a doctor or for the at-home,
self-collection procedure. Digene officials expect the home test to
be available in one to three years in the United States, sooner in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Once it is approved for at-home use _ which requires approval
from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration _ doctors say the HPV
test may open up care to women who are uninsured, live in
underdeveloped regions, or are reluctant to visit a gynecologist.
At less than $30, the procedure is designed to be ``no more
expensive'' than a Pap test, said Digene president Charles
Fleischman who expects the HPV test to be fully covered by major
insurance carriers. (An annual gynecological exam, considered a
preventive service, is typically covered by nearly all insurance
carriers, according to Walter Zelman, president of the California
Association of Health Plans.)
</P>
<P>
   Also still to be determined is whether women will embrace the
concept of performing a necessary at-home test the way they have
have taken to breast self-examinations and home pregnancy tests.
The convenience of an at-home test won't be worth much, doctors
say, if women obtain the results of their test and don't act on the
information. &QL;

EAT THE RIGHT FOODS FOR A BETTER MOOD
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eat, think, be merry.
</P>
<P>
   Life can be that easy. Feed a brain with the right mix of
carbohydrates, fats and protiens _ say, a bowl of oatmeal and
egg-white omelette with veggies _ and your mind will be razor sharp
and awash in a sea of happy hormones.
</P>
<P>
   Go for the quick fix _ a doughnut or a bowl of Frosted Flakes _
and spend the day on an emotional roller coaster guaranteed to
leave you tired and ticked off.
</P>
<P>
   You'd need a medical degree to comprehend the complex
interactions of digestion, hormones and blood chemistry. All you
really need to know is this: Bad foods equal bad moods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food has a tremendous impact on our moods,'' explained Dr.
Michael Hirt, a Tarzana physician who specializes in nutrition.
``When people feel angry or depressed, what do they reach for?
Sweets. The sugar increases serotonin levels in the brain, and
serotonin is the feel-good hormone. It's the same hormone increased
by drugs like Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   ``What tends to happen, though, is that people ride that sugar
high, and then they have that carbo crash about 90 minutes later,''
Hirt continued. ``Their blood sugar is in the toilet. They become
angry, moody. Then they eat something sweet to satisfy themselves
and bounce from one high to another throughout the day.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to stepping off this mood roller coaster is maintaining
a balance of carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Carbs feed the
brain, proteins slow down the rate at which the carbs are consumed
(stabilizing the blood-sugar level), and fats boost feel-good
hormones and also lend a hand in regulating blood chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   There's no sense in denying these impulses. It's all part of the
human survival instinct, said Elizabeth Somer, a Salem, Ore.,
dietitian and author of ``Food &AMP; Mood: The Complete Guide to Eating
Well and Feeling Your Best'' (Owl Books; $17.50). Primitive man
needed those urges to drive him to hunt luxuries such as protein
and fat. Modern man gets into trouble because, while those urges
remain, there's a burger joint or a doughnut shop every few blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turns out the taste of sugar on your tongue releases
endorphins, which give you a pleasurable feeling,'' Somer said.
``No wonder people grab a cookie or a candy bar. Unfortunately,
we're going to all the wrong foods for the right reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   End of lecture.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, one of the few things more annoying than a carbo crash
is a bunch of health professionals (or medical writers, for that
matter) delivering yet another lecture about the importance of diet
and exercise. But, seriously, if everyone worked on their daily
diets, everything _ lectures included _ would be a lot less
annoying:
</P>
<P>
   _ Think brown. Not all carbohydrates are equal. White bread,
white rice, white potatoes and white pasta are fast burners. Whole
grains, brown rice, yams and whole-wheat pasta are slow burners
and, therefore, better brain food.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stablize crashing blood sugar levels. For example, when you've
had only a doughnut and cup of coffee for breakfast, counter with
gentle influences such a turkey on whole wheat bread.
</P>
<P>
   _ Put wheat germ in cookies, cakes and muffins. It's good brain
food, and no one will even know it's there.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mix and match. Lean meats, chicken, fish and soy protein
combined with healthy fats such as fish oil, olive oil and flaxseed
oil will help sustain energy and mental clarity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Listen to your body. Don't deny cravings. It's OK to have a
little chocolate (in fact, research has shown that nothing else can
satisfy a chocolate craving) _ just be sure to mix it with
less-fattening foods. Somer said air-popped popcorn provides the
same basic mood-building blocks as candy, with a lot less fat and
sugar. Dried fruits also work.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get a coffee kick. Despite its bad reputation, caffeine is a
powerful stimulant that is proven to improve mental clarity and
agility, which makes it a good additive a few hours before an
important test or meeting. Warning: More than three cups will lead
to the jitters.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't skip meals. Eat a variety of food every four or five
hours. Keep snacks _ power bars, trail mix or dried fruits _ handy
to fill in when time doesn't permit a real meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget to put fuel into yourself, just like you wouldn't
forget to put gas in the car,'' Hirt said. ``An easy way to do that
is to have a serving of oatmeal and an egg-white omelette with some
chopped spinach in it. That's really the breakfast of champions.
Frosted Flakes are really going to leave you groping for
something.'' &QL;

INVESTORS QUESTION WHETHER THEY'RE IN THE RIGHT FUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. In May of last year I made my first step toward saving for my
retirement and for my daughter's education. I am 36 and my daughter
is 10. Being an absolute novice in the investment area and seeking
professional advice, I went to an adviser from a well-known
brokerage firm. I wanted to invest $50,000. After listening to my
goals, the adviser proposed that I invest all of the money in
Washington Mutual Investors fund, dividing the money among two Roth
IRA accounts and one regular account. I followed this advice, and
paid 5 percent of the total as the fee to enter the fund. At the
time, I didn't know that there were no-load funds that require no
fee, nor did the adviser tell me this. I consider this charge a
pure loss. I am absolutely unsatisfied with the performance of the
fund. I don't understand why when everybody keeps talking about the
booming economy the fund is steadily going down. I understand this
is a long-term investment but if the fund is doing so badly now,
when the market is good, how can I be sure that it won't be doing
even worse when the market changes? So far, including the fee I
paid, my investment is down about 14 percent. Is it ever going to
recover? I have only eight years until the first scheduled
withdrawal. Is there anything I can do to correct my mistake and
improve the situation?
</P>
<P>
   G.J., Pittsfield, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I can understand your frustration, but eventually the
situation will probably prove to be a great deal less bleak than it
seems to you now.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Mutual Investors is a solid fund that operates in a
currently unpopular segment of the market _ value investing.
</P>
<P>
   Value investors look for the stock of companies with the lowest
ratios of the stock price to the book values. Typically these are
solid and well-established, dividend-paying companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Washington Mutual Investors, for example, the
portfolio is dominated by the stocks of utilities and manufacturers
of durable goods. Its portfolio price-to-earnings ratio is 25.4 _
70 percent of the P/E of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a patient fund, taking its positions and holding on
through good and bad markets, which can be seen by its turnover
ratio of 0.28, which means that only a little more than a quarter
of the portfolio is changed each year. (In more aggressive
growth-oriented funds, it's far from uncommon for the turnover to
exceed 1 _ meaning that the dollar value of annual portfolio
changes exceeds the value of assets in the fund.)
</P>
<P>
   You seem to believe that the adviser who suggested this fund is
somehow to blame. In all probability, in your conversations he or
she made a judgment that over the long haul you would be more
comfortable with a conservative, value-oriented holding than a more
aggressive fund.
</P>
<P>
   While that wasn't a strategy that paid dividends in 1999, when
the stock market was largely limited to high-growth issues, your
fund is notable as a defensive investment, and it should fare
better than most stock funds in bad markets.
</P>
<P>
   You can see a bit of this in its performance in the first days
of this year, which have been nobody's delight as far as the stock
market goes. In the same fund family, Amcap, a large-cap
growth-oriented fund, lost 5.63 percent; the year-to-date loss for
Washington Mutual was 3.82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a small consolation, but if the sour market continues,
this is the trend you can expect to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Although it seems hard to understand at this stage, I don't
think you made a mistake in going to the brokerage. After all, as
you noted at the outset, you were an absolute novice when you
began, unaware even of the difference between no-load funds and
funds with sales charges.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, you paid for a professional to advise you. There are many
ways that advisers can hide their fees _ selling classes of funds
with higher annual expense ratios and/or rear-end loads rather than
upfront sales charges, for example _ but if you go to a pro for
advice, one way or another you are going to pay for his or her
time.
</P>
<P>
   You paid $2,500 for your adviser to assess your goals and risk
tolerance. Given the short-term results this may seem like a high
price at this stage, but over the 20- to 30-year period before you
call upon the retirement funds, that charge should fade into
insignificance.
</P>
<P>
   So what to do at this stage? I suggest you go back to the
adviser and confess your unhappiness, and question whether you
might wisely transfer (without fee) into other funds in the same
family.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Investment Fund of America is an above-average fund
in the same family, also maintaining a value-dominated portfolio,
but taking a more aggressive stance within that category. Last year
it returned 16.6 percent to its investors, compared with the 1.2
percent gain for your fund. (The 1999 gains of Washington Mutual
all came before you made your investment.)
</P>
<P>
   You might also question whether whatever part of the portfolio
is designated for your daughter's education might be better
invested in a fund more closely attuned to the intermediate-term
nature of this investment.
</P>
<P>
   I would look to balanced funds here, with offerings in the same
family, including American Balanced and Income Fund of America,
both of which currently divide their portfolios about evenly
between stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Last year I put the entire $100,000 that is in an irrevocable
trust for my children in shares of Sequoia fund. The money will go
to the children in 7 1/2 years. As you know, Sequoia has had the
worst year in its history. Would you advise to wait things out or
switch to another fund?
</P>
<P>
   C.R., Winchester, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. On the surface this question may seem like the one above _
another large-cap value fund that had a miserable year. But Sequoia
fund, which is closed to new investors, is a fairly unique story.
</P>
<P>
   The fund has a tightly concentrated portfolio, with nearly 30
percent of it in shares of Berkshire Hathaway, and with 92 percent
of its portfolio in shares of financial companies.
</P>
<P>
   The balance is shares of the manufacturers of durables, with a
token holding in industrial stocks. As for value-oriented sectors
that might smooth things out in a choppy market _ utilities,
energy, and so forth _ nada. This had led to a high-risk rating
from Morningstar Mutual Funds.
</P>
<P>
   Last year it lost 16.65 percent, and through the first five
trading days of 2000, it shed another 4.99 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If you had a long-term investment time frame, this might be a
good investment, but I think its a little too bold for 7 1/2 years.
If you want a more cautious approach to value investing, I suggest
you switch to Vanguard Index Value.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a 67-year-old widow and have a $100,000 IRA with my
daughters, aged 41 and 39, named as beneficiaries. It is now
invested with 74 percent in Vanguard Asset Allocation fund, 16
percent in Vanguard Long-Term Corporate Bond fund, and the rest in
Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond fund. Given my daughters' ages,
I believe I should change the portfolio makeup into Vanguard funds
with more prospect for growth. What do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   M.L., Chula Vista, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think it's a good idea to make a change, but given the
current choppy markets I also think it would be a good idea to move
fairly slowly.
</P>
<P>
   I would begin by moving the two bond fund positions to Vanguard
Balanced Index, and then wait about six months before making
another move. Like the Asset Allocation fund, Balanced Index
divides its investments between stocks and fixed-income holdings,
but it is more aggressive, holding about 58 percent stocks,
compared with about 36 percent for Asset Allocation.
</P>
<P>
   After about six months, I suggest you move about a third of the
Asset Allocation position to Vanguard Index Value, an all-stock
fund that concentrates on the securities of the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 Index with the lowest price-to-book-value ratios.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, about a year from now and then six months later, I
suggest you move the rest of the Asset Allocation position to
Vanguard Total Stock Market Index fund.
</P>
<P>
   The effect would be a portfolio with a small position _ about 16
percent _ on the fixed income side, and the balance in a portfolio
dominated by large-cap issues, but with a little bias toward value
issues, and with fairly token participations in the mid-cap and
small-cap markets.
</P>
<P>
   That recommendation is based on the idea that your daughters
will treat the money as a long-term investment, eventually to be
added to their retirement assets.
</P>
<P>
   If, on the other hand, it is likely that they will use the money
fairly shortly after inheriting it, I would moderate the mix,
leaving about half in the Balanced Index and Asset Allocation
funds, with the rest divided between Index 500 and Index Value.

JANE SWIFT JUST DOESN'T GET IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jane Swift, the lieutenant governor of Massachusetts, has no
doubt that the staffers she has pressed into providing day care for
her daughter Elizabeth are only too glad to volunteer their
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be stunned if there was anyone who was feeling
pressure to spend time with her and care for her,'' says Swift. To
prove the point, she offers a compelling argument: Elizabeth is
``adorable and engaging and she's learned to blow kisses.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, I've got a little one who is adorable and engaging and a
pretty skilled kiss-blower himself, and I really need a baby sitter
next Wednesday. Would Swift mind getting one of her staffers to
``volunteer'' a few hours that night to take care of my son? I,
too, would be stunned if any of them objected.
</P>
<P>
   When the stories about Swift's use of state employees to perform
personal chores broke last week, she switched the subject to her
busy schedule. Her job, she apparently believes, is infinitely more
demanding than those of mere mortals. ``It's not always easy and
convenient for me to just pop in and out of errands like it is for
everyone else,'' she offered by way of explanation.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue isn't Swift's schedule and it isn't Elizabeth's
charms.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is ethics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the governor and I take very seriously the public trust
placed in us and we will not tolerate any breaking of that trust by
anyone associated with our administration,'' Swift declared in
August, as she announced that Peter Blute's midday booze cruise on
a state-chartered boat would cost him his job as director of the
Massachusetts Port Authority. ``Utilizing state resources for
personal use is not acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to square that admirably clear principle with Swift's
own behavior. To review the bidding so far, she has: (1) repeatedly
asked state employees to baby-sit, without pay, both at the State
House and in her home; (2) had staff members ``voluntarily'' give
up vacation days so they could drive the U-Haul when she moved from
Boston to Northbridge; and (3) ordered a police helicopter from the
Bureau of Tactical Operations to fly her home to North Adams for
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)``Utilizing state resources for personal use is not
acceptable.'' (unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Swift is unforgiving of the lapses and foibles of others. When
Blute turned up on that booze cruise, the lieutenant governor hotly
denounced him. After James Carangelo was overheard making rude
personal remarks during a junket to Mexico, she engineered his
ouster from the Massport board of directors. And when Joe Moakley,
the 72-year-old dean of the Massachusetts congressional delegation,
colloquially referred to Blute's female successor at Massport as a
``girl,'' Swift made a noisy federal case of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's inappropriate . . . to call an accomplished
34-year-old woman a girl,'' she barked. ``I have a problem with it.
He should be picking up the phone and calling Virginia Buckingham
and apologizing to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, indeed, Jane Swift readily spots the motes in the eyes of
others. The beams in her own, she doesn't always notice.
</P>
<P>
   --During the same Mexican junket when she was so attuned to
Carangelo's transgressions, Swift was happy to accept unpaid
first-class upgrades on her plane tickets _ a practice Buckingham
has since banned.
</P>
<P>
   --Swift doesn't scruple at taking $25,000 to teach one course
per semester at Suffolk University, a school where other part-time
instructors earn no more than $3,100 per course. Suffolk, as it
happens, has sought and received tens of millions of dollars in
loan guarantees from state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   --While serving in the Massachusetts Senate, Swift availed
herself of a tax break that exists only for legislators who live
more than 50 miles from their state capital. Intended to ease the
costs borne by lawmakers who must travel long distances to the
State House, the loophole is worth $140 for each day that the
Legislature is in session. The Senate only meets a few dozen times
a year, but because it technically stays in session year-round,
Swift claimed $140 for every day of every year that she was a
senator. Result: For six years, she paid almost no federal income
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   None of these things is illegal. But none of them fits the
rigorous ethical standard to which Swift seems to hold everyone but
herself.
</P>
<P>
   The state's lieutenant governor is blessed with many fine
traits. A touch of humility is not among them. Rather than
acknowledge that commandeering a police chopper to fly her home for
the weekend might not have been such a good idea, Swift bristles.
``I'm the lieutenant governor,'' she snaps, ``and the lieutenant
governor and the governor are allowed to use the state police
helicopter.'' Rather than admit that accepting a $25,000 kiss from
a university eager to score political points might not pass the
smell test, Swift insists she is worth every penny. ``Suffolk,''
she brags, ``is paying me based on the valuable experience I bring
to that class.''
</P>
<P>
   And rather than concede that state workers should not be
dispatched to pick up her dry cleaning or baby-sit her daughter,
she complains about how tough her job is.
</P>
<P>
   Swift is acquiring a reputation as a corner-cutting pol who
brazenly defends her perks while blasting the ethics of others. Is
that really what she wants? If not, it's time to make some changes.
She might begin by learning to say, ``I was wrong.''

GETTING PERSONAL WITH WINONA RYDER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the past six years, Winona Ryder has shepherded her new
film, ``Girl, Interrupted,'' through development hell, sticking
with it as executive producer through various rewrites, directorial
changes and studio upheavals.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just that Ryder liked the film's source material,
Susanna Kaysen's memoir about her two-year stay in a psychiatric
facility. There's a personal connection as well: Ryder says she
could have been Kaysen at one point in her adolescence. In fact,
she checked herself into a psychiatric ward when she was 19,
suffering from anxiety attacks and exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea what was happening to me, and what was worse, I
didn't feel like I could tell anybody about what I was feeling,''
Ryder says. ``So here I was, 19, and I felt totally scared and
totally alone. I tell you, at that point in my life, Susanna's book
would have been a lifesaver.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's why she made the movie. Here, Ryder talks about her
difficulties shaking the experience of playing Kaysen, the daunting
challenge of facing 30, and why Ronald Reagan isn't her favorite
president.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've never talked about your struggle with depression
before. Why now?
</P>
<P>
   A: Why, indeed? It is strange to talk about it. I know how
nauseating it is when actors complain about their lives. We're
sickeningly well-paid people who have very charmed lives.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But ...
</P>
<P>
   A: But that doesn't mean you don't have any problems. I grew up
in front of everybody. !tag!I had my first period, literally, on
film.!tag! My whole life was amplified for public consumption. And
every time I complained about it, I was called spoiled. So I
learned that I wasn't supposed to say anything.
</P>
<P>
   So when I was 19 and had made probably too many movies in too
short a span, I started having this horrible time. My heart would
be going at 90 miles per hour, my breathing would get labored, and
I'd be sweating buckets. And I was lonely and confused and going
through what every teen-ager goes through, facing those big
questions as you exit your adolescence. Why am I here? What is this
world? Where do I belong?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Questions that no one can answer for you.
</P>
<P>
   A: It was like that feeling when you're almost in a car crash,
and you swerve, and for a second there are needles going through
your head and all through your body. It's like that, only instead
of lasting a second or two, it lasted a much longer time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you get over it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Time. Time and a great shrink.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Obviously then, you felt a connection with Susanna Kaysen's
book and her own adolescent struggles.
</P>
<P>
   A: To me, she nailed everything about that time in your life
that is so confusing and so lonely and so oddly funny and weird.
And she captured it with such honesty and without being
self-indulgent, which is something I hadn't seen since Salinger
wrote about it in ``Catcher in the Rye.'' And that's saying a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And, as an added bonus for you, she did it from a female
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Rebels in books are usually saved for the boys. There
really aren't a lot of female rebels. We're usually stuck with Judy
Bloom, you know? And in films, we aren't really offered much at
all. We're given movies like ``Runaway Bride'' and sent on our way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Now, you have a few rebellious moments in the movie, but most
of the heavy lifting is left to Angelina Jolie. Do you have much of
a wild side yourself?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's something I'd like to explore someday _ on film. But I
don't know what life would be like lived that way. I'm pretty happy
with my life as it is.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Attitudes regarding depression have changed a lot since 1967,
the year the movie is set.
</P>
<P>
   A: We've definitely done a 360. Back then, if you were confused
or sensitive or rebelled at all, you were locked up and medicated,
and they basically threw away the key _ especially if you were a
woman. But now, what's so amazing is that the maximum they can hold
you, no matter what your malady is _ suicidal, schizophrenic,
manic-depressive _ is 21 days. Thanks to Reagan, that's the most we
have funding for. Reagan (screwed) us. Reagan (screwed) us bad.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You have so much passion about both the movie and its
subject. Was it hard to let it go?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've never been closer to a movie, and it was hard to shake,
definitely. There are still remnants of Susanna in me and in my
home.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Like what?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's hard to describe, but I made these collages of
photographs and pictures, stuff from Life and Look magazines of
things that were going on in 1967. And I saved them all and brought
them home and put them up in my house. Really, I've just sort of
stayed in Susanna's framework and decorated this cage for her to
live in and brought it back with me. It's almost like she's this
weird sort of pet that I have, you know, and I just can't set her
free.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Wow. How long has it been since you finished the film?
</P>
<P>
   A: April. And she's still right here. It's a weird thing. I
don't want to lose the part of me that can be her. I'll just miss
her too much, you know? I guess I'll always have the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It sounds like you've been spoiled for other movies.
</P>
<P>
   Ryder: I just finished a movie a couple of weeks ago with
Richard Gere. It's called ``Autumn in New York.'' And, you know,
comparatively, it didn't come close. ``Girl, Interrupted,'' not to
use such a cliche, but it was a real labor of love. And then it
felt like I went and did a movie that I was hired to do. And I went
to work, and I did my job. It wasn't a bad experience, but it
didn't go beyond me just doing the job.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So are you trying to find another labor of love?
</P>
<P>
   A: I optioned a book a couple of years ago called
``Roustabout,'' which is about the death of the small circuses that
move from town to town. And I've been trying to get it made for a
while now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you heading for another six-year journey?
</P>
<P>
   A: (Laughs) I hope not! But if that's what it takes, I'm willing
to put in the work.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Brittany Murphy (one of Ryder's co-stars in ``Girl,
Interrupted'') cites you as a huge influence ...
</P>
<P>
   A: God ...
</P>
<P>
   Q: She says she grew up with you singing ``My Sharona'' in
``Reality Bites.'' How does that make you feel?
</P>
<P>
   A: Old! And I just turned 28, so I'm, like, on the doorstep of
30.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Well, you do have two years to cross the threshold.
</P>
<P>
   A: But you can't helping thinking about it, if only just a
little bit. When you're 27, you can still say you're in your
mid-20s. Now, I'm in my late 20s, and it's, like, there are no more
excuses. You can't say, 'Oh, well, I'm young.' You're not young
anymore. So you better start dealing with stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Like what? Marriage, kids, white picket fences? (Ryder has
been dating actor Matt Damon for nearly two years.)
</P>
<P>
   A: Um ... maybe you're right. I do have two years to cross the
threshold. &QL;

DEE DEE SEES THE NICE IN NOTORIETY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dee Dee, our all-purpose advice columnist, has been studying the
recent well-publicized metamorphoses of Monica Lewinsky and Linda
Tripp, and is as ready as she'll ever be to answer your questions. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dear Dee Dee: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My new year's resolution is to look like an entirely different
person by early July. I can't help but notice the remarkable
transforming effect that President Clinton seems to have had on so
many women with whom he has come into contact. I am wondering if he
could do the same for me.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hamstrung, Sconce, R.I. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dee Dee advises you to become notorious as soon as possible.
Celebrity is what changed the women in question _ an infamous
association with the president, not the president himself. You
needn't confine yourself to politics. Any high-profile outrage will
do. Ideally, you want to become involved in a scandal that inspires
the tabloids to dog your every move and thus humiliate you into
weight loss, exercise, electrolysis, major plastic surgery,
sturdier foundation garments, etc. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dear Dee Dee:
</P>
<P>
   I understand that some Jenny Craig franchisees are upset about
the company's new advertising campaign featuring Monica Lewinsky.
They say she's not a good role model for their clients, even though
she's already lost 30-odd pounds. Is Jenny Craig a weight-loss
program or a spiritual path?
</P>
<P>
   _ Bemused, Center Druthers, Vt. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a business, and Dee Dee thinks hiring Monica as its
spokesloser was a stroke of genius. Who's more famous, and in more
need of a makeover, than Monica? Erstwhile Oval Office sexpot sheds
pounds and gets paid for doing it. These days, only fame and money,
no matter how ill-gotten, signify. So Monica is a perfect role
model. Will she change her ways as well as her weight? Stay tuned.
Now if only she'd do something about her hair . . . &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dear Dee Dee:
</P>
<P>
   To be honest, I was envious when I saw the photographs of Linda
Tripp's new face. If plastic surgery can make her look that good, I
figure it could make me look like Cindy Crawford or Kathie Lee, at
least. However, on further reflection, I have come to think that
Tripp is setting a bad example for women who may want to bring down
future presidents and throw the nation into turmoil. A woman in her
position should be above such petty concerns as making herself look
presentable.
</P>
<P>
   _ Troublesome, Troutperch, N.H. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you may think of Tripp _ and Dee Dee doesn't think much
of her, frankly _ she learned the hard way that a woman can't be
famous and unattractive in a celebrity-mad world. Tripp may be
hoping her new look will influence a jury in her favor. Or she may
have just gotten sick of looking at herself in the mirror. Dee Dee
knows what that feels like, and she suspects you do, too. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dear Dee Dee:
</P>
<P>
   Perusing the ``before'' and ``after'' photos of Linda Tripp's
face lift, it occurred to me that Ken Starr could use a little work
in the jowl area. The president's nose might benefit from a subtle
reshaping, and while they were at it, they might lift the bags
under his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Obtuse, Eventide, Mass. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dee Dee takes your point. Women's liberation notwithstanding,
women are under more pressure than ever to look good, while men, by
and large, can coast through life with the faces and bodies nature
gave them. Dee Dee thinks that in the very near future there will
be only two kinds of women: those who are beautiful and never age
because they can afford plastic surgery, and the rest of us. &QL;

MORE HIP-HOP ARTISTS CROSSING OVER INTO MOVIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VANESSA E. JONES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time when hip-hop artists were relegated to certain
kinds of film roles. They made cameo appearances as themselves _
think LL Cool J in the seminal 1985 rap film ``Krush Groove.'' Or
they portrayed inner-city gangbangers in independent films, as Ice
Cube did in his searing ``Boyz N the Hood'' movie debut in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Now hip-hop actors are finding another way to get their names
scrawled on movie posters. An increasing number of rappers,
particularly those who ascended the acting ranks via television or
low-budget movies, are snagging parts in mainstream Hollywood films
by respected directors. Some are even transforming their big-screen
successes into studio production deals that give them the power to
get movies made.
</P>
<P>
   Erykah Badu received glowing reviews for her recent stint as an
orchard worker in Lasse Hallstrom's ``The Cider House Rules.'' LL
Cool J capped a stellar year in which he appeared in ``Halloween
H2O: Twenty Years Later,'' ``Deep Blue Sea,'' and ``In Too Deep,''
with a small, showy part in Oliver Stone's football drama, ``Any
Given Sunday.'' And Ice Cube was able to capitalize on the success
of his 1995 urban comedy ``Friday'' (whose sequel ``Next Friday,''
opens Jan. 12) by landing a significant role in the critically
acclaimed ``Three Kings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes in waves,'' explains Michael De Luca, president of
production at New Line Cinema, which is releasing ``Next Friday.''
The company's relationship with hip-hop reaches back to the 1990
teen comedy, ``House Party,'' starring the duo Kid `N Play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some years you end up with people that pop and they're really
charismatic,'' De Luca continues, ``and there might be more of them
one year than another year.''
</P>
<P>
   While some veteran actors complain that the trend is siphoning
roles from people trained for the job, film studios are blinded by
the platinum-and-diamond dollar signs. After all, hip-hop music has
become so popular that its artists are promoting everything from
Sprite to films like ``Friday'' and Master P's popular
straight-to-video opuses. Now Hollywood executives seem to be
recognizing hip-hop's ability to lure its fans into movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a built-in audience and the movies that we do don't
cost a lot of money (so) there's a potential for a whole lot of
return on it,'' explains Ice Cube, 30, who since his 1991 debut has
appeared in 13 films, including ``Anaconda,'' ``Trespass,''
``Higher Learning,'' ``The Glass Shield,'' and ``Dangerous
Ground.'' ``Since we've been successful on that, they've been
looking for us to do more mainstream big-budget movies.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between rap and film began in the mid-1980s
with teen films like ``Beat Street'' and ``Krush Groove'' that
showed a new generation being turned on to hip-hop culture. In the
early 1990s, those films were replaced by urban dramas such as
``Boyz N the Hood'' and ``Juice,'' the latter featuring a strong
performance by the late rapper Tupac Shakur. The hard-core films
reflected the influence of gangsta rap's bleak and violent lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Some hip-hop artists saw their acting dreams remain just that as
they appeared in films that barely limped into theaters. Others
forged successful careers in televison. Queen Latifah fine-tuned
her craft on the popular ``Living Single,'' LL Cool J starred in
``In the House'' and before Will Smith became WILL SMITH he spent
the early 1990s as television's ``The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, it's been these veteran musicians who are most
often tapped for mainstream roles. In most cases, their film
careers have gone so well they're only distantly remembered for
their music.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Smith, the successful star of such hits as ``Men in
Black,'' ``Independence Day,'' and ``Enemy of the State.'' Although
he started his musical career as the Fresh Prince, bemoaning how
``Parents Just Don't Understand'' and continues it with hit albums
like ``Willennium,'' fans think of him more as a cultural icon than
a rapper.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely crossed over from hip-hop,'' says De Luca. ``He
ended up being an industry unto himself and being this major
star.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the success of Smith and others, a lot of hip-hop
artists have found more imaginative ways to expand their creative
horizons. Master P chose to bypass the Hollywood system by creating
straight-to-video films like ``I'm `Bout It'' and low-budget films
like ``I Got the Hook-up'' that became hits, thanks to his ardent
fans. His actions prompted a renaissance of straight-to-video
filmmaking among regional artists as well as hitmakers like Jay-Z
and Snoop Dogg.
</P>
<P>
   Master P capitalized on his filmmaking successes by recently
signing a five-picture deal with Trimark Pictures. But some
business agreements have more muscle than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has some weird deal,'' says Gary Dauphin, a regular
contributor to film sections in The Village Voice and Vibe
magazine. ``It doesn't always pan out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ice Cube's three-year production deal with New Line may be one
of the exceptions thanks to his stellar filmmaking record.
``Friday,'' a day-in-the-life comedy co-written by and starring Ice
Cube, cost $4.5 million to make, says De Luca. By the end of the
film's theatrical run, New Line had a $28 million winner.
</P>
<P>
   But it was in the video format that ``Friday'' became a
phenomenon. The film, which costarred the pre-``Rush Hour'' Chris
Tucker, rode the video bestsellers list for an impressive 98 weeks
and sold more than 600,000 copies. The numbers were so compelling,
New Line Cinema asked Ice Cube to write a sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put a lot of trust into Cube after that,'' says De Luca.
``He knows what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ice Cube scored more points by directing and starring in ``The
Player's Club,'' a minor hit in 1998. Then he put pen to paper and
co-wrote ``Next Friday.'' In the sequel, Ice Cube's character,
Craig, moves from Watts to the not-so-idyllic suburbs to escape the
wrath of Debo, the neighborhod bully Craig beats up at the end of
``Friday.'' During his day there, Craig encounters bumbling Latino
gangbangers, an ebonics-spewing Korean neighbor and . . . Debo.
</P>
<P>
   The only person Craig doesn't meet is Tucker's weed-loving
character, Smokey. Tucker, now a megastar, decided to pass on the
sequel reportedly for religious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   De Luca seems confident of the success of ``Next Friday'' _ even
without Tucker. The soundtrack album is already a hit and there's a
lot of prerelease buzz. Of course, it doesn't hurt that Ice Cube
has name recognition as a former member of the group NWA and as a
solo artist. Film executives are becoming more aware of that power,
says Ice Cube.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Latifah, for instance, first gained fame with her
Afrocentric, feminist albums of the late 1980s and 1990s. After
costarring in ``Living Single,'' and acting in ``Set It Off,''
``Hoodlum,'' ``Living Out Loud,'' ``Sphere,'' and other films, she
has developed into a well-regarded actress. She most recently
appeared in ``The Bone Collector.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With (that film's) role you can't gauge how many people went
to see that movie because Latifah was in it,'' says Cube in his
laconic Los Angeles drawl during a telephone interview from a
Beverly Hills hotel last month. ``You could put another actor in
there that's not known to the country and they could do a good job.
But they might not get any more (bodies) in the seat. And that's
the bottom line in this business.''
</P>
<P>
   And it seems like more Hollywood filmmakers are satisfying the
bottom line by hiring hip-hop artists. In the last few months,
publications like Time and Vibe magazine have buzzed about upcoming
mainstream film projects featuring rappers who are often making
their debuts.
</P>
<P>
   The Roots' Black Thought is set to star in ``Brooklyn Babylon,''
a film by Marc Levin, who directed the urban poetry movie ``Slam.''
Spike Lee has cast Mos Def and the Roots' ?uestlove in his next
film ``Bamboozled.'' And sometime this year fans may finally see
the Wu-Tang Clan's turn in ``Black and White,'' director James
Toback's much delayed film about white high school students
becoming invovled in Harlem's hip-hop scene.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make actor Samuel L. Jackson complain bitterly
about the trend, in the July issue of Code magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a rapper wants to be an actor,'' said Jackson in the
interview, ``the first thing Hollywood thinks of is, `Well, he's
already got an audience and he'll do a song for the soundtrack.' So
it becomes a completely different business deal that knocks out the
young brother banging his head against the wall and trying to
develop the craft of acting.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't start shedding tears for established actors yet, however.
Dauphin doesn't think Jackson and other A-list stars have to worry
about another Will Smith developing from this trend. At the moment,
he says it's unimaginable that a rapper could compete for a role
with a Denzel Washington or a Wesley Snipes.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean this new generation of hip-hop actors isn't
trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were let in the door as rappers,'' says Ice Cube, ``and
some of these people are going to leave this business as respected
actors and actresses.''

MOVIES RECENTLY REVIEWED IN THE BOSTON GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   !!! ``The Hurricane'' This solid, earnest, sometimes foursquare
film about boxer Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter and his long fight for
freedom after being railroaded on a triple-murder charge is
distinguished by Denzel Washington's sterling performance in the
title role. Remarkably, he convinces us that Carter survived prison
and prevailed by making a spiritual pilgrimage into his own
interior. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``Magnolia'' Paul Thomas Anderson's ambitious follow-up to
``Boogie Nights'' plays like ``Short Cuts'' with hope, as it sends
a platoon of desperate Los Angelenos out into the night to face a
plethora of intergenerational crises. The film sometimes gets away
from him. There's a lot of sprawl and sputter. But its faults are
the faults of ambition, not commercial expediency, and Anderson
writes marvelously for actors. The ensemble led by Julianne Moore,
Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman, John C. Reilly, William H.
Macy, Melora Walters, and Jason Robards keeps it simmering in the
emotional clinches. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``Old Man River'' Lively film of Cyndi Fujikawa's funny,
poignant, angry, loving one-woman stage show stemming from her
efforts to find out more about her taciturn, shadowy, often absent
father, US Army combat veteran (and, before that, internee) Jerry
Fujikawa, who stoically spent most of his life playing stereotyped
Asian clowns. (Unrated)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
!!! 1/2 ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' Scott Hicks almost miraculously
lets the landscape seem to do the work of inscribing the conflicts
between dispossessed Japanese-Americans and territorial locals at
the end of World War II in the Pacific Northwest. Fog and snow are
artfully deployed as perception-masking stand-ins for the willfully
limited vision that's the real culprit in this story of clashes
that lead to death and a riveting courtroom drama, where a
Japanese-American defendant seems to be on trial as much for race
as for murder. (PG-13)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Amy Ruell is trying to buy a cardigan for her 8-year-old
daughter on line. Blind since birth, Ruell, a 45-year-old social
worker and mother of two, has logged on to her daughter's favorite
Web site, Gap.com, to do some shopping.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruell's special screen-reader technology is designed to pick
up words, not visuals, and so she can't make heads or tails of the
clothing site, which has pictures constantly popping up in random
places. Her speech synthesizer is no help. It keeps babbling:
``Link graphic, common graphic, link link, link, common graphic,
image map link . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in its scratchy, robotlike voice, it says, ``Shops fleece
women.'' Ruell looks stumped, and her fingers fly over the
keyboard. A second later, the synthesizer amends its story:
``Advertisement for super-soft pro fleece pullovers and
accessories.'' Ruell laughs. ``See how confusing that is for a
visually impaired person?''
</P>
<P>
   As it has for sighted users, the Internet has opened vast new
vistas for the blind. With the power of new technology at their
fingertips, people such as Ruell often shop on line and retrieve
information they previously had to depend on others to find and
read to them.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a glitch: As the Web has moved at warp speed toward
an increasingly visual universe of snazzy graphics, it has become
much more difficult for blind people to navigate their way across
it. So when Ruell tries to shop for her children or indulge her
passion _ buying books on line _ these days she enters a virtual
jungle of pop-up images. Gap.com and her favorite site, amazon.com,
are not the worst offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon.com is particularly accessible because they have a
text-only version on their Web page,'' Ruell says. ``Other sites
are more difficult to access. They have all these icons that pop
up, but they don't identify them with text, so I don't know which
icon to press to order something.''
</P>
<P>
   Blind computer users, of course, cannot point and click with a
mouse because they can't see the cursor on the screen. Almost as
soon as they convince software companies to produce programs that
include text along with the point-and-click visuals, programmers
come up with glitzy new versions that omit the text labels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The programmers are obviously not thinking about the needs of
disabled people because of market size, so blind people are
constantly falling behind as they're trying to catch up,'' says
Barry Scheur, chief executive of Scheur Management Consulting Co.,
a health-care company in Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Some major Internet services, like America Online, are virtually
inaccessible to the estimated 700,000 blind people who are
computer-literate.
</P>
<P>
   The blind cannot use any of AOL's distinctive features, like its
popular chat rooms, because the world's largest Internet service
provider has not made the bulk of its software compatible with the
screen-reader technologies that convert on-line content into either
Braille or speech. ``The software for AOL and other sites just
gives you icons without any text,'' and the screen reader can read
only words, explains Steve Booth, an assistant operations manager
for the National Braille Press in Boston. So when the screen reader
comes across a bunch of graphics, ``it just goes haywire.''
</P>
<P>
   Booth, who, like Scheur and Ruell, has been blind all his life,
is one of nine plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit against AOL recently
filed by the National Federation for the Blind. The suit is an
attempt to force the provider, which is considered the McDonald's
of Web providers with 20 million users, to make its software
compatible with screen-reader technologies. The case rests on the
federation's interpretation of the Americans With Disabilities Act,
which aims to give disabled people access to equal opportunities in
employment and public services.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, you can't go to college or get a job without
knowing how to use the new computer technology, and it's even more
essential for blind people than it is for sighted people,'' says
Ruell. ``There is a tremendous network of information and support
that we now have access to with the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL spokesman Nicholas Graham says AOL is planning to make the
next version of its software compatible with screen-reader
technologies. He says the company has released software for
Macintosh computers that has a text-read feature, and is in the
process of developing similar software for PCs, which is what most
people use.
</P>
<P>
   Ruell is happy to hear that. As someone who grew up in rural
western Massachusetts, far from an urban center with a Braille
library, she still finds it miraculous that she can buy any book
she wants on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to read,'' says Ruell, who admits she spends more money
on books than she cares to think about. She feeds the books through
her scanner, then hears them read by her computer. ``My mother
should have gone blind because she was always reading to me,'' she
remembers. ``She would stir the pot with one hand and hold the book
in the other.''
</P>
<P>
   If AOL retools its software, as expected, then other companies
that market innovative Internet software might be encouraged to do
so. Then it would become much easier for Ruell and other blind
people to do such things as file their taxes and shop on line.
</P>
<P>
   On a gloomy winter afternoon, Ruell logs on to show a visitor
how she accesses the Internet from the computer in her second-floor
study. Her modern split-level in Hingham, Mass. looks like it has
just been moved into, and it takes the visitor a while to realize
why there are no paintings on the wall, no rugs, no coffee table in
the living room, no bric-a-brac decorating the place. The
furnishings are sparse so Ruell can move briskly and safely around
the house that she and her husband purchased six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ruell, an articulate woman with a no-nonsense air, works
part-time as a therapist and supervisor for the Department of
Mental Health in Brockton, Mass. The commute takes her two hours a
day by special public transportation, but she makes sure she is
home by the time her two children arrive back from school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two things on my computer that you would not have,''
Ruell explains, running her long, tapered fingers quickly across
the keyboard. ``I have a screen reader that is a piece of software
which interprets the images on the screen and sends the information
to the second item: a speech synthesizer.''
</P>
<P>
   In detail, the synthesizer, a little black box that sits on top
of her computer's hard drive, converts that information into speech
and essentially tells its listener what is on the computer screen.
With the screen reader telling Ruell exactly where the cursor is at
a given moment, she knows which commands to type in when. (The
synthesizer also reads back what she has typed to make sure she has
made no typos.)
</P>
<P>
   Ruell is able to ``read'' her many books through another special
software program, which scans the printed page and converts it into
code, which her synthesizer then converts into speech. In that way,
she can listen to the latest bestsellers, not always available on
tape.
</P>
<P>
   Ruell logs onto Amazon.com, whose software is compatible with
JAWS, a popular screen-reader program. (The name stands for Job
Access With Speech.) ``I can access the cursor with these arrows,
and as I arrow down and the cursor lands on each site, the
synthesizer will say, `Books, music, videos, software, auctions,
shopping cart.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ruell says she would never want go back to a pre-Internet world.
She loves the independence the new technology gives her. ``I used
to have a reader I paid $10 an hour to read the newspapers and
professional journals to me,'' Ruell says. ``Now I can do Internet
searches for medication information and treatment strategies for my
clients, and there's all sorts of Web content that wasn't available
to me before. For all of us, the use of the Internet has made the
world a much smaller place.''

   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CHRISTOPHER ANDERSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Environmental and religious groups are trying to
force ExxonMobil to admit that the world is getting hotter and that
people and industry are to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``They continue to deny that global warming is happening,'' said
Peter Altman, national coordinator of Campaign ExxonMobil, an
organization recently formed by about 40 environmental and
religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the campaign is to persuade the nation's largest oil
company to withdraw from an industry group Altman contends is
trying to undermine acceptance of an international agreement that
would require industrialized nations to reduce emissions
contributing to global warming.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been very successful in delaying policies that would
help us,'' Altman said of both ExxonMobil and the Global Climate
Coalition, which was formed and funded by ExxonMobil and other
business interests to raise questions about global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Cirigliano, a spokesman for ExxonMobil in Dallas, said the
company recognizes ``the potential for climate change'' but
questions its cause and the wisdom of signing the international
agreement, known as the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators hope to reach final agreement next year on the
treaty. Under the agreement, developed nations may be able to buy
or trade pollution credits with less developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe the current scientific understanding
justifies mandating a reduction in the use of fossil fuels,''
Cirigliano said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said ``large economic harm would result from reductions
in fuel available to consumers by the adoption of the Kyoto
Protocol.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald North, head of the atmospheric sciences department at
Texas A&AMP;M University, said the majority of scientists agree that
the Earth's average temperature rose by at least 1 degree
Fahrenheit in the 1900s and is expected to rise even more in the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think there is a pretty broad consensus that we are
already seeing the warming, that man is the cause and that there
will probably be another three to five degrees of warming,'' said
North, who considers himself a moderate on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency says that the energy burned
to run automobiles, and to heat homes and businesses, contributes
to global warming. The EPA says there has been a dramatic increase
in atmospheric concentrations of heat-trapping gases, including
carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   North said the effect of global warming in Texas and the
projected corresponding 1-to-2-foot rise in the sea level could add
additional stress on already tight water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   It also could cause an increase in heat-related fatalities, as
well as the loss of beach, coastal habitat and fisheries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not necessarily the end of the world,'' North said.
``People are fairly adaptable. There will be irreversible change.
There's no doubt about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Altman said the campaign seeks to pressure ExxonMobil board
members to follow Ford Motor Co.'s lead and withdraw from the
Global Climate Coalition, which he claimed confuses the public and
policymakers about the facts of global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Kelly, the executive director of the Global Climate
Coalition, acknowledged his group represents businesses and
companies with a stake in how the climate issue is resolved, but he
defended its positions and statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many sides to the ongoing debate, and I think it's
disingenuous to suggest that just because we have a different view
of the climate that it's somehow a misinformation campaign,'' Kelly
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said that while the Global Climate Coalition questions
whether global warming is happening, it advocates that companies
voluntarily explore and employ new technology to reduce emissions
that contribute to global warming.
</P>
<P>
   North, however, said he has reservations about the group's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're trying to protect industry, and they certainly
have a right to do so, but I think there's a certain amount of
dishonesty in their statements,'' he said. ``I think they belittle
scientists in the process, which is something I don't like.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sisters of the Holy Spirit, best known for its work with
teen mothers at the Healy-Murphy Center in San Antonio, also is
involved in Campaign ExxonMobil.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Gabriella Lohan, the Sisters' general treasurer, said she
is optimistic that the oil company eventually will warm to the
campaign's position because religious groups have hundreds of
millions of dollars to invest and their congregations include
millions of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's slow work, but we get it done,'' she said.

&HT;     BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It's not certain what will happen this year, but
one sure bet is that we will continue to try to make life easier
for ourselves and will rely on technology to bring it about.
</P>
<P>
   Another certainty is that our preoccupation with crime will not
abate. For that, too, we will look to technology for help.
</P>
<P>
   There is ample evidence that because of those abiding concerns,
we have traveled far along the road toward acceptance of a
pervasive statism, a system under which personal freedoms will give
way to societal controls and governmental oversight, all for our
own good.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is, of course, that this particular form of hell on
Earth won't result from catastrophic war, pandemic plague or
economic cataclysm. No dictator is imposing this on us. We are
doing it to ourselves, with the greatest of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to control crime, banks long ago installed hidden
cameras that record everything within their range. They not only
pick up the occasional thief, they also observe and record people
going about their ordinary affairs. We rationalize that this makes
sense because it helps to curtail bank heists and aids in the
capture of perpetrators. Furthermore, the benefits come at no
inconvenience to the law-abiding.
</P>
<P>
   Supermarkets have emulated banks as have hospitals, post
offices, shopping malls and schools. The refinement of video camera
technologies, along with their shrinking costs, has abetted
surveillance throughout our society, not excluding the streets on
which we live or the highways along which we drive.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras are installed in public parks to discourage vandalism
and violence. Makes sense _ right? _ especially as it saves money
that otherwise would have to be spent on police protection. In the
process, however, much more of the commonplace activities of people
taking recreation will be watched than the episodic anti-social
behavior the cameras are intended to discourage and punish.
</P>
<P>
   Credit cards are a vital cog in sustaining economic good times.
They are much handier, and safer, than carting cash around.
Moreover, they provide the user with a detailed record. Many of
them provide special payoffs in the form of bonus miles for air
travel or a variety of other discounts.
</P>
<P>
   They also are a comprehensive picture of a card user's purchases
and buying habits. Credit card records are handy for governmental
snooping (remember Kenneth Starr's demand for the credit card
records of Monica Lewinsky's book purchases). Although it's
supposed to be illegal, private investigators manage to get hold of
these records for their own purposes.
</P>
<P>
   EZ-Pass eases life for the motorist, enabling the circumvention
of toll booth backups or having to grope for the correct change or
bills. We love it, even though we know that the system precisely
logs our comings and goings, down to how fast we drive. Because of
their very existence, these records are expedient for both
governmental agencies, for presumably but not necessarily legal
purposes, and for non-governmental snoopers.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones are increasingly in use, surely expediting
communications. At the same time, they are easily monitored,
mocking the notion of having a private conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Airport scanners can now penetrate clothing to examine the naked
body, in outline if not detail. (Given the extraordinary pace of
inventiveness so far exhibited, three dimensional detail cannot be
far away). This is good for disarming terrorists before they can
commit foul deeds. The price is the further erosion of the
integrity of the person.
</P>
<P>
   This is only a partial list of the surveillance technologies in
place and operational. We welcome each in turn, because it delivers
a demonstrable benefit. We little heed the cumulative price we pay
for each increment.
</P>
<P>
   Odds are that the cameras will not be working well in all
situations for which they were designed. Malfunctions are
predictable at crucial junctures.
</P>
<P>
   The odds are better that the power of the cameras, which include
scanning and zooming capabilities, will be misused to ogle
desirable targets.
</P>
<P>
   The chances for devising vigorous controls do not look good,
given the varied interests in having them deployed. Without
enforced controls, we could easily find ourselves in time to come
at the dead end of that road upon which we have enthusiastically
embarked, having been overwhelmed by all the safeguards that were
supposed to make life better for us. We will be living in a
monitored society.

IN POLITICS, MUST GEOGRAPHY BE DESTINY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If a modern-day de Tocqueville paid a millennial visit to
America, he might well conclude that when it comes to political
ability, Southerners tower above their countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the grouping is hardly geographically perfect, but if you
define the political South as the rough area of the old
Confederacy, or as the states that have set their presidential
primaries on the same day to maximize regional clout, the area's
domination is staggering to behold.
</P>
<P>
   The president, of course, is a Southerner, as is the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, hails from Mississippi.
Majority Whip Don Nickles comes from Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois presides, but
Majority Whip Tom DeLay, a rock-ribbed Texas conservative,
prevails. The majority leader's post is held by another
right-leaning Texan, Richard Armey, while the House's chief
budget-maker is Bill Archer, yet another Texas conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the presidency, where four of the last six men elected _
Lyndon Johnson, Jimmy Carter, George Bush, and Clinton _ have
hailed from the the South or got their political start there.
</P>
<P>
   So is geography destiny? Perhaps not. Although this year's
front-runners, Republican Governor George W. Bush of Texas and Vice
President Al Gore of Tennessee, are both from that region, both are
facing unexpectedly stiff challenges from men from other regions _
Arizona Senator John McCain and former New Jersey senator Bill
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the fact that this year, unlike in the recent past,
pivotal primaries will occur before Southerners go to the polls en
masse to vote their preferences. That is a key difference that
could work to the advantage of McCain and especially Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   What's undeniable is that more than a drawl separates the South
from the rest of America. Kevin Phillips, who devised Richard
Nixon's so-called ``Southern strategy'' in 1968, puts the
difference this way: As a region, the South remains more
agricultural, more patriotic, more religious, and more racially
focused than the country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Carrick, former executive director of the South Carolina
Democratic Party and now a California-based political consultant,
says a deep suspicion of government, a deeper patriotism, an
antipathy toward government programs that benefit minorities, and a
Protestant churchiness also help shape the politics of the South.
(It's hard, for instance, to imagine a Northeastern candidate
wearing his religion on his sleeve the way Bush and Gore have
chosen to.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, to be sure, Southern influence has had different effects on
the two parties. ``In the case of the Democrats, the South has
pulled the party toward the center,'' says political analyst
William Schneider. ``In the case of the Republicans, the South has
pulled the party away from the center.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, if today's Southern Democrats tend to be mainstream
moderates, they have been men on a regional mission: In the 1980s,
this group dedicated themselves to taking the party back from
Northern and Midwestern liberals. Thus Super Tuesday _ the early
March set of Southern primaries _ and the Democratic Leadership
Council, the political organization dedicated to a mainstream
policy agenda _ were created to forward that goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Southerners can make a strong argument their political path
paid off. President Clinton is the first twice-elected Democrat
since Franklin D. Roosevelt, and his success has left the Democrats
stewards of a booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Clinton-Gore era has hardly been a time
of wine and roses for liberals, once a core Democratic primary
constituency. The last seven years have seen the president endorse
the notion that big government is bad, abandon a traditional
Democratic commitment on welfare, and, as historians James
MacGregor Burns and Georgia Sorenson point out in ``Dead Center,''
conduct a rear-guard rhetorical presidency that eschewed bold steps
in favor of small, symbolic measures.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it's noteworthy that the surprisingly strong
challenge to Gore has come from a Democrat who has struck
unapologetically liberal stands on health care, race relations,
child poverty, and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   If to be an elected Southern Democrat is to be a politician
comfortable with minorities and coalition politics, to be a
Southern Republican is to be a member of an overwhelmingly white
party that has prospered in no small part as a conservative
reaction to the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   The backlash against the Republican Congress that drove
Clinton's reelection in 1996 and Democratic gains in 1998
illustrates the problem, and the question, for George W. Bush,
whose family has roots in New England, but who, like his father,
has made a business and political career in Texas: Have Southern
Republicans become too far out of step with the rest of the country
to be elected nationally?
</P>
<P>
   Part of Bush's appeal is that, with his proven reach to Latinos,
he seems to break that mold. And he's taken pains to distance
himself from the excess of the Republican Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Yet several of the stands Bush has taken as governor of Texas _
signing a ``right to carry'' law legalizing concealed weapons, for
example, or opposing a hate-crimes bill _ could come back to haunt
him in the general election. (As could Houston's
worst-in-the-nation air quality; remember Pere Bush's use of
polluted Boston Harbor against Michael Dukakis is 1988?)
</P>
<P>
   On both sides, it's a changed primary calendar that may let
those disagreements and doubts come into full relief.
</P>
<P>
   The South has long played a pivotal role in the primaries,
boosting Carter early in 1976 and sustaining him in 1980, for
example. But the advent of Super Tuesday made the nomination
process center around one preemptive question: Can a candidate play
in the South?
</P>
<P>
   If the answer was no, the curtain soon fell. In 1992, Paul
Tsongas entered Super Tuesday as a leading contender, only to be
swamped by Clinton's seven same-day Southern victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Super Tuesday was meant to eliminate somebody like me,''
Tsongas said. He was right. But this year, in the rush to go early,
other states have hopscotched over the South.
</P>
<P>
   The big Southern primary day is March 14, when Texas, Florida,
Louisiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Mississippi all hold their
contests.
</P>
<P>
   Before those states have their say, however, March 7 looms. On
that day, all of New England save New Hampshire hold their
primaries, as do Ohio, Missouri, Maryland, and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   But the big prizes on March 7 are California and New York, the
nation's most and third most populous states. They are the big
reason that the day may well reshape this year's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Southerners lose those states, candidates that had
been considered front-runners will find themselves facing grave
doubts about their electability.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, losing New York and California would be a torpedo to
his plausibility, since a Democrat will likely need both states to
prevail in November. With a New Hampshire win, Bradley would be
posed to sweep New England and lock in New York, where he is
currently about even with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Thus California is key, says Curtis Gans, director of the
Committee for the Study of the American Electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bradley loses there, then the Southern states will solidify
the nomination for Gore,'' he says. ``But if Bradley wins
California, it means a contest all the way to June.''
</P>
<P>
   One national Democratic strategist puts it more starkly: ``If
Bradley wins in New Hampshire, sweeps through New England and New
York, and wins California, then Gore is reduced to simply being a
Southern candidate, and he can't be nominated.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been trapped in that perceptual box before. Although he
won five Southern states on Super Tuesday in 1988, his inability to
score a significant victory outside the South left his campaign
mired in Dixie and tractionless elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are Southern candidates natural fits in California. Compared
with the South, ``California is much more socially liberal on
issues like abortion, school prayer, gun control, and environmental
protection,'' says Carrick.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Clinton has fared well in California, and Gore
remains comfortably ahead there _ so far.
</P>
<P>
   McCain faces a somewhat different challenge, in part because the
Republican primary calendar is different from the Democratic
schedule. He needs perfect execution of an interregional
stepping-stone strategy that leads from New Hampshire on Feb. 1 to
South Carolina on Feb. 19 and then to Arizona and Michigan on Feb.
22.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long shot, yes. Still, McCain is on the move, and wins in
those four states would leave him poised for a big day on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   For either Bradley or Gore, winning will require running a
strong campaign against an establishment-backed front-runner whose
institutional support will help him survive a stumble.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, despite all that, the seminal fact is this: This year,
unlike in campaigns past, the pivotal primaries will take place
before the South weighs in. And that's changed the burden of proof:
This year, there's a real and early burden on the Southern
candidates to prove they can win outside Dixie.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bush and Gore lose California, they are in bad shape,''
says Schneider. ``If they lose there, can the South save them? I am
skeptical.''

IN MAINE, IT'S A MOUSE FACTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAR HARBOR, Maine _ Stargazer has never been normal. Visibly
scrawny from the age of 14 days, the mouse walks with a little
stagger and tumbles helplessly when immersed in water, unable to
right itself. Every few seconds, it tosses its head back and
freezes, staring into space.
</P>
<P>
   Deviant behavior, perhaps, but the mouse is not unwanted. Since
1979, when a caretaker fished the first stargazer out from among
half a million caged mice in Jackson Laboratory, government funds
and untold hours of human effort have gone into keeping 70
generations of his twitching descendants alive. Finally, a little
more than a year ago, the stargazer strain paid off: Using the
mouse, researchers pinpointed a mutated gene that could explain the
ancient human affliction of epileptic seizures.
</P>
<P>
   A small network of neurological researchers all over the country
is interested in stargazer mice, but researchers can buy the mice
only here, among the lobster rolls and summer cottages of Bar
Harbor. Jackson Laboratory supplies the world's largest variety of
mutant mice, which have eclipsed other lab animals as scientists
learned to snip out and swap their genes with those of humans. Last
year, 1.7 million mice _ representing $28.6 million in sales _ left
this ragged stretch of coastline in climate-controlled trucks,
headed south for labs where scientists had been waiting eagerly,
some for up to two years.
</P>
<P>
   Since the technology to substitute and block genes in mice was
perfected in the late 1980s, interest in mouse genetics has
exploded. Mice bred to suffer from human ailments have been crucial
to recent discoveries in the fields of aging, vision, cancer,
diabetes, and epilepsy research. According to a survey by the
National Association for Biological Research, scientists used about
17 million mice in 1998, and said they would be using 50 percent
more within the next five years. From a business standpoint,
Jackson Laboratory happened to be sitting on an oil well when it
burst.
</P>
<P>
   But the laboratory is not a business; it's a nonprofit research
facility commissioned by the National Institutes of Health to store
the mice that scientists make. Somewhere inside the lab's rows of
mouse rooms, or deep-frozen as embryos in vats of liquid nitrogen,
2,400 strains of mutants are being preserved _ morbidly obese mice,
painfully thin mice, mice with glaucoma and spina bifida, mice with
curly tails, mice that walk only in circles, mice with
abnormalities that have no known significance at all _ just in case
someone needs them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackson lab is a library,'' said Ralph Dell, director of the
Institute for Lab Animal Research at the National Academy of
Sciences. ``The popular books are on the first floor, and if you
want the rarer books, you might have to go into the basement and
rummage through and dust them off.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1929, long before this amazing roster of disease was
developed, the Jackson mice arrived here by train from Ann Arbor,
Mich. Their owner, a cancer researcher named Clarence Cook Little,
had retreated to Bar Harbor from a dissolving marriage and his
controversial presidency of the University of Michigan. Until 1933,
the network of scientists known as ``The Mouse Men of America'' had
always exchanged mice freely. But that year, with money so tight
that lab workers donated their salaries for mouse chow, Little
started selling them.
</P>
<P>
   One byproduct of Jackson's growing mouse factory were new
strains of mutant mice, who were fished out from squirming litters
by handlers and brought to a weekly clearinghouse called the
``deviant search.'' By mating the unusual mouse with littermates
carrying a recessive gene for the same trait, Jackson began
developing genetically pure mutant strains. Over the years, the
inventory expanded to include such lines as deaf waddler, claw paw,
flailer, twitcher, tight skin, grizzled, greasy and lurcher,
hammer-toe, waltzer, loop tail, vibrator, pirouette, stumbler, and
stargazer, along with 615 others.
</P>
<P>
   But the world changed in the late 1980s, when scientists learned
how to manufacture, and not just find, mutants. Since mouse DNA was
largely decoded, and is suprisingly similar to human DNA,
scientists could inject a human gene into a mouse embryo and see
what happens. The mouse boom was on. Dell recalls that in 1986,
when he took the helm of Columbia University's Institute for Lab
Animal Research, the university had 6,000 mice. By the time he left
11 years later, Columbia's labs were housing 50,000 of them. Now
there are 75,000.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers would like to see a dozen facilities throughout the
country, each with a million mice available, said Dell. Biotech
companies such as Charles River Laboratories and Taconic entered
the market, offering quicker turnaround for limited numbers of
popular mutant mice.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, though, many scientists working with rarer
mutants can look only to Bar Harbor, where breeders are struggling
to keep up with demand.
</P>
<P>
   James Heywood, who runs a Newton, Mass.-based foundation for
researching amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease,
has become frustrated with the wait for the particular mutant mouse
his lab requires, which is available only from Jackson. Heywood
established the foundation to help his ill brother. He said the
labs researching Lou Gehrig's disease have sometimes waited four or
five months for the right mice, setting back the research as much
as six months. To patients with a disease like his brother's, he
said, ``six months of delay is six months of disease.''
</P>
<P>
   With an eye toward easing the bottleneck, Jackson Laboratory
brought in businessman Warren Cook, a veteran of the ski industry,
to head up its retail efforts. Cook said Jackson is prepared to
supply only 20 percent of the orders it receives, and he hopes to
get that up to 80 percent. ``It's been a pretty product-driven
place,'' he said, ``and it needs to be customer-driven.'' Demand
for these mice is growing 20 percent a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the expansion, Jackson could edge out a local paper
manufacturer to become the largest single employer in Hancock
County, said Maine state Senator Jill Goldthwait, who lives in Bar
Harbor. Jackson is a huge economic boon to the area, where limping
fisheries have left many locals with low-paying seasonal work, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   To Muriel Davisson, a mouse geneticist at Jackson, stargazer's
recent success is a good example of the rare privilege that Jackson
can give its researchers: the time and space to take a chance on a
mutant. In 1979, Davisson was intrigued enough by stargazer's
strange pauses to include the line in her colony at the Mutant
Mouse Resource. Six years later, a visiting neurologist discovered
stargazer's brain waves were similar to those of humans with
petit-mal epileptic seizures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you get a mutant and you can't find anything wrong
with it, but you know that something is wrong, and you have a
choice'' whether to keep it or not, Davisson said. ``It just
happened we were hanging on to this one.''

&HT;     PRIMARY COMPETITION? DON'T COUNT ON NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN LYNCH  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ What have we had to endure in our last half-dozen
presidents?
</P>
<P>
   1. A horny hillbilly who seems to envision himself as Kennedy
Lite.
</P>
<P>
   2. An awkward preppie with two middle names, money that goes
back so far that nobody can recall who stole it, a guy who once
barfed on foreign dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   3. A jovial actor in B-movies who honed his leadership skills
peddling electric ranges on television.
</P>
<P>
   4. An earnest but distressingly inept peanut farmer who once
reported seeing a UFO.
</P>
<P>
   5. Somebody nobody voted for but who reminded everybody of the
middle figure in the evolution chart.
</P>
<P>
   6. Richard Nixon. Once, when Nixon posed for a photo with Jimmy
Carter and Gerald Ford, Bob Dole dubbed the trio ``Hear no evil,
see no evil and evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Can we do better this time around? One can only hope.
</P>
<P>
   If we can, though, it won't be because the people who run
politics in New York are being much help. With the state's
presidential primary coming on March 7, leaders of both parties
seem bent on denying New York voters much of a choice. Some states
_ California, for example _ put candidates on the ballot simply
because they're considered ``viable.'' Not in New York, though.
Here, the bosses are essentially preventing rank-and-file Democrats
and Republicans from choosing the candidates on their own.
</P>
<P>
   How are they doing that? Let me explain:
</P>
<P>
   Question: How are the Democrats doing it?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Virtually every powerful Democratic official in New York
has lined up behind Vice President Al Gore. Everybody in the party
who controls jobs, promotions and the futures of run-of-the-mill
Democratic politicians has made it clear. They're saying, ``This my
guy. You like him, too, don't you?'' And, with only a few
exceptions, the rank-and-file people are saying, ``Yeah, sure.''
Wouldn't you? But it's even worse with the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How so?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, the Democratic bosses have at least made it possible
for candidates they don't back to get on the primary ballot. If you
want to compete for New York's delegates to the national
convention, all you have to do is get 5,000 valid signatures
statewide on nomination petitions. Generally, because of
disqualification rules _ for example, your name on a petition must
be signed precisely as it appears on the voter rolls _ obtaining
5,000 signatures that will pass muster means getting a minimum of
10,000 Democratic voters to sign your petitions. But to get on the
GOP primary ballot, you need 20,000 valid signatures _ or,
essentially, a minimum of 40,000 Republican voters to sign your
nominating petitions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whew, that's a lot.
</P>
<P>
   A: You bet. That explains why Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
choice of the GOP bosses, will appear on the ballot in each of New
York's 31 congressional districts, but Sen. John McCain of Arizona
will appear on the ballot in only two-thirds of those districts.
Steve Forbes got on by coughing up $750,000 of his own money to
hire workers to distribute his petitions. Isn't it nice to have a
rich daddy to leave you a few billion bucks?
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about the other Republican candidates? What about Gary
Bauer or Alan Keyes?
</P>
<P>
   A: They won't be on the New York ballot. The New York bosses
opposed them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Out of curiosity, who did the New York bosses back four years
ago?
</P>
<P>
   A: In a burst of brilliance, they backed Bob Dole and shut out
everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Oh, good thinking.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, Bill Clinton thought so, too.

WHY KENNEDY IS FOR GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. _ To appreciate the surprising decision by
Edward Kennedy to support Al Gore for president before the first
primary, it helps to go off on a vitally important tangent _ life
among the 14 million disabled people in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, with not enough notice, there was a major expansion
of programs to help about half the disabled do what so many of them
desperately want to do _ work and live independent lives.
</P>
<P>
   The program succeeded above all because health care coverage
under both Medicaid and Medicare was imaginatively grafted onto
job-training and job search assistance. The main author, as usual,
was Kennedy. President Clinton and Gore were aboard early and
vocally, and a legislative effort that began as reasonably
bipartisan eventually became a congressional tidal wave of
near-unanimity.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion is a carefully constructed program of incentives
and services aimed at one of the major obstacles to work _ the near
impossibility of obtaining health insurance. It works because it
assembles a considerable array of building blocks under existing
laws, adds to them with a new law, and utterly changes the
landscape for the half of all disabled people who are covered under
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   And Bradley's astonishingly poorly conceived health care
proposals would aim a dagger at it.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, outside of a few attempted reassurances with no details,
for Bradley the disabled don't exist at all. Instead _ along with
all kinds of extremely vulnerable people _ they would be tossed
into ``special needs'' or assigned risk pools for insurance
coverage of unknown dimensions, unknown costs, with unknown
strings, copayments, and deductibles.
</P>
<P>
   In jettisoning Medicaid for insurance premium subsidies that
don't come close to matching the program's careful mix of benefits
and services for those who need health care the most, Bradley
goofed big time. He could repair the goof, but that would require a
huge increase in the costs associated with his health care ideas,
and so he does nothing.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the guy with the big idea in this fight, the
leader able to bring about change on a huge scale and with a
detailed track record of helping the Clinton administration do it
time and time again is Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's contemptuous dismissal of Senator Kennedy last week
was a crude attempt to mask an important fact of life _ not a
political one, but a substantive one.
</P>
<P>
   The country's most important advocate and workhorse for national
health insurance is also the country's most imporant advocate and
workhorse on the building blocks in health care that can make
universal coverage happen.
</P>
<P>
   And this guy who has been doing the hard work for only about 30
years longer than Bradley is backing Al Gore for president for
reasons that have everything to do with that work.
</P>
<P>
   Politics doesn't help much on this. Getting involved in
presidential primaries (1980 notwithstanding) is a famous Kennedy
no-no, above all in years he is running for reelection.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking long precedent required what pure politics couldn't
supply, but the Kennedy-Clinton-Gore record on health care can.
</P>
<P>
   As Kennedy put it, they have conspired on a number of big casino
matters: making health insurance portable for workers, putting huge
new investments into the disease-fighting operations of the
National Institutes of Health, the protection and expansion of
Medicaid and Medicare, the enactment of an effort to insure half
the country's 11 million uninsured children, and now the most
important assault on the problems of the disabled in years.
</P>
<P>
   In supporting Gore, the senator who put universal health
coverage on the nation's agenda almost 30 years ago and has never
let it be removed remarked that piling up these building blocks is
``the best opportunity to get to universal coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Gore himself made the same point in the debate
at the University of New Hampshire Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's snide swipe at Kennedy as ``the establishment'' and
his above-it-all view of policy-making life in Washington's
``bunkers'' betray his own disdain for the hard work it takes to
make things happen against the determined oppposition of
special-interest lobbies that have fought decent health care ideas
throughout this century.
</P>
<P>
   As always, his fingernails are too clean.
</P>
<P>
   Having done the work, Gore knows that Medicaid is not just a
poverty program; it is a safety net. It doesn't just provide
insurance, but for the disabled it also provides services like
rehab care and transportation that are just as vital. When people
on Medicaid got jobs under previous law, there was often a literal
choice between working and keeping health care.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation Kennedy (and Vermont's GOP senator, Jim
Jeffords) passed with the administration's support, there would be
revolutionary change.
</P>
<P>
   And Bradley's grand idea is to put it all at risk.
</P>

STANDOFF IN AN EGYPTIAN VILLAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AL KOSHEH, Egypt _ In a once-quiet town along the Nile, now torn
apart by some of the worst violence in memory between Egypt's
Muslim majority and Christian minority, the military has moved in.
</P>
<P>
   After four days of rioting that ended Tuesday with 22 Christians
and one Muslim killed, hundreds of soldiers and police in combat
gear ringed the town and set up roadblocks flanked by jeeps mounted
with machine guns.
</P>
<P>
   Armored personnel carriers rumbled down dusty streets. A
military curfew was in effect. Phone lines were cut off. And the
government prevented journalists from entering.
</P>
<P>
   From one checkpoint, rows of burned shops, smashed store
windows, and churches and Christian homes draped in the black
bunting of mourning were visible.
</P>
<P>
   To the Coptic minority, the government's response has been a
disappointing and dangerous exercise in militarizing the situation
while ignoring a festering undercurrent of religious hatred.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are spending too much energy on surrounding the town with
the military to keep the media out, and too little time examining
the root of the problem here, and the need for leadership to stop
it,'' said Bishop Wissa , the senior cleric in the region, at the
Coptic church's central cathedral about five miles from Al Kosheh.
</P>
<P>
   The tension in Al Kosheh has been simmering since August 1998,
when two Christian men were found murdered. In the days that
followed, local police, all of them Muslim, rounded up 1,000
Christians in the town and tortured dozens in an effort to extract
confessions that would pin the blame on another Christian, rather
than on the Muslims who did the killing, according to Christan
townspeople.
</P>
<P>
   The police actions outraged Coptic leaders and human rights
activists, and suddenly the sleepy town of Al Kosheh became a
flashpoint between the Coptic minority and the overwhelmingly
Muslim state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This violence grows out of the injustices surrounding that
murder. People were tortured; an innocent man is on trial. It is
amid all this insecurity and injustice for Christians that things
grew worse,'' said Wissa, a frail 61-year-old who was himself
arrested for bringing the allegations of torture to light. A
sedition charge against him is still pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government cannot continue to ignore what is happening
here, or we will have more funerals at our churches,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government of President Hosni Mubarak dispatched a minister
to assess the situation last week, but the impression of residents
here is that Cairo is intent on sweeping the problems between
Egypt's Muslims and Christians under the rug.
</P>
<P>
   This attitude seemed to have been fueled by the clipped comments
of General Ahmed Abdel Aziz Bakr, governor of the region, who told
reporters: ``The government will use every means necessary to
restore the order that was here'' before Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses to the four days of violence said that it had been
touched off by an argument between a Christian and a Muslim
shopowner, and that it quickly escalated into street fighting. By
 &UR; evening &LR;  on Dec. 31, the violence turned against the Christian
community, a majority in this town of 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Christian residents said that on Jan. 1, armed gangs of Muslim
men looted stores and broke into homes owned by Christians. On Jan.
2, the killing started; Christians returned from Sunday  &UR; morning
 &LR; church services to find their stores being looted, and when they
began defending their property, men with rifles and machine guns
opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``My shop was totally destroyed while we were at church,''
Shahad Bahid, 37. ``But I know now that if I returned to protect it
I probably would have been killed.''
</P>
<P>
   The gun-wielding men dragged Christians out of their cars,
witnesses said. They stole herds of cattle and shot the owners,
leaving their bodies amid the dense rows of sugar cane and corn
stalks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were shooting people in the street. You could hear the
yelling and the screaming, and you could see the Muslim men setting
Christian stores on fire and rampaging,'' said the Rev. Jibrial, a
Coptic priest at the Church of the Angel Michael, who witnessed the
violence from inside the church gates.
</P>
<P>
   Shamshun Michaeli saw his son, Wael, 17, shot dead on the street
last Sunday. Jibrial watched as Michaeli ran into the gunfire and
then, screaming, held his son's body in the empty street.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters were barred from the town by authorities but were able
to interview Jibrial and several witnesses at a police station in
the neighboring town of Dar Salam, where they went to complain
about police inaction against those responsible for the killing.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, bells tolled in the Coptic churches as they
celebrated Orthodox Christmas, while the Muslim call to prayer
blared over loudspeakers, heralding the end of the holy month of
Ramadan. (Orthodox Christians mark Christmas by the Julian
calendar, which places it on Jan. 7 on the Gregorian calendar.)
</P>
<P>
   As the two faiths observed their holiest days, they also
struggled to understand how their community had been dramatically
torn apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no Christmas in Al Kosheh this year,'' Jibrial said.
</P>
<P>
   The Coptic faith, one of the oldest branches of Christianity,
traces its roots to St. Mark the Evangelist, who is said to have
arrived in Egypt in 60 AD. The Copts have coexisted uneasily with
Muslims since the 7th century and complain of being marginalized by
the larger society and targeted as infidels by Islamic militants.
But only rarely has the tension between Muslims and Christians
erupted into violence the way it did in Al Kosheh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christians of this town are living in fear for their
lives. How can they be joyous about their Christmas?'' Jibrial
asked.

BUSH PUTS FAITH IN IOWA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ When Elizabeth H. Dole arrived here last week to
convey her endorsement of George W. Bush, she said they both
``share a deep personal faith and belief in the power of prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Her remark was overshadowed by speculation about a place for her
on a possible Republican ticket headed by Bush, yet it represented
another effort to buttress Bush's standing among Christian
conservatives, one of the largest constituencies in Iowa Republican
politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor appealed to the same audience in a debate
here last month by naming Jesus Christ the ``political philosopher
or thinker'' with whom he felt most comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Some Washington analysts found the statement jarring. CNN's Bill
Schneider called the remark ``controversial,'' while MSNBC's Chris
Matthews said Bush should have cited someone else. A commentator in
the Los Angeles Times said Bush's ``assertion was seen as religious
pandering at its worst.''
</P>
<P>
   But in this stolid Midwestern state with middle-American values,
Bush's overtures to religious conservatives are considered smart
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican debate has religion intertwined in its
discourse,'' said Dee Stewart, executive director of the Republican
Party of Iowa. ``Our caucus attendee is not going to be offended by
a discussion of God or moral values in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   At least a quarter _ and perhaps as many as 40 percent _ of the
Iowa Republican voters come from strong Christian conservative
backgrounds, Stewart said. They helped ignite Patrick Buchanan's
insurgency here in 1996, when an impressive second-place finish put
him in position to upset Bob Dole in the New Hampshire primary a
week later.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1988 caucus, the Rev. Pat Robertson, the televangelist
who founded the Christian Coalition, stunned the nation by
finishing second, behind Dole but ahead of the man who eventually
won the presidency, George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The religious forces here are composed of fundamentalist
Protestants as well as Catholics dedicated to abolishing abortion
rights. Among other issues, they believe in prayer in classrooms
and seek government aid for parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   The movement first showed its teeth in Iowa in 1978, when
Senator Dick Clark, a liberal Democrat, was beaten by Republican
Roger Jepsen, after a right-to-life campaign targeted Clark. In
1980, another Democratic senator from Iowa, John Culver, was
battered by a ``New Right'' media assault and beaten by Charles
Grassley, who still holds the seat.
</P>
<P>
   Jepsen was driven from office later in the decade, after his
Christian constituency learned he frequented a massage parlor
featuring ``nude encounter sessions.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, secular issues may be dominating the contest in New
Hampshire, but all five GOP candidates competing in Iowa in the
Jan. 24 caucuses are courting the Christian faithful:
</P>
<P>
   --Gary Bauer, a leader of the Family Research Council and a
highly visible advocate of religious causes before entering the
race, enjoys a natural following within Christian circles.
</P>
<P>
   --Steve Forbes, a champion of the flat tax in 1996, has made
opposition to abortion a pet issue this year in an attempt to make
inroads among the powerful bloc that ignored him four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   --Alan Keyes, who won 7 percent of the votes in the last Iowa
caucus on the strength of his speeches denouncing abortion,
inveighing against homosexuality, and supporting prayer in schools,
is striking the same themes again.
</P>
<P>
   --Utah Senator Orrin Hatch is also using his long record as a
conservative lawmaker to woo the same groups.
</P>
<P>
   (Arizona Senator John McCain is not actively campaigning in
Iowa.)
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, meanwhile, has begun speaking out more
frequently about his own religious commitment. ``The Bible has
influenced me a lot. I read it every day,'' he said in an interview
with the conservative National Review.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who embraced his wife's Methodist faith years ago, also
spoke of ``a very serious evangelical movement taking place in
America. It's challenging the traditional church in many ways.''
</P>
<P>
   While the numbers of the Episcopal Church, in which he was
raised, ``seem to be declining,'' he said, ``the Bible church is
not. There is a backlash to the cultural excesses of the Sixties
and Seventies.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments by the leading Republican candidate are a departure
from his reputation as a ``young and irresponsible'' playboy, an
image Bush had to fight off early in the campaign. As he told the
National Review: ``I've sought redemption and believe I've found
it. I get great strength from the Bible.''

NEW RULES PREVAIL IN 2000 RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ The Republican primary contest, in many ways a
race to the right, has developed an unusual subplot: a contest that
centers on one candidate, George W. Bush, whose ``compassionate
conservatism'' is sometimes interpreted as code for moderation, and
another, Senator John McCain, who is running on populist themes
that often sound Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   The two Democratic candidates, meanwhile, seem determined to
outdo each other in appealing to the party's liberal wing on issues
from gay rights to health care to abortion. Neither Vice President
Al Gore nor former Senator Bill Bradley resists the liberal label,
and both have increasingly eschewed the ``New Democrat'' moderate
strategy that elected President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the emerging fault lines of Campaign 2000,
etched in the granite of the first primary state of New Hampshire,
and underscored in South Carolina with its vital Feb. 19 vote.
These lines have grown brighter and deeper, following a week of
almost daily debates, and have given the campaign a fairly familiar
shape: Republicans mostly talking tax cuts, Democrats arguing about
ambitious, and costly, policy dreams.
</P>
<P>
   But against that backdrop there is something that sets this
political season apart: candidates are employing a degree of
specificity about issues that is extraordinary so early in a
presidential contest. This is particularly the case with the two
Democrats, whose contest has, since midautumn, consisted largely a
sustained debate _ sometimes testy, often dense and baffling, but
always serious and substantive _ about health care.
</P>
<P>
   There has been nothing quite like it on the GOP side. Still, in
both parties it is the rare candidate without a detailed tax plan
and a reasonably complete health care policy. It is a heartening
trend to those who have long lamented the short-shrifting of
substance in national campaigns, but there are political risks as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody always pushes each other to come out with specifics,
but it will come back to dog them in the general election,'' said
Dartmouth College professor of government Dean Spiliotes. ``When
you are this specific so early, it is hard to sprint back to the
middle in the general election.''
</P>
<P>
   Just four years ago, Bob Dole waited until the summer before the
national election to unveil his tax plan. But in the 2000 race,
most of the Republican candidates have already made their tax
proposals, with Gary Bauer last week ridiculing McCain for failing
to produce a plan. McCain, in fact, plans to announce his tax
program Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Bradley's detailed health care plan has
framed the debate and helped propel the former New Jersey senator
into competitive status against Gore. By contrast, when Bill
Clinton campaigned for president in 1992, he talked vaguely about
health care and did not come up with a plan until after many months
of study led by his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Stuart Rothenberg said that while Bradley and
Gore have their differences, their policies are not as different as
the candidates portray them. ``The major fault line in the race is
still Bradley as the reformer, the outsider, the candidate of one
or two big issues who will make a big impact, versus Gore, the
candidate of the establishment, of Democratic constiuency groups,
who is talking about how Bradley ran away from the party,''
Rothenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some Republicans are rubbing their hands in glee at the
sound bites from the debates that might be used against the
Democratic nominee during the general election. But Republicans may
have a similar problem. In Thursday's debate in Durham, N.H.,
George W. Bush all but promised never to raise taxes except in
extraordinary cases such as financing a war. The comment was
designed to have appeal in the antitax climate in New Hampshire and
the Republican Party in general, but it also evoked memories of
former President Bush, who broke his own ``read my lips, no new
taxes'' vow. It does not take much imagination to envision a
Democratic ad that quotes Bush's tax cut pledge and then replays
the tape of his father's broken promise.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has one of the most conservative voting records of
any senator, repeatedly delivers populist, Democratic-sounding
themes. In the debate here Friday night, he blasted Bush for a
``fiscally irresponsible'' tax cut plan that he said gives too much
benefit to the rich, and called for an end to unregulated ``soft
money'' contributions that disproportionately favor the Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is counting on his maverick agenda to have appeal in New
Hampshire, where Independents may vote in either party primary, and
in South Carolina, where Independents and Democrats can vote in the
GOP primary. But it is far less clear how McCain's effort will fare
among the party faithful, and his campaign could falter in states
where only Republicans may participate in the GOP contest.
</P>
<P>
   The other GOP candidates have tried to convince voters that Bush
and McCain are abandoning the conservatives who normally determine
the outcome of primaries. Alan Keyes, the uncompromisingly
conservative talk show host and long-shot candidate, wondered aloud
where the conservatives have gone. Steve Forbes's campaign manager
Bill Dal Col Sunday summed up his candidate's strategy in five
words: ``We are the conservative candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   No candidate has dared for long the kind of campaign that
emphasizes sweeping rhetoric, stinting on detail. And the major
candidates have also, in various ways, paid a price. It is always
easier to attack a political foe who details what he or she would
do. McCain, for example, is plainly paying the price for
specificity on his top issue, an overhaul of the campaign finance
system, now that it is clear that his actions have not always been
a match for his ideals.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Boston Globe reported that McCain had written
letters to the Federal Communications Commission urging that it
take action on a decision being sought by a major contributor to
his campaign, who also allowed McCain to use a corporate jet on
several occasions. That opened McCain up to questions about whether
he was living up to his own rhetoric about the need to overhaul the
campaign system. Since then, several other like examples have
surfaced to underscore the pattern.
</P>
<P>
   McCain insisted he did nothing more than he would have done for
anyone who had complained of FCC foot-dragging, but he canceled a
Saturday fund-raiser that was to be hosted by the same contributor
to avoid questions about an appearance of impropriety.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, has taken a position on campaign finance that
could hurt him in the general election. The Texas governor has
raised an unprecedented $70 million for his primary campaign and
has rejected federal matching funds, which allows him to avoid
spending caps that apply to all of the other candidates except
Steve Forbes, who is self-financing most of his race.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Bush has defended one of the most controversial
activities in politics, the collection of unregulated ``soft
money'' to the political parties. That is the practice that allows
an individual to give contributions of $100,000 or more to a party,
while the same person can give no more than $1,000 to a candidate
per election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Some of issue talk is so detailed that it can be mind-numbing
for debate watchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole discussion about `capped vouchers' vs. `weighted
average vouchers' _ the average person could care less about it,''
Spiliotes said. ``They just want to know whether they will have
health care.''
</P>
<P>
   But such details seem crucial to the candidates, who spend hours
mastering details before debates.
</P>
<P>
   For the Republicans, particularly for the party's front-runners,
taxes have emerged as the race's signature issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bush describes his tax cut of $483 billion over 10 years as a
reasonable middle ground. ``I've been criticized for being too
bold, and I've been criticized for not being bold enough,'' Bush
says in one ad that began running this week. ``It kind of says to
me I'm doing all right.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has proposed a tax cut about half as large as the Texas
governor's, about $500 billion over 10 years, but the Arizonan is
likely to increase the size of his tax cut when he unveils the full
proposal Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But even with a higher dollar figure, the message of McCain's
tax plan will be that it is more prudent and equitable than Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan would give more than 60 percent of its benefits to
the top 10 percent of taxpayers, according to the liberal Center
for Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington. Specifically, Bush
proposes to cut federal income tax rates. His plan drops the two
top rates of 39.6 percent and 36 percent to 33 percent. The middle
rates of 28 percent and 31 percent would be reduced to 25 percent.
Bush would leave unchanged the bottom rate of 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, for Gore and Bradley the question is not how best to
return the surplus, it is a matter of how best to use it for social
programs like health care and education.
</P>
<P>
   But even on the Democratic side, the same arguments about fiscal
prudence and risk apply.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has built his campaign around his health care plan,
which he says could cost $650 billion over 10 years. Gore says the
figure is much higher, however, perhaps more than $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   And just as McCain warns that Bush's tax cut will leave no money
for other priorities, Gore charges that Bradley ``blows the
surplus'' and ``doesn't leave room for investing in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has countered by saying that ``in a period of
unprecedented surplus,'' the vice president should offer more
ambitious health care solutions. And he also has alleged that
Gore's programs would exhaust the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   And so they beat on, matching detail against detail, in a
ceaseless argument that will end only on election day.

CANDIDATES' TRUE COLORS COMING THROUGH IN DEBATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first Democratic and Republican presidential candidate
debates of the new year appears to have revealed more about the top
contenders than all the previous debates combined.
</P>
<P>
   Although some viewers thought former Sen. Bill Bradley won last
week's debate against Vice President Al Gore, there were a number
of other viewers, based on various reports, that saw Bradley
actually lose ground during the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Those other viewers, perhaps for the first time, saw Bradley
come across as a bit more mean-spirited and, at times,
condescending and perhaps too sarcastic during his exchanges with
Gore, especially over Gore's strong criticism of his health plan.
As for Gore, he appeared to be more comfortable at this debate than
in previous ones. Perhaps the earlier endorsement by Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, still very popular and influential, helped his comfort
level.
</P>
<P>
   If Bradley continues to show more of this negative side, it
could cost him precious votes in next month's New Hampshire
primary, particularly among women voters.
</P>
<P>
   At last week's Republican debate, Sen. John McCain, who is in a
dead heat with Texas Gov. George W. Bush in the New Hampshire
primary race, may have lost a bit of his moral high ground. McCain
faced questions about his efforts to influence the Federal
Communications Commission in a case that involved a major
contributor to his campaign. McCain defended his actions, but some
political observers thought that having to do so cost him some of
his stature in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bradley nor McCain can afford to lose any ground in
their respective tight races in New Hampshire. If they lose there,
even by slim margins, their chances of gaining the presidential
nomination later this year become not only slimmer, but virtually
non-existent. If they lose by substantial margins to their
respective opponents in New Hampshire, it will be all but over for
them in this year's presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore wins the New Hampshire primary, it will provide great
impetus to his quest for the presidential nomination. Despite some
polls giving Bradley a lead, some labor activists believe that a
solid turnout by organized labor for Gore could skewer the results
in Gore's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Gore loses the New Hampshire primary, it will not mean
that he is destined to lose the presidential nomination. He is
expected to do well in the southern primaries as well as in other
areas of the nation. And Gore is further expected to have more than
enough support among influential Democrats to gain the nomination
at the Democratic convention. So Gore, as did President Clinton,
can lose the New Hampshire primary, but still win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   If Bradley and McCain, the underdogs to win their party's
nominations, win the New Hampshire primary, both their candidaces
will get a definite boost, but it may not carry them far enough to
win enough other key primaries to carry them to their party's
nomination. Bradley, for example, could do well in New York, where
he played professional basketball, but lose other key state
primaries where Gore would be strong with well-established
Democrats. McCain is not expected to out-duel Bush in the upcoming
southern primaries, especially next month's primary in South
Carolina, where Bush has the funds and the support to do well.
</P>
<P>
   Two other presidential candidates found out in recent years that
winning their New Hampshire primaries no longer means winning the
nomination is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The late Sen. Paul Tsongas won a surprise victory in his New
Hampshire primary race over then-contender Bill Clinton. Tsongas
later had to drop out of the race with a lack of funds and enough
primary victories. Clinton, who turned his second-place finish into
the ``comeback kid'' sort of victory, went on to become the nominee
and the president.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, Pat Buchanan won an unexpectedly strong
second place showing in the 1992 New Hampshire primary, only to
lose the GOP nomination to Vice President George Bush. And Buchanan
won the Granite State in 1996, only to lose the nomination to Bob
Dole.
</P>
<P>
   So McCain and Bradley desperately need to win in New Hampshire,
much more so than Bush or Gore, to keep their presidential hopes
alive. But neither Bush nor Gore can afford a substantial losses
there _ for that would give McCain and Bradley the apperance of
winners, and that could generate more support for them in later
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Niether McCain nor Bradley can afford to make any mistakes in
these remaining weeks to the New Hampshire primary. The polls show
that the state's vote is so volatile that even a small gaffe by
either candidate could turn into a major political disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Soon it will be up to New Hampshire voters to decide their
primary winners. But it may be as much up to Bradley and McCain in
the remaining weeks as to how the voters will arrive at their
decision.

FEUD REKINDLED: BRITISH PAPERS SCORN DE GAULLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Separated by language and disposition, and bound by the
Chunnel, the British and French love to hate each other.
</P>
<P>
   So it might have surprised the British, as much as the French,
to learn last week that Winston Churchill's war Cabinet had
rejected Churchill's and Franklin D. Roosevelt's plan to dump
Charles de Gaulle as the French resistance leader in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In papers unsealed on Tuesday, 57 years after Roosevelt and
Churchill huddled in the White House and plotted de Gaulle's
departure, the antipathy that the two leading allies had for de
Gaulle was revealed in a series of telegrams between Washington and
London.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt and Churchill saw de Gaulle as a vainglorious man with
dictatorial tendencies, who was likely to cozy up to the Russians
after the Nazis were defeated. Roosevelt suggested that de Gaulle
might do a postwar deal with Germany to marginalize ``the
Anglo-Saxons.''
</P>
<P>
   After learning that Roosevelt hated de Gaulle as much as he did,
Churchill sent his Cabinet a telegram asking ``my colleagues now to
consider urgently whether we should not eliminate de Gaulle as a
political force.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He hates England and has left a trail of Anglophobia behind
him everywhere,'' Churchill wrote of de Gaulle, who at the time was
in London, where he spent much of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill questioned de Gaulle's courage, writing, ``He has
never himself fought since he left France, and took pains to have
his wife brought out safely beforehand.''
</P>
<P>
   While the antipathy between Churchill and de Gaulle is well
documented, the extent to which Roosevelt distrusted the French
leader has surprised some historians. Jean Lacouture, one of de
Gaulle's biographers, said Roosevelt's ``thinking was that of a
Midwestern farmer.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacouture is among the French academics and leaders who have
praised Churchill's Cabinet, and other British diplomats, for
sticking up for de Gaulle and the French. The documents, released
by the Public Record Office in London, indicate that the British
war Cabinet did not challenge Churchill's assessment of de Gaulle
as a person as much as it disputed Roosevelt's assertions that de
Gaulle was not as popular with French people as wartime propaganda
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill considered Roosevelt his trump card. He sent his
Cabinet a memorandum from Roosevelt that accused de Gaulle, among
other things, of whipping up animosities between Jews and Arabs in
Algiers. ``De Gaulle may be an honest fellow but he has the
Messianic complex,'' Roosevelt wrote. ``Further, he has the idea
that the people of France are strongly behind him personally. This
I doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   But Churchill's Cabinet, led by the deputy prime minister,
Clement Attlee, and the foreign secretary, Anthony Eden, concluded
that sidelining de Gaulle would hurt the Western allies more than
help them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are convinced the Americans are wrong in this,'' Attlee and
Eden wrote. ``The removal of de Gaulle would probably have a
disastrous reaction on the whole resistance movement. The resisters
would consider that the Anglo-Saxons had betrayed their leader and
a further swing toward Russia would be inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   As for popular support of de Gaulle, they wrote: ``The de Gaulle
whom they follow is, of course, an idealized semi-mystic figure far
different from the man we know. But nothing that Allied propaganda
could do would convince the French that their idol has feet of
clay.''
</P>
<P>
   Churchill reluctantly accepted his Cabinet's advice, but
remained wary of spoiling relations with the United States ``for
the sake of a Frenchman who is a bitter foe of Britain and may well
bring civil war upon France.''
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the sensitivity of the disclosures, such records
are usually made public after 30 years. Even now, some British
diplomats say it was unwise to release them, given the current
state of British-French relations.
</P>
<P>
   Although the British and French are leading the effort to create
a single European military policy, including a 60,000-member rapid
reaction force, Paris and London are at loggerheads over France's
refusal to accept British beef. Despite the European Union's
lifting of a three-year ban on British beef because of ``mad cow''
disease, France says its scientists have concluded that it is not
yet safe.
</P>
<P>
   While the wartime disclosures could improve British-French
relations, they may fuel anti-Americanism in France. The French
foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, has accused the Americans of
being a ``hyperpower,'' so dominant economically, militarily and
culturally that they dictate to even their allies.
</P>
<P>
   That Roosevelt harbored such doubts about de Gaulle and the
wisdom of the French people feeds a perception that most Americans
don't have a clue about the French.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, de Gaulle led a French revival that was based in
large part on distancing France from the United States and Britain.
In the 1960s, he vetoed Britain's entry into the Common Market,
frustrating the British prime minister, Harold Macmillan, who a
quarter-century before was one of the few Cabinet members who
supported Churchill's efforts to push aside de Gaulle.

PUTIN RIDES POPULARITY OF A WAR RUSSIANS WANT TO WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The war that Russia cannot win has turned into a battle
that Vladimir V. Putin cannot lose.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's campaign against separatists in Chechnya may not bring
peace to the Caucasus soon, but the military juggernaut that
propelled Putin, the acting president, into the Kremlin seems
almost certain to guarantee him an easy victory in the election
March 26 for a full term.
</P>
<P>
   Even as fierce resistance by Chechen rebels has blunted a
Russian drive to capture Chechnya's capital of Grozny, the
overwhelming popularity of the war in Russia, and the Kremlin's
media campaign to keep it that way, have created the impression
that nothing that happens there can spoil the coronation of Putin
as Russia's president.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts foresee a protracted conflict in Chechnya that
will evolve into a lengthy, costly guerrilla war. That could sap
Putin's popularity over the long run, but it will not prevent his
election in two months.
</P>
<P>
   Putin created an aura of inevitability by portraying the
offensive as a series of well-planned, well-executed successes _
and making sure that this is what the television networks show.
Events that contradict this view _ such as the insurgents'
counterattack Wednesday on sections of Grozny that the Russians
claimed to control _ do not make the news.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that the rebels can still counterattack at all
raises questions about the sanguine reports on state television.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not leading anywhere; it makes no sense as a military
campaign,'' said Pavel Felgenhauer, a military analyst in Moscow.
``The rebel resistance is getting stronger as the Russian military
gets weaker. But with the propaganda machine working the way it is,
anything can be declared a victory. This is all about putting Putin
in the Kremlin.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian and Western analysts once questioned how long the
Russian public would put up with an unwinnable war in the Caucasus.
But now observers agree that nothing short of a military disaster
can derail Putin's drive to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McFaul, a Stanford University professor, said many
analysts had originally believed that support for the war would be
undermined as Russian casualties mounted. But this argument, he
said, was based on a faulty analogy with the 1994-1996 war in
Chechnya, which Russia was forced to abandon.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Russian citizens did not understand why their military
invaded Chechnya, McFaul said. Now, he said, everyone _ rightly or
wrongly _ subscribes to the notion that the current offensive is a
counterterrorist campaign against ``bandits'' who attacked Russian
territory and bombed innocents in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more body bags come home, the greater will be the resolve
to defeat these `terrorists,' '' McFaul said.
</P>
<P>
   What made the turnaround in opinion possible is the most glaring
weakness of Russia's campaign: its lack of any clear sense of what
defines ``success.'' Launched in October as a security operation
following a wave of rebel attacks on neighboring regions and a
series of deadly apartment bombings that may or may not have
involved Chechens, the offensive quickly turned into a battle for
territory. And as the advance ground on, politicians redefined it
as a struggle for Russia's national identity as a great power.
</P>
<P>
   With the military strictly controlling access to the combat
zone, it is difficult for independent observers to tell how the
battle is going. Even if the rebels score successes, no one in
Russia has to know about it.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, success in Chechnya is anything that looks like a
resolute response, said Sergei Markov, director of the Institute of
Political Research in Moscow. ``This is seen as a just war. People
have the feeling that if Russia loses control over that region, it
will cease to exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Support for the war, and Putin, will not decrease no matter
what happens,'' he said. ``Opinion is in favor of winning, of
putting the Chechens on a reservation, of solving this like America
solved its problems with Indians in the 19th century.''
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, Russian generals said they would employ tactics
similar to those NATO used against Serb forces in Kosovo, with
high-precision attacks and low casualties. But now much of Chechnya
is in ruins and official Russian losses are 465 dead and 1,583
wounded since fighting began last fall. In the past 10 days, 70
Russian servicemen have been killed and 155 wounded as Chechen
resistance has stiffened.
</P>
<P>
   But unless the Chechens pull off a series of major attacks that
force Putin to resign or cancel elections, most analysts said,
Putin's presidential bid is unlikely to be derailed.
</P>
<P>
   That would only happen in the event of a defeat ``serious enough
to break through the seemingly solid military control over
information flow from the fronts,'' said Arthur Martirosyan of the
Conflict Management Group in Cambridge, Mass. ``Putin can easily
turn almost any occasional defeat in Chechnya into a victory on the
image-making front by playing a tough guy.''
</P>
<P>
   For the military, the only problem seems to be its inability to
take Grozny, which would allow it to declare an end to the war.
Russian troops are pinned down by sniper fire and unable to expel
the rebels from bunkers in the ruined city. Russian generals were
forced to cancel plans to celebrate the New Year in central Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop Boris N. Yeltsin, who stepped down as president
on New Year's Eve to make way for Putin, from predicting on
Thursday that victory for Russia was near.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two more months and then we will plant our Russian flag in
Chechnya,'' Yeltsin said in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   But if Yeltsin has not learned the perils of setting a public
timetable, the generals have.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible when we set a date,'' General Victor Kazantsev,
the Russian top commander in Chechnya, said last week. ``We've
already made a lot of mistakes, saying it would be a New Year's
gift or a birthday present for some high official. The most
important thing is to save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there any chance the rebels could pull off something like the
August 1996 offensive that drove the Russians out of Grozny _ a
victory stunning enough to shake Putin's air of invincibility?
</P>
<P>
   While officers lambasted politicians for stopping the 1996 war,
the larger reason for the defeat was that the rebels were able to
surprise the numerically superior and better-armed Russians. And a
drive last week through Chechnya indicated that their forces are
poorly prepared for attacks from the rear.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas, there were no troops for miles. Soldiers at
checkpoints said they are under constant fire, especially at night,
but get little support. Except at forward positions on the
outskirts of Grozny, the troops' vigilance is often not high.
Moreover, said Felgenhauer, the analyst, many officers were
recently rotated out of Chechnya, leaving less experienced leaders
in their place.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say this is the perfect scenario for the rebels
to attack, if they still have that capacity.
</P>
<P>
   But that might not shake Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even a disaster can be turned into a propaganda victory,''
Felgenhauer said. ``It's because the majority of Russian citizens
want . . . to be told about victories, because they want
victories.''

FUROR WELCOMES GAYS' NEWBORNS HOME TO BRITAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It is a drama of Shakespearean proportions.
</P>
<P>
   A gay couple from Britain, turned down in their attempts to
adopt and legally barred from hiring a surrogate mother here, fly
to Los Angeles, get an egg from one woman, have it fertilized with
their sperm, implant it in another woman, and become the proud
fathers of twins.
</P>
<P>
   But when the couple and the twins returned to Britain last week,
they flew into a maelstrom of moral, ethical, legal, and
jurisdictional questions raised by surrogacy and their sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   A California court says that Barrie Drewitt and Tony Barlow,
millionaire businessmen from Danbury, England, are the legal
parents of Saffron and Aspen, a boy and girl born in California
Dec. 9. But under English law, the parents are the American
surrogate mother who gave birth to the twins and her husband, whose
only connection to the arrangement is that he happens to be married
to her.
</P>
<P>
   When Drewitt, 30, and Barlow, 35, showed up at Heathrow Airport
last week with the twins, immigration officials reluctantly allowed
them in, but said the infants would have to leave the country
within a month because they are not British citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Drewitt and Barlow are outraged, calling the action the latest
example of homophobic discrimination in a country that has stymied
their attempts to become parents. They say they want to stay in
Britain but vow to move to the United States, where they have a
home in Beverly Hills, if the government refuses to recognize them
as parents and their children as British.
</P>
<P>
   British officials are more measured, saying this is an
unprecedented case that they have to consider carefully, given the
legal ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   Some worry that a decision to give the infants British
citizenship will open the floodgates for surrogate births, which
are more tightly regulated in Britain than in the United States.
And those who oppose surrogacy contend the ethical issues are being
glossed over.
</P>
<P>
   Anglican Bishop Tom Butler of the Southwark diocese in London
accused Drewitt and Barlow of creating ``designer children,'' part
of a trend in which, he said, selfish adults are experimenting with
a whole generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are producing a generation of children mixed up and
insecure, not because they are wanting for nothing in a material
sense, but because they are totally confused about their
identity,'' Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, government officials seem miffed at the way Drewitt
and Barlow flouted Britain's immigration laws. They say that rather
than showing up unannounced at Heathrow with the infants, the
couple could have arranged a smooth entry by obtaining visas from
the British embassy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But that would not have settled the long-term questions of
nationality and citizenship status. Officials, meanwhile, are
chastened by the fact that at the center of this imbroglio are a
pair of adorable babies.
</P>
<P>
   While the twins face deportation, officials here privately say
there will probably be an extension granted while both sides try to
find a way out of the dispute. Prime Minister Tony Blair's
image-conscious government is loath to see itself portrayed around
the world as heartless or homophobic.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the law is the law, and there appears little room for a
compromise. Neither is there a ground swell to make surrogacy
legally available to anyone but married heterosexual couples.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hillman, a spokesman for the Home Office, said the twins
would become British citizens if Drewitt and Barlow adopt them. But
Drewitt and Barlow say that could take months or even years, and
insist that adoption is an unnecessary burden foisted upon them by
homophobic bureaucrats five years after other homophobic
bureaucrats deemed them unfit to adopt.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Essex County declined to say why the couple were
turned down as adoptive parents, citing privacy laws.
</P>
<P>
   If this drama is Shakespearean in its sweep, there are some who,
like one of Shakespeare's more cynical characters, think the law is
an ass. Among them is Rosalind Bellamy, the surrogate mother who
gave birth to the twins.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at her home in Turlock, Calif., Bellamy said it is
preposterous to suggest that her husband, Chris, is the legal
father of the twins. And because the children grew from an egg that
was not hers, Bellamy insists, ``I am not the biological mother,
but either Tony or Barrie is definitely the biological father.''
</P>
<P>
   Barlow and Drewitt, who both contributed sperm, say DNA tests
showed whose sperm fertilized the egg, but they will not reveal
that to the children, or anyone else, until the twins are old
enough to understand.
</P>
<P>
   Will Halm, CEO of Growing Generations, the Los Angeles agency
that caters exclusively to gay clients seeking surrogates, said in
a telephone interview that his firm has assisted ``a handful'' of
gay couples from European countries. But he said Barlow and Drewitt
were the only British couple the firm had helped, and that they are
the only clients who have encountered problems trying to bring
their children home.
</P>
<P>
   Gillian Dunne, a senior research fellow at the London School of
Economics Gender Institute, said the British government needs to
update its laws to reflect societal changes. She said the ban
against homosexuals having children by surrogate has led to an
informal network in Britain where lesbians and gay men collaborate
to create families. She said lesbians have been doing it for a
generation, and that increasing numbers of gay men are fathering
children to raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it the gayby boom,'' Dunne said.
</P>
<P>
   Dunne has spent the last few years studying a group of 94 gay
fathers, about 70 percent of them from Britain. She said 10 of them
had had children in an informal surrogacy arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're standing on the precipice of great change,'' Dunne said.
``This case is different because the men involved are rich, and
there's a lot of publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Dearle, a family law specialist and partner at Withers,
Britain's leading family law firm, also believes the law needs to
be changed, and not only to reflect the growing number of
nontraditional families. Dearle says informal surrogacy
arrangements leave people vulnerable because sperm is rarely
screened for disease and those involved are ignorant of the
ramifications of Britain's 1990 law governing surrogacy, especially
the provisions on who is legally responsible for the welfare of the
children.
</P>
<P>
   Dearle said Drewitt and Barlow and the twins have been left open
to all sorts of liabilities. While Drewitt and Barlow say they
obtained from Bellamy a legal document in which she waived any
rights to the children, Dearle said the document is not binding in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surrogacy agreements are not enforceable in England,'' said
Dearle. ``The mother can renege on the agreement any time she
likes.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Bellamy, 32, insisted that would never
happen, if only because, as she put it, ``I have four sons now and
I can't afford any more kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Drewitt and Barlow became millionaires when they sold their
medical and cosmetic testing business to an American company for $7
million. They say they have lived together as a couple for 11
years, but under English law, if they break up and there is a
dispute over who is financially responsible for the twins, it is
not they but Chris Bellamy, a floor contractor who lives 5,439
miles away, who would be liable.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this sounds fine if all the relationships involved are
healthy, but what happens if one or all of them break down?'' says
Dearle.
</P>
<P>
   Dearle said that, had he been their lawyer, he would have
advised Drewitt and Barlow to avoid publicity. But Bellamy said the
couple was forced to go public after a disgruntled former employee
of theirs went to a British tabloid to sell the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured if the story was going to come out, we should bring
it out,'' said Bellamy.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who say they have spent about $350,000 in their
five-year quest to arrange a birth, would not be interviewed
because they have negotiated contracts to give exclusive interviews
to a British newspaper and a television company. The sums involved
were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   They have said they agonized through four failed pregnancies
with another surrogate before turning to Bellamy, who had
previously given birth to twins as a surrogate for a heterosexual
couple.
</P>
<P>
   Drewitt told the Mail on Sunday newspaper that he and Barlow
have asked Bellamy and Tracie Matthews, the California woman who
provided the eggs, to be godmothers to the children, and that the
women would always be part of the twins' lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to ensure that our children will grow up to know them
so we can explain where they came from,'' Drewitt told the Mail.
``We don't want them thinking they are different. We want them to
know they are loved and have a nice big family.''
</P>
<P>
   Barlow told the Mail that about 20 embryos, created from
Matthews' eggs, are in a freezer awaiting fertilization, and that
Bellamy has agreed to act as a surrogate for them again next
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about it,'' Bellamy said. ``I'd be willing to be
a surrogate for them again, or for any other gay couple that needed
me.''

SINGLE INCIDENT POWERS STORIES OF ALICE ELLIOTT DARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
IN THE GLOAMING 
Stories 
By Alice Elliott Dark. Simon &AMP; Schuster. 288 pp. $23. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In our current climate of literary excess, where far too much
psychic revelation posing as prose finds its way into print, the
short story has a tough race to run. By nature a sprinter in a
world of marathoners, it must contend for space among bigger,
grander themes; often and erroneously, the short-story writer will
try to be memorable by being garish, instead of merely good. But
the only trait that will stand up to the heft and span of the novel
is emotional resonance _ the staying power of a small and lasting
truth that may change the slant of light in the room, or the view
of the person observing its arc. Chekhov taught us that much, and
you can find these lessons in the perfect moments from stories that
linger in the mind _ Cheever's women walking out of the sea, or
Carver's merciful baker, or O'Connor's Misfit and his providential
cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   First published in The New Yorker in 1994, the title story of
Alice Elliott Dark's second story collection achieved swift
recognition for its use of these qualities: its hues of melancholy,
its deceptively simple delivery of a mother living through the
death of her son from AIDS. ``In the Gloaming'' was included in
last year's ``Best American Short Stories of the Century'' and also
spawned two film adaptations, though no visual interpretation of
the story could do justice to its interior silences. The triumph of
``In the Gloaming'' lies partly in its embrace of imminent death;
the mother, faced with one of the great losses of life, rushes
headlong toward it by defending herself with love. There is nothing
showy in sight: no last-minute epiphany, no stranger at the door to
lessen the dread. There is instead one sterling moment when a woman
holds her son before a fire's dying embers.
</P>
<P>
   Only one other story in this collection approaches such force,
and it too concerns the somber grasp of leaving; in this case, a
woman with early signs of Alzheimer's is surrendering to her
family's efforts to remove her from her home. In the midst of a
not-uncommon sorrow, the ornaments and circumstances of a life
emerge: the vacation homes and bitter, implicit family contracts; a
cheerful daughter's chatter and the emotional legacies that surface
under duress. This ability to suggest an entire character or
history through one dramatic incident is Dark's strength as a
writer; what too often clutters those insights is her tendency to
embellish a story with contrivances or unnecessarily obvious
ironies. In ``The Secret Spot,'' a woman's suspicions about someone
she believes to be a threat to her marriage wind up hurting only
her; in ``The Tower,'' a man's pursuit of a younger woman turns out
to have darker implications about love and romance than he ever
imagined. These stories contain shockers of varying degrees, from a
grandmother's meddlesome indifference (``Triage'') to a
stepfather's iniquitous behavior (``The Jungle Lodge''), and the
unfortunate cumulative result is that the reader longs for a story
where nothing much happens.
</P>
<P>
   That's the case in ``Close,'' wherein a man in his 30s,
expecting his first child, contemplates chucking it all for a woman
whose meadow seems, of course, far greener. The lack of action in
this story mirrors its central themes: Paralyzed by fear,
discontent, and conflicting desires, the protagonist has to sleep
with his own ambiguity _ in a way, his inertia becomes a kind of
blessing, or at least a road map. The eventual success of
``Dreadful Language'' stems from a similar quietude, in spite of a
couple of instant deaths and other heavy-handed devices meant to
evoke the meaning of the title. Faced with the untimely loss of her
father, then her fiance, a woman has to face a life that is,
finally, not much better or worse than a million others. Her
acknowledgment of this muted sadness _ a slow accretion of memory,
truth, and day-to-day progress _ is the least eventful moment in
the story, and, perhaps consequently, the most important.
</P>
<P>
   One gets the sense that Dark intuits this glacial shift of human
emotion even when she's getting in her own way. Many of the stories
are based in the Pennsylvania exurb of Wynnemoor, a blander version
of its sister communities in New Jersey and Connecticut where the
quality of life is judged by its stillness. But when these people
leave their insular confines, heading for the beauty of Italy or
the adventure of the Amazon, the world gets unruly, even
terrifying. The girl in ``The Jungle Lodge'' finds the predatory
nature of the rain forest ``ugly and cruel''; that scenery will
serve as a fitting backdrop to her own personal revelations before
she makes for home. When the divorced mother in ``Maniacs'' has to
relinquish her children for a two-week visit to their father, her
grievous discomfort at the airport becomes a clue to her own
passions _ like the mother of ``In the Gloaming,'' she discovers
that her maternal instincts are bigger than any old dreams she may
have cultivated.
</P>
<P>
   These are the hard-won wisdoms of a life, if one is lucky, and
they deserve to be displayed here unadorned. But Dark suffers from
certain tics common to inexperienced or insecure fiction writers.
She relies on cliches (reinventing one's life, getting closure) and
browbeating references when subtlety would do far better; her
dialogue can be as forced as a daytime soap's. Put up against the
inherent depth of these stories, such failures, whether of
technique or nerve, seem particularly incongruous. It's almost as
though, having invented her characters _ having made them blessedly
human and blessedly flawed _ Dark wants them to change far more and
faster than they are able. Mother of her own invention, she ought
not to be so impatient. They, of course, know better: know that the
moment, or story, or circumstance, is really all you possess at the
end of a day, and that it can take everything in your power to get
it right.

ONCE WAS ENOUGH FOR `THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR'

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' (DVD) _ The appeal of
the original, with Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway, was that Thomas
Crown never got directly involved in his capers. He was strictly
moving the chess pieces. While Pierce Brosnan is suave, he lacks
McQueen's underlying sense of danger. And local fans will want to
know the remake wasn't shot in Boston, as the elder version was.
Not bad, but the original was better. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Sayonara'' _ Marlon Brando stars in the long-awaited video
release of director Joshua Logan's 1975 adaptation of the James
Michener novel. The Japanese settings are beautiful, but the story
lacks dramatic punch. Red Buttons won an Oscar for best supporting
actor. Go figure. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
----- &QC;

</P>
<P>
   NEW FOR KIDS: ``Babar: King of the Elephants'' _ The perennial
favorite is back with a feature-length animated version of the
original ``Babar'' story. When his mother dies, the young elephant
hero is sent to live in the city. Before long he realizes he's a
jungle guy. Solid animation. Good music. For kids, it'll be new;
for adults, it's a diverting bit of nostalgia.

SHOWTIME DEFTLY MOVES `SALESMAN' FROM STAGE TO SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As we usher in 2000, one of the sobering realities in the arts
world is that there is not one serious new play that has opened on
Broadway (though David Hirson's ``Wrong Mountain'' is about to).
There are many reasons, most of them economic, for a state of
affairs that could leave the Tony Awards devoid of a serious
new-play candidate this season.
</P>
<P>
   It is of some significance, then, that Showtime is presenting
the play that perhaps symbolizes Broadway at its highest level of
accomplishment, Arthur Miller's 1949 ``Death of a Salesman,'' in
the production that won last year's Tony for best revival, with
Brian Dennehy. Though ``Salesman'' made it onto most lists as one
of the most important plays of the century, neither Miller's nor
the play's reputation is secured.
</P>
<P>
   Is Miller's success in getting plays mounted on Broadway from
the '40s through the '60s reflective of superior abilities as
compared with today's playwrights? Some would say that his
popularity simply bespeaks a middlebrow outlook on the part of the
playwright and the audience, and I doubt that the naysayers will be
deterred by this Goodman Theatre production.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller's dissection of the crushing claustrophobia of living
within the confines of ``the system'' is a quantum leap from
predecessors such as Clifford Odets. And in Willy Loman, Miller
created a Lear for our times _ not a king but an ordinary man
brought down by a willingness to believe the myth-makers. Work
hard, be well liked, and the American dream is there for the
taking.
</P>
<P>
   And television director Kirk Browning does such a masterful job
of focusing on the virtues of the production that the telecast is a
must for theatergoers, as it breathes some hope into the future of
presenting theater on the small screen.
</P>
<P>
   The Goodman production, directed for the stage by Robert Falls,
is excellent at capturing the sense of Willy's world imploding, of
how selling himself a bill of goods about living the worthwhile
life has wrought havoc on himself and his family. Brian Dennehy and
Elizabeth Franz, who both won Tonys, are on the verge of breakdown,
trying to put the best light on things one moment and collapsing
into near-hysteria the next.
</P>
<P>
   Browning, with nine cameras at his command, zeros in on each of
Miller's characters with a fluidity that wasn't within range for
most of his earlier PBS work. Much of the play takes place in
Willy's mind, and Browning moves from the unbearable present to the
mythic past with even more gracefulness than the stage version. If
not for the occasional laughter, you would hardly believe this
production was videotaped in front of a live audience. The
conventional wisdom says you have to do away with the audience and
reinvent a play for television, as filmmaker Volker Schlondorff did
for the Dustin Hoffman ``Salesman'' on CBS in 1985. Browning shows
that given the right resources, television can do as creditable a
job at capturing the theater experience as it can the football or
basketball experience.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I liked watching the TV version more than seeing this
``Salesman'' onstage last year. Dennehy's fidgetiness was less
bothersome one step removed, allowing the full force of Willy's
tragedy to emerge. His size works for him on television, whereas
onstage it seemed to work against him. Franz's performance as Linda
Loman, live or Memorex, is a shattering experience.
</P>
<P>
   The one drawback I still find with Dennehy's performance is that
it's so full of individual tics it doesn't invest Loman with the
universality he should have. Hoffman was even more mannered, but
his delivery captured the poetry in Miller's playwriting.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the cast is on target; there isn't a weak link among
them. As with all plays on television, it takes more concentration
to adjust to a different kind of acting and, in this case, a
relatively bare set design. Give ``Salesman'' a half-hour, though,
and chances are you'll be riveted and moved in ways that televised
drama rarely attempts.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't completely to the good. Miller's earnestness,
particularly in this production, can be as irksome as Stephen
Bochco's glibness. On balance, though, the Goodman production and
Browning's direction show why ``Death of a Salesman'' is such a
larger-than-life representation of our downsized times.

CD OF STANDARDS SHOWS MICHAEL'S ELEGANT SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a long, winding road it's been for George Michael, the
former scream-inducing teen idol who has just released a quiet,
superbly elegant album of standards. The new-millennium Michael has
left his many career crises behind _ ranging from his lawsuit to
leave Sony Records in the early '90s to his embarrassing arrest for
``lewd conduct'' in a public bathroom in Los Angeles two years ago
_ and is now staking his claim as one of the great song
interpreters of his day.
</P>
<P>
   It's a valid claim, based on his new album, ``Songs From the
Last Century.'' Michael is still only 36 years old, but has sold 67
million records and should sell many more with this velvety,
orchestra-backed CD. It is smoothly produced by Phil Ramone, who
has done similar honors for Billy Joel and Frank Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   There are no original songs _ observers have speculated that
Michael is still going through a cooling-down period after his
arrest and didn't want to fan any controversy with his own
compositions _ but his way with standards seems timeless and not in
the least contrived. He is the latest in a long line of pop figures
to make an album of standards _ joining Bryan Ferry, Sinead
O'Connor, Carly Simon, and Linda Ronstadt _ but none has done it
better than Michael.
</P>
<P>
   Michael's talent was never in question, except perhaps in his
early _ and silly _ mid-'80s era with Wham!, which did the unctuous
``Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go.''
</P>
<P>
   But, starting with his first solo album, ``Faith'' in 1987
(``Faith'' yielded six No. 1 hits and the title track was even
remade by Limp Bizkit last year), Michael has continued to
distinguish himself as a career artist.
</P>
<P>
   So it was no surprise last year when his album, ``Ladies and
Gentlemen: The Best of George Michael,'' shot to No. 1 and sold 2
million copies. That's been followed by the new album, which takes
a chic journey through such classics as the smoky ballad ``You've
Changed'' (originally sung by Billie Holiday) and the
Sinatra-identified ``Wild Is the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael, to his credit, has a broad definition of standards.
Where some artists pluck such songs only from the '40s and '50s,
Michael goes all the way back to the '30s for the acoustic swing of
``My Baby Just Cares for Me'' and the Depression-Era ``Brother, Can
You Spare a Dime?'' But he also steers to more modern times as
well.
</P>
<P>
   He visits the '60s for ``The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face''
(which Roberta Flack recorded in the '60s and which went to no. 1
in 1972), and sings it beautifully, with precise phrasing, then the
late '70s with the Police's ``Roxanne'' (with simmering horns and
vocal scats that rearrange the song nicely), and even the '90s with
U2's ``Miss Sarajevo'' (from the ``Passenger'' soundtrack). It may
not yet be a standard, but sounds like one, with wistful, lightly
strummed acoustic guitar and a faraway-sounding organ. It's also
the album's first single.
</P>
<P>
   Michael, who has not done any interviews to explain his latest
musical project, sounds completely comfortable with the songs. He
exhibits a command, and creativity, that is utterly adult, yet
still fresh.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a subtle sense of humor. In ``My Baby Just Cares
for Me,'' the old line that ``Liz Taylor is not his style and even
Lana Turner's smile is somethin' he can't see'' has been changed to
``even Ricky Martin's smile is somethin' he can't see . . . My baby
only cares for me.'' Not many ex-teen idols have anywhere near this
kind of confidence today.

`ANGELA'S ASHES' TAKES FRANK MCCOURT BACK TO HIS YOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Frank McCourt saw the scowl, he was happy. ``I
was scowling all the time,'' he says, speaking in a soft voice. The
scowl he's talking about is on the face of the poster boy for the
film version of ``Angela's Ashes,'' McCourt's memoir of growing up
in a Limerick slum and refusing to be crushed by it. Published in
1996, ``Angela's Ashes'' took off and hasn't come down from the
stratosphere yet: Millions of copies have been sold, in dozens of
languages.
</P>
<P>
   And now McCourt looks at the fierce expression of Joe Breen, the
9-year-old Irish boy playing him in the film (which opens Jan. 21).
He says it takes him back.
</P>
<P>
   What McCourt doesn't say _ and doesn't need to, for anyone who's
read the book _ is that he had a lot to scowl about. Born in
Brooklyn in 1930, he was taken back to Ireland by his parents when
he was 4. Their vision of a softer life crumbled into disaster.
McCourt's mother (played by Emily Watson in the film) struggled to
keep the family fed. McCourt's father (played by Robert Carlyle)
drank his wages when he worked, and didn't often work. When he left
in 1941, for a wartime job in England, that was the last they saw
of him. Frank, the oldest of four surviving children, faced jeering
classmates who mocked the rubber patches glued over the holes in
his soles and got into a lot of fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was eerie,'' McCourt says of two visits to the set in
Dublin, and his first look at the replicated row house where his
family lived with no indoor plumbing, a ground floor covered in
water and sewage half the year, and a slightly less cold and clammy
second floor _ they called it Italy, and shared infested mattresses
_ with a jauntiness that didn't quite blot out the poverty and the
shame they felt at being poor. ``The one scene in the film with the
washing hanging across the lane _ that was good. It was pretty
grim. Rainy and wet. I think they should get an Oscar for that set.
It cost, I think, two million pounds to build it and then they took
the bulldozers to it. It took two weeks to build and two days to
destroy it.''
</P>
<P>
   The reality, McCourt says, was worse. Or, as he began the book
by writing, in words that seem likely to live a long time: ``Worse
than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish
childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic
childhood.'' McCourt didn't spend much time on the set, he says:
Director-adapter ``Alan Parker was very welcoming, very hospitable,
but I didn't. . . . Well, if you were sitting writing, you don't
want anybody looking over your shoulder. I thought I'd be
intrusive. They were working. What use was I? If I were an actor
playing the part of a certain person, I wouldn't want that person
looking at me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then I haven't known what to make of it from the start,''
McCourt says of the ``Angela's Ashes'' phenomenon. ``First, I
didn't know the book was going to be published. I didn't know it
was going to be on the best-seller list. I was happy just knowing
it would have a Library of Congress number. When there was talk
about a movie, I said: `Are you joking? It's all misery and woe and
despair, leavened with a little humor.' Then I saw the movie and I
was jolted. I had been warned repeatedly by everyone that movie
people destroy books. But I saw it and I couldn't think of any way
of improving it. I knew I was in good hands with Alan. He comes
from a blue-collar background. I come from a no-collar background.
People ask me, `How could you remember?' How could you not
remember? I could have written 10 times as much.''
</P>
<P>
   At 69, after spending most of his adult life teaching and
reflecting upon writing and literature, McCourt has arrived at a
certain detachment and perspective. Activity swirls around him in
the hotel where the film is being publicized. He, however, is calm,
patient, unhurried, a professional, soldiering gracefully through
whatever has to be done. Not for nothing has he lived in New York
for 50 years (he lives there still, though he and his third wife,
Ellen Frey, bought a country house with some of the money the book
has earned). For many years he was an angry man, McCourt says. He
began ``Angela's Ashes'' after years of filling notebooks, and
years of searching for the right voice, which in the end was handed
to him by his granddaughter in her 6-year-old unadorned directness.
</P>
<P>
   There were other reasons for the long gestation period, McCourt
says, not least of them the demands of teaching in public schools
for 27 years. ``I was teaching. I was standing in front of five
classes a day and that stopped me. If I'd spent all those years in
a room writing, I might have succeeded. But then I wouldn't have
written it while my mother was alive. I couldn't. She wasn't too
pleased with any talk of the past, of slum life in Limerick. Her
generation _ you'd be ashamed of it. There was something wrong with
you if you came out of the slums. It was nobody's fault, but there
was something wrong with you.'' And perhaps there were too many
memories of humiliations endured.
</P>
<P>
   Angela McCourt came to visit Frank in America in 1959. She never
left. When she saw her sons, Frank and Malachy, relive their
childhood in an off-Broadway stage presentation decades later, she
cried, ``It's all a pack of lies.'' McCourt wishes he could have
reconciled with his father. He never did. ``There was never any
contact, execpt an occasional letter in which he exhorted us to be
good boys, perform our religious duties, and obey our mother. Crazy
stuff. But no money.'' In 1963, the elder McCourt attempted a
reconciliation. It failed. He went back to his native Belfast and
died there, aged 85. Angela McCourt died in 1981, aged 73. And yes,
there were indeed ashes.
</P>
<P>
   After their mother was cremated, her four sons _ Frank, Malachy,
Michael, and Alphie _ took the ashes back to her native Limerick
and scattered them. That part of the McCourt story isn't in
``Angela's Ashes.'' McCourt wrote so much that he ended the book at
the point when he was 19, headed back to America in 1949. The ashes
are scattered in McCourt's second memoir, `` 'Tis.'' ``I didn't
think I'd be writing a second book,'' he says, ``and that's where
the ashes are scattered, in ` 'Tis.' I was going to bring the first
book all the way up to the time when the ashes were scattered, but
I didn't get that far.'' This, he is the first to admit, has
created misunderstandings, maybe even the beginnings of a
mythology.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was asked about it, I explained that the title means
the ashes she stared into at the fire, the ashes from the Woodbine
cigarettes that killed her, the ashes of her dreams, and the ashes
from which she arose, phoenix-like. Keep them busy, you know.
That's the thing I dread, that kids are going to have to study this
and look for deeper meanings and take multiple-choice tests. And
they'll hate me the way they hate all books they have Cliff Notes
for and study guides. I'm sure for `Angela's Ashes,' kids at school
will be told, `You will notice there are many sentence fragments
and incomplete sentences. Rewrite the passages and complete the
sentences. You will notice the book lacks quotation marks. Please
supply the quotation marks.' It'll turn into an exercise in
remedial English.''
</P>
<P>
   What McCourt's newfound fame will turn into he isn't sure, but
he confidently and mischievously envisions something amusingly
absurd. ``Oh, God, I've been jolted into, I suppose, celebrity
status. People listen to me now. My opinion is sought. They ask me
to write for various magazines. Gourmet. Me? Did you read `Angela's
Ashes'? Architectural Digest, Esquire, GQ. I'm consulted on
anything Irish. I'm the expert on Irish and education. And poverty.
And hunger. Irish-American Magazine picked out the foremost micks
of the millennium. Of course, the top one is John F. Kennedy, but
I'm in there. I was a teacher for years, and now they can't get
enough of me. And later on they'll say, `Who?' It's the express
version of notoriety.''

EMPIRE EXPRESS 
Building the First Transcontinental Railroad 
By David Haward Bain 
Viking; Illustrated; 797 pp.; $34.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Recent news reports about a proposed merger of the Burlington
Northern Santa Fe Corp. and Canadian National Railway Co. said it
would fulfill the century-old vision of a single transcontinental
railroad.
</P>
<P>
   Not that you can't travel from the Atlantic to the Pacific by
rail today and have been able to do so _ even with a change or two
along the way _ ever since the linking of the eastbound Central
Pacific and westbound Union Pacific rail lines in 1869. But what
the proposed merger _ a $5 billion Halifax-to-Los Angeles deal _
would do is put it all in the hands of one corporate tycoon.
</P>
<P>
   And that is a dream that must have engaged, even fleetingly, the
continental-sized egos of some of the visionaries, schemers, and
promoters that populate the epic story of David Haward Bain's
``Empire Express.''
</P>
<P>
   The story itself is very neatly framed between accounts of the
visionary Asa Whitney and the revolting Credit Mobilier scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney, a failed New York merchant, was inspired by the notion
of a transcontinental rail line and he tirelessly promoted it until
the dream was taken over by harder-headed schemers.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal, when it broke three years after the two rail lines
were linked, exposed the officials of both railroad companies as
well as a vice president of the United States (Henry Wilson of
Massachusetts) and a parlor-carful of leading politicians
(including five Bay State congressmen) as swindlers and crooks.
</P>
<P>
   This is a big book (at 797 pages), but it is a big story,
authoritatively told, and there is scarcely a detail that a reader
would happily forgo.
</P>
<P>
   Take just one that lingers in a reader's mind.
</P>
<P>
   It is July 1867 and a surveying party headed by Grenville M.
Dodge, a Civil War general born in Danvers who had become Union
Pacific's chief engineer, is investigating what Bain calls ``the
thorniest engineering problem on the whole line to date'' _ the
crossing of Dale Creek some 100 miles north of Laramie, Wyo., which
would require construction of a trestle bridge 1,400 feet long and
125 feet high.
</P>
<P>
   But Dodge pauses to pick some flowers and writes to his wife:
``No matter how sterile or ragged this country, it is dotted all
over with roses, leaves and grasses, with singular stones and
valuable mines.''
</P>
<P>
   By itself, that is an insignificant detail. But it suggests just
how skillfully Bain has humanized a story that sweeps from New York
boardrooms to the US Capitol _ competing there with the Civil War
for politicians' attention _ to mountain passes and Indian
encampments, all in the context of a breathtaking engineering
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   A lesser writer than Bain _ also the author of ``Sitting in
Darkness,'' an account of the American involvement in the
Philippines _ would have juggled these competing stories, following
first one and then another. But the very way they overlapped is
what makes the story so extraordinary, and Bain's response is to
weave them together.
</P>
<P>
   This is done to great effect in Bain's account of the lobbying
for congressional approval of land grants for the railroad
right-of-way. These occurred even as Washington was in a state of
near-siege during the early months of the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Bain recounts a meeting in January 1863 when a group of railroad
lobbyists met at the White House with President Abraham Lincoln _
``the onetime Illinois railroad lawyer,'' Bain reminds us. With the
capital still reeling from Union defeats at Antietam and
Fredericksburg, a ``careworn'' Lincoln listens as ``his visitors
urged him to approve a five-foot distance between rails for the
Pacific railroad.'' And later, just two days before giving his
Gettysburg Address, Lincoln meets with Thomas C. Durant, a
doctor-turned financial manipulator, and selects Council Bluffs,
Iowa, as the starting point for the Union Pacific line,
acknowledging that he, like Durant, owned land in the town.
</P>
<P>
   And Bain does it again when he weaves together accounts of
Indian raids on work crews and boardroom raids on the federal
treasury and incautious investors.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the workers on the railroad _ including Irish and Chinese
and, at one crucial stage, Mormon construction workers _ those most
at risk from Native American raids were the small surveying parties
out miles ahead of the larger construction teams. One such attack
by a Sioux war party claimed the life of a man whom chief engineer
Dodge called ``one of the brightest of our young engineers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Empire Express'' was 14 years in the researching and writing.
In return for this, Bain allows himself the occasional indulgence
of a line like ``the setting was perfect for an ambush'' to make a
transition from an account of Indian raids to an account of
boardroom skulduggery.
</P>
<P>
   The reader is not just willing to pardon such indulgences but to
delight in them as part payment for an account that is thoroughly
masterful.

THE I OF `THE HURRICANE'

   Rubin Carter has been many things to many people in his 63
years: a troubled kid and an angry young man; a middleweight
contender known as Hurricane Carter; a target of a murder
investigation gone off the rails; a man unjustly convicted; a cause
and a forgotten cause. These days he's also the subject of a
Hollywood movie, ``The Hurricane,'' and a new biography,
``Hurricane: The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter,'' which treat
his life and his ordeal in vastly different ways.
</P>
<P>
   As befits a thoughtful man who used his time in prison to
develop rigorous mental discipline, he's able to see these new
versions of his life dispassionately, to see them for what they
are. ``The movie,'' he says, ``is the story of a group of people
getting together and accomplishing something miraculous. The book
is the true story of my life. You can appreciate both for what they
are and what they do. They are opposite sides of the same coin.''

<P>
   On June 17, 1966, two black men murdered three white people _
two men and a woman _ at the Lafayette Grill in Paterson, N.J. A
few months later, the prizefighter Hurricane Carter and a passing
acquaintance of his named John Artis were convicted of the
homicides. In a city nervous about racial tension, two
African-Americans _ hounded by local police, framed by trumped-up
testimony, and railroaded by a corrupt prosecutorial system _ had
been put away. They wouldn't be cleared for nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, public attention would
</P>
<P>
   CARTER, Page N5 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   periodically fall on Carter. Bob Dylan's song ``Hurricane,'' a
benefit concert at Madison Square Garden, and the publication of
Carter's autobiography in the mid-'70s drew attention to the case.
In 1991, ``Lazarus and the Hurricane,'' by Sam Chaiton and Terry
Swinton, detailed Carter's legal and emotional struggles, his
imprisonment and subsequent release. The latter forms the spine of
``The Hurricane'' _ the story of how Lazarus ``Lesra'' Martin
discovered Carter's autobiography, ``The 16th Round,'' in the
remainders bin of a Toronto Public Library book sale and was
inspired by it to begin a relationship with Carter that eventually
led to his exoneration.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the previous books and concerts compare to the media
blitz generated by the release of Norman Jewison's ``The
Hurricane,'' starring Denzel Washington, and the arrival in
bookstores this week of James S. Hirsch's ``Hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan. 16 Carter will be at the Golden Globe Awards: ``The
Hurricane'' has been nominated for best picture, best actor, and
best director. Last week he started a nationwide book tour with
Hirsch, and he'll be coming to Cambridge on Feb. 22 for a Harvard
symposium with Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Cornel West, among others.
</P>
<P>
   For decades people paid him only sporadic attention. Now they
won't leave him alone.
</P>
<P>
   Before I go much further, I should say that I am a friend of
Rubin Carter's. In 1993, I interviewed him in King City, a small
town just outside Toronto, where he then lived with Chaiton,
Swinton, and Lisa Peters, who are all portrayed in the film. Over
the years, I've spoken to Carter on the phone and we've had several
subsequent visits, including a visit to my home in 1994, when he
and the three Canadians presented me with a fine lithograph as a
housewarming present. Also, as Chaiton and Swinton were developing
the screenplay that became ``The Hurricane,'' they sent me a copy,
asking for advice. I gave them a few suggestions and a lot of
encouragement. I made the suggestions out of friendship; money
never exchanged hands, but I wished them good luck. Virtually
anyone familiar with the case was excited about seeing Carter's
extraordinary life on screen. I should also say that I'm quoted,
accurately, in Hirsch's book.
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood vs. history
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the film, which runs about 2 hours and 20 minutes,
Washington's Carter is a ruggedly handsome man who _ with the
inspiration of a young man named Lazarus and the dogged work of
Chaiton, Swinton, and Peters _ is freed. It's a simple telling of a
complex tale.
</P>
<P>
   The book is a different story. It's a darker, deeper one that
gets at the Machiavellian machinations that led to Carter's put him
in prison and kept him there. Its value isn't just in filling in
the blanks left by the movie but in detailing Carter's life long
before prison and long afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only one who knows what happened to me is me,'' says
Carter from New York. ``And here's what you have to understand. The
movie is a movie. It cost $30 million or $40 million and the movie
people have to put butts in the seats. That's what a movie is and I
don't have any problem with that. No problem at all. The movie
people don't like the book. That's up to them. But I'm glad to have
them both.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the debate between people who prefer the movie and
those who appreciate the book is determined by the essential
difference between the two media.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has always used history more for marketing than for
truth-telling. The movies have always had a particularly hard time
with biography, sports biography included. From William Bendix's
goofy portrayal of Babe Ruth to Oliver Stone and Kevin Costner's
canonization of Jim Garrison in ``JFK,'' Hollywood has rarely
gotten its history straight. Even in boxing, Rocky Graziano was
sanctified by Paul Newman in ``Somebody Up There Likes Me.''
(Martin Scorsese, always the exception, portrayed boxer Jake
LaMotta in ``Raging Bull'' with so much depth and dimension that,
even though it rejuvenated his flagging career, LaMotta didn't like
most of the film.)
</P>
<P>
   While incarcerated, Carter refused to eat prison food, obey
prison rules, or in any other way accept his condition as if he
were a guilty man. One of the other disciplines he learned is the
ability to hold in his mind two seemingly disparate concepts
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``This movie was about three hours long when I first saw it,''
says Carter. ``I liked that story. But that's too long and cuts
into the number of shows they can have so they cut it down. That's
the way movies are.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, as Carter says, is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I first got a copy back in September,'' he says. ``I sat down
at my desk and read it three times straight through. I didn't get
up to eat or drink or go to the bathroom. And I wouldn't change one
word. That's a miracle. Jim Hirsch's miracle.
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Touched by three angels
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people who worked on my case over the years are mad
because they're not mentioned in the movie,'' says Carter, ``so
they're running off saying stupid things about the movie. Why can't
they see that this movie is an emotional purge and that people are
being touched?''
</P>
<P>
   Several critics of the movie (including Kenneth Turan of the Los
Angeles Times), while praising Washington's performance to the
hilt, have objected to the creation of a fictional detective named
Vincent Della Pesca, who lurks around corners and has less
dimension than Snidely Whiplash as he railroads Hurricane Carter.
It wasn't a single villain that kept Rubin Carter behind bars for
nearly two decades. His imprisonment was brought about by a
confluence of factors including false testimony, paid informants,
manipulated evidence, crooked police, and prosecutors willing to
buy into the system. And at the root of it all, as federal Judge H.
Lee Sarokin finally declared in setting aside the verdict, was
race.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not where ``Hurricane'' director Norman Jewison chose
to travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to approach this story from the standpoint of
race,'' Jewison said during interviews to promote the film. ``I was
more interested in approaching it as a powerful but heartwarming
story. I think you have a Frank Capraesque ending _ everyone
realizes they have struggled for something that is right and end up
victorious.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter agrees with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a movie,'' he says, once again. ``You have to make a
movie for people to see. And I like that about it. There's a
miraculous quality about it. It's about people's lives coming
together to help each other. Miraculous.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rubin Carter has earned the right to believe in miracles.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my life, I've had three angels,'' he says. ``The first was
John Artis. They would have freed John Artis at any time if he lied
and told them I shot those people. He didn't. The second angel was
Lesra Martin. He came into my life at a time when I needed an angel
and didn't even know it. The third angel was Judge H. Lee Sarokin,
who had the courage to do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch's book, which viewers of the film owe it to themselves to
read, tells a much more complex, complicated tale than Jewison's
film. It delves deeply into Carter's childhood, a nightmarish time
when Carter's nickname wasn't Hurricane. It was Silent Night: He
was black he and didn't speak much because of a chronic stuttering
problem. It chronicles the ups and downs of Carter's postprison
relationships with Chaiton, Swinton, Peters, and Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the book,'' says Carter, again explaining that there's
no contradiction between the film and the book. ``Jim Hirsch
covered ground that you can't get to in a movie. And the movie ends
with me getting out of prison . . . with the exoneration. I've been
out for nearly 15 years and Jim Hirsch has that in the book. You
can't put everything in the movie. Jim Hirsch's book is about me _
63 years of my life. And he does great justice and gives great
dignity to those years.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter sighs, tired of explaining his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me put it this way,'' he says, finally. ``The movie is the
outside, the book is the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin Carter now lives and works in Toronto as the head of the
Association in the Defense of the Wrongfully Convicted, an activist
group dedicated to overturning unjust verdicts.

COMEBACK KING: KIRK DOUGLAS STEPS BACK INTO THE RING

entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of Kirk Douglas with Lauren Bacall in a
scene from ``Diamonds.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    A 1991 helicopter crash nearly killed him. A 1996 stroke left
him unable to talk. But, as the millennium turns, Kirk Douglas
remains unbowed.
 &HT;    ``I've mellowed, and I am tougher,'' says the film legend, a
notorious tough customer in his heyday. ``I was tough, but I was
always toughest on myself. Now I can be mellow _ I can accept the
weaknesses in others, because I can accept the weaknesses in
myself.
 &HT;    ``I think I'm a better person now,'' he says, ``but I'm still
pretty tough.''
 &HT;    Relaxing at Manhattan's Essex House hotel, Douglas smiles and
proudly flexes an arm muscle. He appears frail, but his handshake
is firm. He speaks slowly, but expresses himself clearly.
 &HT;    The occasion for this audience with Douglas is his new movie,
``Diamonds,'' which will go into wide release on Jan. 21. The
veteran actor shines as former boxing champ Harry Agensky, who
travels with his estranged son (Dan Aykroyd) and grandson (Corbin
Allred) to Reno to reclaim a stash of diamonds Harry hopes will
keep him out of a nursing home.
 &HT;    In the original version of the script, Harry suffered from
Alzheimer's disease. After he had agreed to play the role, Douglas
helped screenwriter Allan Aaron Katz and director John Asher
reconfigure the story in order to depict Harry recovering from a
stroke.
 &HT;    ``This is a comeback film,'' Douglas says. ``When I had my
stroke I couldn't talk _ I babbled. I said, `Listen, if silent
pictures come back, I might get a job.'
 &HT;    ``My son Michael and I have wanted to do a picture together,''
Douglas adds, ``and he said, `Why don't you work with a speech
therapist and then we'll do the picture?'
 &HT;    ``I was so angry,'' the actor recalls. ``I said, `Michael, why
don't you work with my speech therapist? Then, when you talk the
way I talk, we'll do the picture.'''
 &HT;    Douglas laughs.
 &HT;    ``We laughed,'' he says. ``But he was right. So I worked with a
therapist, and it happened that `Diamonds' came along. The vocal
exercises you see me do in the picture I really do.''
 &HT;    Some actors, after experiencing so debilitating a health crisis,
might not show their faces onscreen again, preferring instead to
let images from the past linger in the minds of moviegoers.
``Diamonds'' showcases Douglas in all his imperfect glory, and even
emphasizes the ravages of age via flashbacks to Harry's boxing
exploits, lifted from Douglas' Oscar-nominated performance in
``Champion'' (1949).
 &HT;    ``Anything can happen to you in life,'' Douglas says softly.
``You have to get rid of vanity.
 &HT;    ``When you have a stroke, you first have such depression,'' he
says. ``You just want to be in bed. You don't want to see
anybody.''
 &HT;    His comeback was sparked by his being named to receive a 1996
Oscar for ``50 years as a creative and moral force in the
motion-picture community.''
 &HT;    ``I initially wanted Michael to accept it for me,'' Douglas
recalls. ``He said, `No way, Dad. You've got to do it.' I was very
frightened, until I walked on the stage.
 &HT;    ``Then I was really a hambone,'' he says with a laugh. ``I
thought, `Three thousand people are standing up and cheering. Wow _
I need to say more than a thank-you.'''
 &HT;    That experience encouraged Douglas to function again, to accept
the fact that he had a speech impediment and to get on with his
life.
 &HT;    ``I've now got `Diamonds' done, and I've had several scripts
offered to me,'' he says. ``I'm writing books and I've got my
family, and I've given more speeches since I had the stroke than I
ever had.
 &HT;    ``I just gave a speech before the Speech Pathologists
Association,'' he adds. ``They work with stroke victims. I feel
like the pinup boy for stroke victims _ I make strokes fashionable.
 &HT;    ``Stroke victims are still too often pushed to the side or
hidden,'' he concludes, ``and, as I said, sometimes they do it to
themselves.''
 &HT;    Life-threatening experiences often compel people to re-explore
their feelings about death and religion, and Douglas was no
exception.
 &HT;    ``After the helicopter crash I felt guilty,'' he says. ``Two
young people died, and one of them was 18, getting ready for his
senior prom _ I was in my 70s, I had lived a life. Why did that
happen?
 &HT;    ``So I became interested in more _ I hate to use the word _
spiritual things,'' he says. ``I've been studying the Bible, the
Torah, every week for three years now. I've done it with an
Orthodox rabbi. Now I'm doing it with a Conservative rabbi. If I
live long enough, I'll do it with a Reform rabbi.
 &HT;    ``I've realized that all religions say one thing: We all pray
and receive the same God,'' the actor says. ``So why is the world
so f--ked up? I don't know.''
 &HT;    Turning to matters slightly less profound, Douglas agrees to
look back at a career which began in 1941, when he made his
professional acting debut on Broadway in ``Spring Again.'' He first
performed onscreen opposite Barbara Stanwyck in ``The Strange Love
of Martha Ivers'' (1946). He would go on to Oscar nominations for
``Champion,'' ``The Bad and the Beautiful'' (1952) and ``Lust for
Life'' (1962).
 &HT;    As a producer, Douglas shepherded such classic films as ``Paths
of Glory'' (1958) and ``Seven Days in May'' (1964). He also broke
the Hollywood blacklist against supposed Communists by giving
Dalton Trumbo the onscreen writing credit he deserved for
``Spartacus'' (1960), a key factor in his 1996 special Oscar.
 &HT;    ```Spartacus' was a great movie with a great cast and a great
theme,'' Douglas says. ```Paths of Glory' was a great antiwar movie
and, I think, the best film Kubrick ever did.
 &HT;    ``Vincente Minnelli did a great job with `Lust for Life,'''
Douglas adds, ``and I thought I did a great job in that study of a
pathetic artist (Vincent Van Gogh). `Diamonds' is my 80th picture,
and there are probably 20 or 22 of my films that I really like.''
 &HT;    Douglas hopes to add to that list in the near future. In the
meantime, he recently celebrated his second bar mitzvah and is
reading scripts. In addition, the successful author and novelist
plans to write at least two more nonfictional books, one about his
relationship with his mother and the other about his thoughts on
death.
 &HT;    As the conversation draws to a close, Douglas ponders what Issur
Danielovitch _ the ragman's son from Amsterdam, N.Y., who grew up
to become Kirk Douglas _ might make of the life he's led.
 &HT;    ``I think of that often,'' Douglas says. ``I've written about
it.
 &HT;    ``I'm lucky,'' he concludes, ``and I don't feel unlucky because
of the stroke. It's made many changes in me as a person that, as I
said, I like. It's given me an appreciation of where I'm from and
who I am.
 &HT;    ``It's given me an appreciation for life.''

 (Includes a color slide of James Gandolfini and Edie Falco in a
scene from ``The Sopranos.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Everybody's talking about the latest Mafia hit, but the people
on the inside are keeping their mouths shut.
 &HT;    It was dawn on the boardwalk in Asbury Park, N.J., and ``The
Sopranos'' was secretly filming a scene for its new season on HBO.
 &HT;    It was supposed to be secret, that is, but despite freezing
temperatures a crowd of fans had gathered to watch.
 &HT;    `Tony, Tony!'' they hollered as series star James Gandolfini _
better known as mob boss Tony Soprano _ appeared, leaving the actor
nothing to do but shake his head in amazement.
 &HT;    ``People were coming out of the woodwork,'' new cast member
Federico Castellucio recalls. ``We had to wonder how they even knew
we were out there.''
 &HT;    That's how it is when your unheralded cable-television
comedy/drama series has suddenly caught fire, topping critics'
10-best lists and drawing comparisons with the best shows of all
time.
 &HT;    Laughing, Gandolfini smacked one of his tree-trunk arms around
Castellucio's shoulders.
 &HT;    ``Just wait until your stuff comes out, kid,'' he told the
newcomer. ``They'll be shouting your name, too.''
 &HT;    He doesn't have to wait long now _ the second season of ``The
Sopranos'' premieres on Jan. 16, and the cast members are eager to
say ... nothing.
 &HT;    ``I don't want to lose my job,'' says Edie Falco, who won an
Emmy Award last year as mob wife Carmella Soprano. ``Before I do a
series of interviews, I am given a speech by the publicity people
and the writers. They repeat: `There are no clues to be given.'
 &HT;    ``I actually made the mistake of telling a reporter about a
shirt I was wearing this year,'' she adds, ``and I got so severely
yelled at. They're not kidding around _ they're serious about
keeping the secrets. `Confidential' is printed on every single
piece of paper we're handed.''
 &HT;    In other words, the message from HBO is: ``Fugeddaboudit.''
 &HT;    But still, a few of the Sopranos will sing.
 &HT;    Producer Ilene Landress, calling from Stage X at Silvercup
Studios in New York, reports that Tony Soprano will get a sister
this season.
 &HT;    An on-set source divulges that this season ``The Sopranos'' will
go to Naples to have some meetings with faraway ``family members.''
 &HT;    Another new script features Sandra Bernhard and Janeane Garofalo
as actresses filming a mob movie. Tony Soprano happens to stumble
upon their set.
 &HT;    But don't turn to Falco for confirmation.
 &HT;    ``I'm not talking. Not a thing,'' she says. ``You didn't hear it
from me.''
 &HT;    The 35-year-old Castellucio, a Naples native now living in New
Jersey, hesitates to say anything specific about his new character.
 &HT;    ``Let's just say this guy has a background like mine, a Jersey
guy born in Italy,'' Castellucio says nervously by telephone. ``All
these characters are the people that I know.''
 &HT;    He pauses.
 &HT;    ``Oh my God,'' he says, ``maybe I've said too much.''
 &HT;    Maybe, but critics can't say enough about the show. Rolling
Stone called it ``the best thing to hit TV in decades,'' while
Entertainment Weekly recent chose ``The Sopranos'' as its Best TV
Show of 1999.
 &HT;    The lives of the cast have been radically changed, Falco says.
 &HT;    ``Last month I'm walking my dog in New York in jeans and a
T-shirt,'' she recalls, ``and a fire truck full of men pulls up
screaming, `Carmella! Carmella!'''
 &HT;    Or ask 68-year-old Dominic Chianese, who suddenly can't walk
around his native New York without being mistaken for the scheming,
underhanded Uncle Junior.
 &HT;    ``An entire construction crew in Times Square stopped working
this summer and started screaming, `Uncle Junior! Uncle Junior!'''
Chianese says.
 &HT;    He can't even eat at an Italian restaurant anymore.
 &HT;    ``I get too many bottles of wine sent over,'' he says.
 &HT;    His only mixed reviews, Chianese adds, have come from his
92-year-old Italian mother: ``My ma will call me and say, `You were
very good, son _ but you curse way too much at work!'''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, Falco questions the press reports that real-life
mafiosos are among the show's biggest fans.
 &HT;    ``I laughed my head off when I read those reports,'' the actress
says. ``I'd love to know where these reporters got tapes of
mobsters talking about a TV show. Maybe crime goes down when the
show is on?''
 &HT;    If the Mob isn't into ``The Sopranos,'' they're just about the
only people who aren't _ quite a turnaround from a year ago, when
series creator David Chase found it hard to peddle his idea for a
new show. Fox, for example, turned him down cold, insisting that
mob dramas were passe.
 &HT;    Chase, a native of New Jersey, insisted that his show wasn't an
ordinary mob story _ or, actually, that it was an extraordinarily
ordinary one.
 &HT;    ``It's about mobsters in suburbia,'' Chase says. ``For me,
that's not so farfetched. Let's just say I grew up with guys like I
write about in the series.''
 &HT;    The key to the show's success, he believes, is its plausibility.
 &HT;    ``I try to make the behavior relatable to everyone,'' he says.
``While this mob family is quite different from the rest of us,
they're really not that different.''
 &HT;    At the center of that family is Tony Soprano, played by the
notoriously press-shy Gandolfini _ who, his colleagues say, is
almost as secretive on the set.
 &HT;    ``The truth is, I don't really know Jim that well,'' Falco says
of her onscreen husband. ``We don't hang out at all after shooting.
I think it makes the fantasy life more dimensional. So when I see
Jim walk onto the set, he's Tony _ every square inch of him is
Tony.''
 &HT;    Falco does have one insight into Gandolfini's reaction to the
show's popularity.
 &HT;    ``He is a bit in shock that he has this sex-symbol status these
days,'' she says. ``The women on the set think he's definitely
sexy, but he just doesn't see it. He's powerful, he's cuddly _ an
Italian teddy bear.
 &HT;    ``He also has that dangerous thing, which is frankly so sexy.''
 &HT;    Like any Mafia-related film or television series, ``The
Sopranos'' has gotten its share of complaints about Italian
stereotyping, but Landress says they're few and far between. Most
people who call or write to complain have a more pressing concern.
 &HT;    ``Fans say that 13 episodes a year aren't enough,'' she says.
``HBO wants us to do more, but we want to keep the quality up.''
 &HT;    Which takes us back to Asbury Park. By now the sun is setting,
but the new scene is in the can. And, yes, the fans are still
there.
 &HT;    ``Tony, Tony!'' they chant.
 &HT;    Actually, Falco reveals, the scene is part of the second-season
finale, a dream sequence in which Tony returns to the only place
that ever made him happy as a child, which is the boardwalk.
 &HT;    Suddenly the don bumps into a man with a gruesome head wound.
This leads to Tony grabbing a can of gasoline and pouring it over
his head.
 &HT;    As soon as she's spoken, Falco seems to regret having said
anything. But, after all, she hasn't revealed anything about the
actual plot of the new season _ the scene is just a dream, after
all.
 &HT;    Falco decides that she won't get fired over it. But either way,
she says, the entire series has been a dream sequence in its own
right.
 &HT;    ``If I get whacked tomorrow,'' she says, ``I'll be grateful to
have been part of the best mob series ever.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE: Possibly objectionable language in paragraphs 4 and
5. 
 By KEVIN DICKSON  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be printed in Canada before Jan. 16. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Camryn Manheim is a one-woman show.
 &HT;    In person, she's every bit as intelligent _ and as intimidating
_ as the no-guff lawyer she plays on ABC's ``The Practice.'' In
Toronto, on the outdoor set of her upcoming television movie, ``The
Loretta Claiborne Story'' _ set to air Jan. 16 on ABC _ Manheim is
juggling a hectic shooting schedule, bustling production assistants
and an imminent interview, all while laughing and exchanging
good-natured quips with the cast and crew around her.
 &HT;    She drops into a director's chair dragged into some unsuspecting
family's driveway, settles down and takes a deep breath.
 &HT;    ``I'm kicking any ass that stands in my way,'' she says with a
laugh. ``People who have told me that I can't have what is rightly
mine or what I want, my dreams. People who said, `You are never
going to be able to attain your dreams, you don't have what it
takes.'
 &HT;    ``That's whose asses I kick,'' she says cheerfully. ``And those
are the asses that I will continue to kick, because they stand in
my way.''
 &HT;    These days there aren't many people who will stand in the
38-year-old actress' way, but Manheim feels that there are still
obstacles before her.
 &HT;    ``As far as leading a movie and making it romantic, I don't see
that around the bend anytime soon,'' Manheim says matter-of-factly.
``So I'm going to force the hand. I think that I have the resources
and the wherewithal to actually produce my own film, and that's
what I'm going to do.''
 &HT;    In other words, the lady is going to do things her way.
 &HT;    ``I'm developing movies and scripts and buying books that I want
to star in,'' she says, ``because those opportunities aren't
offered to me right now. You're going to have a hard time finding a
producer who wants to offer me a romantic lead in a motion
picture.''
 &HT;    The Toronto set of ``Loretta Claiborne'' is only the latest
whistlestop on a whirlwind tour that began in earnest two years
ago, when Manheim picked up an Emmy Award as Best Supporting
Actress for her work as Ellenor Frutt on ``The Practice.'' In one
of those magic moments that go directly from your screen to
television history, Manheim dispensed with the usual litany of
thank-yous and bellowed, ``This is for all the fat girls!''
 &HT;    It was heartfelt, it was outrageous and it was gutsy. Like
Manheim herself.
 &HT;    Since then, Manheim has written a book, the wildly successful
``Wake Up, I'm Fat'' (Broadway Books, 1999), based on her own
one-woman show. She's appeared in films, most notably in a
brilliantly creepy turn in the dark comedy ``Happiness'' (1999).
She's even become a darling of the paparazzi, thanks to her
friendship with publicity magnet Monica Lewinsky.
 &HT;    Through it all, the actress has staunchly resisted playing by
traditional rules. She has not embarked on a rigorous diet. She has
not learned to toe the party line, and she has never said she's
sorry. In these days of political correctness and ultra-bland
celebrities, Manheim is refreshingly candid, down-to-earth and
inspiring.
 &HT;    Inspiring is the word for the Disney television movie ``The
Loretta Claiborne Story,'' in which Manheim plays a social worker
who bonds with a young, troubled athlete who is partially blind,
mildly retarded and unable to walk properly. Despite those
handicaps, the young woman goes on to become a champion runner at
the Special Olympics.
 &HT;    ``I read the script and loved it,'' Manheim says
enthusiastically. ``Because we never see this subject matter on
television _ it's not glamorous, it's not glitzy, it's certainly
not `Melrose Place.' All the things I've been fighting for _ really
great female characters, great themes and telling really important
stories _ are all evident in the script.
 &HT;    ``That's why I did it _ it's a win/win situation.''
 &HT;    Manheim went straight from ``The Loretta Claiborne Story'' into
the role of a middle-aged ``Snow White'' for another television
movie that will be seen later this year.
 &HT;    ``That they offered me Snow White was such a huge, huge victory
for me,'' she says. ``I didn't even read the script before I
agreed. And I am so grateful to those producers for even thinking
of me in that fashion.''
 &HT;    Which brings us back to her book, because a big part of its
purpose, as with the show that preceded it, was to get people to
think about large people in different ways.
 &HT;    ``Actually,'' she says with a laugh, ``that was our fear in
marketing, that it would only appeal to fat women. But it wasn't
written just for fat women, and I hope that, somehow, that message
gets across and everybody reads it.
 &HT;    ``You could replace the word `fat' with anything,'' she says.
```Wake Up, I'm Short!' `Wake Up, I'm Gay!' `Wake Up, I Have
Learning Disability!' `Wake Up, I'm Too Thin!' `Wake Up, I'm
Tired!'''
 &HT;    She laughs.
 &HT;    ``Shut Up, You're Fat,'' she offers with a grin.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, Manheim is honest enough to admit that she might
not be so avid a supporter of overweight acceptance if she herself
had weighed less.
 &HT;    ``I leave the idea open that it might have been different, had I
been a skinny little beauty queen,'' she admits.
 &HT;    Currently single, Manheim does have one man in her life:
television maestro David E. Kelley, creator of ``The Practice,''
``Ally McBeal'' and ``Chicago Hope,'' among other shows.
 &HT;    Her audition for him, in pursuit of a role that later went to
another actress, is the stuff of television legend: Sensing that
things were going badly, Manheim challenged Kelley to a game of
chess. Her gameboard demeanour fascinated him, and he ended up
creating the part of Ellenor expressly for her.
 &HT;    ``I would like to think that it was my destiny to arrive here at
some point and make some kind of contribution to the fight for
acceptance,'' Manheim says proudly. ``David Kelley gave me the key
to that door.
 &HT;    ``It's mostly because of this man, who is so confident in
himself and in his intuition that he can embrace what is unique
about everybody and not try to make us all conform,'' she says.
``He's changed my life forever, in the best, most positive, most
glorious way, and for that I am eternally grateful.''
 &HT;    Not that she doesn't have one bone to pick with Kelley. If he
wants to make his Emmy-winning star happy, there's one small detail
left to be squared away: Manheim would like to see Ellenor get a
sane boyfriend.
 &HT;    ``Can't you write in?'' she pleads. ``Listen, tell all the
readers to write in to David Kelley and ask him to give Ellenor a
love interest for next season.
 &HT;    ``We all want it,'' she says confidently. ``You know you do! I
certainly do!''

COMEBACK KING: KIRK DOUGLAS STEPS BACK INTO THE RING 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of Kirk Douglas with Lauren Bacall in a
scene from ``Diamonds.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    A 1991 helicopter crash nearly killed him. A 1996 stroke left
him unable to talk. But, as the millennium turns, Kirk Douglas
remains unbowed.
 &HT;    ``I've mellowed, and I am tougher,'' says the film legend, a
notorious tough customer in his heyday. ``I was tough, but I was
always toughest on myself. Now I can be mellow _ I can accept the
weaknesses in others, because I can accept the weaknesses in
myself.
 &HT;    ``I think I'm a better person now,'' he says, ``but I'm still
pretty tough.''
 &HT;    Relaxing at Manhattan's Essex House hotel, Douglas smiles and
proudly flexes an arm muscle. He appears frail, but his handshake
is firm. He speaks slowly, but expresses himself clearly.
 &HT;    The occasion for this audience with Douglas is his new movie,
``Diamonds,'' which will go into wide release on Jan. 21. The
veteran actor shines as former boxing champ Harry Agensky, who
travels with his estranged son (Dan Aykroyd) and grandson (Corbin
Allred) to Reno to reclaim a stash of diamonds Harry hopes will
keep him out of a nursing home.
 &HT;    In the original version of the script, Harry suffered from
Alzheimer's disease. After he had agreed to play the role, Douglas
helped screenwriter Allan Aaron Katz and director John Asher
reconfigure the story in order to depict Harry recovering from a
stroke.
 &HT;    ``This is a comeback film,'' Douglas says. ``When I had my
stroke I couldn't talk _ I babbled. I said, `Listen, if silent
pictures come back, I might get a job.'
 &HT;    ``My son Michael and I have wanted to do a picture together,''
Douglas adds, ``and he said, `Why don't you work with a speech
therapist and then we'll do the picture?'
 &HT;    ``I was so angry,'' the actor recalls. ``I said, `Michael, why
don't you work with my speech therapist? Then, when you talk the
way I talk, we'll do the picture.'''
 &HT;    Douglas laughs.
 &HT;    ``We laughed,'' he says. ``But he was right. So I worked with a
therapist, and it happened that `Diamonds' came along. The vocal
exercises you see me do in the picture I really do.''
 &HT;    Some actors, after experiencing so debilitating a health crisis,
might not show their faces onscreen again, preferring instead to
let images from the past linger in the minds of moviegoers.
``Diamonds'' showcases Douglas in all his imperfect glory, and even
emphasizes the ravages of age via flashbacks to Harry's boxing
exploits, lifted from Douglas' Oscar-nominated performance in
``Champion'' (1949).
 &HT;    ``Anything can happen to you in life,'' Douglas says softly.
``You have to get rid of vanity.
 &HT;    ``When you have a stroke, you first have such depression,'' he
says. ``You just want to be in bed. You don't want to see
anybody.''
 &HT;    His comeback was sparked by his being named to receive a 1996
Oscar for ``50 years as a creative and moral force in the
motion-picture community.''
 &HT;    ``I initially wanted Michael to accept it for me,'' Douglas
recalls. ``He said, `No way, Dad. You've got to do it.' I was very
frightened, until I walked on the stage.
 &HT;    ``Then I was really a hambone,'' he says with a laugh. ``I
thought, `Three thousand people are standing up and cheering. Wow _
I need to say more than a thank-you.'''
 &HT;    That experience encouraged Douglas to function again, to accept
the fact that he had a speech impediment and to get on with his
life.
 &HT;    ``I've now got `Diamonds' done, and I've had several scripts
offered to me,'' he says. ``I'm writing books and I've got my
family, and I've given more speeches since I had the stroke than I
ever had.
 &HT;    ``I just gave a speech before the Speech Pathologists
Association,'' he adds. ``They work with stroke victims. I feel
like the pinup boy for stroke victims _ I make strokes fashionable.
 &HT;    ``Stroke victims are still too often pushed to the side or
hidden,'' he concludes, ``and, as I said, sometimes they do it to
themselves.''
 &HT;    Life-threatening experiences often compel people to re-explore
their feelings about death and religion, and Douglas was no
exception.
 &HT;    ``After the helicopter crash I felt guilty,'' he says. ``Two
young people died, and one of them was 18, getting ready for his
senior prom _ I was in my 70s, I had lived a life. Why did that
happen?
 &HT;    ``So I became interested in more _ I hate to use the word _
spiritual things,'' he says. ``I've been studying the Bible, the
Torah, every week for three years now. I've done it with an
Orthodox rabbi. Now I'm doing it with a Conservative rabbi. If I
live long enough, I'll do it with a Reform rabbi.
 &HT;    ``I've realized that all religions say one thing: We all pray
and receive the same God,'' the actor says. ``So why is the world
so f--ked up? I don't know.''
 &HT;    Turning to matters slightly less profound, Douglas agrees to
look back at a career which began in 1941, when he made his
professional acting debut on Broadway in ``Spring Again.'' He first
performed onscreen opposite Barbara Stanwyck in ``The Strange Love
of Martha Ivers'' (1946). He would go on to Oscar nominations for
``Champion,'' ``The Bad and the Beautiful'' (1952) and ``Lust for
Life'' (1962).
 &HT;    As a producer, Douglas shepherded such classic films as ``Paths
of Glory'' (1958) and ``Seven Days in May'' (1964). He also broke
the Hollywood blacklist against supposed Communists by giving
Dalton Trumbo the onscreen writing credit he deserved for
``Spartacus'' (1960), a key factor in his 1996 special Oscar.
 &HT;    ```Spartacus' was a great movie with a great cast and a great
theme,'' Douglas says. ```Paths of Glory' was a great antiwar movie
and, I think, the best film Kubrick ever did.
 &HT;    ``Vincente Minnelli did a great job with `Lust for Life,'''
Douglas adds, ``and I thought I did a great job in that study of a
pathetic artist (Vincent Van Gogh). `Diamonds' is my 80th picture,
and there are probably 20 or 22 of my films that I really like.''
 &HT;    Douglas hopes to add to that list in the near future. In the
meantime, he recently celebrated his second bar mitzvah and is
reading scripts. In addition, the successful author and novelist
plans to write at least two more nonfictional books, one about his
relationship with his mother and the other about his thoughts on
death.
 &HT;    As the conversation draws to a close, Douglas ponders what Issur
Danielovitch _ the ragman's son from Amsterdam, N.Y., who grew up
to become Kirk Douglas _ might make of the life he's led.
 &HT;    ``I think of that often,'' Douglas says. ``I've written about
it.
 &HT;    ``I'm lucky,'' he concludes, ``and I don't feel unlucky because
of the stroke. It's made many changes in me as a person that, as I
said, I like. It's given me an appreciation of where I'm from and
who I am.
 &HT;    ``It's given me an appreciation for life.''

 (Includes a color slide of the rock group Rage Against the Machine
_ Zack de la Rocha, Tom Morello, Tim Commerford and Brad Wilk.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Tom Morello, the Harvard-educated guitarist for Rage Against the
Machine, hopes that the success of the politically strident rock
band ultimately will be gauged less by its considerable record
sales than by its good works.
 &HT;    That's the biggest difference, he says, between his rap/rock
group and such contemporaries as Limp Bizkit and Metallica, with
whom Rage shared a headbanger triple-header at the Woodstock '99
festival in July.
 &HT;    ``I'm a fan of both of them,'' the 35-year-old Morello says.
``We share some things musically. But Rage Against the Machine is
something entirely different, not only from a musical standpoint
but also from a philosophical one.
 &HT;    ``From our first rehearsals, we have been not just about making
great music but about forging those songs with our convictions _
which is somewhat different than doing it `just for the nookie,'''
he adds, referring to Limp Bizkit's summer hit.
 &HT;    Indeed, few if any bands in rock history resemble Rage Against
the Machine, whose newly released third album, ``The Battle of Los
Angeles,'' debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard charts with sales of
nearly half a million copies.
 &HT;    The quartet emerged in 1991 with a mix of rap and rock that lit
the fuse for what became the defining pop trend of 1999. But what
really set the band apart was frontman Zack de la Rocha's lyrics,
machine-gun-speed political broadsides about specific issues such
as Mexico's Zapatista rebels, imprisoned Native American activist
Leonard Peltier and Mumia Abu-Jamal, the former Black Panther and
radio journalist now on Death Row for killing a policeman 18 years
ago.
 &HT;    The band has backed up its convictions, too, playing numerous
benefits, including the Tibetan Freedom Festival and concerts for
Abu-Jamal and Peltier. It even donated its fees from a 1997 stint
opening for U2 to a number of activist organizations, including
Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting and Women Alive.
 &HT;    ``I think that we are on the threshold of being able to really
push the boundaries of what it means to be activists in the world
of music,'' Morello says. ``It's not enough for us to just dabble
in feel-good issues and do the occasional benefit show _ we want to
really try to build a bridge between our pretty sizable audience
and the world of getting-your-hands-dirty activism.
 &HT;    ``And the band's success, in the end, will be judged not by
record sales but by tangible gains in that world.''
 &HT;    Even so, Rage has enjoyed impressive record sales _ each of its
first two albums, ``Rage Against the Machine'' (1992) and ``Evil
Empire'' (1996), were certified platinum.
 &HT;    But Morello says that, in making ``The Battle,'' the bandmembers
felt that their charge was ``to not just make the best Rage record,
but to make a defining record.''
 &HT;    And that was not easy to accomplish: While Morello, de la Rocha,
bassist Tim Commerford _ also known, these days, as Y.tim.K _ and
drummer Brad Wilk finished most of the music for the album more
than a year ago, de la Rocha struggled with the lyrics and the
album wasn't wrapped up until July.
 &HT;    Still, Morello says, there were no complaints.
 &HT;    ``We have a tremendous and unique musical chemistry,'' he says,
``but it's a chemistry that does not always work at a sprinter's
pace, and that's OK.''
 &HT;    Morello doesn't flinch from acknowledging the dicey
interpersonal dynamics that tend to keep the four musicians apart
when they're not recording or touring.
 &HT;    ``I've played with dozens of other musicians in different
situations,'' he says, ``and nothing approximates what it's like to
play with Zack and Timmy and Brad. And if I have to wait a little
bit longer to make records with those guys, that's all right. It's
well worth the wait.
 &HT;    ``It would have been a tragedy to put something out before all
four of us were behind it.''
 &HT;    The songs on ``The Battle of Los Angeles'' rage hard, living up
to de la Rocha's characterization of the band's music as ``the
weapon of sound above ground'' on the first single, ``Guerilla
Radio.''
 &HT;    He raps about popular apathy, lowest-common-denominator media,
corrupt politicians, unjust socioeconomic conditions and, in
``Voice of the Homeless,'' about the continuing controversy over
Abu-Jamal.
 &HT;    But ``The Battle of Los Angeles'' is also noteworthy for its
music, unquestionably the strongest Rage has yet produced.
Throughout the album's 12 songs, Commerford and Wilk lock into
solid grooves that support Morello's pyrotechnic guitar work, which
runs from straightforward and gritty on songs such as ``Testify''
and ``Sleep Now in the Fire'' to effects-laden simulations of
bombs, tracer missiles, Celtic pipes and helicopters flying
overhead.
 &HT;    ``One of the things I really like about this record is there's a
compactness to it, both as a whole and on some of the individual
songs,'' Morello says. ``I love some of the sprawling opuses from
record one, where the modus operandi was `Hey, we've got another
riff. Let's just sew it onto the end of whatever songs we happen to
be working on that day.'
 &HT;    ``But on this album the song structures tend to be tighter, and
that makes it even more powerful.''
 &HT;    That should translate to the concert stage, too, he adds, where
the always-formidable Rage plans to spend much of 2000.
 &HT;    ``We never go onstage to be the second-best band,'' Morello
says. ``We always have our hackles up. Of course, music is an art
form and it's not all that competitive _ but we don't ever intend
to be the second-best band on a stage at any show.''

MOB APPEAL: `THE SOPRANOS' GIVES THE MAFIA A MAKEOVER

 (Includes a color slide of James Gandolfini and Edie Falco in a
scene from ``The Sopranos.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Everybody's talking about the latest Mafia hit, but the people
on the inside are keeping their mouths shut.
 &HT;    It was dawn on the boardwalk in Asbury Park, N.J., and ``The
Sopranos'' was secretly filming a scene for its new season on HBO.
 &HT;    It was supposed to be secret, that is, but despite freezing
temperatures a crowd of fans had gathered to watch.
 &HT;    `Tony, Tony!'' they hollered as series star James Gandolfini _
better known as mob boss Tony Soprano _ appeared, leaving the actor
nothing to do but shake his head in amazement.
 &HT;    ``People were coming out of the woodwork,'' new cast member
Federico Castellucio recalls. ``We had to wonder how they even knew
we were out there.''
 &HT;    That's how it is when your unheralded cable-television
comedy/drama series has suddenly caught fire, topping critics'
10-best lists and drawing comparisons with the best shows of all
time.
 &HT;    Laughing, Gandolfini smacked one of his tree-trunk arms around
Castellucio's shoulders.
 &HT;    ``Just wait until your stuff comes out, kid,'' he told the
newcomer. ``They'll be shouting your name, too.''
 &HT;    He doesn't have to wait long now _ the second season of ``The
Sopranos'' premieres on Jan. 16, and the cast members are eager to
say ... nothing.
 &HT;    ``I don't want to lose my job,'' says Edie Falco, who won an
Emmy Award last year as mob wife Carmella Soprano. ``Before I do a
series of interviews, I am given a speech by the publicity people
and the writers. They repeat: `There are no clues to be given.'
 &HT;    ``I actually made the mistake of telling a reporter about a
shirt I was wearing this year,'' she adds, ``and I got so severely
yelled at. They're not kidding around _ they're serious about
keeping the secrets. `Confidential' is printed on every single
piece of paper we're handed.''
 &HT;    In other words, the message from HBO is: ``Fugeddaboudit.''
 &HT;    But still, a few of the Sopranos will sing.
 &HT;    Producer Ilene Landress, calling from Stage X at Silvercup
Studios in New York, reports that Tony Soprano will get a sister
this season.
 &HT;    An on-set source divulges that this season ``The Sopranos'' will
go to Naples to have some meetings with faraway ``family members.''
 &HT;    Another new script features Sandra Bernhard and Janeane Garofalo
as actresses filming a mob movie. Tony Soprano happens to stumble
upon their set.
 &HT;    But don't turn to Falco for confirmation.
 &HT;    ``I'm not talking. Not a thing,'' she says. ``You didn't hear it
from me.''
 &HT;    The 35-year-old Castellucio, a Naples native now living in New
Jersey, hesitates to say anything specific about his new character.
 &HT;    ``Let's just say this guy has a background like mine, a Jersey
guy born in Italy,'' Castellucio says nervously by telephone. ``All
these characters are the people that I know.''
 &HT;    He pauses.
 &HT;    ``Oh my God,'' he says, ``maybe I've said too much.''
 &HT;    Maybe, but critics can't say enough about the show. Rolling
Stone called it ``the best thing to hit TV in decades,'' while
Entertainment Weekly recent chose ``The Sopranos'' as its Best TV
Show of 1999.
 &HT;    The lives of the cast have been radically changed, Falco says.
 &HT;    ``Last month I'm walking my dog in New York in jeans and a
T-shirt,'' she recalls, ``and a fire truck full of men pulls up
screaming, `Carmella! Carmella!'''
 &HT;    Or ask 68-year-old Dominic Chianese, who suddenly can't walk
around his native New York without being mistaken for the scheming,
underhanded Uncle Junior.
 &HT;    ``An entire construction crew in Times Square stopped working
this summer and started screaming, `Uncle Junior! Uncle Junior!'''
Chianese says.
 &HT;    He can't even eat at an Italian restaurant anymore.
 &HT;    ``I get too many bottles of wine sent over,'' he says.
 &HT;    His only mixed reviews, Chianese adds, have come from his
92-year-old Italian mother: ``My ma will call me and say, `You were
very good, son _ but you curse way too much at work!'''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, Falco questions the press reports that real-life
mafiosos are among the show's biggest fans.
 &HT;    ``I laughed my head off when I read those reports,'' the actress
says. ``I'd love to know where these reporters got tapes of
mobsters talking about a TV show. Maybe crime goes down when the
show is on?''
 &HT;    If the Mob isn't into ``The Sopranos,'' they're just about the
only people who aren't _ quite a turnaround from a year ago, when
series creator David Chase found it hard to peddle his idea for a
new show. Fox, for example, turned him down cold, insisting that
mob dramas were passe.
 &HT;    Chase, a native of New Jersey, insisted that his show wasn't an
ordinary mob story _ or, actually, that it was an extraordinarily
ordinary one.
 &HT;    ``It's about mobsters in suburbia,'' Chase says. ``For me,
that's not so farfetched. Let's just say I grew up with guys like I
write about in the series.''
 &HT;    The key to the show's success, he believes, is its plausibility.
 &HT;    ``I try to make the behavior relatable to everyone,'' he says.
``While this mob family is quite different from the rest of us,
they're really not that different.''
 &HT;    At the center of that family is Tony Soprano, played by the
notoriously press-shy Gandolfini _ who, his colleagues say, is
almost as secretive on the set.
 &HT;    ``The truth is, I don't really know Jim that well,'' Falco says
of her onscreen husband. ``We don't hang out at all after shooting.
I think it makes the fantasy life more dimensional. So when I see
Jim walk onto the set, he's Tony _ every square inch of him is
Tony.''
 &HT;    Falco does have one insight into Gandolfini's reaction to the
show's popularity.
 &HT;    ``He is a bit in shock that he has this sex-symbol status these
days,'' she says. ``The women on the set think he's definitely
sexy, but he just doesn't see it. He's powerful, he's cuddly _ an
Italian teddy bear.
 &HT;    ``He also has that dangerous thing, which is frankly so sexy.''
 &HT;    Like any Mafia-related film or television series, ``The
Sopranos'' has gotten its share of complaints about Italian
stereotyping, but Landress says they're few and far between. Most
people who call or write to complain have a more pressing concern.
 &HT;    ``Fans say that 13 episodes a year aren't enough,'' she says.
``HBO wants us to do more, but we want to keep the quality up.''
 &HT;    Which takes us back to Asbury Park. By now the sun is setting,
but the new scene is in the can. And, yes, the fans are still
there.
 &HT;    ``Tony, Tony!'' they chant.
 &HT;    Actually, Falco reveals, the scene is part of the second-season
finale, a dream sequence in which Tony returns to the only place
that ever made him happy as a child, which is the boardwalk.
 &HT;    Suddenly the don bumps into a man with a gruesome head wound.
This leads to Tony grabbing a can of gasoline and pouring it over
his head.
 &HT;    As soon as she's spoken, Falco seems to regret having said
anything. But, after all, she hasn't revealed anything about the
actual plot of the new season _ the scene is just a dream, after
all.
 &HT;    Falco decides that she won't get fired over it. But either way,
she says, the entire series has been a dream sequence in its own
right.
 &HT;    ``If I get whacked tomorrow,'' she says, ``I'll be grateful to
have been part of the best mob series ever.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE: Possibly objectionable language in paragraphs 4 and
5. 
 By KEVIN DICKSON  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be printed in Canada before Jan. 16. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Camryn Manheim is a one-woman show.
 &HT;    In person, she's every bit as intelligent _ and as intimidating
_ as the no-guff lawyer she plays on ABC's ``The Practice.'' In
Toronto, on the outdoor set of her upcoming television movie, ``The
Loretta Claiborne Story'' _ set to air Jan. 16 on ABC _ Manheim is
juggling a hectic shooting schedule, bustling production assistants
and an imminent interview, all while laughing and exchanging
good-natured quips with the cast and crew around her.
 &HT;    She drops into a director's chair dragged into some unsuspecting
family's driveway, settles down and takes a deep breath.
 &HT;    ``I'm kicking any ass that stands in my way,'' she says with a
laugh. ``People who have told me that I can't have what is rightly
mine or what I want, my dreams. People who said, `You are never
going to be able to attain your dreams, you don't have what it
takes.'
 &HT;    ``That's whose asses I kick,'' she says cheerfully. ``And those
are the asses that I will continue to kick, because they stand in
my way.''
 &HT;    These days there aren't many people who will stand in the
38-year-old actress' way, but Manheim feels that there are still
obstacles before her.
 &HT;    ``As far as leading a movie and making it romantic, I don't see
that around the bend anytime soon,'' Manheim says matter-of-factly.
``So I'm going to force the hand. I think that I have the resources
and the wherewithal to actually produce my own film, and that's
what I'm going to do.''
 &HT;    In other words, the lady is going to do things her way.
 &HT;    ``I'm developing movies and scripts and buying books that I want
to star in,'' she says, ``because those opportunities aren't
offered to me right now. You're going to have a hard time finding a
producer who wants to offer me a romantic lead in a motion
picture.''
 &HT;    The Toronto set of ``Loretta Claiborne'' is only the latest
whistlestop on a whirlwind tour that began in earnest two years
ago, when Manheim picked up an Emmy Award as Best Supporting
Actress for her work as Ellenor Frutt on ``The Practice.'' In one
of those magic moments that go directly from your screen to
television history, Manheim dispensed with the usual litany of
thank-yous and bellowed, ``This is for all the fat girls!''
 &HT;    It was heartfelt, it was outrageous and it was gutsy. Like
Manheim herself.
 &HT;    Since then, Manheim has written a book, the wildly successful
``Wake Up, I'm Fat'' (Broadway Books, 1999), based on her own
one-woman show. She's appeared in films, most notably in a
brilliantly creepy turn in the dark comedy ``Happiness'' (1999).
She's even become a darling of the paparazzi, thanks to her
friendship with publicity magnet Monica Lewinsky.
 &HT;    Through it all, the actress has staunchly resisted playing by
traditional rules. She has not embarked on a rigorous diet. She has
not learned to toe the party line, and she has never said she's
sorry. In these days of political correctness and ultra-bland
celebrities, Manheim is refreshingly candid, down-to-earth and
inspiring.
 &HT;    Inspiring is the word for the Disney television movie ``The
Loretta Claiborne Story,'' in which Manheim plays a social worker
who bonds with a young, troubled athlete who is partially blind,
mildly retarded and unable to walk properly. Despite those
handicaps, the young woman goes on to become a champion runner at
the Special Olympics.
 &HT;    ``I read the script and loved it,'' Manheim says
enthusiastically. ``Because we never see this subject matter on
television _ it's not glamorous, it's not glitzy, it's certainly
not `Melrose Place.' All the things I've been fighting for _ really
great female characters, great themes and telling really important
stories _ are all evident in the script.
 &HT;    ``That's why I did it _ it's a win/win situation.''
 &HT;    Manheim went straight from ``The Loretta Claiborne Story'' into
the role of a middle-aged ``Snow White'' for another television
movie that will be seen later this year.
 &HT;    ``That they offered me Snow White was such a huge, huge victory
for me,'' she says. ``I didn't even read the script before I
agreed. And I am so grateful to those producers for even thinking
of me in that fashion.''
 &HT;    Which brings us back to her book, because a big part of its
purpose, as with the show that preceded it, was to get people to
think about large people in different ways.
 &HT;    ``Actually,'' she says with a laugh, ``that was our fear in
marketing, that it would only appeal to fat women. But it wasn't
written just for fat women, and I hope that, somehow, that message
gets across and everybody reads it.
 &HT;    ``You could replace the word `fat' with anything,'' she says.
```Wake Up, I'm Short!' `Wake Up, I'm Gay!' `Wake Up, I Have
Learning Disability!' `Wake Up, I'm Too Thin!' `Wake Up, I'm
Tired!'''
 &HT;    She laughs.
 &HT;    ``Shut Up, You're Fat,'' she offers with a grin.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, Manheim is honest enough to admit that she might
not be so avid a supporter of overweight acceptance if she herself
had weighed less.
 &HT;    ``I leave the idea open that it might have been different, had I
been a skinny little beauty queen,'' she admits.
 &HT;    Currently single, Manheim does have one man in her life:
television maestro David E. Kelley, creator of ``The Practice,''
``Ally McBeal'' and ``Chicago Hope,'' among other shows.
 &HT;    Her audition for him, in pursuit of a role that later went to
another actress, is the stuff of television legend: Sensing that
things were going badly, Manheim challenged Kelley to a game of
chess. Her gameboard demeanour fascinated him, and he ended up
creating the part of Ellenor expressly for her.
 &HT;    ``I would like to think that it was my destiny to arrive here at
some point and make some kind of contribution to the fight for
acceptance,'' Manheim says proudly. ``David Kelley gave me the key
to that door.
 &HT;    ``It's mostly because of this man, who is so confident in
himself and in his intuition that he can embrace what is unique
about everybody and not try to make us all conform,'' she says.
``He's changed my life forever, in the best, most positive, most
glorious way, and for that I am eternally grateful.''
 &HT;    Not that she doesn't have one bone to pick with Kelley. If he
wants to make his Emmy-winning star happy, there's one small detail
left to be squared away: Manheim would like to see Ellenor get a
sane boyfriend.
 &HT;    ``Can't you write in?'' she pleads. ``Listen, tell all the
readers to write in to David Kelley and ask him to give Ellenor a
love interest for next season.
 &HT;    ``We all want it,'' she says confidently. ``You know you do! I
certainly do!''

   SAN ANTONIO _ Government scientists in Oklahoma and Texas were
looking for something to cure a deadly plant disease when they came
across compounds that could turn out to be the first new class of
antibiotics discovered in the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise discovery by scientists with the Department of
Agriculture is so new, in fact, that they are not yet saying
exactly what they found, because patents are pending.
</P>
<P>
   They also quickly add that it will be years before scientists
know whether the discovery will yield new weapons to battle human
infections.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases, who are in the forefront of the search for new
antibiotics, are excited about the findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a significant finding because we'd kind of considered
we'd already found pretty much what is out there,'' said Dr.
Marissa Miller, director of the institute's Office of Antimicrobial
Resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Antibiotic drugs like penicillin are used to treat bacterial
infections like streptococcus, staphylococcus and E. coli.
</P>
<P>
   But overuse of these drugs, coupled with the survival skills of
the germs, have resulted in bugs that can resist the effects of
different antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Drug-resistant infections now are a major public health concern,
said Dr. Jan Patterson, professor of medicine at the University of
Texas Health Science Center and medical director of infection
control at University Hospital in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of new antibiotics drugs lately, but they are
what we might call `me too' antibiotics because they're similar to
the antibiotics we've had before, and so they are not different
enough and bacteria can become resistant more quickly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bacteria can evolve very quickly,'' she said. ``They reproduce
billions of times in a day, so they have lots of opportunities for
evolving and becoming resistant. So the need is definitely there
for new classes of antibiotics.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir Alexander Fleming, the Scottish scientist credited with the
discovery of penicillin in 1928, made his finding when mold spores
blew into a bacteria culture he was growing in his laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   But before throwing away the contaminated sample, he looked at
it closely and noted that the spores were killing the bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   A similar twist of fate was at work in the latest discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Benny Bruton, a researcher at the Agricultural Research Service
Laboratory in Lane, Okla., and Bob Stipanovic, a chemist at the
USDA laboratory in College Station, Texas, actually were looking
for naturally occurring microbes to combat the deadly fungal
outbreaks that cause root rot in agricultural crops.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the compounds they tested did not work well against
fungi, Bruton said. But then they observed something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some of the tests we were doing, we noticed that it was
inhibiting growth,'' he said. ``So then it was just obvious to us
that we needed to take those compounds and do a critical evaluation
for antibiotic activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientists tested the compounds against several categories
of bacteria, including strains of staphylococcus and streptococcus.
Six of the compounds showed potential for killing the bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an accident,'' Bruton said. ``We had no preconceived
idea that it was an antibiotic.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruton noted that there are many forms of both staphylococcus
and streptococcus, and that he did not test the new compounds
against the specific bugs that cause disease in humans. His
laboratory is not equipped to handle human pathogens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because it worked on the species we tested, does that
mean it will work on all of the species? No, but it might,'' Bruton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stipanovic said the project was fun and worthwhile for the
scientists involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially if you can see it carry forward and do somebody
some good,'' he said. ``That's kind of your dream. You hope this
would provide a new source of antibiotics that would be effective
against some of these strains that are drug-resistant.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said researchers at her institute would be involved in
the next stage of testing to see if the compounds work against
known human pathogens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hopeful that we will be able to develop the compounds
for use in humans,'' she said, ``and that they will be safe and
effective. But that will be a fairly long process.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that new drug discoveries are just one step of a broad
effort now under way to battle drug-resistant infections.
</P>
<P>
   Better infection control, improved sanitation and research into
new therapies, such as vaccines, are among the approaches being
pursued.

   Valley of Life
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK _ It's really a shame that some
greedy, impatient greenhorns, having blundered into this place
while looking for a shortcut to California's gold fields, saddled
it with such a macabre name.
</P>
<P>
   It was 150 years ago this month that a member of the
Bennett-Arcan party, rescued after enduring weeks of miserable
privation on the floor of the dry-lake basin, christened it Death
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, if you tell people you're headed to Joshua Tree or
Anza-Borrego or some other spectacular desert locale in the West,
they'll often smile, nod and say, ``Beautiful country.'' But if you
tell them you're going to Death Valley, they're more likely to
scrunch up their noses and say, ``No thanks. Never been there. Not
in a hurry to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is a pity, because this vast national park on the
California-Nevada border boasts some incredible features: sand
dunes that undulate across the landscape for miles, a 1920s mansion
steeped in frontier lore, the lowest point of elevation in the
Western Hemisphere, curious rock formations that produce a mosaic
of subtle hues _ light lavender, gold, gray, salmon, mustard _ with
the changing sunlight, a volcanic crater nearly 500 feet deep ...
and water.
</P>
<P>
   Really. Lots of water. On the east side of the valley, it gushes
forth from Travertine Spring, filling two swimming pools and
irrigating an 18-hole golf course at the aptly named Furnace Creek
Inn and Ranch complex. It flows out of the ground in Grapevine
Canyon, nourishing Scotty's Castle, the mansion located there.
</P>
<P>
   It percolates from springs on the west side of the valley. One
of those water sources, in fact, sustained the exhausted men and
women and sick young children of the Bennett-Arcan group while two
ox-team drivers, William Lewis Manly and John Rogers, climbed out
of the valley to the west, wandered to the area of present-day
Saugus, and returned with provisions -- and an idea of how to get
out.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in an era of paved roads, vehicle air conditioners,
refrigerated transport _ and the Auto Club _ Death Valley is
infinitely more hospitable, despite the morbidity that pervades its
place names: Hells Gate, Funeral Mountains, Dante's View, Coffin
Peak, Starvation Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Late winter is an optimal time to visit. Temperatures in
January-February, for example, average 70 degrees in the daytime,
43 degrees at night although legions of European visitors seem to
prefer the depths of summer, so they can return home with tales of
a genuine Old West experience, the mercury having routinely hit 120
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   There are many remnants of Death Valley's colorful past,
including ruins of borax-mining operations from the late 1880s. At
Furnace Creek Ranch, a free museum chronicles this chapter of the
region's history, describing how the mineral was hauled 165 miles
to Mojave by 20-mule teams.
</P>
<P>
   Death Valley's relative isolation holds many urbanites at bay.
Once you've driven more than 180 miles north of Los Angeles on
Highway 395, you've got another 100 miles of winding road through
the Panamint Range to reach Furnace Creek, the park's social hub.
From another direction, the crawl up from I-15 at Baker is 131
miles. From Las Vegas to the east, the drive is 135 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Once you're on the valley floor, you'll find that exploration is
no less convenient. This national park is nearly the size of
Connecticut, and although most people don't bother with the dirt
roads that snake into its remote reaches, Death Valley's most
popular attractions still stretch over a substantial area. On a
trip here in mid-October, we put 980 miles on the odometer in four
days.
</P>
<P>
   So it's a good idea to allow plenty of time for your excursion.
There is so much to see and ponder, it's not a visit you'll want to
rush.
</P>
<P>
   In the northeast corner of the park is Scotty's Castle, which
stands as kind of an elaborate monument to con artistry.
</P>
<P>
   At about the turn of the century, Walter Scott, an adventurer
who would acquire the nickname Death Valley Scotty, borrowed two
Colorado gold nuggets from his wife and set about convincing
various urban businessmen that they came from his secret gold mine
in Death Valley. Investment money poured in, which he spent
lavishly.
</P>
<P>
   One investor, Albert Johnson, treasurer of a life insurance
company in Chicago, grew curious and paid a visit to Death Valley.
There was no mine to see (there never would be), but Johnson's
chronically poor health improved in the dry desert climate, and he
fell in love with the place.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, whose wife wasn't thrilled with life in a tent on their
frequent visits, bankrolled the construction of an elaborate,
Spanish-style vacation home in 1922 _ which Scotty promptly moved
into and passed off as his own (presumably built with gold-mine
revenues).
</P>
<P>
   Today, 50-minute tours of Scotty's Castle _ as it came to be
known are conducted throughout each day ($8 for adults). It is
fascinating to walk through the dark interiors, surveying heavy
redwood timbers, red tiles with inlaid images of desert creatures,
Shoshone and Paiute baskets. Guests used to gather by the fire in
the great room to be regaled by Scotty's tall tales, sometimes with
Johnson present, playing along.
</P>
<P>
   Park ranger Cecilia Mitchell, who led the tour while attired in
1930s garb, pointed to the wall that once featured an indoor
waterfall. She remarked on the steam-heat radiators, and the water
wheel that provided electricity for the house. Water flows from the
spring here at a prolific rate: 180 gallons a minute in the
castle's heyday, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think of the desert as this barren, lifeless, desolate
land,'' Mitchell said later. ``It's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this desert, despite averaging less than two inches of
rain annually, sustains life in many forms. After our visit to
Scotty's Castle, while proceeding south through the park, we
encountered a coyote in an area between Dry Bone Canyon and
Mesquite Flat. It had long since lost any fear of man, and appeared
as tame as a suburban pet as it approached to within a few feet.
The coyote licked its chops a couple of times. This suggested one
of two things: Either some idiot had tossed this creature a morsel
from a picnic basket ... or the coyote had come to acquire a taste
for tourists who appear debilitated by the heat and dryness of
Death Valley.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to move on. In the area of Stovepipe Wells, at about
the midpoint of the park, is one of Death Valley's most mesmerizing
attractions. It is a vast plain of sand dunes, the remnant of a
600-foot-deep lake that covered this desert floor in the
Pleistocene Epoch.
</P>
<P>
   A well-marked gravel road leads to a parking area at the dunes'
eastern edge. Most visitors seem to wade into the dunes 100 feet or
so, take a couple of pictures, and retreat to their cars. But this
fishhook-shaped expanse covers 14 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Bring along hiking boots and plenty of water. You'll find that
after even a short walk, human footprints disappear, replaced by
numerous tracks of birds, reptiles and rodents. The great mounds of
sand, randomly sculpted and precisely rippled by the wind, at times
seem otherworldly.
</P>
<P>
   There are many such natural wonders in Death Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Zabriskie Point is another. It lies just a few miles from
Furnace Creek, but to experience it at its best -- dawn -- you
might have to set an alarm. As the sun begins to peek over the
Funeral Mountains, the Panamints far across the valley are fired a
rich red. As the sun climbs higher, light plays on the rumpled
contours of the sandstone hills below the point, and shadows marble
the folds of the rock. It's a dramatic sight, but in winter be sure
to bring a coat.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south in the park is Artists Palette, reached by a
nine-mile, one-way road (RVs longer than 25 feet prohibited). Here,
oxidation in the clay of the ancient lake bed has created giant
splotches of color on a cliff face.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular stop is the Devils Golf Course, where striations
of salt and gravel from the former lake bottom, contorted into
crystallized ridges and turrets by the force of wind and rain, have
created some truly nasty lies.
</P>
<P>
   But the real tourist draw in Death Valley is a mean salt plain
with a sickly looking puddle. Badwater. The sign says the elevation
is -282 feet, and tourists clamor to get their pictures taken next
to it, but it is not to be believed. The lowest point in the
Western Hemisphere is actually a few miles farther out on the
plain, but this spot (279.8 feet below sea level) is as low as you
can go without having to stray too far from your car.
</P>
<P>
   Far up the rock face to the east is a white mark indicating sea
level; that's where the sand castles would be if Santa Monica Beach
could be magically moved here.
</P>
<P>
   It was not far from here directly across the salt flat, at the
base of Telescope Peak that Asahel Bennett and J.B. Arcan made camp
by a spring with their wives and four ill children. By then, their
only source of food was their slaughtered oxen.
</P>
<P>
   Days earlier, in the Nevada desert to the east, Manly wrote,
``The four children were crying for water, but there was not a drop
to give them ... The mothers were nearly crazy, for they expected
the children to choke with thirst and die in their arms.
</P>
<P>
   Their wagon train from the Midwest had reached Utah too late in
1849 when it would have been risky to try to beat winter to the
High Sierra passes. The wagon train guide wanted to lead the group
to Los Angeles, roughly along what is now I-15, then head north to
the gold fields.
</P>
<P>
   But rumors of a pass through the mountains to the west proved
too tantalizing, and a large group of travelers splintered off,
staggered across the Mojave Desert and wandered into this strange,
silent valley only to encounter the broad, towering range of the
Panamints as an unbroken obstacle blocking their path.
</P>
<P>
   The travelers split into various groups to try to pick their way
out, and although 14 members of this ill-fated wagon train detour
eventually perished, most had reached the mountains, passes and
desert to the west and southwest. Only one person died in Death
Valley itself.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it's impossible to breeze along Death Valley's smooth,
well- marked asphalt roads, carrying Arrowhead water on ice in the
trunk and a box of Wheat Thins on the console, and not think of
those unfortunate souls who had been in such a rush to get to the
gold diggings.
</P>
<P>
   Pull to the side of the road late in the evening, wander out
onto the desert floor, and listen. It's eerily still. Imagine a
rickety cart holding your belongings, dragged by an emaciated ox,
crunching over this craggy rock at a few miles a day, as you search
desperately for signs of a spring along the walls of this natural
caldron.
</P>
<P>
   Manly's account of his party's eventual exit seems almost too
eloquent to be anything but apocryphal. The travelers, he wrote,
trudged to a ridge in the Panamint Range, reaching it at dawn.
``Just as we were ready to leave ... we took off our hats, and then
overlooking the scene of so much trial, suffering and death, spoke
the thought uppermost, saying, 'Goodbye, Death Valley.' ``
</P>
<P>
   It was an unfair characterization, because the valley hadn't
been unduly harsh to them _ providing several sources of water, for
example. But it stuck.
</P>
<P>
   Misnamed then, misunderstood to this day, Death Valley never
could shake its grim reputation.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE: Furnace Creek, Death Valley's tourism hub, is
about 280 miles northeast of Los Angeles via I-5 and Highways 14,
395 and 190. On an approach from the south, it is 131 miles from
Baker via Highways 127 and 190.
</P>
<P>
   COSTS: The National Park entrance fee is $10 per vehicle, $5 for
a motorcycle or bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: Amfac Parks &AMP; Resorts operates three lodging options
inside the park. They are Furnace Creek Inn, (760) 786-2361;
Furnace Creek Ranch, (760) 786-2345; and Stovepipe Wells, (760)
786-2387. The park has nine campgrounds. Reservations: (800)
365-2267.
</P>
<P>
   DINING: The Furnace Creek Ranch dining establishments were found
to offer excellent service and hearty fare that seemed in keeping
with the rugged, desert setting. Dinner at the Wrangler Steakhouse
ranges from $18 to $25 (salad and side dishes included) and
features eight cuts of beef and pork (including an unusual
offering, pork mignon). The ribs are popular, but you might want to
scrape off some of the smothering sauce. Vegetarian items and a
salad bar are also available. The setting is fun featuring piped-in
music of 1950s TV western shows, also Gene Autry and the Sons of
the Pioneers. At the upscale Furnace Creek Inn dining room, main
courses on the a la carte menu range from $21 to $29.

 CREEK INN-DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK-LADN

<P>
   Soothing serenity of the Furnace Creek Inn
</P>
<P>
   By Eric Noland, Travel Editor
</P>
<P>
   DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK _ There are many stunning sights in
Death Valley, but they are also far-flung, such that a visitor can
quickly chew up an entire day with excursions to Ubehebe Crater,
Badwater, Dante's View, maybe even an off-road jaunt to Charcoal
Kilns or the Racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   A sightseer should not cram the schedule so full, however, that
simple relaxation is forsaken. Ample time should be allotted for
savoring the desert's invigorating winter warmth and contemplating
the region's kaleidoscope sunsets.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no lodging property is better configured to accommodate
these indulgences than the Furnace Creek Inn, which has been
pampering guests since it was constructed from river rocks and
adobe blocks 73 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is comfortably removed from the main Furnace Creek complex,
where a national park visitors center, gas station, store, golf
course and the Furnace Creek Ranch, the inn's modestly priced
sister property, cluster together.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred yards away, up a hill and tucked into a thick
grove of date palms and tamarisk trees, the Furnace Creek Inn
beckons weary travelers. In winter, room rates start at $230. For
that, you'll get peace, quiet, a room recently redecorated in
subtle hues ... and access to one of the most inviting swimming
pools in the West.
</P>
<P>
   It is fed continuously by sizzling Travertine Spring, and is
maintained at an exquisite 82 degrees. Because fresh water
circulates through here constantly (the runoff is used to water the
nearby Furnace Creek Golf Course), there is no need to put
chemicals into the pool.
</P>
<P>
   It is here, luxuriating in the waters, that guests can watch the
sun set behind the Panamint Range, observe a moonrise behind the
Amargosas, and soak up the reassuring stillness of the desert in
late afternoon and evening. The stone deck area features two
wood-burning fireplaces, which are stoked nightly this time of year
so that when you emerge from the pool, you can wrap yourself in a
terrycloth robe (provided by the resort) and position a lounge
chair near the open blaze _ nighttime temperatures in January and
February, after all, dip into the low 40s.
</P>
<P>
   If you're intrigued by the sights overhead, slip off to the
lobby, where a high-powered telescope is aimed heavenward.
</P>
<P>
   It's delightful just to walk leisurely around the inn's grounds.
The hotel is terraced into the side of a mountain, and it blends
easily with its surroundings _ perhaps because it was constructed
entirely from them.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Coast Borax Co., mining the ``white gold'' that
would spawn the romance of 20-mule teams and the 1950s TV show
``Death Valley Days'' (hosted by Ronald Reagan), constructed the
building in a Moorish style in the late 1920s, employing a Spanish
stonemason and Paiute and Shoshone adobe-brick craftsmen.
</P>
<P>
   It appears the workers plucked nearly every stone they found in
the Furnace Creek Wash. Rocks are mortared into place at every turn
in walls, walkways, arches, tunnels, planters, patios. They blend
well with grounds that were recently replanted by Pomona landscape
designer John Greenlee, who discarded the Rancho Mirage petunia-bed
look for an emphasis on native decorative grasses that change color
throughout the year, plus accents of such subtle plants as lantana
and verbena.
</P>
<P>
   The inn also underwent an interior redesign. ``We brought the
outside colors in,'' said manager Toni Doyle Jepson, who oversaw
replacement of furniture, carpet, drapes and bedspreads. ``We
replaced the pink and turquoise of the Southwest fad.''
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the Furnace Creek Inn has swapped its prior
Mission feel for more the sense of a romantic European hideaway.
Which is appropriate, really. It gets a crush of visitors from such
nations as Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland and
Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The European visitors are particularly fond of Death Valley in
summer, so much so that the inn, which used to close in summer, has
been operating year-round since 1996. ``They love the Old West, and
they do want to see the desert at its harshest,'' Jepson said. ``If
it's not 120 degrees, they're disappointed. They want to take their
picture next to the thermometer.''
</P>
<P>
   For families or travelers whose budget can't justify the inn's
luxury, the nearby Furnace Creek Ranch is a viable alternative. Its
rooms (starting at $94) are motel-like but clean and
well-maintained, and its grounds feature a spring-fed pool, a broad
greensward, playground apparatus, sand volleyball courts and close
proximity to the 18-hole golf course (greens fees $50).
</P>
<P>
   The ranch also features a coffee shop, the 49er Cafe, that
offers hearty breakfasts and lunches, and a restaurant, the
Wrangler Steakhouse, that serves a wide array of broiler items. The
service at both establishments was found to be unfailingly
efficient, and even thoughtful _ lunch at the cafe comes with a
generous pitcher of ice water (essential at 200 feet below sea
level).
</P>
<P>
   The ranch's downscale dining options, in fact, were found to be
preferable to those of the inn on a visit in October. The service
staff at the inn seemed overwhelmed _ and, perhaps as a result,
inattentive _ at both breakfast and dinner. Also, the inn's
adventuresome menu _ an odd hybrid of Southwest and Pacific Rim _
fell a bit short of its lofty aim on main courses, although its
salads were excellent.

   The pool at the Furnace Creek Inn is a natural draw for guests.
It is continuously fed by warm spring water. Its deck also provides
a commanding view of the Panamint Range to the west.

&HT;     ALBANY BRACES FOR BIG BUSINESS FROM DIALLO TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DANIELLE T. FURFARO  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The upcoming trial of four New York City police
officers accused of killing an unarmed man won't just bring
protesters to the state capital. It also will bring money.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses, including hotels, restaurants and car rental
agencies, expect to see a spike in customers when reporters,
lawyers and protesters converge on Albany at the end of the month
for the highly charged trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically, the city hopes that there will be few
protesters,'' said Anne Trimble, an owner and operator of La Serre,
an upscale restaurant downtown. ``But businesswise, it will be a
boost to the Albany economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection is scheduled to begin Jan. 31 in the trial of the
four police officers charged with killing Amadou Diallo, an unarmed
West African immigrant. The trial was moved to Albany after defense
attorneys argued that the officers could not get a fair trial in
the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, who are white, are accused of gunning down Diallo,
22, outside his Bronx home on Feb. 4, 1999, at about 12:40 a.m.
Diallo was struck by 19 of 41 shots fired at him.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as word got out the trial was headed here, the Albany
County Convention and Visitors Bureau compiled a packet promoting
hotels, restaurants and transportation services. The kit was
shipped to more than 30 media outlets in the New York City area and
other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communications people will require accommodations, catering
and computer uplinks,'' said Michele Vennard, president of the
Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   New York One, an all-news cable channel in New York City, plans
to send several reporters and technicians to Albany to cover the
trial. Peter Landis, news director for New York One, expects
employees to stay for the duration of the trial, which could last a
month or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be able to go live at a moment's notice,'' Landis
said. ``As long as we think that something will be happening, there
will be no lull in our coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to tell how many protesters will converge on
the city, but pre-trial protests in the Bronx, which drew
thousands, may be a good indicator.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a room may be tough. Some hotels are already booked for
much of February by people associated with the trial. State
lawmakers also have secured rooms for the annual legislative
session.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are booked for 15 of the days in February,'' said Marc
Leffman, general manager of the Albany Crowne Plaza, the hotel
closest to the Albany County Courthouse. ``All of the other hotels
will be feeling our overflow.''

   SCI-MOON-ILLUSION (Undated) _ One of the most familiar illusions
embraced by the human brain has finally been demystified, according

so-called moon illusion, the moon rising or setting over the
horizon appears much bigger than the moon directly overhead, even
though both moons are exactly the same size. By allowing viewers to
move simulated moons toward and away from each other, the
scientists demonstrated that the illusion seems to be caused by the
brain's inability to estimate huge distances in the empty night
sky. By Sandra Blakeslee. (800 words)

 &HT;    TRIAL BEGINS FOR ATLANTA PROFESSOR IN ``HOLOCAUST DENIER'' CASE
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON, Jr.
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ An American professor has a date in British court
Tuesday to defend her assertions that a controversial English
historian distorted history and acted as a ``Hitler partisan'' in
his campaign to discredit conventional beliefs about the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Lipstadt, a professor of modern Jewish and Holocaust
studies at Atlanta's Emory University, wrote about historian David
Irving in her 1994 book, ``Denying the Holocaust: The Growing
Assault on Truth and Memory.''
</P>
<P>
   In her book, Lipstadt portrays Irving as a prominent and
dangerous ``Holocaust denier,'' who campaigns to persuade the world
that the familiar story of the systematic murder of the Jews by the
Nazis is untrue. She also depicts him as an extremist who
manipulates, distorts and falsifies history for his own purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Irving rejects accusations that he denies the Holocaust took
place. Instead, Irving, who has described Anne Frank's diary as a
forgery, believes that the Nazi campaign targeted many civilians
and not just Jews and that the number of victims has been
exaggerated. He also rejects assertions that Nazis used poison gas
to kill Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which will be heard before a judge without a jury, is
expected to last three months. It is almost certain to stir deep
feelings about Europe's most painful memory. It also represents an
opportunity for mainstream historians to directly confront the
fringe effort to discredit accepted accounts of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Irving, who has written extensively on World War II and the key
characters of the Third Reich, has been widely vilified for
challenging commonly held beliefs that 6 million Jews died at the
hands of the Nazis. He also has asserted that Adolf Hitler knew
nothing of the Final Solution _ the Nazi plan to exterminate Jews _
until late in the war.
</P>
<P>
   German authorities have banned Irving because of his assertions
about the Holocaust. Many European countries, including France and
Germany, do not allow publications of material that denies
historical facts of the Holocaust. Britain has no such law.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Penguin Books on Monday denied the book
contained libelous statements and expressed regret that Irving has
chosen to air his complaint in court.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Forbes Watson, Penguin's managing director, said in a
statement that the company will defend itself vigorously. ``Penguin
has a history of upholding freedom of speech for itself and its
authors,'' Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   Irving on Monday said he has been unfairly attacked because he
doesn't accept conventional accounts of the Holocaust. He described
himself as a reputable historian who posits a reasonable reading of
documents and other data.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not denying the Holocaust,'' he said. ``They don't want me
to say 'This bit's true and this bit's phony' _ they say I have to
buy the whole package. If I don't, they say I'm a Holocaust
denier.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Lipstadt defamed him when she asserted that his writing
applauds the interment of Jews in concentration camps and that he
has intentionally manipulated historical records and data to
support conclusions that tend to exonerate Hitler. He said she also
damaged his reputation when she linked him to terrorist, neo-Nazi
and anti-Semitic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Irving seeks no specific amount in damages, but he has said he
would have settled for 500 pounds _ about $800 _ donated to a
charity.
</P>
<P>
   Irving spent much of Monday polishing his opening statement. He
said he will represent himself because he cannot afford an
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Under British law, Lipstadt and Penguin books bear the burden
proving that statements about Irving contained in the book are
true. The defense is led by prominent attorneys Richard Rampton and
Anthony Julius, the lawyer who handled Princess Diana's divorce and
the author of a book about the poet T.S. Eliot's anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt arrived in London over the weekend and is expected to
be present at the start of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Leading Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer, of Yad Vashem, the
Holocaust museum in Jerusalem, told The Guardian newspaper that the
trial represents an opportunity to attack assertions that the
Holocaust didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Bauer doesn't underestimate Irving as an
adversary. ``There is no doubt that he is an extremely intelligent
man, and he has read a huge number of documents, and this conscious
denial of the truth is something that he has in common with many
other deniers,'' he said.

so-called moon illusion, the moon rising or setting over the
horizon appears much bigger than the moon directly overhead, even
though both moons are exactly the same size. By allowing viewers to
move simulated moons toward and away from each other, the
scientists demonstrated that the illusion seems to be caused by the

IN MAINE, IT'S A MOUSE FACTORY

   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAR HARBOR, Maine _ Stargazer has never been normal. Visibly
scrawny from the age of 14 days, the mouse walks with a little
stagger and tumbles helplessly when immersed in water, unable to
right itself. Every few seconds, it tosses its head back and
freezes, staring into space.
</P>
<P>
   Deviant behavior, perhaps, but the mouse is not unwanted. Since
1979, when a caretaker fished the first stargazer out from among
half a million caged mice in Jackson Laboratory, government funds
and untold hours of human effort have gone into keeping 70
generations of his twitching descendants alive. Finally, a little
more than a year ago, the stargazer strain paid off: Using the
mouse, researchers pinpointed a mutated gene that could explain the
ancient human affliction of epileptic seizures.
</P>
<P>
   A small network of neurological researchers all over the country
is interested in stargazer mice, but researchers can buy the mice
only here, among the lobster rolls and summer cottages of Bar
Harbor. Jackson Laboratory supplies the world's largest variety of
mutant mice, which have eclipsed other lab animals as scientists
learned to snip out and swap their genes with those of humans. Last
year, 1.7 million mice _ representing $28.6 million in sales _ left
this ragged stretch of coastline in climate-controlled trucks,
headed south for labs where scientists had been waiting eagerly,
some for up to two years.
</P>
<P>
   Since the technology to substitute and block genes in mice was
perfected in the late 1980s, interest in mouse genetics has
exploded. Mice bred to suffer from human ailments have been crucial
to recent discoveries in the fields of aging, vision, cancer,
diabetes, and epilepsy research. According to a survey by the
National Association for Biological Research, scientists used about
17 million mice in 1998, and said they would be using 50 percent
more within the next five years. From a business standpoint,
Jackson Laboratory happened to be sitting on an oil well when it
burst.
</P>
<P>
   But the laboratory is not a business; it's a nonprofit research
facility commissioned by the National Institutes of Health to store
the mice that scientists make. Somewhere inside the lab's rows of
mouse rooms, or deep-frozen as embryos in vats of liquid nitrogen,
2,400 strains of mutants are being preserved _ morbidly obese mice,
painfully thin mice, mice with glaucoma and spina bifida, mice with
curly tails, mice that walk only in circles, mice with
abnormalities that have no known significance at all _ just in case
someone needs them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackson lab is a library,'' said Ralph Dell, director of the
Institute for Lab Animal Research at the National Academy of
Sciences. ``The popular books are on the first floor, and if you
want the rarer books, you might have to go into the basement and
rummage through and dust them off.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1929, long before this amazing roster of disease was
developed, the Jackson mice arrived here by train from Ann Arbor,
Mich. Their owner, a cancer researcher named Clarence Cook Little,
had retreated to Bar Harbor from a dissolving marriage and his
controversial presidency of the University of Michigan. Until 1933,
the network of scientists known as ``The Mouse Men of America'' had
always exchanged mice freely. But that year, with money so tight
that lab workers donated their salaries for mouse chow, Little
started selling them.
</P>
<P>
   One byproduct of Jackson's growing mouse factory were new
strains of mutant mice, who were fished out from squirming litters
by handlers and brought to a weekly clearinghouse called the
``deviant search.'' By mating the unusual mouse with littermates
carrying a recessive gene for the same trait, Jackson began
developing genetically pure mutant strains. Over the years, the
inventory expanded to include such lines as deaf waddler, claw paw,
flailer, twitcher, tight skin, grizzled, greasy and lurcher,
hammer-toe, waltzer, loop tail, vibrator, pirouette, stumbler, and
stargazer, along with 615 others.
</P>
<P>
   But the world changed in the late 1980s, when scientists learned
how to manufacture, and not just find, mutants. Since mouse DNA was
largely decoded, and is suprisingly similar to human DNA,
scientists could inject a human gene into a mouse embryo and see
what happens. The mouse boom was on. Dell recalls that in 1986,
when he took the helm of Columbia University's Institute for Lab
Animal Research, the university had 6,000 mice. By the time he left
11 years later, Columbia's labs were housing 50,000 of them. Now
there are 75,000.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers would like to see a dozen facilities throughout the
country, each with a million mice available, said Dell. Biotech
companies such as Charles River Laboratories and Taconic entered
the market, offering quicker turnaround for limited numbers of
popular mutant mice.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, though, many scientists working with rarer
mutants can look only to Bar Harbor, where breeders are struggling
to keep up with demand.
</P>
<P>
   James Heywood, who runs a Newton, Mass.-based foundation for
researching amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease,
has become frustrated with the wait for the particular mutant mouse
his lab requires, which is available only from Jackson. Heywood
established the foundation to help his ill brother. He said the
labs researching Lou Gehrig's disease have sometimes waited four or
five months for the right mice, setting back the research as much
as six months. To patients with a disease like his brother's, he
said, ``six months of delay is six months of disease.''
</P>
<P>
   With an eye toward easing the bottleneck, Jackson Laboratory
brought in businessman Warren Cook, a veteran of the ski industry,
to head up its retail efforts. Cook said Jackson is prepared to
supply only 20 percent of the orders it receives, and he hopes to
get that up to 80 percent. ``It's been a pretty product-driven
place,'' he said, ``and it needs to be customer-driven.'' Demand
for these mice is growing 20 percent a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the expansion, Jackson could edge out a local paper
manufacturer to become the largest single employer in Hancock
County, said Maine state Senator Jill Goldthwait, who lives in Bar
Harbor. Jackson is a huge economic boon to the area, where limping
fisheries have left many locals with low-paying seasonal work, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   To Muriel Davisson, a mouse geneticist at Jackson, stargazer's
recent success is a good example of the rare privilege that Jackson
can give its researchers: the time and space to take a chance on a
mutant. In 1979, Davisson was intrigued enough by stargazer's
strange pauses to include the line in her colony at the Mutant
Mouse Resource. Six years later, a visiting neurologist discovered
stargazer's brain waves were similar to those of humans with
petit-mal epileptic seizures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you get a mutant and you can't find anything wrong
with it, but you know that something is wrong, and you have a
choice'' whether to keep it or not, Davisson said. ``It just
happened we were hanging on to this one.''

<P>
   The streets of Green Bay, Wisconsin, grow noticeably quieter
whenever the hometown Packers play each Sunday. Few cities with NFL
franchises can match the fanaticism and loyalty of Green Bay's
Packers fans.
</P>
<P>
   Local sausage and beer sales can be gauged according to the
team's playing schedule. Monday morning sports pages are required
reading for many.
</P>
<P>
   During any given Football Sunday (and the occasional Monday
night game), visitors to this working class Midwest city can best
fit in by wearing Packer green and gold, steering clear of blocking
anyone's view of a TV set, and preparing for public mood swings
based on current game score.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Krueger is a Packers diehard. Like most fans, he regards the
team as ``his'' and regards Lambeau Field, where the Packers play,
as hallowed ground. Krueger becomes entirely caught up in the
on-field action. He can barely concentrate on days he has to work
before games.
</P>
<P>
   ``All day long all I thought about was the game tonight. I got
home, watched two hours of pre-game, (had) goose bumps, (I)
couldn't wait. I sat there in that chair and I could not wait for
the game to start,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   When his Packers are winning he's happy, when his Packers are
losing, he's blue.
</P>
<P>
   CONTEST-DEPENDENT
</P>
<P>
   How do human behavior experts explain such contest-dependent
mood swings?
</P>
<P>
   Paul Bernhardt, a doctoral candidate in the Educational
Psychology Department at The University of Utah, along with
co-authors James M. Dabbs and others at Georgia State University,
believes he has at least a partial answer. Bernhardt collected
testosterone samples of soccer and basketball fans viewing contests
both in person and on television.
</P>
<P>
   Bernhardt's testosterone study indicates a chemical connection
between fans and players.
</P>
<P>
   ``For fans of winning teams, testosterone increases, and for
fans of losing teams the testosterone dropped. These were not the
players, these were the fans. What we found is that for fans who
are not particularly committed to the teams, they do not have the
changes,'' Bernhardt reports. It did not matter whether the fans
were watching the contest live or on television.
</P>
<P>
   Testosterone in fans basking in a team's glory increased about
20 percent, and in losing fans decreased about 20 percent,
statistically significant numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Normally during the course of a day testosterone drops around 50
percent, from its highest level, in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   The research was prompted by public safety officials who wanted
to know the connection between testosterone and aggression.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies of such a phenomenon have shown athletes
themselves experience testosterone surges when they anticipate or
actually win a game. But Bernhardt's research is the first
documentation of fans experiencing the same changes in body and
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Says Bernhardt, ``What we are really studying here is the fans
have a personal connection to their teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Testosterone is the major male hormone that turns boys into men.
When it surges at puberty males grow body hair, deep voices, strong
muscles and bones, and a libido.
</P>
<P>
   PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS
</P>
<P>
   Endocrinologist Dr. Wayne Meikle at the University of Utah says
testosterone has psychological effects on the male as well. ``They
feel stronger, more confident, it increases their sexual interest
and also their sexual performance,'' says Meikle.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors will sometimes prescribe testosterone for weak, aging
men because the hormone improves bone and muscle strength and eases
depression. With supplemental testosterone, Meikle says, ``their
mood improves, some who may have been mildly depressed, that may be
corrected, their libido improves, [there's] an overall feeling of
well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers don't know what exactly in the brain and body
chemistry triggers testosterone change in sports fans and don't
know the degree to which these surges and declines affect behavior.
Cognitive and sociological factors, for instance, can account for
soccer mob violence and for the drop in individual demand for the
virility drug Viagra when World Cup soccer matches are played.
</P>
<P>
   What is known is that victory elicits a feeling of dominance in
players and fans. Aggression can be one outlet of the emotion
leading to outlandish, even violent behavior, win or lose. ``It is
not an outlandish speculation to think that the victory riots that
are sometimes seen after big national championships might not be
somewhat of a result of increases in testosterone ,'' Dr. Meikle
reports, ``that the testosterone is higher than the fans are
socialized to handle and they get out of control a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Testosterone is considered a male hormone but women do have the
hormone, about one-tenth of the amount found in men. But
researchers think highly motivated female sports fans experience
the same testosterone surges. Joe Krueger attests to this. ``You
should interview my mom. I guarantee my mom has tons of
testosterone when she watches football,'' he says.

   Hannah, 15 months old, has had recurring ear and sinus
infections _ eight infections in eight months. Four antibiotics
have failed to control the problem, which stems in part from the
colds her 5-year-old sister brings home from kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   A specialist recommended surgery to place tubes in her ears and
to remove her adenoids to relieve the congestion that fosters the
infections. Her parents sought a second opinion from another
specialist, who questioned the need for an adenoidectomy and said
it would be perfectly safe to wait before considering ear tube
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The second specialist noted that a new pneumococcal vaccine will
soon be licensed that will prevent up to 40 percent of childhood
ear infections. Meanwhile, the doctor said that any new ear
infections could be treated with antibiotics, although even this
treatment may be unnecessary, since four out of five ear infections
cure themselves.
</P>
<P>
   With ear infection the most common childhood infection after the
common cold, the quandary Hannah's parents face is widely shared.
Some 25 million doctor visits each year are prompted by infections
or fluid in children's ears.
</P>
<P>
   Should they have tubes surgically inserted to reduce the risk of
this pesky infection or should they treat each infection as it
occurs and wait for the child to outgrow the problem? Will waiting
compromise the child's ability to hear and acquire language or,
worse yet, interfere with learning and social skills? Will tubes
damage the child's ear drums or cause problems that might require
other operations?
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma has been worsened in recent years by the wide use of
day care, where young children most vulnerable to ear infections
are repeatedly exposed to upper respiratory infections. Although
the initial infection is commonly viral, the congestion it causes
permits bacteria to gain a foothold in the middle ear, especially
in small children whose ear canals are shorter and straighter than
an adult's.
</P>
<P>
   Antibiotics may cure the bacterial infection, but fluid commonly
remains trapped in the middle ear for weeks or months, impairing a
child's hearing and serving as a fertile field for future ear
infections.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, children with recurrent ear infections were often
placed on low-dose antibiotics for months as a preventive. As more
bacteria become resistant to antibiotics, however, this practice
has fallen into disfavor and is now used only in extreme cases.
Further, the use of antibiotics, decongestants and antihistamines
to clear out the residual fluid has proved worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Although ear tubes have been popular for about 30 years, the
long-term benefits and risks have not been clearly established.
Despite this uncertainty and amid cries that many of the operations
are unnecessary, use of ear tubes has long been the most common
operation performed on small children in this country.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1994 review of cases in which ear tubes were recommended
for 6,611 children under 16, the operation was deemed appropriate
for only 41 percent, according to objective criteria established by
experts. For 32 percent, the reasons given were considered
equivocal and for the rest, tubal surgery was considered
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   As with many other procedures, decisions must be based on less
than ideal information. To make a solid decision, parents must
consider the effects of the problem on the parents and other family
members, not just the affected child.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents say the infections disrupt family life and force
parents to lose work time. But a reassuring new study of 2,278
children ages 2 and 3, followed since they were 2 months old,
revealed no bad effects of ear infections on their behavior or any
increased stress between parent and child.
</P>
<P>
   The children, studied by a team headed by Dr. Jack L. Paradise
at the University of Pittsburgh medical school, are being followed
to determine what effect, if any, repeated ear infections and
persistent fluid in the middle ear may have on language skills,
ability to learn and social and emotional development.
</P>
<P>
   Previous reports of problems in these areas have been based on
studies with serious shortcomings that the researchers are trying
to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Paradise noted that the problem of ear infections was at its
worst between 6 months and 2 years and improved as the child got
older, as the ear canals lengthened. For most children, ``it's best
to ride out the storm,'' he said, adding: ``Middle ear disease has
been with us forever. It's part of being a child.''
</P>
<P>
   But clearly there are exceptions. Paradise, a conservative in
these matters, said inserting tubes to prevent an accumulation of
fluid might be the best approach when a child suffered one ear
infection after another, especially if the child was in day care,
if the parents both worked and if family life was being disrupted
by the infections.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts say ear tube surgery is indicated for a child with
middle ear disease (persistent fluid and infections) lasting more
than three months that has not responded to two courses of
antibiotics and that has resulted in a measured hearing loss in
both ears of more than 30 decibels or that has caused obvious
hearing loss in a toddler and a delay in language development.
Another indication for surgery is the development of what doctors
call retraction pockets in the eardrum.
</P>
<P>
   Ear tubes are inserted through a hole made in the eardrum, which
vibrates from sound waves. These vibrations are transmitted to the
hearing organ in the inner ear. Besides the known hazards of
anesthesia, ear tube surgery can sometimes result in permanent
damage to the eardrum.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of ear tubes are short-lived. They help only for as
long as they stay in place, during which time the child's ears
should be kept out of water. In most cases, the tubes fall out in
six to nine months and, if an infection recurs, they would have to
be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Tubes are not recommended for children who have only sporadic
infections. Paradise suggested as minimum three bouts of infections
in six months or four in a year. And most experts say that tubes
should not be used for a child who has fluid in the ears for
several months but no infections, unless, of course, the child's
hearing is seriously impaired.
</P>
<P>
   The pain of an ear infection, which can be excruciating, can be
relieved by giving the child acetaminophen or ibuprofen. But small
children should not be given aspirin, which raises the risk of a
potentially fatal disease called Reye's syndrome.

TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS OF A HIGH-FAT, HIGH-PROTEIN DIET 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(DW) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have eaten nearly 400 eggs since July. Scrambled, mostly. A
few over medium.
</P>
<P>
   At home, I fry them in a pool of butter or, better yet, bacon
grease. I add some cream while scrambling, a little cheese while
cooking. At a hotel or restaurant, I'll go with an omelette, thick
with sausage or cheddar (or both).
</P>
<P>
   I know it sounds gross. It is kind of gross. I've lost 28 pounds
so far.
</P>
<P>
   I started the low-carbohydrate (read: high protein, high fat)
diet on a whim this summer, two weeks after I quit Diet Coke cold
turkey, because everywhere I turned there seemed to be people
swearing they had lost weight effortlessly on the plan. Also, I was
fat.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I have always been fat, or, in polite parlance, overweight.
I have not always been particularly bothered by this, and, unlike
most of my fellow low-carbers, I have not spent my life failing at
other diets. In fact, I may have been the only adult American woman
who never dieted. So now there are none.
</P>
<P>
   There are a bunch of low-carb variations _ Atkins, the Zone,
Protein Power _ all of which rely on the notion that because
carbohydrates take longer to process, the body burns fat more
readily if there are no carbs around to distract it). I bought an
Atkins paperback for $6.99 and skimmed it, but I don't follow it
diligently; I tried Atkins products: the vitamin supplements, shake
mix and faux candy bars but found them both expensive and annoying.
</P>
<P>
   So now I just try to eat as few carbohydrates as possible
without letting the restrictions ruin my life.
</P>
<P>
   No bread, no pasta, no potatoes. Unlimited meat, chicken and
fish, best if slathered with mayonnaise. Green vegetables but no
squash, very little fruit but plenty of nuts. The ultimate irony is
Atkins says that added fat actually helps it work better; avocado,
whipped cream and bleu cheese dressing are your friends.
</P>
<P>
   What I do not do is count the 1 carbohydrate in the cream in my
decaf or however many may be in my Cobb salad. Being a single
twentysomething New Yorker who eats out or orders in most nights, I
do not stress out about sauces, even though they probably all
contain sugar and other no-nos.
</P>
<P>
   It's more funny than it is hard.
</P>
<P>
   In the cafeteria at work, I amble up to the deli counter and ask
for a chicken salad ``platter'' _ a breadless sandwich, down to the
pickles on the side. I order burgers without the bun, Caesar salad
with no croutons _ even, once, eggs Benedict on tomatoes. I
substitute spinach for mashed potatoes at restaurants all over town
and eat steak and lamb chops on weeknights. Sushi? Sashimi.
</P>
<P>
   There are embarrassing moments. Pulling pizza toppings off the
crust while on assignment on a college campus. Unrolling the wrap
to get the turkey out of the snack on airline flights. Nixing a
burrito joint on an evening out, only to have a friend announce to
an acquaintance of his whom we ran into later on the street that we
had switched restaurants because I am on the Atkins diet.
</P>
<P>
   Always, there is the question of whether to reveal.
</P>
<P>
   On a blind date with a vegetarian, I figured I'd just enjoy my
Greek salad, no explanation necessary. But then he suggested
skordalia, a double-whammy of pureed potatoes slathered on thick
bread! I cheated, then copped before the next date, at which I ate
guacamole with a fork _ no chips _ and ordered a protein
smorgasbord.
</P>
<P>
   At lunch with the secretary of education, I stacked up the
triangles of toast on the side of my plate and munched the insides
of the turkey sandwich. He was sympathetic _ turns out his son lost
60 pounds on the plan _ and later in the afternoon, he purposely
did not offer me a cookie, a gesture that I found sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Now I am announcing it to the world.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because you can eat, say, all the cheese you want, the
diet has been surprisingly smooth. When I have chosen to cheat, for
a special-occasion dessert or a scrumptious-seeming French fry, I
have found myself less than impressed by what I am missing. As for
treats, the frozen choco-butter I read about on the Internet
crossed my personal gross threshold, but I do occasionally indulge
in a special frozen yogurt with just seven grams of carbohydrates
per cup. The most yawning absence, surprisingly, is rice: Indian
and Chinese food are just not the same straight from the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Dieting is mostly a psychological game, I suppose, and for me,
starting by giving up Diet Coke laid a strong foundation. When I
crave a soda _ I used to slurp three or four a day _ I compare the
satisfaction of a sip with the depressing notion of being a person
who cannot quit Diet Coke. Then I refill my water bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Though Atkins and other low-carb gurus are bona fide doctors,
most of the medical establishment _ and my brother-in-law, a
biology major _ detests these diets, offering ominous warnings of
kidney failure, heart disease and other illnesses caused by the
lack of fruits and excess of fat. Others have more concrete
worries: assuming one is not willing to pass over pasta in
perpetuity, won't the pounds just come right back?
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'm not sure whether this is working because of the
counterintuitive, quasi-scientific theories the doctors argue
about, or whether it is because I don't nibble at the candy on my
neighbor's desk at work, snack in the afternoons or munch chips at
parties (I also have been exercising more). But my pants are baggy,
and people keep telling me how great I look.
</P>
<P>
   Only 20 pounds _ and who knows how many eggs _ to go.

STOUT DRINKERS AREN'T JUST SEEING THINGS

   (The Science Times)

 By HENRY FOUNTAIN 
  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may be less the unraveling of one of the great scientific
mysteries of our time and more just the answer to a bar bet, but
researchers in Australia have confirmed that some bubbles in a
glass of Guinness stout travel downward, apparently defying the
laws of nature.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has cried into a pint of Guinness at a pub may have
noticed the phenomenon: some bubbles against the inside of the
glass appear to move toward the bottom instead of floating to the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to determine whether this does, in fact, occur
(rather than being, as a scientist might put it, an artifact of the
drinking process), Clive Fletcher, a professor of computational
engineering at the University of New South Wales in Sydney,
Australia, and colleagues used software to simulate what happened
to draft stout in a glass.
</P>
<P>
   It was not just an idle exercise: Fletcher hoped to demonstrate
to Australia's own brewing and winemaking industries the benefits
that such a simulation program _ known as computational fluid
dynamics, or CFD, software _ could bring to their production
processes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for an appropriate illustration of this
technology that would appeal to everyone,'' Fletcher said. ``Most
people can relate to a glass of Guinness.''
</P>
<P>
   Using software from Fluent, a company based in Lebanon, N.H.,
the researchers ran many simulations over six or seven months,
altering various parameters, including the temperature of the
stout, the size and concentration of bubbles and even the shape of
the glass. Scientists at Guinness' research laboratory in Dublin
provided information about viscosity and other characteristics of
the brew.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what the Australian researchers found: Guinness in a
glass does not just sit there. Bubbles form on the bottom and start
to rise to the top, taking some liquid with them. Bubbles in the
center move faster than those on the outside, against the glass. So
more stout is brought up in the center.
</P>
<P>
   This liquid has to go somewhere. It moves toward the outside,
and then downward, replenishing what has been lost from the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   It is when the stout is moving downward that the phenomenon
occurs. Guinness is fairly viscous, as anyone familiar with its
distinctive creamy head knows. Larger bubbles can break free and
rise to the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a balance between liquid motion pulling bubbles down
and buoyancy pushing them up,'' Fletcher said. ``For big bubbles,
buoyancy wins.''
</P>
<P>
   For tiny bubbles, however, buoyancy loses. Bubbles smaller than
about one five-hundredth of an inch in diameter are inexorably
dragged to the bottom of the glass. Guinness drinkers, it turns
out, ARE seeing things.
</P>
<P>
   Such vital research probably would not have been possible even
five years ago. Advances in personal computers over that time have
made CFD software much more powerful, said Keith Hanna, a spokesman
for Fluent.
</P>
<P>
   The software ``allows you to simulate in a computer what you
could do by experiment, but a lot less expensively,'' Hanna said.
And by allowing parameters to be changed easily, ``it allows you to
ask the `what if' question,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The software has applications in many industries, including
aerospace, chemicals, electronics and automotive. Some motor racing
companies, for example, use it as a virtual wind tunnel (the
``fluid'' in this case being air) to design airfoils to increase
the downforce that keeps a race car glued to the road at high
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher is hoping his research catches the eye of Australian
brewers and winemakers, who, unlike their counterparts in some
parts of the world, still rely more on art than science to make
their products. In a fermentation tank, turbulence _ in other
words, unsteadiness of flow _ is very often a controlling factor
for the chemical reactions that occur. CFD software could be used
to aid in designing tanks and other elements, Fletcher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very powerful engineering technology available to
assist in controlling fermentation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Worthy goal, and one that no doubt inspired Fletcher and his
colleagues as they endured the rigors of scientific
experimentation, including the necessary field trials in local
pubs.
</P>
<P>
   Just how many of those did they conduct, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll leave that to your imagination,'' Fletcher said.

&HT;     HOW TO STORE FAMILY PHOTOS, DOCUMENTS FOR THE NEXT GENERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS  
 &HT;     c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Family history and memories are priceless.
</P>
<P>
   But so often, precious photographs, family records and mementos
get lost or succumb to wear and tear, and the elements.
</P>
<P>
   And videotapes or digital recordings and the like can offer a
false sense of security. Preservation experts warn that many of
these formats may be obsolete within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   According to Maria Holden, preservation administrator of the New
York State Archives, the safest place to store these items is dry,
cool and without dramatic fluctuations in temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid garages, attics, basements and exterior walls, Holden
stressed. ``These areas go through too many climate changes, from
cold to hot and humid. Too much humidity will cause mold or mildew
to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Dehumidifiers or fans help overcome seasonal changes, but a
bookcase or closet in the right location also works well. These
should be on an interior wall and away from direct sunlight.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   TIPS ON PRESERVING
</P>
<P>
   The ideal storage conditions for most photographs are
temperatures of 68 degrees and relative humidity in the range of 30
to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Insects and rodents are attracted to photographic materials,
according to the American Institute for Conservation of Historic
and Artistic Works in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Regularly dust or vacuum containers of photos stored in shelves,
boxes and cabinets. Avoid storing collection materials on the
floor, where they are more likely to be damaged by insects and
rodents or water leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Wood and wood products such as paper and cardboard often contain
acids that can cause extreme damage to books, photographs and metal
objects. Be sure to store your collection in acid-free,
archival-quality boxes and wrapping tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Torn documents should be stored in clear polyester folders.
Never use vinyl or acetate page protectors or self-adhesive pages,
because the plasticizers can leach out and emit acid as they age
and destroy the documents they should be protecting, Holden said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several sizes and types of polyester folders to
choose from,'' Holden explained. Avoid using pressure-sensitive
tape, glues, self-adhesive labels, paper clips or rubber bands to
contain photos or documents. Use an acid-free folder or box
instead. When labeling photographs, use a soft lead pencil, not
ink, and write lightly on the reverse side of the image.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   ALBUM DAMAGE
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Institute for Conservation, magnetic
or self-adhesive albums can be detrimental to photographs. Many
commercially available enclosures are labeled ``archival'' or
``acid-free,'' but some may still contain harmful additives. And
never use enclosures made from colored papers, unprocessed wood
pulp paper, glassine or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to house or store
photographs. Only use enclosure material labeled that it has passed
the Photographic Activity Test (PAT).
</P>
<P>
   Negatives can produce acidic gases as they age and therefore
should be placed in archival, buffered enclosures (which start at
approximately $21.95 for sheets of six strips, holding 36 frames)
and stored separately from other photographic materials, according
to the institute.
</P>
<P>
   Store negatives and photos in separate locations, so that in the
event of a catastrophe, you will still have a backup for your
family archives.
</P>
<P>
   Holden said that digital photos also are sensitive to moisture.
Droplets of water, even from a sneeze, will dissolve the ink. ``The
inks are water-soluble and not forgiving,'' Holden said.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic preservation is an ongoing process, because
technology is always changing. Even if you upgrade now, think about
doing it again in 10 to 20 years, conservation experts say. Make
sure you inspect archived materials at least once a year for any
signs of insect activity or mold growth.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   ARCHIVAL BOXES
</P>
<P>
   You can store just about anything in a box, which serves to
block out light, Holden said. However, cardboard boxes from the
grocery store or gift boxes won't do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always use custom-fitted, buffered (acid-free), paper-based
archival boxes, which come in a wide variety of flat and vertical
sizes,'' Holden said. Conservation suppliers carry the boxes (an
8-by-10-inch drop-front box costs approximately $8.95) and other
acid-free supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Holden recommended using acid-free folders before putting the
item in a box for two levels of protection.
</P>
<P>
   Vertical files offer easier retrieval for documents or newspaper
clippings. However, fragile papers or photos, especially maps and
works of art on paper, should always be stored flat, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   PRESERVING BOOKS
</P>
<P>
   Even books, from the family Bible to albums and rare first
editions, should be stored in an archival box. An acid-free box
with a drop front is ideal for books that you look at regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Books can be kept out on bookshelves, if you make the right
provisions,'' Holden said. Wood shelves should be sealed with a
polyurethane or use a polyester film, glass or Plexiglas to line
the shelf. Oversized books should always be stored flat on the
shelves to protect the spin from warping. Keep all books away from
direct sunlight and heat ducts, and free of dust and insects.
</P>
<P>
   Holden stressed that you should always wash your hands before
retrieving anything for viewing and wear clean white cotton gloves
when handling photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   SAVING VIDEOTAPES
</P>
<P>
   Videotapes, especially, must be kept clean, out of light and
away from strong magnetic fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is always changing,'' Holden said. ``So you may
want to think about having a master copy made of any important
videotapes. The VHS format is a problem because you can only play
them on a VCR.''
</P>
<P>
   When having a master copy made, use a higher-quality broadcast
format (as opposed to a consumer format) which can be transferred
as the technology changes, Holden said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have made an important VHS video, make a
broadcast-quality copy immediately,'' as well as a user copy, said
Sarah Stauderman, an audio visual media conservationist with Vidi
Pax in Manhattan. You won't be able to play this preservation
master on your VCR at home.
</P>
<P>
   Always label all of your tapes with information beyond a title
or the subject. This way you can decide whether the whole tape or
just part of it is worthy of the restoration or preservation cost,
starting at $95 per hour. Making the preservation copy usually
takes up to three hours, including cleaning the tape.
</P>
<P>
   Always buy good-quality tapes and mark them with the date of
purchase. The life span is shortened when tapes sit around unused,
Stauderman said.
</P>
<P>
   She also said videos should be stored away from magnetic fields,
such as the television and VCR, upright in their original
containers. Keep them away from smoke and out of damp or humid
areas.

PULLING SOFT WOOL OVER YOUR EYES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 16)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do advertising tricks _ those hidden persuasions of the huckster
class _ get your goat? If so, consider what has been done to the
Capra hircus, a hairy wild goat that likes to graze along the
mountainsides of the Himalayas.
</P>
<P>
   For generations until 1684, the maharajah of Kashmir had
exclusive rights to the underfur combed from the throat and belly
of this cold old goat. The maharajah's domain, a land that remains
in dispute even today between India and Pakistan, was spelled
``Kashmir,'' but the wool was spelled ``cashmere.''
</P>
<P>
   Though sometimes challenged by exotic fabrics like vicuna (who
now remembers what kind of coat Bernard Goldfine gave Sherman
Adams?), cashmere has long been known as the finest wool that money
can buy. That meant, of course, that it had to be topped by a wool
even more rare, available at a higher price, to warm the skin of
those late-arriving  &UR; arrivistes &LR;  who could learn to scorn the harsh
feel of the cashmere worn by the riffraff.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Shahtoosh &LR;  is a no-no; that ``king of wool'' comes from the
Tibetan antelope, an endangered species. Enter  &UR; pashmina &LR; ,
pronounced pash-MEE-nah, a new name to create the illusion of a new
goat with softer fur. The linguistic trick is to use the Persian
word for the mountain goat's fur and to ignore the name of the
place _ Kashmir, pronounced cashmere _ where the weaving into wool
is done.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pashm &LR;  is the Persian word for ``wool,'' or more specifically,
``soft wool from under the throat of sheep or goats.'' In 1880,
Mrs. A.G.F. Eliot James in ``Indian Industries'' wrote, ``The
 &UR; pashm &LR; , or shawl-wool, is a downy substance, growing next to the
skin and under the thick hair of those goats found in Thibet and in
the elevated lands north of the Himalayas.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years later, a British natural history magazine
explained, ``It is this  &UR; pashm &LR;  of the goat of these regions which
affords the materials for the celebrated Kashmir shawls.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pashmina &LR;  is the Persian word for ``woolen,'' with a feminine
ending. A couple of years ago, the  &UR; pashmina &LR;  push began. ``Finer
than cashmere,'' touted one catalog, ``extraordinarily soft, warm
and lightweight.'' Scarce; higher-priced; a gift even more eagerly
sought after by the uxorious luxurious.
</P>
<P>
   In The Wall Street Journal in November, Lauren Lipton shot it
down: ``Sit down, fashionistas:  &UR; Pashmina &LR; , this most hyped of
fabrics, is not a particularly premium kind of cashmere.'' She
quoted textile-science sources scoffing at the promotion and
cashmere industry sources saying: ``Cashmere is the hair of the
cashmere goat.  &UR; Pashmina  &LR; is the same goat.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pashmina &LR;  marketers were quick to bleat that cashmere fibers
were usually 15 microns thick while  &UR; pashmina &LR; 's were a few microns
thinner, and their product was woven on a warp of spun silk. You
can believe that if you're a Big Spender. A company calling itself
Nepal  &UR; Pashmina  &LR; Industry, in Katmandu, honestly begins its product
profile with `` &UR; pashmina &LR;  (better known as cashmere).''
</P>
<P>
   The source of the expression ``to pull the wool over one's
eyes'' is a mystery. It was first seen in a Jamestown (N.Y.)
Journal in 1839, at about the same time the term  &UR; OK &LR;  appeared:
``That lawyer has been trying to spread the wool over your eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The allusion seems to be to spread a blanket over the head to
obstruct one's figurative sight, similar to the origin of
 &UR; hoodwink &LR; ; other speculation goes as far as to suggest pulling a
person's hairpiece over his face. But no etymologist has yet come
up with the specific item made of wool, or fine goat's hair, on
which the expression is based.
</P>
<P>
   FIRE THAT WALL
</P>
<P>
   The hot new word in primary politics this season is  &UR; firewall &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, George W. Bush's chief strategist, told the Gannett
News Service that in 13 state contests after the New Hampshire
primary, ``virtually every one of those states presents the
possibility of a  &UR; firewall &LR; .'' (In a parody in The Weekly Standard,
Rove was shown to be conducting ``Operation  &UR; Firewall &LR; .'')
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past week,'' said Dan Schnur, John McCain's
communications director, ``you've started to see the Bush people
talk about Michigan as a  &UR; firewall &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   The word clearly has a Bush connotation. In a United Press
International dispatch in 1989 about the political genius of the
GOP's Lee Atwater, it was noted that ``what clinched the nomination
was a political  &UR; firewall &LR;  Atwater constructed with the pack of
Southern primaries on Super Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Birnbaum wrote in The Wall Street Journal just after
that 1988 campaign that Bush's strategy ``was to lock into place a
political  &UR; firewall &LR;  in the Midwest to prevent any late surge by
Democrat Michael Dukakis.''
</P>
<P>
   In political parlance, the word means ``an unassailable
political barrier; a front-running state campaign denying a
creditable showing to a challenger who must do well in that area
for his or her underdog campaign to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   The word is also used more generally. The Alliance for Worker
Retirement Security accused President Clinton of trying to ``break
the traditional  &UR; firewall &LR;  between Social Security and income
taxes.'' The Washington Post noted in 1987 that Reagan officials
said they were ``committed to nurturing the contras as a  &UR; firewall &LR; 
against communism.'' The word is stronger than  &UR; bulwark &LR;  and not as
rickety as  &UR; rampart &LR; ; it has replaced the earlier  &UR; seawall &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   In his 1951 Dictionary of Americanisms, Mitford Mathews cited a
1759 transaction of the Moravian Historical Society regarding the
proper way to build a house: ``the chimney and  &UR; firewall &LR;  shall be
made strictly according to the draft.''
</P>
<P>
   The wall built to prevent the spread of fire was extended
metaphorically to a barrier against anything harmful. More
recently, in computer lingo, a  &UR; firewall &LR;  is a security system set
up to protect a network from direct attack by hackers through the
Internet; in politics, it is now the preventive preferred by
strategists who, if the  &UR; firewall &LR;  fails, turn to  &UR; damage control &LR; .

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the weeks before Jan. 1, the number of calls to hot lines,
and their sense of foreboding, increased enough that some crisis
centers around the country increased their staffs and braced for
the possibility of a millennial surge in attempted suicides.
</P>
<P>
   The historic significance of this year's calendar change, for
some sufferers of depression, represented ``a definite line of
demarcation'' that seemed impossible to get past, according to
Reese Butler, director of the National Hope Line Network, a
nonprofit network of 19 crisis centers that is based in Vallejo,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Arlene Krohmal, executive director of CrisisLink in Arlington,
Va., reported receiving numerous telephone calls from people who
felt there was no point in going into the 2000s feeling as they
did.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Krohmal said she increased the size of her staff after
CrisisLink received twice as many calls in November as in the
previous November. The level remained high through December.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the year 2000 scare fizzled, the calls tapered off and
CrisisLink and other mental health centers found the holiday
uneventful. New Year's Eve was ``a pretty normal night,'' said
Marcia Epstein, director of the Headquarters Counseling Center in
Lawrence, Kan. Even before Jan. 1, she said, callers who mentioned
the arrival of the year 2000 seemed more concerned with surviving a
other emergencies than with killing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   New Year's Eve was also ho-hum for the Samaritans of New York, a
nonprofit group whose suicide prevention hot line had one of the
``slowest shifts we've had in quite some time,'' said the director,
Eileen Fitzmaurice. Crisis centers in Los Angeles, St. Louis and
Charleston, S.C., also reported no more calls than usual during New
Year's weekend and the first few days of January. The American
Association of Suicidology in Washington also had no immediate
reports of a rash of suicides.
</P>
<P>
   But a longer look at the turn to the 2000s may reveal that the
death rate was higher than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David P. Phillips, a sociologist known for his studies of
mortality rates surrounding symbolic occasions, has begun a study
of the year 2000's effect on all deaths, not just suicides. He
predicts a notable increase. One reason is that people seem to
postpone death, regardless of the cause, until after a birthday or
holiday, his previous studies have found.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is that deaths of all kinds tend to dip at the
end of the month and peak at the beginning, especially deaths
involving substance abuse. The pattern is especially strong for
December and January, said Phillips, a professor of sociology at
the University of California at San Diego. ``We know in general
this monthly cycle is sharpest for the December-January boundary
and it will be sharper, one can say confidently, for this
particular December-January boundary because there was more
drinking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the data needed to prove Phillips' theory is not expected
for years, and anecdotes from the front lines of mental health
centers were often contradictory.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, at least one depressed patient reported a feeling
of exhilaration while watching the New Year celebrations on
television, said Thomas Caffrey, a Manhattan psychologist. Caffrey
said the patient ``wept periodically as he watched, hour by hour,
and felt like for once, the human race was celebrating something
together.''

WALKING THE PATH TOWARD TOMORROW'S DREAMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is a labyrinth? On the surface it is nothing more than a
circular path marked out on a floor or perhaps the ground outdoors
lined with rocks.
</P>
<P>
   I walked on one on New Year's Eve, inside a darkened, candle-lit
room. People slowly moved in circles on the medieval-style
labyrinth and then lighted candles as they prayed for the future. I
joined them, not knowing why exactly.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, amid the clamor that usually marks the coming of the
new year, I was grasping for a quiet moment to reflect on what it
means to be on earth as we entered the momentous year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   People have been walking labyrinths, off and on, for centuries.
They are paths of prayer and meditation and also have been used as
symbolic pilgrimages to the Holy Land of Jesus' birth. But I was
skeptical, thinking, ``What can walking in circles get you?''
</P>
<P>
   But I was surprised. After taking off my shoes and joining
several others moving through the labyrinth for about 20 minutes
and then lighting a candle, I felt emotionally and spiritually
touched. It was an extraordinary moment for me.
</P>
<P>
   The labyrinth I walked was a winding path painted on lengths of
canvas laid on the floor of a large meeting room at University
Christian Church in Fort Worth. It was comparable to a prayer path
at Grace Episcopal Cathedral in San Francisco, which is patterned
after a labyrinth at Chartres Cathedral in France.
</P>
<P>
   We were told to take our time, to meditate, perhaps to say a
prayer or repeat a favorite Bible verse to ourselves. But there are
no rules.
</P>
<P>
   A gentleman carrying a shepherd's crook directed us onto the
clearly marked path. We moved constantly down the narrow path. The
movement, I'm told, keeps your mind focused and adds to the
spiritual experience. We approached the center at times. But then
the path changed, and we moved again to the outer limits of the
circle.
</P>
<P>
   The center of the labyrinth represented the presence of God for
many of us. But that's not true for everybody. There are many
twists and turns, just like in life. When the path did finally lead
us to the center, many of us stood there for several moments, as if
to drink in a divine presence.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Scott Colglazier, senior minister, said the labyrinth
at his church was one effort to offer a spiritual and meditative
way of entering the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Colglazier also walked the labyrinth and said he also had an
unexpected spiritual response to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I found it interesting,'' he said. ``But toward the
end I felt all these emotional feelings of grief welling up inside.
I think ministers, because of what they do, carry a lot of pent-up
grief.''
</P>
<P>
   Colglazier received national media attention when he called on
fellow pastors nationwide to join him in preaching about peace
during the first sabbath of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great response. I didn't take a count on how many
preached on peace, but there were quite a few,'' he said this week.
Stories of his peace effort ran in many papers, he said, including
the ``Philadelphia Inquirer'' and ``The New York Times.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own sermon on the first Sunday of the new year, titled
``Peace: The Everlasting Pause for a New Millennium,'' Colglazier
noted that the 20th century was one of the most violent in history,
and he called for all people of good will to promote peace in the
new century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace is locked in the golden box of every human heart _ your
heart and my heart,'' he said. ``And peace will only happen when we
... plant it in the world. That's what will make for a new heaven
and a new earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Colglazier said he was inspired to suggest the peace sermons
after he and other members of the Fort Worth Millennium Celebration
committee decided to have a ``pause of peace'' during the
community-wide New Year celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every effort for peace initially feels like a drop in the
bucket,'' Colglazier said. ``But that is how we fill the bucket _
one drop at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   As I walked the labyrinth last week, I, too, dared to dream of
peace.
</P>
<P>
   I hoped the next 100 years would be better than the last. I
hoped there would be less bigotry and hatred and no repeats of the
Holocaust, nuclear blasts and bloody world wars. Maybe I'm just
dreaming. But it's a good dream.

`A VAST CONSPIRACY': GOING OVER CLINTON'S ENEMIES LIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A Vast Conspiracy,'' the title of Jeffrey Toobin's new book
about the sex scandal that led to President Clinton's impeachment,
comes of course from Hillary Clinton's accusation that a ``vast
right-wing conspiracy'' had been working ``against my husband since
the day he announced for president.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Toobin says he believes that Mrs. Clinton's remarks
were delivered before she learned the truth of her husband's
involvement with Monica Lewinsky, and although her remarks also
reflect the self-pitying, go-on-the-attack stance routinely assumed
by the administration whenever it has been under fire, Toobin comes
to the conclusion that ``there was indeed a `vast right-wing
conspiracy' to get the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Toobin's highly partisan book does a dexterous job of showing
how Kenneth Starr's office bungled its investigation of Clinton
through a combination of zealotry, infighting and ineptitude; this
portion of the book was recently excerpted in The New Yorker. But
the book consistently plays down the role that the president
himself played in triggering and sustaining the ordeal the country
went through for so many months.
</P>
<P>
   Toobin makes the dubious assertion that not only the Paula Jones
case but the Whitewater investigation as well exist ``only because
of the efforts of Clinton's right-wing political enemies.'' He goes
on to argue that scarcely ``a single prominent Democrat or Clinton
supporter'' was ``convinced by the evidence to change sides,''
never mind that longtime Clinton allies like Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman and the president's former aide George Stephanopoulos,
among many others, harshly criticized Clinton's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas the legal expertise of Toobin _ a former assistant U.S.
attorney and an associate counsel in the office of the independent
counsel Lawrence E. Walsh _ helped him present a powerfully argued
assessment of the O.J. Simpson case in his last book, ``The Run of
His Life'' (1996), the narrowly legalistic approach here often
results in a tin ear when it comes to the subjects of politics and
governance.
</P>
<P>
   Although one of the themes of this book is what Toobin calls
``the legal system's takeover of the political system'' _ meaning
the growing efforts on the part of liberal, and more recently
right-wing, activists to use the courts to target and change laws _
he tends to look at the actions of Clinton and his associates
strictly in terms of criminal law.
</P>
<P>
   He writes that no one could say ``with the specificity required
for a criminal case, what Bill and Hillary Clinton had done wrong''
in terms of Whitewater, that scarcely anyone could ``articulate any
criminal offense the president might have committed'' with
``Filegate'' or the campaign finance scandal, and that Clinton's
conduct in the Monica Lewinsky case was ``shabby, but not
illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments suggest that elected officials need not
especially worry about ethical conflicts, compromising financial
entanglements or reckless behavior as long as they have not
committed an actual crime. Toobin reaches the conclusion that the
whole impeachment crisis ``was never anything more than it appeared
to be _ that of a humiliated middle-aged husband who lied when he
was caught having an affair with a young woman.''
</P>
<P>
   By focusing on sex, not the president's lies under oath, this
assessment ignores Clinton's failure in his constitutional duty to
uphold the rule of law; in the words of Judge Susan Webber Wright
(who presided over the Paula Jones case), he deliberately
``undermined the integrity of the judicial system.'' It ignores his
lies not only to his family, but also to his staff, to members of
Congress and to the American public, his using others to lie for
him while imperiling the political agenda he was elected to help
implement.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, Toobin blames the media and the legal system,
not Clinton's stonewalling, for creating a new set of victims:
``the witnesses who had to hire lawyers, the targets who had to
live in fear, the investigating agents who had to turn away from
more important work and the public that was distracted from the
real business of government and, of course, had to pay the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   While Toobin observes that Clinton dealt with the crisis ``not
with candor and grace, but rather with the dishonesty and self-pity
that are among the touchstones of his character,'' he consistently
portrays the president as a victim of ``extremists of the political
right who tried to use the legal system to undo elections _ in
particular the two that put Bill Clinton in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Toobin spends the better part of this book railing against
Clinton's adversaries, whom he says ``appeared literally consumed
with hatred for him.'' ``They were willing to trample all standards
of fairness _ not to mention the Constitution _ in their effort to
drive him from office,'' he says. ``They ranged from one-case-only
zealots in the cause of fighting sexual harassment to
one-defendant-only federal prosecutors, and they shared only a
willingness to misuse the law and the courts in their effort to
destroy Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   In the course of this book we are given cutting portraits of
people like Cliff Jackson, the longtime Clinton nemesis who leaked
reports about the president's draft record, and Randall Terry, the
founder of the antiabortion group Operation Rescue. The reporter
Michael Isikoff, who is described as Newsweek's ``in-house expert
on Clinton's sex life,'' is lumped in with these enemies and is
taken to task for writing a book about the scandal. As for Kenneth
Starr, he is characterized as ``Babbitt with a badge,'' his
investigative team as having ``an obsession with meaningless
atmospherics'' and ``a predilection for canine zeal over solid
prosecutorial judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Toobin persuasively argues that Starr's decision not to give
Monica Lewinsky immunity in February 1998, as two of his more
levelheaded prosecutors recommended, helped ensure the president's
survival. By the time the deal was finally made 176 days later,
Toobin writes, ``the political and legal terrain had been
transformed since those frenzied first days of the scandal''; the
delay of nearly half a year ``had allowed the country to come to
terms with the fact that the president probably had had the affair
with the intern _ but that he had managed to do a pretty good job
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet compelling as Toobin's account of Starr's botched
investigation may be, it is undermined by contradictions and
perplexing assertions. On one page Toobin writes that the
prosecutor ``was a consummate Washington careerist who navigated
the capital more by self-interest than by ideology''; two pages
later he writes that Starr ``was a committed political conservative
who stood outspokenly opposed to Clinton on virtually every
controversial issue of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   In one passage Toobin comes down hard on the book agent Lucianne
Goldberg for reflecting ``the new face on American politics _
personal, petty, and mean.'' In the same paragraph he indulges in
some petty meanness himself, cattily describing Ms. Goldberg as
emerging ``from a virtual space somewhere between the Republican
National Convention and the bar scene in `Star Wars,''' like Norma
Desmond in ``Sunset Boulevard,'' ``her heart full of murder and
longing.''
</P>
<P>
   The most telling description in this willfully subjective book,
however, is attached to Clinton who, in comparison with his
adversaries, Toobin writes, emerges as ``the good guy in this
struggle,'' a dubious assessment of the chief protagonist in a saga
decidedly bereft of heroes.

SHRINKING IGUANAS  
 DANGER FROM ALGAE 
</HEADLINE>
   El NINO'S STAR LINK  
 (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not that the marine iguanas of the Galapagos Islands are
cheap, exactly _ but they do shrink in the rain.
</P>
<P>
   That's the finding of two long-term studies of the lizards on
two islands in the Galapagos chain, off Ecuador. The study, by a
researcher from the University of Illinois and a colleague from
Germany, found that some iguanas shrank by as much as two and a
half inches, or about 20 percent of their body length, over two
years.
</P>
<P>
   That period coincided with El Nino events, when rainfall
increased and food for the lizards, which forage for algae along
the islands' rocky shores, was in short supply. The researchers
found that iguanas that shrank more (as a percentage of length)
survived longer than other iguanas during these lean times because
they used less energy and their foraging was more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Since cartilage and connective tissue make up only about 10
percent of the total body length in these creatures, the shrinking
can't be explained by decreases in these tissues alone.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who reported on their work in the journal
Nature, believe that some bone is absorbed as well, and that
steroids produced as a result of stress may be at least partly to
blame, much the way astronauts' bones shorten slightly during long
space trips.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike humans (and any other adult vertebrates, as far as is
known), the iguanas can lengthen once again when food availability
improves and can switch between long and short repeatedly during
their lifetimes.
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   Algae of a different sort played a much more draconian role
among the sea life off California's central coast, according to
researchers from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute and
other institutions. They have connected the deaths of more than 400
sea lions in 1998 to an algal bloom that produced a powerful
neurotoxin.
</P>
<P>
   Mussels are often monitored during blooms for signs that the
algae may be producing compounds that can be harmful to marine life
or even humans. At the time of the 1998 bloom, however, no evidence
of the neurotoxin, domoic acid, was found in blue mussels from
Monterey Bay.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, high levels of the acid were found in bay
anchovies. And, scientists report, high levels were also found in
the urine and feces of surviving sea lions.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors exhibited many symptoms of neurological damage,
including seizures, head weaving and abnormal scratching. So it was
not surprising, perhaps, that domoic acid produced by the algae was
found to be the cause. But the Monterey Bay research, reported in
Nature, is the first to conclusively link sea lion deaths to a
harmful algal bloom.
</P>
<P>
   The means by which the animals were poisoned was conclusively
determined as well: eating the anchovies. That, plus the finding
that mussels were unaffected, called into question the
effectiveness of monitoring mussel toxicity alone during such
blooms.
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   In the Andes of Peru and Bolivia, many farmers follow an old
practice for determining when to plant their potato crops. They
watch the stars of the Pleiades constellation in June, and the
brighter the stars appear, the more rain they forecast for the
growing season, October to May. If the stars are less bright and
little rain is predicted, the farmers put off planting their
drought-sensitive crop for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, using weather data and satellite imagery, two American
researchers suggest why this centuries-old method works. The
visibility of the stars, the researchers report in Nature, appears
to be an indicator of variability in the El Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   In an El Nino event, the researchers say, high, wispy cirrus
clouds become more abundant. These clouds are probably what makes
the Pleiades appear less bright. So the dimmer stars foretell El
Nino, when there will be less rain than normal in the Andes, and
the rainy season will be delayed.

&HT;     VOLUNTEERS BOLSTER SEARCH FOR MISSING CALIFORNIA GIRL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   VALLEJO, Calif. _ Nearly 800 volunteers joined the police over
the weekend in searching for possible clues in the disappearance of
a 7-year-old girl in this Northern California city.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers hunting for Xiana Fairchild, who was last seen since
Dec. 9 as she walked to a school bus stop, found about 300 items,
mostly clothing, said Lt. JoAnn West of the Vallejo police.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have found pieces of clothing or something that seems
suspicious to them,`` West said.
</P>
<P>
   There were so many volunteers that many were turned away,
organizers said. Many people had to wait two or more hours just to
register for the search because the Vallejo police and FBI asked
that each person be photographed and fingerprinted. Then they drove
to a downtown parking lot to be briefed on search tips and receive
a map with a specific area highlighted.
</P>
<P>
   West said that it was not uncommon for law enforcement officials
to take such steps in a massive public search so they can rule out
volunteers' fingerprints if found on a piece of evidence, or to
locate a participant later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have waited all afternoon to be a part of this and to
give the community and the family some peace of mind that she is
not here,`` said Diane Probasso, who lives in Vallejo.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers checked garbage cans and portable toilets, and looked
under piles of leaves and through knotholes in fences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a granddaughter who's two days younger than Xiana,
whose parents had problems with drugs and were unable to care for
her, so I relate very much to her situation,`` Probasso said.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Carson, a 51-year-old Solano County clerical worker, said
she, too, had to participate because her sister had been kidnapped
and sexually assaulted in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister was 6 years old when she was kidnapped on her way to
school up in Eureka,`` Carson said between stops along a
residential street where she was searching.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky that he spared her life and dropped her off back
at the school ... but I know how helpless you feel and so I just
wanted to do something,`` Carson said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect who assaulted her sister was later convicted and
jailed, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the search does not yield any evidence, Probasso said,
the efforts of so many volunteers were not in vain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we made everyone a little bit more aware today, and I
think some people may have been a little ambivalent because it has
been going on for so long and it has been so confusing,`` she said
as she wrapped up her hour-long search of Federal Terrace Park. ``I
think this kind of effort brings it back into the spotlight for
them.``
</P>
<P>
   Xiana's great-grandmother, grandmother and an aunt joined the
search but her mother, Antoinette Robinson, and Robinson's
boyfriend, Robert Turnbough, did not.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson and Turnbough have come under increasing scrutiny after
telling the police conflicting stories about Xiana's disappearance,
Lt. West said.
</P>
<P>
   West, however, would not say whether they were among those
subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury investigating the
case in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Robinson nor Turnbough returned calls seeking comment.

GROWING PAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 (Eds: Question may be italicized)  
 (af)  
 By C. CLAIBORNE RAY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My 4-year-old occasionally complains of excruciating but
ill-defined nighttime pains in his calves and shins. Friends say
they recall similar pains, which used to be called growing pains.
What are they? What helps?
</P>
<P>
   A. The description fits what doctors still call growing pains,
or benign limb pains of childhood. The suffering is real, though
the source is still not understood.
</P>
<P>
   Most pediatricians do not believe growing pains are actually
related to the child's growth. For one thing, the location is
ill-defined, not specifically at the limbs' growth plates, and for
another, the pains occur mostly in the age group from 4 to 12,
while the periods of most rapid growth are usually earlier or
later.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent of healthy children get growing pains, usually
at night and usually in the legs. They are somewhat more common in
girls than in boys. Once other possible causes, like injury or
inflammatory disease, have been ruled out, such pains are diagnosed
as growing pains.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the use of gentle massage, warm towels and perhaps
acetaminophen or ibuprofen is all that is needed to let the child
go back to sleep. The pains have no lasting consequences, and some
children the next morning do not even remember being awakened by
the pains. &QL;

30-YEAR MISSION BRINGS CLOSURE TO PHOENIX SOLDIER'S FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVE WALKER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
PHOENIX - The helicopter gunship,
<TEXT>
<P>
   hit by furious fire, went down hard in the Laotian jungle with
four soldiers aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Eyewitness accounts varied, but someone, somewhere, saw two men
run from the wreck toward the tree line.
</P>
<P>
   From that day in the height of the Vietnam War, and for nearly
three decades after, a Phoenix family clung to the slim hope that
one of those men might be Jon Eric Reid, 22. That's what Army
reports had led them to believe, and if anyone could survive,
surely it would be Jon.
</P>
<P>
   But in October 1999, Army investigators concluded that Reid and
his co-pilot, David May, died in the crash. The fate of the other
two men aboard the UH-1C ``Huey'' gunship, crew chief Randolph
Johnson and door gunner Robert Acalotto, isn't known.
</P>
<P>
   The remains of Reid and May will be buried Jan. 14 at Arlington
National Cemetery in Virginia. Some of Reid's Army buddies will be
there, as will his brother and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Missing will be that glimmer of hope they held through all these
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was totally not prepared for that,'' said Reid's sister,
Roxena, recalling the day Jon's death was verified.
</P>
<P>
   ``My belief was that he had survived the crash and he had
escaped. It took me a day or two to really quit crying and come to
grips with the facts as they were, and to be grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day he died, Feb. 20, 1971, Reid's crew and others with
the Army's 48th Assault Helicopter Company were flying an emergency
resupply mission over Savannakhet Province, Laos. The Air Cavalry's
larger mission was providing air support for Lam Son 719, a massive
invasion of Laos by the South Vietnamese army.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a mixed-up mess in Laos,'' said Terrell Peterman,
who also flew with the 48th. ``We were doing things that shouldn't
have been done in a helicopter. I still ponder on what it was all
about. It was too dangerous for the kind of aircraft we had.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do what you're told to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Reid's helicopter went down, enemy fire prevented a rescue
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard day,'' Peterman said. ``We couldn't get 'em out.
We couldn't get into 'em. It was too hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterman and Reid had graduated from helicopter flight school
together and were roommates on bases in Texas and Alabama. To
Peterman, Reid was Jake; to Reid, Peterman was Ernie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake was a unique character, an original,'' Peterman said.
``Unless you've been there, you can't imagine how close you get to
these people. I've never been as close to anybody. He was pretty
much like a brother to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in bed when the doorbell rang,'' said Jon Reid's little
brother, Mike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, my mother started screaming. I was 13 and sort of didn't
know what to do. I knew what it was without hearing what it was. I
think I hid under a pillow.''
</P>
<P>
   Audrey, Jon's mother, was distraught beyond words, so his dad,
Bill, called Jon's two sisters. Roxena was in Colorado and Karen
was in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   For Roxena, Bill couched the news in hopeful language.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really kind of minimized it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, and for most of the next 30 years, the Reids
clung to the reports of two men running from the Huey.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the crash ``had a profound effect on our family,'' Roxena
said, calling it ``an open wound that never could heal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reids had moved from Virginia to the Arcadia section of
Phoenix in 1959. Bill built custom homes back East, where their
life had mirrored ``the television '50s family,'' Mike said. In
Phoenix, things didn't go so well.
</P>
<P>
   Bill, a former World War II fighter pilot, tried his hand at
local real estate but eventually returned to airplanes, dousing
forest fires and bugs. Bill even flew a plane for the movie
``Catch-22,'' shot in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The kids remember friction over finances between Bill and
Audrey, who eventually started her own interior decorating business
to help make ends meet. The family endured with wry, nothing-sacred
humor.
</P>
<P>
   Jon was an active Boy Scout who loved hunting and camping. When
tubing the Salt River, he would climb the highest rocks to launch
the most dramatic dives.
</P>
<P>
   He was careful with money, though, and washed dishes at the Tee
Pee Tap Room, a neighborhood spot the family patronized often. He
bought an old Ford Ranchero, which he called the Blue Goose.
</P>
<P>
   Jon's nickname for Mike was Little Beaver. Karen was KK. Roxena
was Fancy. Their mother, for reasons now unclear, was Newt.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, Jon often butted heads with his dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``There had been some major brouhahas over how you should act as
a teenager,'' Mike recalled. Looking back, it wasn't anything
serious: late hours, partying, a lax attitude about school.
</P>
<P>
   Jon knocked around for a while after his years at Arcadia High
School, moving to Los Angeles to work in a bakery, then Colorado to
work on a ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Mike visited Jon at the ranch, where conditions were rugged. He
remembers Jon blasting rodents with a .22 pistol.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a bit of a temper at times,'' Mike said. ``He was kind
of a solitary soul, too. He wasn't one for big crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a strong character. He did not take anything from
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, Jon got a low draft number and enlisted instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to fly,'' Roxena said.
</P>
<P>
   Jon did well in helicopter school, and he did well by his dad,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reconciliation came when Jon began flying,'' Roxena said.
``Suddenly, there was a language the two could talk.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bill got a nickname _ Whiskey Papa Romeo, pilot radio code
for his initials.
</P>
<P>
   In early summer 1970, just before shipping out to Vietnam, Jon
accompanied Mike on a church-sponsored float trip down the Grand
Canyon. Jon took along a bottle of Southern Comfort. At the end of
the float, Jon and Mike hiked out of the Canyon, their gear stuffed
into Jon's Army duffel. Mike got his first sip of Southern Comfort
that day.
</P>
<P>
   Jon wasn't especially reflective or contemplative during the
trip, Mike said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody that age, even if you're going to war,
believes that anything can happen to them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Roxena drove Jon from her home in Fort Collins
to Denver, from where he flew to San Francisco, then to Southeast
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talked non-stop the whole way about what he wanted to do
when he got out,'' she said. His dream was to be a hunting guide,
maybe run an outfitting business.
</P>
<P>
   In his first letters home from Vietnam, Jon wrote about card
games, joked about the water (``it makes cloudy ice cubes''),
dropped hints about ``the Far East cookie shortage'' and detailed
some of the small aggravations of Army life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake liked to have fun,'' Peterman said. ``But he was serious
about what he was doing. As unpopular as that war was, he believed
in what we were there for.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Peterman said, ``he was one of the finest helicopter pilots
I've ever been around.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his letters home regularly reported the number of hours
he was flying, Reid seldom mentioned combat. When he did, it often
was in the form of a joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're surrounded by Indians, but Gen. Custer gave us officers
a briefing and assured us that everything was okey-dokey,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Living conditions for Peterman, Reid and the other pilots of the
48th were typically lousy.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``Vietnam wasn't all bad. We'd go to the officer's
club, proceed to get drunk. That was the recreation there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes recreation could be as informal as sharing a bottle of
Chivas Regal in your hootch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd break the cap and pass it around until it was gone,''
Peterman said. ``That was a night at Dong Ha.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid often talked about his family at such times, about taking
his little brother out shooting in the desert in the Blue Goose,
Peterman said.
</P>
<P>
   In one letter to Mike, Jon warned about drugs. In another, he
wrote, ``Don't flip out on a bummer and lose your cool. Hang loose
and don't sweat your brother's longevity, 'cause these clowns don't
even have Kryptonite bullets.''
</P>
<P>
   The gunships of the 48th were decorated with a leering cartoon
of the Joker from ``Batman'' comic books. The tight-knit unit's
motto: ``Skill, not luck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We went out and made it happen,'' said Rick Lester, who also
flew with Reid. ``War has a way of stripping you down. You can talk
trash all day long, but when you're in an area of operation, you've
got to be a man. There are no facades.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid ``was like a cowboy,'' Lester said. ``Just hard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was at the 100 percent edge of the envelope all the time,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Peterman's last conversation with Jake came on the morning of
Feb. 20, standing on the flight line before dawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere, we had gotten some bowls of chicken noodle soup,''
he said. ``We were standing, drinking that soup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember him saying, `Ernie, be careful out there. I'm
worried about you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Like many POW-MIA families in the '70s, the Reids held onto
hope; specifically, the eyewitness accounts of two men escaping the
wrecked Huey.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Reid joined a support and advocacy group of POW-MIA
relatives and traveled to Washington, D.C., each year for
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always said, `The Army lost my son, they can find him,' ''
Roxena recalled.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the family contributed to Red Cross shipments of
sweets and soap, presumably bound for POWs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere, I think there's a warehouse with enough soap to
keep Laos clean for years,'' Karen said.
</P>
<P>
   She and Audrey even traveled to Vientiane, the Laotian capital,
in the fall of 1971. Many POW-MIA family members had made this sad
journey, and the sisters' expectations were low.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect someone to say, `Oh, here's your brother,' ''
Karen said, describing the fruitless trip as ``one more grain of
sand'' in efforts to stir action.
</P>
<P>
   Back at home, Bill Reid, the former fighter pilot, posted an
Army map of the crash area on the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad knew that Jon was an outdoorsman, that he was out there
living in the jungle,'' Karen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He walked my brother out of that jungle 500 different ways,''
Roxena said. ``It was heartbreaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike knew different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something told me he wasn't coming home,'' Mike said. ``I saw
him coming out of the helicopter like John Wayne or Butch Cassidy.
He wouldn't let himself be a prisoner. I saw him go out with guns
a-blazing.''
</P>
<P>
   In May 1973, while spraying fire ants in Alabama, Bill Reid was
killed in an airplane crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within 18 months, my mother lost her son, her own mother and
her husband,'' Roxena said. ``And she carried on.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he legally could, Mike joined the Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ticked off,'' he said. ``I was going to go seek
revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   But the war was winding down, and Mike never saw action.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Americans were allowed to enter Laos for the first time
to look for missing soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Audrey Reid died.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't talk about Jon unless she brought it up,'' Mike
said. ``She'd try and stay `in the now' around me.''
</P>
<P>
   Roxena inherited the official next-of-kin designation when her
mother died. She followed the Army's plodding reclamation efforts.
Other crash sites had priority. The status of Reid and his crew had
long ago been changed from MIA to presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   Laos allows remains-recovery crews to enter the country five
times each year. The crews are based at the Army's Central
Identification Laboratory in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1994, a team visited the coordinates of Reid's Huey,
but results were inconclusive. In a nearby village, a man told of
another crash site. Although the copter that crashed there had been
almost completely scavenged, the team found a few provocative
items. Still, there was no evidence to link this crash to Reid.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1996, another team dug a test pit at the site and
recommended more excavation.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley Sturm, a civilian anthropologist, led a team back to the
site in late March 1998. Trees, roots and termite nests were
cleared away, and a grid was established over the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The helicopter was gone,'' Sturm said. ``Unfortunately, the
metal on wrecks is high quality and in high demand by locals.''
</P>
<P>
   Carefully plotting each shovelful, Sturm supervised the removal
of dirt to a line of sifting boxes. Dozens of locals were employed
as laborers.
</P>
<P>
   On the dig's third day, he said, a fragment of David May's dog
tag was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we knew we had something,'' said Sturm, who has led more
than a dozen such missions. ``Prior to that event, we had no
aircraft data.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several days, the remaining pieces of May's tag
were recovered, as well as watch pieces, a key, a pen cap, about 90
bone fragments and three teeth.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, the Army informed Roxena that the site had been
excavated and that some remains had been found.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think that they would find anything,'' Roxena said.
``I wasn't too concerned about their excavation.''
</P>
<P>
   Army dental records showed, however, that two of the teeth were
Reid's, and that a mitochondrial DNA analysis, matched against DNA
from blood samples earlier contributed by Roxena and her son,
Bryan, confirmed it. The third tooth belonged to May.
</P>
<P>
   Bits of wreckage recovered from the site matched the UH-1C Huey,
and Reid's was the only known UH-1C to fall within a 15-kilometer
radius of the site.
</P>
<P>
   An exhaustive series of reviews and confirmations are built into
the Central Identification Laboratory's process. Last October,
Roxena was contacted by the Army's Memorial Affairs Operations
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The one constant since 1971, the one hopeful presumption based
on information provided by the Army _ that the Huey's door hatches
had been jettisoned, that the pilot-side seat appeared to be empty
and that two men made tracks for the trees _ had been wrong all
along.
</P>
<P>
   That point is echoed in a detailed eyewitness account of Reid's
wreck recently provided to ``The Arizona Republic'' by Stephen
Knowles, a fellow pilot in the 48th who saw Reid's helicopter catch
fire in the air, watched it crash and attempted to land his own
Huey to make a rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Knowles, who lives in the Atlanta area, left the crash under
fire _ something he still regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I had not seen any movement of any kind (in Reid's
copter),'' Knowles wrote. ``No waving arms to signal possible
hiding positions. We had not heard any radio calls while they were
in the air or from the ground. No one had run away from the
aircraft, or to the aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of the Army's finding about Jake Reid circulated quickly
among old copter pilots.
</P>
<P>
   In Marietta, Ga., Rick Lester had just stepped out of a shower
when he flipped on his computer. Waiting for him were eight
e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks like they found Jake Reid,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on Lester's mouse pad were his watch and a Jon Eric Reid
POW bracelet.
</P>
<P>
   A small cross, signifying missing-in-action status, currently
marks Reid's name on the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial in Washington.
The symbol will be changed to a solid diamond, signifying a
confirmed death.
</P>
<P>
   Although families can reject the Army's findings in MIA-recovery
cases, Roxena Wotring, now a nursing professor at Arizona State
University in Tempe, believes her brother died in or near the Huey
not long after it hit the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's exactly what happened,'' she said. ``Jon was
able to land the helicopter, but it was damaged, and then it burst
into flames from all the ammo and the fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the other two escaped, I don't know. I'm sorry for the
families whose sons were last seen running into the jungle.''
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, Jon Reid's teeth, which made the identification
possible, will be buried in a family plot in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother always was trying to find him,'' Roxena said. ``We sort
of felt like we owed it to her.''
</P>
<P>
   May's surviving family will join Wotring and her sister, Karen
Nunan, now a teacher in Brisbane, Australia, at the Jan. 14
ceremony at Arlington. So will Mike Reid, now district wildlife
manager in Pagosa Springs, Colo. (``I'm living the life he was
supposed to,'' Mike said of Jon.)
</P>
<P>
   Also planning to attend is Ernie Peterman, who farms in Mountain
Home, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, I'm looking forward to it. In a way I'm not,'' he
said. ``I'm not certain how I'll feel, but that's the least I can
do to pay my respects to Jake.''
</P>
<P>
   Lester said he and a few others from the 48th are planning
something special for the ceremony, too. Jake Reid and David May
meant a lot to them. Still do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still hear the radio calls, still hear their laughs,''
Lester said. ``Those are good memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to see how much everybody respected Jon Reid, come
to Arlington.''

 &HT;    BEHIND THE AOL MERGER: CONTENT DRIVES CYBERSPACE FUTURE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For media giants, the push nowadays is to get on
line. For Internet outlets, the push is to offer more news and
entertainment content.
</P>
<P>
   Those complementary needs drove Time Warner and America Online
Inc. on Monday to enter into a huge merger that would create a firm
that spans the rapidly converging worlds of media and cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that their deal further advances the growing prospect
of a Web-dominated media world and a media-dominated Web.
</P>
<P>
   But it also may reveal that AOL needed to re-invent itself as a
media company, while its market valuations remained high, in the
wake of new free-Internet business models that targeted its 20
million customers and threatened to wash away its worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``A merger like this one says that either AOL is overvalued or
Time Warner is undervalued,'' said Julien Roch, a senior media
analyst for Lehman Brothers. But he added, ``the key thing is
content. Media is becoming like the Internet, where you have to buy
companies that will show up the winners.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL signaled its long-term faith in the power of media
convergence at last week's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.
For a modest monthly fee, it said, AOL plans to allow television
viewers to gain access to its services from a set-top box, even as
they watch their favorite network or cable shows.
</P>
<P>
   With AOL-TV, users would, for example, be able to order online
an outfit being worn by own of their favorite stars in the course
of the show by clicking on a translucent form superimposed on her
clothing. An instant messaging add-on, already an AOL speciality,
would allow chat-room members to comment in real time on whatever
appeared on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the mega-merger overshadowed another related
announcement Monday: A three-year alliance between AOL and the
Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), a non-profit,
government-subsidized entity. That deal further underscored how
content drives the future of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, which presumably would be inherited by the
newly merged firm, PBS would offer content for several existing AOL
brands. At the same time, many of PBS's programs will be promoted
on AOL.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, the big merger was prompted by a big money bet: the
belief that the Internet, now accessible to some 120 million
Americans, will soon move beyond the personal computer and emerge
as a prime source of news and entertainment as well as a valuable
add-on to cellular phones and hand-held computers.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts predict the mega-merger will prompt further fusion
between traditional media firms and cyberspace outlets, despite
often heard concern on Wall Street that many Internet companies _
profit-making AOL aside _ remain overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect this to expedite a huge number of megamergers in the
coming year,'' said Ken Kiarash, analyst with Buckingham Research
Group.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the engagement and prospective business marriage of
the two giants will likely induce other Internet-service providers
to review their long-term strategy, said Paul Noglows, an analyst
at Chase Manhattan's securities arm.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, Noglows added, is whether they can afford to remain
as mere access providers and/or Web portal sites without the aid of
another ``a significant media partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Noglows is not alone among analysts in forecasting further
business links between the Internet and companies. But others who
see the same trend at work fear it could also lead to undue media
domination and restricted choices for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   As Tom Goldstein, dean of the Columbia University Graduate
School of Journalism, puts it: ``Customers are entitled to know
what corporate entity is responsible for bringing them their news.
And this is now getting harder to know, with the emergence of a
crop of big media companies not normally associated with
journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Arnold, executive director of Hands Off the Internet, a
group that has been allied with AOL and aligned against such cable
outlets as Time Warner on the issue of high-speed access to
cyberspace, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``For a year now, AOL-backed groups have been active in pushing
state and
</P>
<P>
   local access regulation in franchise transfers and renewals
across the country. It will be interesting to see if (the merged
company is) as aggressive in promoting this regulation in its
service territories.''

   Noglows is not alone among analysts in forecasting further
business links between the Internet and companies. But others who
see the same trend at work fear it could also lead to undue media
domination and restricted choices for consumers.

   As Tom Goldstein, dean of the Columbia University Graduate
School of Journalism, puts it: ``Customers are entitled to know
what corporate entity is responsible for bringing them their news.
And this is now getting harder to know, with the emergence of a
crop of big media companies not normally associated with
journalism.''

<P>
   ``For a year now, AOL-backed groups have been active in pushing
state and

across the country. It will be interesting to see if (the merged
company is) as aggressive in promoting this regulation in its
service territories.''

<P>
   The peregrine falcon, California condor, American alligator and
bald eagle pull back from the brink of extinction. Governments and
conservation groups cut deals with private landowners _ and buy
more and more land outright _ in a drive to save the natural
landscape or at least preserve its essence. Once-putrid rivers and
streams are restored to health. Vanished ecosystems are reassembled
and brought back to life. Keystone predators like wolves are
restored to the wild.
</P>
<P>
   The list of victories in conservationists' never-ending struggle
to keep the modern human economy from destroying and degrading the
natural world grows longer all the time. But while green forces are
winning battles and have launched more than a few counterattacks,
many of their generals and strategists say the war is being lost.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the gains, for instance, humans continue to appropriate
an ever-growing proportion of the wild landscape to their use.
Largely because of this, wild species are going extinct at 100 to
1,000 times the natural ``background'' rate. One in eight plant
species is rated as imperiled. By some analyses, one in three could
be extinct or doomed to extinction in 50 years. Since plants form
the very matrix of terrestrial ecosystems, the ripple effect on
other organisms would be substantial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are getting worse faster than they're getting better,''
Dr. Deborah Jensen, the chief scientist of the Nature Conservancy,
told an audience that gathered in Madison, Wis., to honor the
ecologist Aldo Leopold in October. There is ``not much cause for
optimism,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Conversations with many of her colleagues in government,
academia and the trenches of conservation over the last few months
make it clear that her view is widely shared. And a recent report
by the United Nations Environment Program concluded that
environmental gains worldwide had been overtaken by population
growth and economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of these grim assessments, two different
philosophies have lately emerged to compete for strategic and
intellectual dominance of the conservation movement as the world
enters what experts generally believe will be the make-or-break
decades of the struggle. The two views appear to be taking firm
root, and it remains to be seen whether they will reinforce or work
against each other.
</P>
<P>
   One philosophy sees the struggle as a great crusade or, as Dr.
Jensen called it, ``a grand cause.'' Conservationists who embrace
this view rely less on the practical and scientific reasons to
rally support and instead are more often casting their objective as
nothing less than the saving of Creation, with a capital C. In
this, they are appealing to the moral sense of people, including
the religiously devout, in hope of galvanizing a wider spectrum of
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The second emergent philosophy is more pragmatic. It sees the
key to success as an ability to come to terms within the global
economy that is mostly responsible for escalating degradation and
destruction of the natural world. In this view, only down-to-earth
deals with this juggernaut can save nature: give the human economy
part of what it wants from nature in exchange for a guarantee that
the rest will not be disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   These two approaches do not always jibe. Take Southern
California, where one of the nation's most ambitious conservation
projects _ a sweeping attempt to save much of what is left of the
species-rich Los Angeles-to-Mexico landscape _ is based on
long-term land trade-offs between developers and conservationists.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, some conservationists wonder why there should be
any compromise when development has already destroyed 90 percent of
the coastal ecosystem. Why not just stand firm and wield any
appropriate laws to halt further landscape destruction?
</P>
<P>
   Because that approach is unworkable, the deal makers say. It is
better to negotiate so that at least some substantial slice of the
landscape, containing something close to a full panoply of wild
species, can be preserved.
</P>
<P>
   The general task facing conservationists is truly daunting, and
by now well known.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, once-vast ecosystems that covered entire
regions of the nation _ the longleaf pine forests of the Southeast,
for instance, and the prairies and savannas of the Midwest _ are
slivers of their former selves. Even as some wetlands are restored,
others are being destroyed at a rate that means a continuing net
loss. Urban sprawl accelerated from 1992 to 1997, according to the
Department of Agriculture, more than doubling the rate of the
preceding decade.
</P>
<P>
   According to some biologists, the most intractable threat to the
future of many species is the global economy's redistribution of
plant and animal species on a wide scale. Sometimes this is
beneficial, the experts say, but hardy invaders tend to take over
the habitats of vulnerable local species that cannot make it
elsewhere. The upshot is reduced biological diversity, a more
homogenized version of nature.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the ways in which humans disturb the natural world, this
comes closest to being irreversible. Many scientists despair of
ever putting the genie back in the bottle. The global interchange
of species is ``so vast and complex, we're hardly able to
comprehend it,'' Dr. Mike Wingfield, a South African expert on
forests, told an audience at the International Botanical Congress
last summer in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   In other instances, though, nature tends to spring back once the
cause of disturbance is removed. Depleted fish populations recover
once fishing stops. Forests and grasslands retake abandoned
farmland, especially when given a helping hand by restorationists.

REDESIGNED LINCOLN ENTERS MILLENNIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
PHOENIX - Lincoln has perhaps
<TEXT>
<P>
   the most stodgy image in the auto industry, more so than
Cadillac, with a reputation for building oversize land yachts for
retirees. That, and creating the raw material for stretch
limousines.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the 2000 Lincoln LS, which is nothing less than a
major attempt by Ford's luxury division to reinvent itself. This is
the car that would carry Lincoln into the future, and maybe around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The hefty Navigator sport-utility vehicle is credited with
pulling Lincoln out of the hole, but the midsize LS is designed to
attract the 35-55 postwar generation away from imports.
</P>
<P>
   The LS is ``Motor Trend's`` Car of the Year for 2000, a major
coup against stiff competition, and the first time in two decades
that domestics and imports have been combined to vie for the prize.
</P>
<P>
   I drove the most unusual version of the LS, V-6 powered with a
five-speed stick shift. That's right, this Lincoln comes with stick
shift, although only with the six-cylinder engine. It's the first
stick-shift Lincoln since 1951, back before Ford Motor Co. had
developed a decent automatic.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad the automaker opted to skip the V-8 for stick, which
certainly would enhance the performance aura of the new sedan.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, I found the LS to be a sporting car with good balance
and road manners, and a unique character. I couldn't put the
rear-wheel-drive LS in a box with anything else I've driven. That
includes the Jaguar S-type, which shares its chassis with the LS _
the most tangible benefit gained by Ford since it bought Jaguar a
few years back.
</P>
<P>
   The test car was outfitted with stiffer suspension and 17-inch
aluminum wheels. Still, it had a smooth and comfortable ride, not
as soft as Lexus ES300 nor as edgy as BMW 528i. When called upon,
the LS is quick and responsive, with nicely balanced handling and
responsive steering. Freeway cruising is relaxed and seamless, and
control and stability are first-rate.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the handling equation is a 50-50 weight balance, front
to rear. Also, much of the body is weight-reducing aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   The V-6 provides plenty of power, especially coupled with the
quick, precise manual transmission, but I would like to sample the
torquey V-8, which puts out 252 horsepower over the six's 210. The
automatic transmission is also a five-speed, and 95 percent of all
the LS cars are expected to be automatic.
</P>
<P>
   One thing I didn't like about the stick shift was the position
of reverse: hard to the left and forward. It's too close to first
gear, and a couple of times, I slipped it into reverse instead of
first. I caught the mistake before I plowed into the car behind.
</P>
<P>
   The leather-lined interior is spacious and really quite nice,
understated for a Lincoln, looking more like something from Lexus
or Infiniti.
</P>
<P>
   The leather seats are firm and supportive, and the cabin has
plenty of leg, head and hip room, front and rear. But there is
scant stowage anywhere in the interior, aside from some minuscule
door pockets and a small compartment under the center armrest.
</P>
<P>
   My only major complaint with the LS is the exterior styling,
which is pleasant enough but highly derivative of Acura, Lexus,
what have you. Why come out with an all-new car, one that carves
out a new niche for Lincoln, and have it look pretty much like
everything else?
</P>
<P>
   Fit and finish on the test car was excellent throughout.
</P>
<P>
   There were just a few options added to the well-equipped base
V-6 model, including $365 for a special paint job, $995 for a power
moonroof, $595 for a six-disc CD changer and $850 for a convenience
package that included mist-sensing wipers, driver's seat memory and
glare-sensing rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   The V-8 model starts at about $3,500 more than the V-6 version.
Still, the pricing is moderate for this level of refinement and
compares well with the competition. Part of that competition is the
Cadillac Catera, a midsize car with a similar mission to that of
the LS, though not as successfully accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   The Lincoln LS is a car that's easy to like on several levels,
with enough luxury for traditional Lincoln buyers and enough sport
for the new generation. Other than the generic styling, the LS is a
winner that takes its place among the best sedans. &QL;

 UNDATED: by restorationists.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some ecosystems return to health when cleansing processes like
fire, on which they depend, are restored. Rivers tend to cleanse
themselves once pollutants are no longer dumped in.
</P>
<P>
   That is what keeps conservationists from total despair; if
people can be persuaded to stop interfering with natural processes,
the situation will eventually correct itself to some degree. The
problem is to get through the 21st century, and especially the next
50 years. But according to one analysis, from one-third to half of
the earth's surface has been transformed by human activity, and as
the population grows, the trend appears sure to continue: the
world's population, now about 6 billion people, is expected to
rocket to 9.5 billion by 2050, then grow more slowly before
stabilizing at nearly 11 billion around 2200.
</P>
<P>
   Few if any scientists go so far as to say that what people know
as the natural world will simply disappear, to be superseded by
some high-tech virtual reality. But it is widely considered a sure
bet that many species will vanish. Many kinds of ecosystems could
disappear from the earth. Many genetic resources could be lost,
including some that might offer the promise of lifesaving medicines
and improved food production.
</P>
<P>
   The shape and texture of nature will surely change, and probably
not for the better: it is likely to become simpler, poorer, less
interesting and perhaps less stable ecologically.
</P>
<P>
   Many conservationists believe their basic task over the next few
decades is to slow this process and to save as many of the pieces
of nature as possible _ that is, as many species, in their natural
settings _ so that once the great fever of human population
expansion has broken, there will be building blocks for a
large-scale restoration.
</P>
<P>
   But in developing countries, where the population crush will be
worst, the situation may be close to hopeless, especially in the
tropics, where most species live. Dr. John Terborgh of Duke
University, an expert on tropical conservation, says efforts to
save nature in some parts of the world ``are just doomed to fail.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 1999 book, ``Requiem for Nature'' (Island
Press/Shearwater), Terborgh wrote that nature ``cannot long
survive'' a combination of inadequate nature parks, unstable
societies and faltering institutions that plagues many developing
countries. ``We have a long way to go before anyone can feel
comfortable about the future of nature,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is in a better position, he says.
</P>
<P>
   But about three-quarters of the land in the United States is in
private hands, and therefore vulnerable to the economic juggernaut.
Given the steady expansion of the economy and the steady advance of
development, some experts have raised questions about whether
growth and conservation can be responsibly balanced.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who has been a chief advocate
of making deals to achieve such a balance, as in Southern
California, staunchly defends the approach. ``There is no way you
can put everything off-limits'' in nature, he said. The goal then
becomes to conduct human activity ``in a way that is mostly
compatible with the ecosystem.'' Which means making hard-headed
trade-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the belief of others that the conservation war is being
lost at the moment, Babbitt describes himself as ``an optimist who
says we cannot accept the possibility of defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, too, is hopeful. First, he says, the richest assemblages
of species inhabit a relatively small part of the land, meaning
that conservation efforts can be effectively focused on a
relatively few biological hot spots. Second, he says, the
conservation movement has lately taken on a new zeal in keeping
with its increasingly expressed moral objective of saving creation.
</P>
<P>
   This is a potentially powerful appeal, many conservationists
believe, one capable of engaging people's close-to-home desire to
bequeath a healthy world to their children. ``And you can give the
next generation of young people something worth fighting for,''
Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the impulse to save creation and the gritty deal-making
approach to conservation can be fused into an ultimately winning
combination may become clear in the early decades of the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   This generation's reputation in history may depend partly on the
outcome if Jamie Rappaport Clark, director of the United States
Fish and Wildlife Service, is right in saying:
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be remembered for what we've left of the land
rather than what we've built on it.

COMPELLING FIRST LINES DRAW READERS INTO WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LELA STROMENGER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; EDITORS: THERE IS A LIST OF EXAMPLE BELOW STORY ON THIS TAKE:
 &UR; ``Begin at the beginning,'' Alice was advised in Wonderland, ``and
go on till you come to the end: then stop.'' If only it were that
easy in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Writers have been struggling since Homer to find the art of
opening a story. There is pretty general agreement on which ones
have succeeded best. What true reader hasn't thrilled, at some age,
to the passage that begins, ``It was the best of times, it was the
worst of times''? Dickens' ``Tale of Two Cities'' is among the
classic examples.
</P>
<P>
   The question, then, is not so much which, but why.
</P>
<P>
   People who know books have their own answers and, of course,
their own favorites. Anne Stephenson, who writes the New &AMP; Notable
books column for ``The Arizona Republic,'' said she was hooked
immediately by the ``jazzy'' voice of Vladimir Nabokov's Humbert
Humbert: ``Lolita, light of my life,'' and so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lolita,'' indeed, puts the reader right into the grip of its
extraordinary narrator, who, Stephenson said, `` &UR; commands the
reader to look at his obsession.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps there's a clue there.
</P>
<P>
   It is interesting that most of the people polled for this
article named a work spoken in the first person. That directness
seems to grab readers.
</P>
<P>
   A skilled writer can bait the same hook twice, introducing the
character and establishing the mood simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Peters, owner of the Scottsdale bookshop the Poisoned
Pen, cited, among others, Daphne du Maurier's ``Rebecca'': ``Last
night I dreamt I went to Manderly again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a book as a conversation between the author and the
reader,'' Peters said. ``Based on the opening, the reader decides
if he is interested in pursuing the conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   People buy books on the strength of the beginning paragraphs,
she said, and in a competitive field, a ``crackerjack opening'' is
critical.
</P>
<P>
   The most quotable writer in English, needless to say, was not a
novelist at all. Barbara Riggs, public-relations manager of the
Scottsdale Cultural Council, noted that ``the best opening lines
are all in Shakespeare's plays.'' Riggs gave the example of ``Henry
V'': ``O for a muse of fire, that would ascend / The brightest
heaven of invention.'' It's hard to argue with that.
</P>
<P>
   In every discussion of this kind, there is one American
masterpiece that inevitably comes up _ the three-word opening to
Herman Melville's ``Moby Dick.'' And Jay Boyer, a creative writing
instructor at Arizona State University, knows why.
</P>
<P>
   That sentence turns the focus ring for the novel, ``which is not
about going after a white whale but about finding one's place in an
uncertain universe'' in which evil exists, Boyer said. The question
is the most baffling faced by man, and Boyer pointed out that the
very tone of the questioner is uncertain, seeking _ not ``My name
is Ishmael'' or ``I am Ishmael,'' but ``Call me Ishmael.''
</P>
<P>
   From genre writers to literary giants, then, that is how the
masters do it, somewhat like musicians. A note is struck, a tone is
caught, a theme is stated. Good books, it seems, grow out of good
beginnings. Obviously, we'd be unwise to make the first sentence of
any book a litmus test. But it's not a bad guide. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SOME GREAT FIRST LINES: &QL; 
``Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in
its own way.'' &QL; 
_ Leo Tolstoy, ``Anna Karenina.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.
Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down
the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Validmir Nabokov, ``Lolita.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel
Aureliano Buendia was to remember that distant afternoon when his
father took him to discover ice.'' &QL; 
_ Gabriel Garcia Marquez, ``One Hundred Years of Solitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in
possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.'' &QL; 
_ Jane Austen, ``Pride and Prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll
probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy
childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before
they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I
don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   _ J.D. Salinger, ``The Catcher in the Rye.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the saddest story I have ever heard.'' &QL; 
_ Ford Madox Ford, ``The Good Soldier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever my mother talks to me, she begins the conversation as
if we were already in the middle of an argument.'' &QL; 
_ Amy Tan, ``The Kitchen God's Wife''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Tench went out to look for his ether cylinder: out into
the blazing Mexican sun and the bleaching dust. A few buzzards
looked down from the roof with shabby indifference: he wasn't
carrion yet.'' &QL; 
_ Graham Greene, ``The Power and the Glory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am out of my mind, it's all right with me, thought Moses
Herzog.'' &QL; 
_ Saul Bellow, ``Herzog.''
</P>

   PHILADELPHIA _ The session, Dr. Aaron T. Beck recalls, began
like many others. The woman lay on the couch, describing her sexual
encounters with men, while Beck, at the time a recent graduate of
the Philadelphia Psychoanalytic Institute, sat behind her,
scribbling in his notebook.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does talking about this make you feel?'' he asked her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel anxious,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   Trained to probe the hidden conflicts underlying psychological
symptoms, Beck responded with an interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are anxious because you are having to confront some of
your sexual desires,'' he told her. ``And you are anxious because
you expect me to be disapproving of these desires.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, Dr. Beck,'' his patient replied, ``I'm afraid that
I'm boring you.''
</P>
<P>
   Arms crossed on his chest, red bow tie resplendent, pale blue
eyes keen beneath a shock of white hair, the founder of the fastest
growing, most extensively studied form of psychotherapy in America
is telling this story to explain how he eventually came to leave
Freud behind.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his office at the Beck Institute for Cognitive
Therapy and Research in Philadelphia, he offers a favorite maxim:
``There is more to the surface than meets the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to many psychological difficulties, Beck has found in 40
years of research and clinical work, lies not deep in the
unconscious, but in ``thinking problems'' that are much closer to
conscious awareness.
</P>
<P>
   In the woman's case, for example, it turned out that she engaged
in an endless self-deprecating monologue, an inner voice constantly
berating her that she was unattractive, uninteresting and
worthless.
</P>
<P>
   These ``automatic thoughts,'' as Beck calls them, led her to
behave in self-defeating ways, like acting promiscuously because
she did not think she had much else to offer, or engaging in
histrionics in an effort to seem more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Cognitive therapy, developed by the psychiatrist after he
abandoned psychoanalysis, is intended to help patients correct such
distortions in thinking, often in a dozen sessions or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   Beck calls the method ``simple and prosaic,'' with no dredging
up of lost childhood memories, no minute examination of parental
misdeeds, no search for hidden meanings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to do with common-sense problems that people have,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Patients in cognitive therapy are encouraged to test their
perceptions of themselves and others, as if they were scientists
testing hypotheses. They receive homework assignments from their
therapists. They learn to identify their ``inaccurate'' beliefs and
to set goals for changing their behavior.
</P>
<P>
   It is an appealing package. In an age when managed care closely
monitors the consulting room, and most psychiatrists view drugs _
not talking _ as the treatment of choice for their patients, it has
been able to provide hard data in support of psychotherapy's power.
</P>
<P>
   Cognitive therapy's basic precepts are easily summarized in
training manuals and its simplicity makes it an ideal research
tool. Dozens of studies have shown it to be effective in treating
depression, panic attacks, addictions, eating disorders and other
psychiatric conditions. Researchers are also studying the therapy's
ability to treat personality disorders and, in combination with
drugs, psychotic illnesses like schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   Therapists from around the world travel to the Beck Institute
for training. Mental health organizations like the National Mental
Health Association recommend cognitive therapy to patients as one
of the few forms of psychotherapy studied in large-scale clinical
trials.
</P>
<P>
   Yet every theory of the human mind in general springs from a
human mind in particular. Freud, caught in his own Oedipal
struggles, saw the unconscious as roiling with sexual and
aggressive impulses. Fritz Perls, possessed of a biting wit and
fond of confrontation, invited his patients to take the ``hot
seat.'' Carl Rogers, a former seminarian and by all accounts an
empathic soul, argued that psychotherapy should be
``client-centered.''
</P>
<P>
   In its way, cognitive therapy _ practical, cerebral and to the
point _ is also a fair reflection of the man who conceived it.
</P>
<P>
   He is 78 now, an emeritus professor of psychiatry at the
University of Pennsylvania, four times a father, eight times a
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as a younger man, his former students say, Beck, with
his white hair and the bow tie he carefully affixed each morning,
projected a grandfatherly air, offering a nurturing presence, a
passion for collecting data, a conviction that evidence always
trumps opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Others in his position might cultivate the flamboyance Americans
seem to expect of their therapy gurus. Beck has more in common with
Marcus Welby than Dr. Laura Schlessinger; his currency is ideas not
personal charisma. Soft-spoken and unexcitable, he wears a hat,
chats amiably with strangers in elevators and uses old-fashioned
words like ``gosh'' and ``gal.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to describe himself, Beck ticks off ``kind, intelligent,
creative, flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need to be right,'' he says, ``but I don't like to be
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey Young, a former student, now the director of the
Cognitive Therapy Center of New York, recalls a debate with his
professor over whether those who came to them seeking help should
be referred to as ``patients'' or ``clients.'' Beck had a simple
solution: Ask people what term they prefer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I am ultimately a pragmatist,'' Beck says. ``and if it
doesn't work, I don't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He encourages a similar philosophy in his patients, hoping they
will eventually choose to let go of the self-defeating attitudes
that tie their lives in knots. ``It's a testable assumption,'' Beck
tells a 30-year-old woman who believes, she told him, that ``if I
don't punish myself, God will be mad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see if you stopped punishing yourself and nothing
happened,'' he suggests.
</P>
<P>
   With patients convinced that they must always be perfect, that
their bosses hate them, that their spouses are insensitive to their
needs, he will question, gently, ``Would you agree that it is
against your best interests to have this belief?'' He will ask:
``What are the disadvantages to thinking this way?'' He will wonder
out loud: ``Do you think it is possible to ignore these thoughts?''
</P>
<P>
   It is a faith in the rational mind he has carried since
childhood, growing up in a middle-class neighborhood of Providence,
R.I., the third son of Russian Jewish immigrants, his father a
printer with strong socialist beliefs who wrote poetry in his later
years, his mother a forceful woman of unpredictable moods who had
already lost two children.
</P>
<P>
   He was a Boy Scout, an active child who, despite his mother's
overprotectiveness, played football and basketball until at 8, he
developed a serious staph infection after surgery for a broken arm.
The infection kept him in the hospital for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers the surgeon saying ``he's not under yet,'' a
terrible dream of a series of alligators, each biting the tail of
the next, the last alligator biting his arm.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers his mother saying: ``He will not die. He will not
die.'' The boy himself never questioned that he would recover, but
the surgery, Beck believes in retrospect, was a defining moment in
his life, restricting his activities and forcing him to find
quieter forms of entertainment, like reading.
</P>
<P>
   The hospitalization defined his life in other ways, too. He
developed a phobia of blood and injury: a hospital scene in a movie
was enough to send his blood pressure plunging. If he smelled
ether, he became anxious and began to faint.
</P>
<P>
   He conquered his fears methodically, allowing logic to gradually
triumph over irrationality. ``I learned not to be concerned about
the faint feeling, but just to keep active,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   With such a straightforward attitude toward his own psychology,
Beck, who was a resident in psychiatry at the Cushing Veterans
Administration Hospital in Framingham, Mass., in the early 1950s,
was probably never meant to become a psychoanalyst; even now, his
interest in how his childhood experiences shaped him seems minimal.
But Freudian theory was ascendant in psychiatry departments across
the country, and with many of his fellow residents, he entered the
psychoanalytic institute in Philadelphia, completing his training
in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he had some doubts. The lack of precision annoyed him:
Though every analyst agreed that in neurosis there were ``deep
factors at work,'' no one, Beck discovered, could agree on exactly
what those factors were.
</P>
<P>
   He found work with patients exhausting, because the goals seemed
so unclear. ``The idea was that if you sat back and listened and
said `Ah-hah,' somehow secrets would come out,'' Beck remembered.
``And you would get exhausted just from the helplessness of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he completed his training and began taking patients in
for analysis. But without any fanfare, he began to adjust the way
he interacted with them.
</P>
<P>
   The woman who worried about boring him, for example, he asked to
sit up and face him, so that she could see his facial expressions
and gauge his interest in what she was saying. He began to ask more
questions, and to listen to the answers in a different way.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, at Penn, where he joined the faculty in
psychiatry in 1954, Beck was trying to find empirical evidence for
Freudian precepts _ and failing. With a colleague, he designed an
experiment to test the link between depression and masochism, a
basic psychoanalytic notion. But the researchers found no evidence
that the depressed patients in the study somehow needed to suffer.
Instead, Beck said, they simply showed low self-esteem, devoid of
hidden motives. ``They saw themselves as losers because that's the
way they saw themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``cognitive'' approach to therapy that Beck ultimately
developed _ influenced, he says, by thinkers like Karen Horney,
George Kelly and Albert Ellis, whose rational emotive therapy
struck similar themes _ was a major departure from the
psychoanalytic fold. It was not received warmly. Many analysts
dismissed it as superficial; some suggested that perhaps Beck
himself ``had not been well analyzed.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been other critics, as well. Psychologists trained in
classical behaviorism have opposed cognitive therapy's focus on
``thoughts,'' which they said could not be measured objectively.
Biological psychiatrists, like Dr. Donald Klein, director of
research at New York State Psychiatric Institute, have argued that
the therapy is simply a morale booster for depressed patients, not
a specific treatment. Beck, for his part, has responded to each
critique with a new raft of experimental data.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an unusual person,'' said Dr. John Rush, professor of
psychiatry at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center
and a former student. ``He is willing to test his own beliefs, just
like he asks patients to test theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the early years it often was lonely work, and it was his
wife, Phyllis, now a Superior Court judge in Philadelphia, who
buoyed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was my reality tester,'' he said. ``She went along with
the newer ideas I had, and that gave me the idea that I wasn't in
left field.''
</P>
<P>
   Many decades later, she remains his closest confidante. But it
is his daughter, Dr. Judith Beck, a psychologist who is director of
the Beck Institute, who participates most closely in his work.
</P>
<P>
   Scene: A suburban delicatessen, a corned beef sandwich, his
daughter sitting next to him; a comfortable setting for Beck who,
his colleagues and former students say, is in fact very shy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you remember that dream I had when I was going off to
graduate school?'' she asks him. ``That I was up on the Empire
State Building and I felt in danger of falling off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do,'' he says. ``And do you remember what I told you it
might be about? That the higher you aspire, the greater you're
going to fall?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit me as absolutely that was what it meant,'' she replies.
</P>
<P>
   As institute director, she has come to know her father in a
different way, to admire him as a thinker and a therapist, to work
with him as a colleague. When she was a child, she says, he was
always working; age has made him more tolerant, less driven, has
turned him more toward family.
</P>
<P>
   It has not slowed him down. He receives 10,000 e-mail messages a
year, divides his time between Penn and the institute, is expanding
his research into new areas. He plays tennis regularly, despite a
recent hip replacement. His newest book, ``Prisoners of Hate: The
Cognitive Basis of Anger, Hostility and Violence,'' (HarperCollins,
1999) appeared last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Retiring, he says, has never entered his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has done a lot of cognitive therapy on himself,''
says his daughter.

RIGHT ANGLE: SIDEWAYS THINKING DOES THE TRICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thaddeus Steele was a man who could think sideways. In fact, he
invented the art.
</P>
<P>
   He was my wife's grandfather, and he was never completely
socialized. He kept rattlesnakes under the house. He fished and
hunted for a living, and although he sometimes held a job, if he
thought the fish were biting, he left the job site for the fishing
pond without a single wince of conscience.
</P>
<P>
   He also believed that traffic signs and stoplights were there to
``instruct those who didn't know how to drive.'' Because he knew
what he was doing, he ignored them.
</P>
<P>
   But it is for his inventive method of problem solving that I
remember him here. Thad Steele never met a problem he couldn't
solve, and in a way no one else might have thought of.
</P>
<P>
   When the corner post of his back porch cracked, and the porch
roof sagged on one side, he lassoed a nearby sapling and pulled it
down under the porch eave, using the natural springiness of the
tree to keep the roof from falling.
</P>
<P>
   STILL THAT WAY &QL; 
``It was still that way the last time I saw it,'' my wife says.
</P>
<P>
   Once, when a neighbor used a shortcut across his lawn,
eventually wearing a path in the grass, Thad Steele knew how to
stop her. He never would have confronted her directly; that wasn't
his style.
</P>
<P>
   No, he dug a person-size hole hip deep in the center of the
path, mixed up a load of pudding-quality mud to fill it in, used
carpet tacks to secure a cloth across the hole and sprinkled it
with dirt and grass to camouflage the hole.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the woman stepped into the hole up to her waist in
brown goo. She stopped shortcutting across his yard.
</P>
<P>
   I especially like the touch of the carpet tacks.
</P>
<P>
   There are many examples of Thad Steele's peculiar approach to
life.
</P>
<P>
   SHOOTING SCARE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His friend Hub Hawkins had a stutter. Thad had said many times
that ``if Hub were frightened enough, he'd talk as plain as the
next man.'' One day, while Thad and Hub's cousin Dewey were sitting
on the front porch, they saw Hub walking toward them on the
railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Thad leveled the pistol he always carried _ as all real men in
Madison, N.C., did in those days _ and fired several times at Hub's
feet, making him dance. Hub yelled back, ``D-D-Dod d-damn you,
D-Dad D-D-Deele!''
</P>
<P>
   That was one solution that didn't take.
</P>
<P>
   But sideways thinking often did work. Thad Steele kept five blue
Dodges in his backyard so he always had parts for the blue Dodge he
drove.
</P>
<P>
   When his wife and her sister argued violently over who owned a
beautiful pitcher and bowl that had belonged to their mother, Thad
Steele took the crockery down to the creek and broke them on the
rocks. It stopped the squabble.
</P>
<P>
   STRAIGHT TO REALITY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He pierced straight through to the reality, to the heart of
the matter,'' my wife says. ``He was not about social acceptance.
He thought it silly.''
</P>
<P>
   She remembers once, when she was about five years old, her
grandfather was asked to baby-sit her. For Thad Steele,
baby-sitting meant the child adapting to him, not the other way
around.
</P>
<P>
   And so, because he had intended to go hunting that day, the
child went hunting with him.
</P>
<P>
   He had seen a bunch of flying squirrels in the woods near the
house, and so the three of them _ Thad Steele, his gun and the
five-year-old girl _ went out shooting.
</P>
<P>
   After he had shot three of them, he wrapped them in a blanket
and handed them to the child, telling her, ``Take care of them like
babies.''
</P>
<P>
   There are perhaps more appropriate ways to deal with a child,
but the old man knew who he was dealing with.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have said, `Watch these while I go down the path
looking for more,' but he didn't. He turned them into baby dolls
for me. He understood me and made me feel like a million dollars. I
was their mother because of what he said to me.''
</P>
<P>
   My wife has learned her lessons from Thad Steele well. She is
also a master of sideways thinking.
</P>
<P>
   When she was young and poor, recently divorced, she couldn't
afford her automobile inspection, so she painted the inspection
sticker on the windshield of the car and used it for the full year.
</P>
<P>
   As an adult and an art teacher in Arizona, she was given an art
room with carpet _ not the best kind of floor for a room full of
second-graders with jars of tempera paint. And when the inevitable
spill happened and she couldn't scrub out the stain, she realized:
``I'm an art teacher; I can mix that color.''
</P>
<P>
   So she matched the color of the original carpet and painted over
the stain.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, in another school, after a month of working with
clay, the dried gray powder was ground into the tile floor. When
she asked the janitor to mop the floor to prevent the clouds of
dust from clay choking the kids, the janitor replied ``mopping is
not in my job description,'' and ignored her.
</P>
<P>
   So, as a master of sideways thinking, she and the kids filled up
a dozen or so 10-gallon buckets with tap water and then, in one
grand cascade, poured it all out onto the floor. She sent one of
the kids to the janitor with the message: ``Help! The room's
flooded!'' And the janitor came and mopped up the mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``The floor was the cleanest it had ever been,'' she notes.
</P>
<P>
   Sideways thinking helps get things done when ordinary thinking
is stymied.
</P>
<P>
   From the evidence of our family, sideways thinking skips
generations, like some genetic traits. My wife's grandfather had it
in spades, but her father did not. He was a thoroughly socialized
man, well-thought of in the community.
</P>
<P>
   My wife got the gene, but her daughter didn't. She is a reporter
on a newspaper in the South, and she has all the people skills
necessary for the job. But although she is very smart, her
intelligence travels in a straight line, not crabwise.
</P>
<P>
   But that daughter is now pregnant, and if the pattern holds
true, the twins she is carrying will turn out to think sideways,
like their grandmother and great-great grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   My wife looks forward to subverting them, showing them the
secrets of sideways life, hoping to explore a world free from
social and cultural expectations.
</P>
<P>
   And she looks forward to baby-sitting them, just like her
grandad baby-sat her.

   &UR; RETRANSMITTING TO CORRECT BYLINE Here are Anne Stephenson's
capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``NAT KING COLE'' &QL; 
By Daniel Mark Epstein (FSG, $27) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `The kid was wearing a light green gabardine suit that draped
his long, slender frame so loosely it looked like the first
high-note blast of a trumpet might blow his coat off.'' Nat Cole
was 16 then, shy but bold enough to know how good he was. It's this
image of the young Cole in 1935, about to go up against Earl Hines
in the ``Battle of Rhythm'' in Chicago's Savoy Ballroom that begins
Epstein's biography. Cole died of cancer when he was 45, yet his
story is rich enough for several lives. There were his formative
years in Chicago as what Epstein calls ``a kitten on the keys.''
There were his marriages and infidelities, bad business decisions,
and troubles with the IRS. There was the racial tension that
buffeted his career (in 1956, he was attacked onstage by White
assailants during a performance in Birmingham, Ala.). And there
were Cole's affability and pragmatism, which helped him skirt
racial politics, court a White audience, and make an amazing
crossover from jazz to popular (and frequently schlocky) music.
Epstein creates an engaging portrait of this romantic figure in
American music. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``IN THE GLOAMING'' &QL; 
By Alice Elliott Dark (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $23) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In ``Triage,'' a mother and her adult daughter pursue an uneasy
truce as they jockey for position in each other's lives. In ``The
Tower,'' an aging bachelor falls for a young woman whose background
hints at a very unpleasant surprise. In ``Dreadful Language,'' a
woman moves through youthful rebellion to true love and on to
sorrow and resignation. But the big draw in this story collection
is the title piece, which was published in ``The New Yorker'' in
1994, made into a HBO film starring Glenn Close, and chosen by John
Updike for ``The Best American Short Stories of the Century.'' ``In
the Gloaming'' is a story about conversations _ they take place
always at twilight, the time called ``the gloaming'' _ between a
woman and her 33-year-old son, who is dying of AIDS. With austere
precision, Dark charts the mother's heart as she comes to know both
her son and herself and as she begins to understand that these
daily talks are her dying child's way of returning her love to her.
It's a wonderful story _ moving, understated and as true as the
emotional secrets it unveils.
</P>
<P>
   ``100 BEST ALBUM COVERS: THE STORIES BEHIND THE SLEEVES'' &QL; 
By Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell (DK, $19.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``At 4 a.m. every morning for a week, three adults and two
children were sprayed silver and gold from head to toe and driven
from the hotel to the location to await a glorious sunrise that
never happened,'' write Thorgerson and Powell. It rained, it was
cold, it was boring, and after the makeup ran out, they had to use
car paint, which they removed with turpentine. In the end, the
adult models were dumped (they used just the naked children, a
brother and sister who had already appeared nude in a Japanese
version of ``Alice in Wonderland'') and the sunrise was faked, but
the album cover for Led Zeppelin's ``Houses of the Holy'' is
memorable enough to appear here, a full 26 years later. Also
included are the stories behind the covers for Santana's
``Abraxas,'' the Grateful Dead's ``Aoxomoxoa,'' Big Brother &AMP; the
Holding Company's ``Cheap Thrills'' and John Lennon and Yoko Ono's
``Two Virgins'' and many more.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``FLU'' &QL; 
By Gina Kolata (FSG, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The flu of 1918 came in two waves. The first showed up in the
spring, bringing its victims chills and fevers but rarely lasting
more than three days. It was, Kolata writes, ``banal, and easily
forgotten.'' In September, however, it came back with a vengeance,
and this time it was a killer that altered countless lives.
Children were orphaned, families were destroyed. Thousands of
people die horribly. More than 25 percent of the United States
population became ill, and between 20 million and 100 million
people died worldwide. If a similar plague were to strike today, it
would kill more people in a single year than heart disease,
cancers, strokes, pulmonary disease, AIDS and Alzheimer's disease
combined. But is this possible? Are authorities prepared to fight
the outbreak of another virus with such mysterious and deadly
power? Kolata, a science writer for the ``New York Times,'' looks
at the history of the 1918 flu and at the lessons it offers for
averting a similar disaster today. It's fascinating but sobering
reading _ if you feel a chill coming on, save it for another day.  &QL;

HBO JUST WANTS YOU TO NOTICE THE SOPRANOS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also TV-SOPRANOS) 
(DW) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Spike Lee was there; so were Christopher Walken and
Aidan Quinn and Stephen King and the present and former police
commissioners of the City of New York. The party at Roseland on
Wednesday night was the biggest ever given by HBO, no stranger to
lavish premiere parties.
</P>
<P>
   But then HBO has never before had anything quite as big as ``The
Sopranos'' to promote.
</P>
<P>
   The cable channel had planned on about 1,000 guests; about 1,800
showed up for the party and screening of two episodes in the new
season. The Ziegfield theater could not contain the crowd, so HBO
bused the latecomers to its headquarters on Avenue of the Americas.
On the way they may have glimpsed one of the many ``Sopranos''
billboards dotting the city, or at least seen a city bus go by with
the cast glaring out in full menace just above the message,
``Family. Redefined.''
</P>
<P>
   Had some taken the subway, there's a chance they could have
ridden in one of the cars ``fully branded'' _ as HBO's top
marketing executive put it _ with ``Sopranos'' advertising: nothing
but black-and-white images of the cast.
</P>
<P>
   It is all part of what Eric Kessler, the executive vice
president for marketing at HBO, called a campaign ``comparable to
the biggest thing we've ever done.'' Why not, he added, ``We're
talking about the return of the best show on television.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos'' won that label from virtually every critic last
season. For a show that is unarguably the most talked-about series
ever on HBO, a channel that puts a premium on generating talk, the
effort to reintroduce it to the public is extending just about
everywhere HBO can reach. That includes HBO.com/Sopranos, of
course, the most-used Web site ever associated with HBO, executives
said. It features ersatz FBI files on each character, gossip about
who may be rubbed out and polls on the season's favorite lines of
dialogue. (Last season's winner was uttered by Anthony Jr. in
Episode 1, about the absence of his grandmother's cherished ziti.
Like many ``Sopranos'' lines, it can't be printed here.)
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the CD of songs from ``The Sopranos,'' a music
video, a traveling ``waste management'' truck (Tony's not-so-true
calling) and a series of on-the-air promotions on multiple cable
channels. There's even a promotion on a broadcast network, CBS,
with the most prominent and expensive of those ads scheduled during
the NFL playoff games this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The promotional campaign is huge for HBO, both in significance
and expenditure, though Kessler and other HBO executives declined
to give an overall price. ``Sopranos'' images are so widespread, on
display at bus stops as well as the entrance of Lincoln Tunnel,
that some of the cast and crew are beginning to worry about a
backlash. At the premiere party, James Gandolfini, who stars as
Tony Soprano, said, sounding as if in character, ``I'm sure people
will be gunning for us this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bewkes, HBO's chairman, said the pay cable channel was only
trying to make up for ``the big marketing disadvantage'' it faced
in comparison with the established broadcast networks. Only about
25 million subscribers receive HBO, about a quarter of the homes
that are available to the broadcast networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are literally forced to buy buses,'' Bewkes said.
</P>
<P>
   And trains. Kessler said HBO had also bought space on Metro
North trains. That's just New York awareness, of course, he said.
For more national exposure, HBO has turned to magazines like The
New Yorker, Vanity Fair, People and Entertainment Weekly, all of
which will be running a four-page ad on ``The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is likely to be seen more widely than a commercial on an
NFL playoff game, but even there Bewkes said HBO was hamstrung.
``CBS is the only network that will allow us to buy time,'' he
said. And CBS forbids HBO to give the time and date of the
``Sopranos'' season premiere (Sunday at 9).
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony Soprano's Waste Management'' truck will appear in parking
lots at the NFL playoff games and at the Super Bowl. Cardboard
cutouts of the characters will be available for fans to pose with
for pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The channel also expects MTV or VH-1 to begin running a video
featuring the show's theme song, ``Woke Up This Morning,'' by the
group A3.
</P>
<P>
   This season's episodes include cameo appearances by people like
Janeane Garofalo, Sandra Bernhard, Jon Favreau and Frank Sinatra
Jr., all playing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them joined the other celebrities at the premiere at the
Ziegfield and the party at Roseland. It was one more indication of
how far the show has come. Last year's premiere was in the basement
of the Virgin Megastore on Broadway, and the party was at John's
Pizzeria on West 44th Street.

<TEXT>
<P>
   As they dragged their luggage up the long winding staircase in
the main building on Ellis Island, immigrants in the early 1900s
would catch the eye of the Public Health Service doctors if they
looked too out of breath and certainly if they were coughing.
</P>
<P>
   To the doctors, this was a possible sign of a contagious disease
like tuberculosis and they needed to act swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   After examination with a stethoscope and, after 1910, an X-ray
machine, immigrants with tuberculosis would be sent back home if
the disease had not progressed too far, or would be placed in an
isolation ward, where many of them died.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a real fear of the disease,'' said Dr. John
Parascandola, the Public Health Service historian. ``There was not
a treatment for it. It was contagious and it didn't go away
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, public health officials again fear tuberculosis. Because
tuberculosis rates are rising in the developing world and
immigration from those countries is at all-time highs, health
officials have begun one of the largest screenings for disease
among immigrants at the nation's border since the days of Ellis
Island.
</P>
<P>
   They plan to install high-speed chest X-ray machines at each of
the nation's 19 immigrant detention centers. And they have begun
outreach programs and testing at places where immigrants
congregate, like schools and churches.
</P>
<P>
   But while the purpose of the effort is similar to the one at the
turn of the century, public health officials face an entirely
different set of circumstances this time around, and lessons from
Ellis Island are few.
</P>
<P>
   Public health officials today do not have to make crucial
diagnoses in seconds, as they did at Ellis Island. They also have
effective antibiotics and treatments for most of the diseases _
trachoma, a contagious eye disease that could cause blindness;
typhus; favus, a contagious disease of the scalp and nails; and
pneumonia _ that doctors grappled with at Ellis Island.
</P>
<P>
   But they now have new diseases to worry about, like AIDS, and
drug-resistant varieties of old ones, like tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, the country's borders are less secure,
and immigrants hardly filter through the same place at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   Today, legal immigrants are screened in their home countries for
infectious diseases and disorders that can be harmful to themselves
or others. These include, in addition to HIV and TB, syphilis,
gonorrhea and mental disorders like paranoid schizophrenia. Those
with transmittable diseases are kept out of the country until they
are no longer infectious.
</P>
<P>
   But the hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants who enter
the country every year come with no medical screening at all. The
United States no longer deports immigrants for medical reasons, so
if the Immigration and Naturalization Service detains immigrants
found to have a serious contagious diseases, the Public Health
Service must isolate them and treat them.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the serious contagious diseases, the most prevalent
illnesses found in immigrants over the past few years include
inactive tuberculosis, skin infections, diabetes and colds.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has changed is that borders don't really exist anymore,''
said Dr. Gene Migliaccio, director of the Division of Immigrant
Health Services for the U.S. Public Health Service. ``With
airplanes and the ease of movement from one country to another, the
potential of bringing in a disease is tremendous. We have to be
more vigilant with the work we do, vigilant that disease can
spread.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Public Health Service conducted medical
inspections of more than 150,000 illegal immigrants who were caught
by the immigration service, screening them for most of the
infectious diseases that are still widespread in the developing
nations from which immigration is high, like tuberculosis, malaria,
dengue fever and various plagues.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   According to Migliaccio, they found 126 cases of tuberculosis
last year. Among those born in the United States, the nation's TB
rate is only about 5 per 100,000, while the rate among the
country's foreign-born population is about 30 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   When federal legislation in 1891 mandated the medical inspection
of all arriving immigrants, the law gave doctors at the borders the
philosophy to which they would adhere for the next three decades:
They must exclude all ``idiots'', the insane, paupers or those
likely to become public charges, people suffering from a loathsome
or dangerous contagious disease, and criminals.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the Ellis Island wave from 1900 to 1920 _ on
one record day in 1907, 11,747 were processed _ doctors had to
examine the immigrants at breathtaking speed.
</P>
<P>
   Often the patients did not realize they were being observed by
doctors, who stood at the top of the stairs looking for signs of
heart trouble, difficulty breathing or physical disabilities. The
doctors examined each immigrant for common diseases, and then asked
them a few questions, perhaps in their native languages, to look
for the ``idiots'' and the insane.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the peak periods, they would be doing these people at a
rate of three or four per minute,'' Parascandola said.
</P>
<P>
   Patients would be marked with chalk on the shoulder _ G for
goiter, H for heart, X for mental retardation _ if doctors felt
that further examination was necessary. The mark for suspicion of
tuberculosis (then called consumption) was likely to be a P, which
stood for physical and lungs. But without a cough or an outward
sign of sickness, detecting TB was difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they didn't have a serious case and could somehow disguise
it, I'm sure in those busy years, there was a chance you could get
through,'' Parascandola said.
</P>
<P>
   In most years, 1 percent of the immigrants were denied entry,
many for medical reasons. Those with contagious diseases would be
sent to the communicable disease ward, treated until healthy and
would then be admitted. If they did not get better, the
responsibility fell on shipping companies to ship immigrants back
at company expense.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid that, the shipping companies developed clinics along
the way, said Howard Markel, author of ``Quarantine! East European
Jewish Immigrants in the New York City Epidemics of 1892'' (Johns
Hopkins University Press) and an associate professor of history and
of pediatrics and communicable diseases at the University of
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example if someone were coming from Russia, they'd be
examined at the Russian border, then again at a port like Hamburg
or Rotterdam, and maybe two more times before they crossed the
Atlantic to cut down on the incidence of imported infections,''
Markel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A rejection rate of 1 to 2 percent is pretty good. And in some
cases, the country was blaming immigrants for importing diseases
that already existed here, like tuberculosis and trachoma, an eye
disease that was much more common among American Indians and _ for
want of a better term _ hillbillies than among those populations
coming through Ellis Island.''
</P>
<P>
   When federal legislation severely restricted immigration in
1924, the United States began to do the medical inspections in the
immigrants' countries of origin when they applied for immigration
visas.
</P>
<P>
   This practice, which is still used today, dramatically changed
the role of U.S. public health officials, who began to focus on the
medical inspection of illegal aliens apprehended by the INS for
violating immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going through legal mechanisms, you're going to get
a physical exam by a physician in your home country and everything
will be above-board,'' Migliaccio said. ``It's the illegal
population we're worried about.''

ENTERING A 2ND SEASON, `THE SOPRANOS' HAS A HARD ACT TO FOLLOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If there is one thing a soprano should know, it's how
to pull off an encore.
</P>
<P>
   But for David Chase, the maestro behind ``The Sopranos,'' the
HBO mob opera that became the most wildly celebrated show of
turn-of-the-century American television, the prospect of an encore
to last season's critical and commercial triumph is bringing with
it an almost crushing burden of extravagant expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have back problems such that I can't walk,'' Chase said,
forcing a laugh as he reeled off a litany of his recent physical
woes. ``I have lip problems, problems with my chest wall. I
shouldn't say it's related to the pressure, but I think so. I
really do.''
</P>
<P>
   The return of ``The Sopranos'' to HBO this coming Sunday night
at 9 is surely the most eagerly awaited second season of a
television series in recent years. The first 13 episodes last year
were called everything from the best show of the year to the best
of the decade to even the best television show ever. HBO has waged
a promotional campaign that has underscored that praise,
capitalized it, put it in italics and shouted it from the rooftops.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Grey, who with Chase is an executive producer of the show,
said: ``You see everything HBO is doing and, to be honest, you
enjoy it in one sense. But I try to remind everyone: Let's all
remember, we're doing a television show here.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase is a veteran television writer who has worked on such
series as ``The Rockford Files'' and ``Northern Exposure.'' He
created ``The Sopranos'' from his own intensely personal vision
after years of trying to sell the story of Tony Soprano, a
strikingly human northern New Jersey mobster, and his dysfunctional
families, personal and professional, to movies and then to
television networks. He admitted he had no inkling when he wrapped
up the initial batch of episodes last January that he would soon be
at the center of a success so phenomenal he would begin receiving
fan letters from people like Stephen King and signed guitars from
Elvis Costello.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, this is beyond my wildest dreams,'' Chase said in an
interview at the Stanhope Hotel near his home in Manhattan. ``Last
year we'd be out there shooting, myself and the cast, and we'd say
to ourselves, Who's going to watch this? We were having a really
good time doing it. And I guess it's the Puritan ethic: If you're
really enjoying yourself, you're going to be punished.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, of course, Chase and his actors, James Gandolfini, who
plays Tony; Edie Falco, who plays his wife, Carmela; Nancy
Marchand, who plays his conniving mother, Livia; and many of the
others were swept away in a wave of adulation, including Emmys for
Chase (writing) and for Ms. Falco (leading actress in a drama
series).
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the hard part. Doing it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I sat down to start the second season I did have the
feeling, now what am I going to do?'' Chase said. ``And you're
aware there's a thing called a sophomore slump.'' The pressure, he
said, began to kick in fully last April, when the show became the
subject of a special event put on by the Museum of Television and
Radio in Los Angeles. It was mobbed with fans from the
entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could sit here and say, listen, I'm an artist, we artists do
things for ourselves. It's really about expressing ourselves and
pleasing ourselves,'' Chase said. ``And there's a certain truth to
that. I think you have to be somewhat true to your vision.
Otherwise you'd go crazy chasing something all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're social animals. We're like dogs. If the other dogs
turn on you, it's going to hurt. You're going to feel bad. You
don't want the rest of the pack to turn on you, the pack that first
embraced you. I'd be kidding you to say it was anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase said he and his team of writers started discussions about
framing a second season as far back as last February. The biggest
problem they faced, he said, was purely mechanical: having closed
year one with Tony's mother having organized an attempt on his
life, and the arrest of his other main antagonist, Uncle Junior,
``Suddenly Tony and his mother are not speaking,'' Chase said.
``And Uncle Junior's not there. All the things you rely on to get
through a writers' meeting to be able to go home _ `So then he
talks to his mother and they have a fight about X' _ you don't have
those anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no specific plan to write the season finale last year
with some kind of dangling plot points, Chase said. ``We kept
thinking we didn't know there'd be a next season. We've got to
shoot our best shot. We'll have to sacrifice whatever second season
there is to the first, because the first is all we have. So there
was some stuff to work out.''
</P>
<P>
   The solutions include new characters, like Tony's long-lost
sister, Janice, an exile from the counterculture (whose commune
name is the Hindu goddess Parvati), and a threatening mobster just
out of the pen, Richie Aprile. Chase said his biggest problem
remained Tony's relationship with his mother, one reason Tony was
in therapy all last season.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is it difficult to find a way to bring Tony and Livia
back even into the same room, he said, but, ``coming off the events
of last year, things happened to Tony to make him a more volatile
person.''
</P>
<P>
   While the violence quotient, which Chase said the series had
consciously tried to keep under control last season, may seem
slightly elevated as the season begins, he added, ``It's not that
we just want to pump it up and put more violence in it but that
Tony has a lot more rage.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony's rage was a factor in the one instance last season when
the show ran into some opposition from HBO, Chase said. In the
now-memorable episode where Tony takes his daughter Meadow on a
college-shopping trip to Maine and encounters a former gang member
who turned state's evidence, HBO executives vocally protested its
climax, where Tony kills his despised former colleague with his
bare hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``HBO said you can't do this,'' Chase said. ``You've built up
the most interesting protagonist on television in the past 25
years, and now you're just going to lose it. There was a big
discussion.'' He said he argued that to have Tony not kill ``a
rat'' would be so counter to his character ``that we'd lose
viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the episode was almost too good for Chase. ``I
saw it and said: Why did we do this for a TV series? This would be
such a great independent movie.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   HBO's decision to allow Tony to be seen committing brutal murder
underscored Chase's conviction that ``The Sopranos'' could have
achieved this level of success only on an outlet like HBO.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Grey, whose studio, now called Basic Entertainment,
owned the rights to the show, placed it at the Fox network. After a
pilot script, the network passed on making the series, as did CBS
and ABC. Grey says: ``The truth is I was wrong. You could never
have made this at Fox or any other network.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase said that restrictions on the wholesale vulgarity that
contributes so significantly to the show's verisimilitude would
have been the least of the problems at a network. ``I just know
they would never sit still for Tony being this ruthless guy. I know
they would have tried to make it that, on the side, he's helping
the FBI find the guys who blew up the World Trade Center. That
claptrap. That would have been horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen new episodes are in the final stages of production. HBO
has already made it clear it wants more, and Chase said he has
committed verbally to another season. ``We'll start meeting again
in February, blocking out stories.'' After that, he said, there are
a ``bunch of clauses'' for further seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this,'' Chase said. ``Who would let go of this?''
</P>
<P>
   It is a big change, he admitted, after having chafed for much of
his career at being limited mainly to television. ``All my life I
wanted to do movies. I just resented every moment I spent in
television. But I wound up in TV and it provided a good living and
I was very fortunate that I worked on really good shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for me it was always cinema, cinema, cinema. Now this has
been so good. Where am I ever going to go where it's going to be
this good again?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Cancer patients often use herbal remedies for various health
purposes, including the treatment of their disease, but they are
hesitant to share this information with their doctors, according to
Jamie S. Myers, a clinical nurse specialist at the Research Medical
Center in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   That's unfortunate, she says, because herbal therapies can
sometimes interfere with traditional treatments, making them less
effective or possibly dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that health-care professionals maintain an open
dialogue with patients so they are comfortable sharing (their use
of) alternative therapies or herbal medicines,'' Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   She addressed the issue recently at the Oncology Nursing
Society's 10th Annual Fall Institute meeting in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   People usually feel comfortable talking about prescription
drugs, and if encouraged to do so, they'll mention over-the-counter
medications, said Myers. ``But a lot of people think of herbs as a
food supplement and don't bring the subject up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians and nurses also have an obligation to learn about the
functions of herbal remedies, according to Georgia M. Decker, a
nurse practitioner at Integrative Care in Albany, N.Y., who also
spoke at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Good integrative medical programs that include herbal remedies
need to be based on a life-encouraging approach, good nutrition and
a healthy lifestyle, according to Keith Block, M.D., medical and
scientific director of Block Medical Center and the Institute for
Integrative Cancer Care in Evanston, Ill. Herbal care must also be
tailored to a patient's particular needs and biochemistry, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients need the supervision of a knowledgeable caregiver,''
said Block. If practitioners aren't careful, herbs can inhibit the
effects of chemotherapy or make it too toxic to the patient, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And only high-quality products should be used. More than half of
herbal remedies on the market are contaminated with other
substances, such as steroids, digitalis, arsenic, cadmium or lead,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, herbal medicines should not replace traditional
therapy, according to Myers. ``[However,] we want people to have
every chance of a cure and urge people to complement traditional
therapy with herbal remedies,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinical studies of the effects of herbs on cancer are lacking,
Block said. However, some of the studies that have been done show
herbs can help accelerate the death of cancer cells, cause
early-stage cancer cells to revert to healthy form or boost the
immune system, he explained. Herbs may also help slow the growth of
new blood vessels that feed a tumor or help reduce the toxicity of
chemotherapy drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Silymarin is one of the herbs least toxic to cancer patients and
one of the most important to immune function, said Block. The herb
stops liver cells from breaking down during chemotherapy
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Another herb that can help reduce chemotoxicity is ginseng, said
Block.
</P>
<P>
   However, herbs that work for one patient may not work for
another. For example, ginseng is believed to enhance estrogen
levels and theoretically could interfere with the breast cancer
drug tamoxifen, said Decker. Tamoxifen works by blocking estrogen
receptors in breast tissue.
</P>
<P>
   And the herb astragalus, which has been used to reduce the
effects of chemotherapy on healthy tissue, has caused toxicity and
death in lab animals, noted Myers. ``I would really caution people
about it until there's more evidence that it's useful and not
toxic,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Echinacea, which people take to boost the immune system, is one
of the most popular herbs on the market. However, it shouldn't be
used with methotrexate, a chemotherapy drug often used to treat a
variety of cancers, including breast, blood, bone and lung, said
Myers. Individuals should also avoid using the herb with
ketoconazole, a drug that treats fungal infections in patients with
a low white blood cell count.
</P>
<P>
   St. Johns's wort is another herb patients should take with
caution, according to Myers. The remedy is used widely in Europe to
treat anxiety and depression and is applied externally for
hemorrhoidal pain. However, it may counteract chemotherapy, said
Myers.
</P>
<P>
   People should be careful when using traditional Chinese herbal
formulas because they are usually combinations of herbs that work
synergistically; they are rarely made up of a single herb, said
Decker. These formulas sometimes are named with a number for
example, Formula 42.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, we don't know scientifically what all the effects
are,'' she said. ``We don't have the research, as we know it, to
validate the information.''
</P>
<P>
   These herbs should only be used for relieving a symptom, said
Decker. Once the symptom goes away, patients should stop taking the
herb. Patients must always have the correct diagnosis and take the
right dosage at the right time. ``The importance of taking the
right dosage at the right time escapes most people,'' she observed.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the reasons for taking Chinese herbs (as well as other
herbs) include constipation, diarrhea, depression, frequent
urination and fatigue. ``Close to none of the herbs used for these
symptoms are scientifically researched,'' said Decker. ``Most
patients kind of dabble on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more popular herbs among cancer patients are
Calmspirit and Ease2, which are supposed to help reduce stress.
Mobility3 is sometimes used by chemotherapy patients to restore a
loss of sensation in the feet, while HeadQ is often used for
headaches. Marrow Plus, which may help bone marrow cells
regenerate, is another popular herb. All preparations are made by
Health Concerns, based in Oakland, Calif. ``It's a combination
herb, so we don't know how a person will tolerate it,'' said
Decker. ``It's often used after chemotherapy, but it's still pretty
controversial.''
</P>
<P>
   When making a recommendation about an herb to a patient,
practitioners need sound scientific evidence that a compound is
safe, said Block. ``A narrow margin of safety is only okay when
research demonstrates a well-defined therapeutic effect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more research that needs to be done to see what
works for cancer treatment,'' said Myers. ``A lot of evidence is
anecdotal. There haven't been a lot of clinical trials conducted
yet.''

<P>
   Deep-space phenomena that emit X-rays are the cosmic equivalent
of extreme sports. Electromagnetic waves that are thousands of
times more energetic than the visible and ultraviolet light given
off by lazy nebulas and placidly burning stars, and invisible to
the naked eye, X-rays stream from gigantic explosions, matter
smashing together at nearly the speed of light, and gases so hot
that they cannot be detected with ordinary telescopes. If the
visible universe is a relaxing bridge match, its X-ray counterpart
is sky surfing from 30,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   This extreme universe is about to flash into view as never
before. Earth's atmosphere blocks X-rays from reaching the ground
(even though they travel a short distance through air in doctors'
offices), so they must be collected by instruments flying aboard
satellites in space. With the launching of three new X-ray
observatories in six months _ one by the United States, one by
Europe and one by Japan _ the most powerful and violent phenomena
in the universe are already beginning to give up their secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The first of those observatories, NASA's Chandra X-ray
Observatory, was put aloft by the space shuttle Columbia in July
and has just begun returning scientific data and discoveries. In
December, the European Space Agency launched its X-ray Multi-Mirror
mission, or XMM, aboard an Ariane 5 rocket and engineers are still
conducting preliminary tests of its instruments. The Japanese X-ray
satellite called Astro-E is scheduled to be launched in February.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers with a taste for the extreme can hardly wait for the
games to begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a giant leap forward in every possible
dimension,'' said Dr. Richard Mushotzky, an X-ray astronomer at
NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, who is collaborating on all
three missions. ``It's like the universe opening up to us.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their differences, X-rays and visible light are in
essence the same phenomenon: a web of electric and magnetic fields
that travels through space in the form of waves. X-rays simply have
much higher energies and shorter wavelengths than light does.
</P>
<P>
   But before Chandra's telescope, which can resolve, or see, much
finer details than any similar instrument that has ever been built,
the best available X-ray images of the sky were fuzzier than what a
good amateur telescope on the ground could produce in visible
light.
</P>
<P>
   The nub of the difficulty is that X-rays cannot be reflected by
mirrors or refracted by lenses as easily as the visible light in an
amateur telescope can. X-ray optics in the $1.5 billion Chandra
observatory rely only on glancing reflections _ otherwise the
X-rays would simply be absorbed by the mirrors rather than focused.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can actually reflect X-rays,'' said Dr. Harvey D.
Tananbaum, director of the Chandra X-ray Observatory Center at the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. ``The surfaces have to
be incredibly smooth and they have to have exactly the right
curvature.''
</P>
<P>
   The heart of Chandra's telescope resembles a huge set of highly
polished, slightly tapered, curved, soup cans, nested one inside
the other. The assembly can resolve features about half the size of
the largest ground-based telescopes can see.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers will also have their best look yet at what amount to
different ``colors'' of X-rays. Just as, in the visible spectrum,
blue light is more energetic than red light, and green and yellow
are somewhere in between, X-rays have their own rainbow of sorts,
with the highest energies emanating from the hottest and most
violent regions, and lower energies from calmer and cooler climes.
The energy spectrum also carries detailed information about the
composition, velocity, density and distance of the X-ray-emitting
gases.
</P>
<P>
   Chandra carries a spectrograph _ the equivalent of a prism _ to
sort the X-rays by energy. But XMM and Astro-E, whose images will
not be as sharp as Chandra's, will specialize in gathering the
finest and most detailed X-ray spectra ever collected from space.
XMM will have the added feature of being able to keep track of
X-ray emissions that fluctuate in intensity over a small fraction
of a second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chandra will detect sources and know their positions very
accurately,'' said Dr. Nicholas White, deputy project scientist for
Astro-E and an astrophysicist at Goddard, where the Japanese
spacecraft's main spectrograph was designed and built.
</P>
<P>
   ``Astro-E and XMM will come along and get very good spectra,''
he said. ``When they are combined together you get the whole
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   The very first images from Chandra have provided a taste of
things to come. The unparalleled sharpness of the images has given
astronomers their best view yet of the shrapnel-like remnants that
are thrown off when a giant star explodes and of the hot,
X-ray-emitting jets of material that tear through surrounding gases
at the centers of galaxies and clusters of galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   In its most captivating and surreal image so far, Chandra has
also revealed a top-like formation of blazing-hot gases at the core
of the Crab nebula, the glowing debris of a nearby star whose
explosion was recorded by Chinese astronomers almost a thousand
years ago. The structure may be aligned with the axis of the
spinning cinder, called a pulsar, that is believed to have been
created in the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Magnetic fields whipped around by the pulsar's spin are probably
the energy source of the Crab nebula's glow as seen in visible
light, infrared radiation and radio emissions. The top-like
structure may reveal just how this powerhouse works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Already in Chandra we've seen things that have only been
hypothesized before,'' said Mushotzky, of Goddard.
</P>
<P>
   As the X-ray observatories move into full swing, said Dr.
Wallace Tucker, an astrophysicist and the spokesman for the Chandra
X-ray Observatory Center, their main areas of scientific emphasis
might be described as ``the big, the bad and the beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Under ``big,'' he places galaxy clusters, which are the largest
structures in the universe, that are held together by gravity and
which containing huge amounts of X-ray emitting gas. The new
telescopes can see that gas from farther away than ever before,
shedding light on how the clusters formed in the young universe.
Such studies can also provide clues on the origin and fate of the
universe as a whole.

MARTIN BUBER AND THE SEATTLE RIOTS

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Of all the events of recent months, none surprised the media as
much as the riots in Seattle around the World Trade Organization
talks.
 &HT;    For days following the initial outbreak of violence, pundits
were oddly silent, unable to interpret what they were seeing. World
political leaders, economists and trade advocates versus
environmentalists, human rights activists and labor?
 &HT;    Laid-back, successful Seattle? What could have caused such a
thing?
 &HT;    Although Seattle may be receding in memory as just one more 1999
news story, I would like to nominate it as last year's top religion
story. Indeed, when pundits look back on the first decade of the
twenty-first century, they may choose Seattle as the event that
initiated a new chapter of American ethics and spirituality.
 &HT;    The riots, sparked by a small anarchist group, made the
headlines. However, a large contingent of attendees went to Seattle
out of religious conviction. Roman Catholic nuns and priests,
liberal Protestants, progressive evangelicals, Jews and Buddhists
converged on Seattle to protest industrialized globalization and
its disregard for the dignity of creation.
 &HT;    One of the least-reported aspects of contemporary religion is
the greening of spirituality. Since the 1970s, religious belief and
environmentalism have converged on a number of fronts.
 &HT;    Americans have embraced a host of spiritualities honoring
nature: Wicca, Native American practices, and eastern religions.
Writers like Annie Dillard and Wendell Berry extol the vision of
God in creation. Even rather stuffy Christian organizations, such
as the National Council of Churches, have pursued ``green''
agendas.
 &HT;    Christian saints who embody ecological wholeness, like St.
Francis of Assisi and Hildegard of Bingen, enjoy surprising
popularity. And Jewish scholars cull the Hebrew scriptures to find
new understandings of early Israel as a people serving the land.
 &HT;    All this contrasts sharply with the past. Historically, western
religions have been ambivalent or hostile to nature. Some scholars
even attribute the environmental crisis to western religion. The
Bible, it is widely held, taught humanity to ``dominate'' the
earth. Backed by God's command to subdue nature, western Europeans
wreacked ecological havoc on the world.
 &HT;    Seattle proved that religious belief is not at enmity with the
earth. Those wanting to ``dominate'' the earth were the politicians
and economists. Among those wanting to save it were many thousands
of religious people.
 &HT;    Typically, Wiccans, Buddhists, Roman Catholics and Presbyterians
do not have much in common. But in Seattle they joined forces for
human rights and the rights of all nature: for slaves, debt relief,
humane labor conditions; for clean air, sea turtles and rain
forests.
 &HT;    Diverse groups laid aside theological difference for common
cause: if we lose the earth, we lose everything.
 &HT;    What traditional Christians are finally realizing -- and why
they can join with others in this cause -- is that there is no
fundamental divide between ``man'' and ``nature.'' For nearly two
millennia, this dualism reigned in the West. Humanity was ``above''
the rest of creation, thus superior to it.
 &HT;    But a new message has gotten through. All creation -- humanity
included -- is connected. We are all part of a divine ecosystem,
God's habitat. Everyone, everything in the world is kin.
 &HT;    In his influential ``I and Thou,'' Jewish theologian Martin
Buber depicted relationship as the basis of all religious ethics.
When something is defined as an ``It'' -- a separate and outside
entity -- human beings feel justified in abusing it. But when
things as defined as ``Thou'' -- things possessing a fundamental
dignity of their own -- a relationship of mutual respect ensues.
 &HT;    Thus, ``I-Thou'' is the starting point for true spirituality.
``In the beginning,'' Buber wrote, ``there is relation.''
 &HT;    Seattle was not an outbreak of isolated rowdiness or
eco-terrorism. Seattle was a clash between two worldviews: those
who see nature as an ``It'' and those who see it as a ``Thou.'' On
a street in front of Starbucks, those concerned with the utility of
things versus those concerned with the dignity of creation played
out the future.
 &HT;    And it is the future. Jane Goodall says, ``If only we can
overcome cruelty, human and animal, with love and compassion shall
we stand at the threshold of a new era in human moral and spiritual
evolution -- and realize, at last, our most unique quality:
humanity.''
 &HT;    In other words, by embracing ``I-Thou,'' the world has a chance
to survive.
 &HT;    Through the broken glass of Nordstrom, we glimpse a new hope --
a hope to overcome division, a hope for peace, a hope for genuine
global community. And this community is not tied together by the
Internet, but it is linked in its common divinity.
 &HT;    Looking past the violent minority, Seattle demonstrated there
are more ``I-Thou'' folks than I dared hope.

 UNDATED: a whole.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tucker's ``bad'' category includes black holes, collapsed
objects whose gravity pulls gas from the surrounding space, heats
it and whips it up to tremendous speeds. And among his
``beautiful'' subjects of study are young stars, which tend to be
much more active and unruly than the middle-aged sun, crackling
with X-ray flares and other energetic emissions.
</P>
<P>
   By examining those stars, Tucker said, ``we should be able to
get a good feeling for what our young sun was like when the
building blocks for life were being built up on Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   While the early images from Chandra have been hailed as the
first steps on that scientific path, they have been a long time
coming. Astronomers conceived the idea of flying an X-ray telescope
of Chandra's size more than 20 years ago. But in the 1980s, as the
project gathered momentum, it suffered through lean budgets and
delays caused by unrelated NASA setbacks like the Challenger
explosion and the initially flawed optics of the Hubble Space
Telescope.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the 1990s, the Chandra mission was reduced in scope for
budget reasons. Finally, Chandra _ named after the late Subramanyan
Chandrasekhar, an astrophysicist who shared the 1983 Nobel Prize in
Physics _ was released from Columbia's cargo bay on July 23.
``Houston, we have a good deploy,'' said Col. Eileen M. Collins,
the mission commander, in high NASA-speak as the satellite drifted
into space.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker conceded that bringing the project to fruition had
``taken a lot longer than the X-ray astronomers expected.''
</P>
<P>
   They could soon be facing an embarrassment of riches. Since the
launching of the $750 million XMM from French Guyana on Dec. 10, a
basic checkout of the spacecraft's systems was ``all perfect,''
said Dr. Fred Jansen, an astrophysicist at the European Space
Agency, who is the mission's project scientist.
</P>
<P>
   A complete commissioning of all the on-board instruments began
last week, with the first science images scheduled to be taken on
the first of March _ an event that Jansen referred to as ``first
light.''
</P>
<P>
   XMM will collect X-rays within an area that is between 5 and 20
times as large as Chandra's, making it especially useful for
collecting spectra from faint, extended objects, like distant
galaxies, Jansen said. Because of an ability to reorient itself
quickly, XMM will also study the rapid cosmic explosions called
gamma ray bursts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before XMM opens its eyes, it should be joined in space by
Astro-E, which is scheduled for launching from Japan on Feb. 8,
said Dr. Stephen S. Holt, an astrophysicist at Goddard, who is the
mission's project scientist in the United States. American
collaborators on the project estimate that it will cost $300
million to build and launch the satellite, although they caution
that accounting practices vary greatly among spacefaring nations,
making direct comparisons difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most powerful instruments on Astro-E is a
cryogenically cooled spectrometer that was designed and built at
Goddard, Holt said. Before its coolant runs out in about two years,
astronomers hope, Astro-E's spectrometer will collect the most
finely resolved X-ray spectra ever seen from space.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big contribution of Astro-E is the energy resolution,''
Holt said, noting that it would provide a correspondingly
fine-grained view of the composition, density and temperature of
the hot gas, wherever it might be in the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers caution that while they have a long list of known
objects to study, all previous missions have turned up unexpected
finds, beginning with the discovery of the first cosmic X-ray
source in 1962. Those spacecraft, with names like Uhuru, Einstein,
Rosat, Asca and the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, have made
discoveries that included a mysterious background of X-rays in
space and complex pulsations emanating from black holes and neutron
stars.
</P>
<P>
   The most important discoveries of the new fleet of X-ray
observatories are likely to be objects whose existence is
unsuspected, these astronomers say.
</P>
<P>
   And the quest to understand the extreme universe will not end
with the latest mission. White, of Goddard, is involved in an
effort to build an X-ray observatory so powerful that it will be
able to capture an image of an individual black hole, a task that
will require a spatial resolution at least a million times as much
as Chandra's.
</P>
<P>
   Black holes are so massive that they are shrouded in a so-called
event horizon, a boundary from which nothing inside can escape, not
even light, X-rays or any other kind of radiation. The goal, White
said, would be to resolve the dark silhouette of an event horizon
against the superhot gases swirling around it.
</P>
<P>
   The feat would probably require a fleet of up to 32 identical
X-ray satellites flying in formation and staring at the centers of
galaxies, where supermassive black holes are thought to be lurking,
White said.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes that the first stage in that quest, a four-satellite
package called Constellation-X, will be in space by 2008 with a
cost of around $600 million to build and launch it.
</P>
<P>
   In the new millennium, the extreme universe could become one of
the most popular of spectator sports.

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Ugh, the crud! You've got it. Coughing, sneezing,
aches, pains, the whole nine yards.
</P>
<P>
   So you take the pills and you drink the fluids and you stay home
from work.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you fall asleep every 45 minutes, you still need
something to do when you're conscious _ with or without
accompanying children, partners, pets or telemarketers. A few
guilty pleasures to distract you from the microbial battle raging
within.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some, serious and silly, culled from the wheezing,
hacking ranks of The Dayton Daily News features staff:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Forget your January diet. Your throat is sore. Nothing goes
down better than ice cream, and we're not talking frozen yogurt.
Maybe some Haagen-Dazs Dulce de Leche. A whole pint. Just for you.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Two words: Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Two more words: spiked tea.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Let your dog or cat find the room's sun spots, then kick them
out and nap there yourself.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Memorize a passage from ``Valley of the Dolls'' for use in
demanding pills from your doctor.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Magazines are made for sick days. Start with Vanity Fair for
slick, no-redeeming-social-value reading; when your head starts to
ache from the tiny type, switch to In Style, one of those
publications in which the words don't really matter.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Body paint with Vick's Vap-O-Rub.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Circuit training for the sick: Start from bed, give TV remote
a workout, move to couch, pause for medication, call your mom and
whine about how lousy you feel, make soup, get out new Kleenex box,
take temperature and nap. Feel the burn?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Watch back-to-back episodes of Dating Story, Baby Story and
Wedding Story on the TLC cable channel (starting at 1:30 p.m.).
They're entertaining, but you'll be hard-pressed not to feel like a
loser if you're not dating, married or a parent-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sucrets: You'll be eating them like candy.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Gingerroot: Slice and add to pot of water. Bring to boil. Pour
into mug and add sugar or honey. The peppery taste will soothe your
throat and clear your sinuses.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Look for Sneezers, a new super-soft tissue featuring colorful
Sesame Street and Rugrats characters on the box. The tissues, also
available in pocket packs, sell for less than $1.69. You can also
sneeze with Barbie and with Blues Clues by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Gargle with salt water.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Take your coffee-table art books to bed with you and look at
the pictures. Don't read the text. Don't try to learn anything,
just enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Stop licking your lips: Constant wetting and drying sucks
moisture from lips' outer layer, causing them to feel dry, which
prompts more licking.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Get out the board games and card games, set up a giant family
jigsaw puzzle, start a building project with Legos or Lincoln Logs.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Check out The Christopher Lowell Show (Discovery Channel, noon
and 3 p.m. weekdays). The engaging host redecorates a room, leads
you through a do-it-yourself project and makes a meal, all within
an hour. Makes it possible to believe you can do anything with a
staple gun and a dream.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A pediatric nurse shares an easy way to remember the foods we
can begin to eat after an intestinal virus: Just think of the word
BRAT (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast).
</P>

   There now, don't you feel better?

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Somebody forgot to tell Annie Bonaparte that you
need money to get things done. Not that she'd turn it down, if
anybody has some to give away.
</P>
<P>
   As program director of the Roosevelt/Westwood Neighborhood
Association, she knows that money would go a long way toward
improving the lives of the people who live there: seniors on fixed
incomes, single parents and young people with drug addictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many problems in this community,'' she says.
``Mental and physical problems, helplessness, hopelessness.''
</P>
<P>
   But building community is an inexpensive proposition as
neighborhood projects go. The key is to convince people that they
have something to offer their neighbors. That sense of empowerment
builds on itself. It shows people, as Bonaparte says, that ``even
if I'm poor, I can give something.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonaparte has been bringing people together in
Roosevelt/Westwood for almost 30 years. It was her spark that
energized a senior-teen oral history project, created a college
scholarship program and started a home weatherization-fixup
project. At Dayton City Commission meetings, she is a voice for
people who live in the modest houses in troubled areas of Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   But it was her friend Margaret Knapke who suggested to her that
community healing could happen literally, as well as
metaphorically.
</P>
<P>
   Knapke is a practitioner of an ancient form of hands-on healing
called Reiki, which probably originated in Tibet. The word means
``universal energy,'' and Knapke uses the analogy of an extension
cord to describe how it works: She is the cord and the energy flows
through her to the person she touches. It is based on the belief
that the human body is more than just matter; it is an extended
energy system.
</P>
<P>
   Knapke says Reiki can ease physical pain, promote relaxation and
increase physical and creative energy. Bonaparte believes it can
help her neighbors with their ailments: seniors with diabetes and
cancer; young people who are fighting addictions; children who
can't seem to sit still in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Knapke began to teach Reiki to neighborhood
residents, three to five at a time. They have agreed to ``pay'' for
their training with 15 hours of community service, by practicing
Reiki on others in the neighborhood. ``That's one thing I love
about it,'' Knapke says. ``It's so democratic. Anybody can learn to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand what Reiki might do for a neighorhood like
Roosevelt/Westwood, it's important to know first what it did for
Bonaparte, and the healing journey she made after a fall down a
long flight of stairs.
</P>
<P>
   That fall, in 1974, left her with a bad back and chronic pain
that 19 surgeries couldn't alleviate. At times, she says, ``I was
laying up in a hospital, listening to people tell me what I
couldn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   About 10 years ago, she met Jeff Epton, former publisher of the
alternative newspaper Impact Weekly, through their mutual community
activism. ``I was just whipped, and he offered to give Margaret
(advertising) space in his paper in exchange for my (Reiki)
treatments.'' At the time, Bonaparte held neighborhood youth group
meetings in her living room. Epton had no distribution points for
his papers, because there were no businesses in the
Roosevelt/Westwood. So he paid the kids to pass them out to the
residents.
</P>
<P>
   It is another example of what Bonaparte has learned, and taught,
over the years: Community is more about sharing heart than sharing
geography.
</P>
<P>
   Knapke taught Bonaparte to give herself Reiki treatments, and,
four years after learning it, Bonaparte uses it every day, in
addition to massage, meditation and prayer. ``I can greet you with
a smile on my face, standing straight up.'' She does that, and
throws in a hug, too.
</P>
<P>
   She's on hand when Knapke holds Reiki sessions in the
neighborhood association's newly renovated office, a house that
still has boards over the windows.
</P>
<P>
   In one room, a woman lies fully clothed on a portable table
covered by a flowered sheet. A pillow is under her knees. Knapke
offers instruction to another volunteer, who places his palms
gently over the eyes of the woman. Reiki is not a form of massage;
as a matter of fact, it can work without ever touching the
recipient, Knapke says. She calls it ``thinking with your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   A complete treatment may take an hour or more. When it's over, a
person may feel a little disoriented, dizzy, warm, relaxed or
energized. Results differ with the individual.
</P>
<P>
   But the benefits of Reiki have been documented by medical
studies, according to Dr. Narinder Saini, medical director of the
Community Hospital Coronary Prevention and Rehabilitation Center in
Springfield, and medical director of the Ohio Academy of Holistic
Health. Although not a Reiki practitioner himself, he recommends
Reiki and other holistic treatments for stress management, improved
mental attitude and to accelerate healing from surgery. In fact, he
underwent three Reiki treatments for short-term back pain. The pain
went away, and never returned.
</P>
<P>
   He warns, though, that Reiki should be used as a supplement, not
a substitute, for conventional medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Smith, a Roosevelt/Westwood neighborhood resident who
learned Reiki several months ago, says it has helped her with the
stress of going through a divorce. She has used it on her
4-year-old daughter, too, whom she describes as ``hyper.'' ``I
think it will be a big help to lots of younger kids in the
neighborhood, to calm them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Knapke is in the early stages of forming a nonprofit
organization called the Vital Resources Reiki Project, which would
teach Reiki where she believes it is most needed: in disadvantaged
communities. She has taught Reiki in El Salvador to victims of rape
and torture. AIDS organizations have used Reiki, as have hospices
and residential treatment facilities. ``The applications are
infinite,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In Roosevelt/Westwood, it's happening without government grants
or piles of paper work. ``People who give money, they want to see,
touch and measure. I don't have time for that,'' Bonaparte says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to liven it up, to heal it up,'' Bonaparte
says.
</P>
<P>
   And to pass it on.

 &HT;    Telemedicine is here and promises better health care
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The wasted time begins even before the patient
reaches the doctor's waiting room. Just calling for an appointment
involves busy signals and on-hold purgatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can make an appointment with the first call, they
figure the clerks aren't busy enough so they've got to lay someone
off,'' says Dr. Rudy Arnold, president of the Miami Valley Health
Improvement Council.
</P>
<P>
   Time is spent driving to the doctor's office, waiting in the
waiting room, waiting in the exam room for the nurse, waiting for
the doctor, waiting again for the nurse, waiting to pay, driving to
the pharmacy, waiting for the prescription, driving back to work
and catching up with messages from the half-day's lost
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this is unavoidable. But the majority of health-care
visits are for chronic conditions _ arthritis, diabetes, clogged
arteries, that sort of thing _ and our drive-and-wait method of
treating them is inordinately expensive to patients, health plans
and employers. As the oldest baby boomers approach 55, University
of Illinois researchers concluded this fall that the system is not
just inefficient but utterly inadequate to handle the upcoming
volume of chronic illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   That is where telemedicine comes in, says Arnold, who practiced
primary care and managed hospitals for the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   It's done over computers. The patient, still at work or at home,
sees the doctor's face on his or her monitor. The doctor sees the
patient and also the patient's medical record and recent tests.
Arnold says equipment already is available that would enable the
doctor to look down a patient's throat or hear a heartbeat through
a stethoscope.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the doctor writes a prescription, it goes directly to the
pharmacy's computer,'' Arnold says. ``Lab test orders go to the
lab, and results go back to the doctor's e-mail. Any special
instructions go straight to the patient's printer. The loss from
work is 10 to 15 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   He's talking only about chronic conditions, remember. ``I'm not
trying to replace all visits. But if I'm normally seeing a patient
four to six times a year, and now I only have to see them once or
twice in person, all of a sudden I've made it easier on the
patient, it's more affordable, I've given better service and I've
given better care.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, better care. What the doctor needs to treat a chronic
problem is data. ``If I get that,'' Arnold says, ``the fact that I
shook their hand or didn't is relatively academic.'' And a computer
can handle and analyze more data than any human in a white coat.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I listen to that heartbeat through the computer, I can
also watch it. I can run it against all the standards, and I get a
printout that says this guy's got a problem that I might not have
noticed just listening. That's an improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Face-to-face contact is essential in assessing a patient, but
telemedicine can improve even that. The doctor not only sees the
patient's face on the monitor, but also the patient's face from six
previous visits. ``I can now see subtle differences that I would
never have been able to see before,'' Arnold says.
</P>
<P>
   This is not sci-fi pie in the sky. Telemedicine already is here.
It's used in some prisons for the doctor's safety. The University
of Texas uses it for children with chronic problems in poor, rural
areas and has actually found an increase in eye contact. The U.S.
Department of Agriculture is giving out $20 million in grants and
more than $200 million in loans this year for telecommunications
technology that improves health care and education in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Primary-care doctors and specialists often exchange data by
computer modem already, Arnold says, ``but we've left the patients
kind of out of the loop. Gosh, that's where we can really make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Snowbirds could reach their northern doctors from Florida in the
winter. Moms wouldn't have to drag little kids to germy waiting
rooms. Physicians could eliminate some costly overhead and
time-consuming administration and concentrate on medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Some local doctors and HMOs are willing to start a pilot
telemedicine program, Arnold says. Now he needs an employer, one
with an old enough work force that it's losing noticeable
productivity to visits for chronic conditions. The question isn't
if, but when.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect at the end of one year, the changes would be
sufficient that pretty soon doctors would be putting their own
practices at risk by not being part of it,'' Arnold says.
``Primary-care telemedicine is going to revolutionize the way we
deliver health care.''

 &HT;    Celebrities give us all hope: We can lose weight, too
 &HT;    (EDS: Runs with FATCHAT.)
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Fat is the great equalizer: It doesn't
care whether you're rich or poor, renowned or unknown, beautiful or
plain.
</P>
<P>
   Which helps explain why weight-loss programs crave high-profile
spokespeople.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the famous face does is focus people on the fact that
somebody famous did it, but you can too,'' says Marcie
Gorman-Gordley, president and CEO of Weight Watchers, whose most
noteworthy shill is Sarah Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Monica Lewinsky became the latest boldface dieter.
The former federal witness' brand new bag: Spokesperson for Jenny
Craig. Her first TV commercials will continue through March.
</P>
<P>
   Given the media's hunger for Lewinsky news, ``we feel we can
reach more people than ever before,'' says Brian Luscomb,
communications director for Jenny Craig.
</P>
<P>
   The Slim-Fast stable of stars has included wacky telethon host
Jerry Lewis, Regis sidekick Kathie Lee Gifford and baseball skipper
Tommy Lasorda. TV actress Susan Saint James has pitched Diet
Center. But the true heavyweights of testimonials are Weight
Watchers and Jenny Craig.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers _ and the media _ pay more attention to celebrity names,
Gorman-Gordley says. ``I've been doing this for many, many years,
but if I fly into town, nobody cares. If Fergie flies into town,
she gets noticed.''

 &HT;    A skeptic's experience with Reiki
 &HT;    By Kathy Whyde Jesse
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ I am not a person who finds it easy to relax. But
I fell asleep on the Reiki table.
</P>
<P>
   Under Margaret Knapke's touch, I drifted pleasantly in and out
of consciousness, aware of where and how I was being touched, but
unaware of how much time was passing.
</P>
<P>
   When I finally sat up, I was amazed that an hour and a half had
gone by.
</P>
<P>
   Knapke began the session by asking about any health problems I
might be having. She wrote down the information in a notebook.
</P>
<P>
   I laid on my back on a comfortable, cushioned table, my shoes
off, with a pillow under my knees. Knapke covered the windows to
keep out some of the light, then asked whether I wanted soft music
or a glass of water before she began.
</P>
<P>
   She started at my feet, pressing into the soles, then pulling my
legs so that my hips came off the table.
</P>
<P>
   I was free to keep my eyes open or to close them. If I wanted to
talk, or if something felt uncomfortable, I was encouraged to let
her know. I didn't want to talk, and everything felt great.
</P>
<P>
   I did open my eyes occasionally, and I saw that Knapke's eyes
were closed. Sometimes, she wasn't touching me at all, but she was
making wide sweeping gestures over my torso, as if gathering up an
invisible sheet that covered me.
</P>
<P>
   She gradually worked her way up my body, massaging my abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't work on every part of my body. I didn't roll over on
my stomach.
</P>
<P>
   She finished with my head and neck, spending a great deal of the
session on these areas. She rubbed a circular pattern into the top
of my head, lifted my head to rub the top of my neck with her
thumbs (I think). She stuck a finger into each of my ears and
rubbed.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, I sat up for a few moments without trying to
stand. I felt warm and tingly, although not really dizzy. Knapke
encouraged me to stick around for a while until I was sure I was
able to drive.
</P>
<P>
   I felt relaxed, yet energized. Ready to take on the world,
although the day's headaches didn't seem nearly as daunting as they
had an hour and a half ago.

FIRM FACES LAST LEG OF HUMAN GENOME PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Md.) (nk) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Celera Corp. of Rockville, Md., said Monday it was about to
begin the final stage in its project to decode the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   It has analyzed some 10 million fragments of human DNA, each
about 500 chemical units in length, and is now ready to assemble
them into a complete human genome, said Dr. J. Craig Venter, the
company's president.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly requires comparing each DNA fragment to the 10 million
others and will be a prodigious calculating task, expected to take
Celera's supercomputer about three months. If successful, it will
represent a remarkable achievement for a company that was founded
only in May 1998, and since then has built a plant with 300
sequencing machines and the largest known civilian computer.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledge of the full sequence, or order of the DNA units, in
the human genome is expected eventually to change the practice of
medicine, yielding the entire book of instructions for programming
the human organism and enabling diseases to be approached at the
genetic level.
</P>
<P>
   Genome assembly, the step that Celera is about to begin, has
been viewed as a formidable obstacle because animal genomes are
shot through with repeats _ numerous copies of stretches of DNA
with the almost identical sequence. Like identical pieces of a
jigsaw puzzle, the repeats are highly confusing to assembly
programs.
</P>
<P>
   But Celera's chief scientists _ Dr. Hamilton O. Smith, Dr. Mark
Adams and Dr. Eugene Myers _ have developed techniques for bridging
the repeat regions and bringing at least some of them under
control. A pilot project to decode the genome of the laboratory
fruit fly was completed last year, validating the computer program
Myers had written. He has said he expects the human genome to prove
easier in principle than the fruit fly, because its repeats are
more dissimilar from each other.
</P>
<P>
   Venter said that in addition to Celera's own sequence data he
will also use the information developed by Celera's rival, the
public consortium of academic centers in the United States and
Britain, which has been working to sequence the human genome since
1989.
</P>
<P>
   The two sets of data will be assembled independently, he said,
because of possibly differing levels of accuracy. Celera is
sequencing the DNA of a single anonymous man (males are genomically
more interesting because they have both an X and a Y chromosome;
females only X's) while the public consortium is sequencing a
mosaic genome in which different segments come from different
anonymous individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The human genome is at least 3 billion bases of DNA in length,
and calculations suggest it needs to be sequenced some six times
over for a fully accurate assembly to be made.
</P>
<P>
   Because Celera's 10 million sequenced fragments include a total
of only 5.3 billion bases, the company at present has achieved less
than two-fold coverage but as the computer run proceeds it can add
new data from both its own sequencing machines and the data
published by the public consortium. By the time the two assembly
runs are completed, Venter said, he expects both to be working with
a four-fold coverage, and the results can then be combined.
</P>
<P>
   Because Celera and the public consortium are taking different
but complementary approaches to decoding the human genome, it would
be logical for them to collaborate. But merger talks that began
last year have petered out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said from the start we would welcome collaboration but
the idea has never developed any momentum,'' said Tony White, the
chief executive of the PE Corp., which owns Celera. ``There is a de
facto collaboration in that we have access to the public data, as
we should.''
</P>
<P>
   Though critics have questioned whether the public consortium
should continue its work if Celera completes the human genome,
there seem several reasons for pressing ahead. First, Celera's
ambitious assembly algorithm might not work, leaving the company
with millions of tiny pieces and no genome. Second, Venter implied
Monday that once Celera's assembly is finished he will declare
victory and move on to the mouse genome, an essential project for
interpreting the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   Although a completed assembly would probably yield almost all
the human genes, the part of interest to pharmaceutical companies,
it seems that long stretches of human chromosomes, notable the
middle and end sections, cannot be decoded by present methods.
Biologists who wish to know every letter in the human genetic code
will almost certainly have to rely on the public consortium..
</P>
<P>
   A third justification for the consortium's work is that of
public access. Although the consortium makes all its data
immediately available, Celera is not obliged to release anything.
Venter said he would publish an article on the finished human
genome, release the ``consensus human genome'' on a DVD disk, and
give academic biologists a cut-rate subscription to Celera's data
base (rates for pharmaceutical companies are $50 million a year).
</P>
<P>
   Many academic biologists would doubtless prefer having their own
free data base than having to depend on Celera's largesse. Also,
much of the interest of the human genome is likely to lie not in
the sequence which is common to all humans but in the DNA sites
where individuals have a unit that differs from the consensus
sequence. It is these variations, known as SNP's, for single
nucleotide polymorphisms, that make each individual unique and are
the basis for a projected new drug system known as
pharmacogenomics.

 &HT;    Talking the fat away via the Internet
 &HT;    (EDS: Runs with LOSING-WEIGHT.)
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Here's one sure way for a computer to
help you lose weight: Hoist it over your head while jogging 5 miles
a day.
</P>
<P>
   (And we mean a full-sized model, not some wimpy laptop.)
</P>
<P>
   But if you'd rather not be labeled the town loon, try this
instead: Log on and just talk about losing weight. To folks you
don't even know.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anonymity is what makes it so easy for me to be honest,''
admits a woman who checks into iVillage.com's diet and fitness chat
room several times a week for what she calls ``a motivational
tuneup.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, `I lost my mind and ate an entire bowl of mashed
potatoes while cleaning up the kitchen,' and 20 people remind me
that it's not the end of the world and that I'm not the only one
(battling a weight problem).
</P>
<P>
   ``Misery does love company,'' she writes. ``But it loves support
even more.''
</P>
<P>
   That surge of same-boat motivation, fitness experts say, is one
reason why interactive tools _ such as chat rooms, message boards,
e-mail correspondence, and online workout and nutrition logs _ are
the newest weapons in the weight-loss arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Other reasons include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Accountability, such as a personal trainer who reviews your
exercise journal once a week or a ``support buddy'' (an electronic
pen pal with similar goals) whom you message each night;
</P>
<P>
   _ Targeted data, whether it be advice on how to train for a
marathon or how to get started if you've got 100 pounds or more to
lose;
</P>
<P>
   _ Daily reminders, such as an e-mail or phone call (with a taped
message), that feature a motivational saying;
</P>
<P>
   _ Fun feedback, including charts and graphs that show your
progress (and that you can print out and tape to your bathroom
mirror);
</P>
<P>
   _ Links to other sites, which run the gamut from university
medical libraries to a gym in your hometown.
</P>
<P>
   But first, some common sense: You can't, of course, expect
results if you sit in front of a screen for hours nibbling chips.
Bottom line is _ like it always is _ you have to eat less and move
more. Period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typing just doesn't burn enough calories,'' jokes Adell Maher,
a New York-based counselor who specializes in eating disorders.
``In all seriousness, however, I think most people know what they
need to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's saying that these sites are a solution. They're a
tool, and they seem to be helping a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   And, predictably, there are a lot of sites.
</P>
<P>
   Some are free, making their money through advertising, selling
you products and/or forwarding your personal stats to marketers.
Examples: eFit.com and Cyberdiet.com.
</P>
<P>
   Others, which may offer one-on-one sessions with a nutritionist
or trainer and weekly monitoring of your progress, can range from
$9 to $35 a month. Examples: eDiets.com and fitnessbyday.com
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a host of other sites not limited to diet and fitness
_ such as iVillage.com, sixdegrees.com and webwidesales.com _
feature weight-loss discussion groups, articles on specific diets
(i.e., Atkins) and links to even more information.
</P>
<P>
   It's interaction, however _ not information alone _ that boosts
success, researchers say. Like chat rooms and message boards or, in
the case of a recent Brown University study, direct advice.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's medical school found that after three months, patients
who received e-mail feedback from a behavior modification expert
lost an average of 6 pounds more than patients who just had online
access to weight-loss articles and resources.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Tate, Brown research associate, says experts are trying
to devise support methods with ``minimal face-to-face contact.''
Like fitnessbyday, a site run by Boston-based personal trainer
Brian Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't necessarily have to have someone right beside you to
motivate you,'' says Day, who charges $35 a month to monitor
members' weekly updates, which include workout logs and other
``accountability methods.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, you can lie. But then, what's the point?
</P>
<P>
   ``My members as a rule,'' he says, ``are painfully honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Another interactive tool is a chat room, where members talk in
``real time.'' In other words, it's like having an animated dinner
party conversation: Sometimes it's hard to keep up; certain folks
talk more than others; and the subject at hand isn't always the
subject being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   One person, for instance, asks about low-carb diets. Another
says low-carb diets are popular in Chicago. A third says she's an
elementary schoolteacher in Chicago. A fourth says he's a teacher,
too, but in New Hampshire. Then the first person returns to ask
where in New Hampshire because she has an aunt there.
</P>
<P>
   Moderator can help exchanges
</P>
<P>
   You get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The downside of a chat room is that it usually lacks focus
unless a specific topic is scheduled and lead by a moderator,''
says Charles Epstein, president of BackBone Inc., a high-tech
marketing firm in Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're an acquired talent, and some people have to get up
courage to participate. The good thing is, you don't go in with the
trepidation you might feel in an encounter group. Here, you can go
in and feel perfectly comfortable to express yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   But not outrageously comfortable. The best sites are closely
monitored for derogatory comments, absurd advice, solicitors or
folks trolling for dates. Your member name _ for example, DIETER99
or MOM.OF.TWO _ can be rendered invalid if you're a jerk. Access
denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never once seen anything offensive,'' says Jill Johnson,
whose fitness Web site, oxycise.com, includes a message board.
``Instead, people are overwhelmingly positive. I'm like Richard
Simmons. Sometimes I'll start crying reading people's stories.''
</P>
<P>
   A message board, unlike a chat room, isn't in real time.
Instead, you post an electronic ``stickie'' for folks to read and
respond to publicly (or privately, if you wish). Most sites clear
boards every few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have chat rooms,'' says Charles Platkin, president
and CEO of eFit.com, ``because they're not typically where people
develop supportive relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Another difference is that members tend to swap one-liners in a
chat room but talk more in-depth on a board.
</P>
<P>
   The choice, of course, is yours.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to find what motivates you to get UP from the
keyboard and change your life,'' Platkin says. ``It's not as simple
as having someone say, `Go take a walk.' ``
</P>
<P>
   In quest of streamlined site
</P>
<P>
   Efit.com, in fact, offers an unusual motivational tool _ a free
before-and-after ``morphing'' program that alters a photo you
submit to show a slimmer you. Not in a dramatic way (you won't pop
up as a supermodel), but subtlely.
</P>
<P>
   What's next, a robot blocking your fridge?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to get overwhelmed by all this, so you should look
for a streamlined site that targets your specific needs,'' says
Gregory Florez, Salt Lake City-based personal trainer and spokesman
for the American Council on Exercise. His site, fitadvisor.com,
will launch Jan. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't change their behavior if they have to do too many
clicks. That gives them an excuse to take a break, get up and go to
the vending machine. It's like having to drive too far to the gym.
People look for ways to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Another potential downside, besides information overload, is
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can put on a lab coat and be an expert,'' Florez says.
``Look for real clinical and scientific background. Dig deeper than
the hype and look for case studies and testimonials before you
accept anyone's advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, if you wish, just chat and take it for what it's worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing a doctor to lose 150 pounds, so I already have an
eating plan and workout schedule,'' writes an iVillage.com member
who turns to the site's diet chat room when she feels the urge to
overindulge. ``But what I need is someone who knows how it feels to
weigh 300 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always somebody (in the chat room), even in the middle
of the night. It's like a 24-hour friend who never judges you, just
cheers you on.''
</P>
<P>
   Florez, like most diet and fitness experts, agrees that online
camaraderie, support and information can be powerful as part of an
overall battle plan to improve your lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be realistic and totally honest with yourself,''
he says. ``None of this stuff will do anything for you if you don't
get off the couch.''

 &HT;    MILITARY MEDICINE SAID TO OWE UP TO $1 BILLION TO CONTRACTORS
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The military health care system is being dunned by
the contractors who run the bulk of its Tricare health plans for
hundreds of millions of dollars in allegedly unpaid bills.
</P>
<P>
   The money is primarily for medical services the contractors say
they have provided to military retirees and their dependents and
the dependents of active duty personnel, according to the National
Association for the Uniformed Services (NAUS), a military advocacy
group.
</P>
<P>
   In an article posted on its Internet site, www.naus.org, the
group estimated that the five Tricare contractors have accumulated
between $500 million and $1 billion in unpaid bills over the past
several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a disaster that's very difficult for them (Defense
Department officials) to address,'' said retired Major Gen. Richard
Murray, president of NAUS. ``Military health care is funded in
competition with tanks, ships and so forth. They have cut back on
health care in order to fund these other programs, and now they
have cut it too far.''
</P>
<P>
   A Defense Department spokesman declined to respond to questions
about the contractor claims, saying that to do so could reveal
details about President Clinton's upcoming budget message to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things are still being discussed and we can't tell
you anything about those discussions,'' said spokesman Jim Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Active-duty personnel, their dependents and retirees and their
dependents are entitled to subsidized health care and
pharmaceuticals through Tricare, the Pentagon's health care system.
</P>
<P>
   Although military hospitals care for active-duty personnel and
some civilians, most beneficiaries are served by five private
health care providers through a series of huge regional contracts
that function much like health insurance plans.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said that because of budget shortfalls, military
facilities have been unable to care for beneficiaries and have
shifted many of them to the contractors.
</P>
<P>
   This procedure resulted in contract ``change orders'' for which
the contractors have not been paid, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, the contractors are saying they provided between
$500 million and $1 billion worth of medical care and prescriptions
that they haven't been paid for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David R. Nelson, president of one of the contractors, Sierra
Military Health Services, said in a written statement that his
company is negotiating for the unpaid bills through bid adjustment
provisions of its contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monies we have calculated in these areas to date are
significant, and we will continue to work collaboratively with the
government toward resolution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Hannett, Washington lobbyist for Anthem Alliance for Health
Inc., the contractor responsible for Tricare beneficiaries in the
Dayton, Ohio, area, said his company was ``working with the
department on a number of adjustment requests.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the money allegedly owed to Tricare contractors, a
magazine devoted to government medical matters reported in its
current issue that Pentagon budget analyist have concluded the
Defense health system will run an additional $500 million deficit
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis by the Defense Department comptroller's office
concluded that under current budget projections, the military
health care system will accumulate up to $6 billion in deficits by
2005, according to an article in the magazine, U.S. Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The annual budget for the system is about $15 billion.

TIME-SLOT TUSSLE, TIRED PLOTS SUGGEST `NYPD BLUE' SHOULD CONSIDER
RETIREMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Tuesday, ``NYPD Blue'' returns to the coveted time slot for
which it fought so hard, flexing its dramatic muscle but huffing
and puffing like an overweight jogger. The cop series _ once
praised as an innovator and risk-taker for its wobbly handheld
camera angles, its delivery of more emotion than blood, its bold,
artistic use of racy visual images (read: semi-nudity) _ no longer
packs the dramatic oomph or emotional lift of yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   Its popularity has been slipping each season, so it's obvious
that even some of ``Blue's'' hard-core fans are finding better
things to do at 9 p.m. on Tuesdays. With CBS rookie ``Judging Amy''
now asking for a fight, what's the future hold? Should creator
Steven Bochco _ or ABC _ decide that enough's enough?
</P>
<P>
   Could be. ABC's decision to give the romantic drama ``Once and
Again'' extra time in ``Blue's'' slot this fall, while toying with
the idea of putting ``Blue'' on another night, was the network's
first public sign of dwindling confidence in the series. After an
outcry from a furious Bochco, (and with ``Judging Amy'' beating the
stew out of ``Once and Again'' among women) ABC relented. The
compromise was to give ``Blue'' its time slot, but not until
January. (The good news for ``Blue'' fans is that they'll get an
unbroken string of new episodes until May.)
</P>
<P>
   That done, here comes the hard part. Rick Schroder, still
looking no more than a day older than 15, has eased smoothly into
the character of Danny Sorenson, a hard-nosed former
narcotics-squad detective who matches Dennis Franz's Andy Sipowicz
in looking pained and worried, even on good days.
</P>
<P>
   But Schroder has failed to erase the ghost of Jimmy Smits the
way Smits quickly turned David Caruso's brooding character into a
dim memory. That failure has more to do with a dissatisfaction
overall with ``Blue,'' a series that, let's face it, has been
feeling its joints creaking for the past two seasons. Watch
``Blue'' these days and there's redundancy, a kind of weariness
that shows up in mood, tone, the secondary plotlines, even on the
actors' faces.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Lawrence got out last season, fed up with her limited
role as Sipowitz's wife; Nicholas Turturro is laying the groundwork
for his exit this season. Why the practically invisible James
McDaniel (Lt. Fancy) has hung on for so long with so little to do
is a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Is Kim Delaney next to leave? Relegated to being a love-life
sounding board for Andrea Thompson's Detective Jill Kirkendall,
Delaney looks bored stiff. And who wouldn't be after getting A-list
time when mixing it up with Smits?
</P>
<P>
   As for the season's first two episodes, nothing better signifies
``Blue's'' slide into mediocrity. Usually gritty, explosive
affairs, the most notable thing in the season premiere is yet
another oh-so-close exposure of female breasts. Overall, the
episodes just sit there, lifeless, at best variations of old story
lines.
</P>
<P>
   The opener has Sorenson and Sipowicz going after crooked beat
cops and running into the blue wall. By episode two, they're
sniffing the trail of the person who left a baby in a trash bin.
The suspects are prostitutes, and neither the chase nor the outcome
is worth sticking around for.
</P>
<P>
   On the personal front, we get a look at Kirkendall and her
ongoing reconciliation with her shabby ex-husband (Erich Anderson,
who also chips in as Felicity's dad on that WB series). In true
``Blue'' fashion, female characters are written with a twinge of
resentment, as though this show's creators believe, deep down, that
the detective squad is a men's club.
</P>
<P>
   The best scenes for the underused Delaney were in her
relationship with Smits (even her alcoholic binges were set up to
show that Smits could be heroic and strong-minded). Now, Kirkendall
is shown as a tough cookie on the street but a wreck at home, where
she's terrified of being alone.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to figure out whether to give the old lug another shot,
Kirkendall sounds as indecisive as Felicity asking, ``Ben or
Noel?'' By episode's end, the writers have her in a long satin
lingerie number when meeting with Anderson. (Check out, though,
what gives her the nerve to finally grow a backbone.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sipowitz is settling into life as a single parent.
Young son Theo has put on some TV years, although just enough to
respond as Sipowitz lectures him on choosing a profession where he
can ``help people'' like Sipowitz's dead wife and his son, who was
gunned down a few seasons back. (As he says this, the background
music shifts in volume. Sob, sob.) In midchat, Sipowitz also
cautions the toddler about spreading his mashed potatoes across the
table and gets a kiss for his attention to detail. How cute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue'' offers the best example this season of the ongoing
question posed to any long-running series: When is it time to call
it quits?
</P>
<P>
   It's an individual's decision. ``Law &AMP; Order'' and ``Friends''
continue to reinvent themselves; ``Party of Five'' and ``Beverly
Hills, 90210'' have all but petered out.
</P>
<P>
   Remember how ``Roseanne'' was pushed out? And ``Murphy Brown?''
Both were terrific, proud shows that simply hung around too long.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be the same thing with ``Blue''?

RAPPERS AND VIOLENCE GO HAND-IN-FIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We all probably know about the recent incident involving Sean
``Puff Daddy'' Combs, fellow rapper Jamal Barrow, Jennifer Lopez, a
shooting at a New York nightclub, and a stolen pistol.
</P>
<P>
   But that was just the latest example of a disturbing trend:
</P>
<P>
   Police blotter: In early December, rapper Jay-Z (real name Shawn
Carter) is accused of stabbing record executive/rapper Lance ``Un''
Rivera at a New York nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Police blotter: In July, rapper Luther Campbell of 2 Live Crew
fame is charged with aggravated battery after allegedly hitting a
man with a whiskey bottle at a Miami club.
</P>
<P>
   Police blotter: In May, Malcolm Howard, a member of the
Hartford, Conn., group 4 Black Faces and an admitted former drug
dealer and user, is found shot execution-style.
</P>
<P>
   Police blotter: In April, Combs and two friends are said to have
beaten Interscope Records exec Steve Stoute after Stoute refused to
edit a Nas video that showed Combs nailed to a cross. Stoute was
said to have received a six-figure sum in exchange for not pressing
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Police blotter: In the summer of 1998, rapper Bushwick Bill
files a $20 million lawsuit against Virgin Records and two
subsidiary labels, accusing three men of beating him in a Houston
bar after he left his label of 12 years, Houston's Rap-A-Lot
Records.
</P>
<P>
   Rap-related violence also includes numerous alleged threats or
attacks on rap journalists by the Madd Rapper, Wyclef Jean and the
Almighty RSO, among others; and Limp Bizkit's violent songs such as
``Break Stuff,'' which was reportedly a conduit to the violence at
Woodstock last summer.
</P>
<P>
   A rap sheet is not an artist's resume. Rap and violence have
always been bedfellows. After all, two of the music's biggest
names, Tupac and Notorious B.I.G., were gunned down within months
of each other. And, according to a New York Times article, Tupac
allegedly threatened XXL editor Sheena Lester.
</P>
<P>
   But incidents of violence surrounding rappers do seem to be more
pronounced and frequent than ever, even as the music is selling
better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's certainly true,'' says Jim Henke, chief curator
at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. ``And beating up journalists is
new _ rappers didn't do that before.''
</P>
<P>
   The increased violence surrounding rap appears to be a byproduct
of several factors, not the least of which is public perception.
Musicians getting in trouble in nightclubs is nothing new, nor are
violent lyrics in metal songs.
</P>
<P>
   But because rap has grown in popularity so much over the past
decade (to the point that well-known and previously unknown artists
can debut at No. 1 on the national CD charts), anything rappers do
receives more attention now. Mainstream media reports more on
hip-hop than ever before, and there are several publications _
among them ``Vibe, XXL, Rap Pages'' and ``The Source'' _ devoted to
the music.
</P>
<P>
   Thus a fracas involving a famous performer is immediately bigger
news than it would have been even five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the causes go deeper than that. Henke and others say that
part of the problem is that rap stars are often young men who came
out of an urban environment to make an enormous amount of money and
garner national attention very quickly _ sometimes overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these guys go from sleeping on their aunt's couch and
rapping for their friends to being on videos and having a lot of
money to spend,'' says Alan Light, editor of Spin magazine. ``A lot
of these guys are 18, 19 years old, and there's no sort of guidance
or any type of control on them.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a problem, Light says, because there is ``a level of
violence endemic to where hip-hop originates. Rap is now and will
be for the foreseeable future the music of young, inner-city males.
The first thing you're taught in any writing class is `Write what
you know,' and they write songs about the world around them.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, he says, is that young men who aren't ready to
handle success are ``left out there alone, and they're going to get
into whatever trouble they're going to get into.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only other place you see young black men skyrocketed into
fame and fortune is sports,'' Light says, ``and look at all the
athletes in trouble. But in sports you have a safety net _ you have
coaches, other players, trainers. Rappers are out there alone.''
</P>
<P>
   But it seems the music itself also creates much of the problem.
Dozens of popular rap CDs, including those by Jay-Z and Puffy, are
filled with boasts and threats of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Being harder than anyone else, being more ``street'' and able to
command more friends, more women and more money, is the subject of
hundreds of songs, some by men who have made millions, some by
youngsters making their debut.
</P>
<P>
   Various rap stars, from Biggie to Kid Rock, have bragged of
pasts as drug dealers _ in no small part because such credentials
lend validity to their stance as being hard.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that there is a sense of entitlement and overlay
of anger to many rap recordings _ a dismissive-to-everyone-else
tone that is harder to maintain than it is to rap about.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of talk about shooting and killing, and some of
those rappers really do live that life,'' says J.C. Jimmerson IV, a
Fort Worth rapper who records as Mr. Aggravated Foe Braids.
``People rap so long and they tend to live what they rap about and
make it reality. Right now, rap is about 75 percent murder rap.
Competition is fierce, and some people are jealous.''
</P>
<P>
   Henke agrees, saying that the life described in rap songs is
``the life they're used to. They're used to defending their turf.
And a guy that didn't grow up that way, that grew up middle class,
he's still got to project that image. You make a lot of money and
you think you're invincible, that the law doesn't apply to you.
There is a need to keep up that image.''
</P>
<P>
   And the fact that two of the music's biggest names have been in
serious trouble in just the past month points to a future that may
well include more incidents such as the ones mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't going to go away anytime soon,'' Light says. ``It's
discouraging that people don't learn from what they see _ Tupac is
dead, Biggie is dead, Puffy is in trouble again. I hope people can
see that this is dumb and has significant consequences.''

 &HT;    Big Orange, Blank make cover again
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Home Depot Chief Executive Arthur Blank smiles from the cover of
Forbes (Jan. 24) in the latest of many magazine articles about the
Atlanta-based retailer of home improvement products.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to the company's success, says Forbes, is its
``relentless tinkering with merchandising, the browbeating of
suppliers, the exploitation of technology that makes Home Depot
such a terrifying competitor. ... Big Orange has demolished
once-thriving chains, not to mention mom-and-pop hardware stores.''
</P>
<P>
   The average Home Depot outlet sells an average of $850,000 worth
of items a week. The company chalked up more than $380 billion in
revenue last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the only credible threat to Home Depot's dominance
of hardware retailing is Lowe's Cos., of Wilkesboro, N.C., which is
half in size in sales and store count,'' Forbes says.
</P>
<P>
   Blank and co-founder Bernie Marcus have been featured in at
least half a dozen magazines in the past year, sometimes in the
cover stories.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenspan cult
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) calls him ``the greatest central
banker in the history of the world,'' and one New York investment
bank is alleged to have set up a little shrine in his honor. That's
how big the cult of Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal
Reserve, has become, says The Economist (Jan. 8-14).
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton last week nominated Greenspan to his fourth
term as Fed chairman. As Fed chairman, Greenspan has been credited
with engineering the longest economic expansion in U.S. history and
with keeping inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty clear he will have no trouble getting Senate
confirmation, since Gramm heads the committee that will conduct
hearings on the nomination, the magazine notes.
</P>
<P>
   Biting the market
</P>
<P>
   Several events converged to hurt the stock market in the first
trading week of the new year, but nothing hurt worse than the rise
in interest rates, Business Week (Jan. 17) says.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the spotlight on the long-bond yielding 6.6 percent _ the
highest in 27 months _ and the odds of a Federal Reserve rate hike
rising, too, investors took out the old rule book and sold,'' the
magazine says. ``In the end, no matter how much good news you try
to dredge up, much of the market's future rests with the Fed.''
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Many leaders who dominate business today have what
psychoanalysts call a ``narcissistic personality,'' says Harvard
Business Review (January-February). ``That's good news for
companies that need passion and daring to break new ground,'' the
quarterly says, while adding that ``even productive narcissists can
be dangerous for organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Mutual Funds (February) offers a ``guide to retiring rich''
through IRA and 401(k) pension planning.
</P>
<P>
   _ After-hours stock trading is catching on among online traders,
but Individual Investor (February) warns that for all its rewards,
the practice has its pitfalls.

EXECUTIVE ORDERS TEND TO USURP CONGRESS' POWER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a story last week about the unexpected changes in Russia's
political structure, The New York Times used the word ``ukazes''
without any accompanying explanation. The Times' inflated opinion
of the educational level of its readers being what it is,
apparently no further explanation was warranted.
</P>
<P>
   I readily confess my ignorance, plus that of many of my
colleagues, who are some of the most well-read people I know. A
quick trip to the dictionary revealed that a ukase (although the
Times spelled it with a ``z'') is an imperial proclamation or order
having the force of law.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Russian equivalent of a U.S. presidential executive
order. And though you'd never know it by looking at the number of
orders issued by almost every American president since Abraham
Lincoln (Rutherford Hayes and James Garfield resisted the urge), in
this country it is a form of unconstitutional lawmaking that usurps
legislative power. Congress historically has been none too bothered
by this supplanting of its authority.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of issues are so pressing that a president feels
compelled to make law via executive order _ or, worse yet, through
classified presidential directives that even members of Congress
are denied access to _ rather than go through the constitutionally
mandated process of Congressional approval?
</P>
<P>
   Everything from controlling ``invasive species'' of plants and
animals to the declassification of POW/MIA records to directing
federal agencies to implement various U.N. human rights treaties
even though they haven't been ratified by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The current Democratic occupant of the White House has managed
to issue 311 of these hummers as of Dec. 21, but he is by no means
the prime abuser. Republican presidents Eisenhower, Nixon and
Reagan all topped Clinton's mark _ but Bill has another year to
play, so the jury's still out.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's 311 are small fish compared to Harry Truman's 905, but
that pales when stacked up next to the winner and still champion,
Franklin D. Roosevelt, who issued a whopping 3,723 executive
orders.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln issued the first such presidential directive to be
classified as an executive order, according to attorneys William
Olson and Alan Woll, who authored a policy analysis last fall on
EOs for the Cato Institute. That order, issued on Oct. 20, 1862,
established federal courts in parts of Louisiana that were being
held by federal troops.
</P>
<P>
   What started basically as interoffice memos between Lincoln and
his executive branch staff on how to run a government beset by
civil war while Congress was not in session have morphed into a
second legislative branch of government.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with executive orders is that not all of them rely
on clearly delineated constitutional or statutory authority.
Ambiguity being the best friend of power, presidents have used the
wide divergence of opinion about the scope, application and legal
authority of presidential directives to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But some members of the 106th Congress have had enough of this
imperial presidency. Rep. Jack Metcalf of Washington has been
joined by 83 bipartisan co-sponsors, including nine Texas
congressmen, to introduce House Concurrent Resolution 30. The
legislation will take the teeth out of any executive order that
infringes on congressional powers and duties or requires the
expenditure of federal funds not specifically appropriated by
Congress for the purpose of the order. They would be little more
than presidential wish lists and have no force or effect unless
Congress enacted them as law.
</P>
<P>
   What triggered this long-overdue interest? E.O. 13061: Federal
Support of Community Efforts along American Heritage Rivers. In it,
Clinton promised federal money to ``protect'' first 10, and later
14, rivers nominated by local governments and environmental groups
under the American Heritage Rivers Initiative _ itself created by
executive order.
</P>
<P>
   No one is saying that protecting rivers isn't a good thing. But
issuing federal regulations for what should be local land use
policies and then promising federal funds that would have to be
``reappropriated'' from some place else _ all without congressional
authority _ was a move that troubled even members of the
president's own party.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential adviser Paul Begala, no doubt totally unaware that
his words would send a shiver down the spines of Americans who
value the balance of power established in the Constitution, said
this at one of Clinton's executive order signing parties: ``Stroke
of the pen. Law of the land. Kinda cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Not kinda cool. Downright chilling.

<TEXT>
<P>
   If a man is diagnosed with cancer that is confined to the
prostate, what is his next step?
</P>
<P>
   Finding the right treatment of course, but which one?
</P>
<P>
   For years, radical prostatectomy -- surgical removal of the
entire prostate -- was considered the best method, and for many men
this will be their choice. Radiation, delivered either from a
source outside the body or from within the body via implanted
radioactive seeds (called brachytherapy), is an alternative to
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But a third method, cryosurgery -- freezing the tumor -- is
gaining momentum as a viable option.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cryosurgery is now stirring some interest in the medical
community as a whole,'' said Robert S. Gould, M.D., director of
prostate cryosurgical research at the University of Massachusetts
Medical Center in Marlborough.
</P>
<P>
   Cryosurgery, also called cryoablation, uses extremely cold
temperatures -- as low as minus 72 degrees Fahrenheit -- to freeze
and kill cancerous tissue within the prostate. The freezing
substance, placed in a hollow metal probe or probes, is typically
liquid argon or nitrogen.
</P>
<P>
   First a surgeon inserts small tubes into the prostate gland and
seminal vesicles (the pouches that produce semen) using ultrasound
imaging, via a small device inserted into the rectum, as a guide.
Then the surgeon slides the probes through the tubes, and the argon
or nitrogen freezes the tips of the probes, which in turn freeze
the tissue on contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that cryosurgery destroys prostate tissue,
whether benign or malignant,'' said Richard Babaian, M.D., a
urologist at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who has been
performing cryosurgery since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's the most recent of the prostate cancer treatments
to enter mainstream medicine, cryotherapy specifically targeting
the disease was developed in the 1960s. Then performed with the
prostate surgically exposed, it soon faded due to poor results and
difficulties with the procedure itself. It wasn't revived until
about 1990, when improvements in probe technology and ultrasound
ushered the procedure back into general practice.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, cryosurgery was used mainly as a salvage therapy
for men whose cancer had not responded to radiation. But with
reports of high complication rates, including pain and rectal
injury, evidence against cryosurgery mounted. Some of the ensuing
criticism was warranted, due in part to the limitations of the
technology of the time -- but not all, Babaian said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception is that cryosurgery got a bad rap because of
very high complication rates,'' he said. ``But the patients chosen
for the procedure had a high risk of complications to begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   About three years ago, the Health Care Financing Administration
(HCFA), the federal agency that administers Medicare, ruled that it
would not reimburse for the procedure. Coincidentally, the ruling
came at a time when cryosurgery was growing as a primary rather
than a salvage therapy.
</P>
<P>
   IMPROVEMENTS LEAD TO RESURGENCE
</P>
<P>
   But the procedure did not wither away once again. Instead,
researchers developed new ways to deliver the freezing element and
made improvements in temperature monitoring. About a year ago,
Babaian said, cryosurgeons presented data to officials at HCFA
showing that the effectiveness of cryotherapy was essentially
comparable to that of radiation therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the procedure is covered not only by Medicare, but also
by insurance companies as a primary therapy for prostate cancer.
This coverage is combining with advances in both the technology and
the procedure itself to expand access to cryosurgery, if sales by
one medical-technology company are any indication.
</P>
<P>
   Endocare, based in Irvine, Calif., has been manufacturing
cryotherapy-delivery systems for about eight years now, according
to Paul Mikus, chairman and chief executive officer. His company
launched a new system called targeted cryoablation using liquid
argon in July, 1999. Within three months, 50 centers had purchased
the technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of those centers is Stanford University Medical Center.
Clinicians there are interested in evaluating the technique in
practice, said Harcharan Gill, M.D., associate chief of urologic
oncology. At Stanford it will be offered only to men who are not
eligible for surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a potential, but we don't know what the full potential
is,'' he said. ``I'm going to try it here at Stanford to see if it
has potential in a select group of patients.''
</P>
<P>
   HOW IT STACKS UP AGAINST OTHER TREATMENTS
</P>
<P>
   One of the appeals of cryosurgery over radical prostatectomy is
that it can be performed in less time and requires a shorter
recovery period. ``It's done as an outpatient [procedure] or
one-day stay in the hospital,'' said Babaian. ``There is a quicker
return to normal patterns.''
</P>
<P>
   Cryotherapy may have fewer side effects than other treatments,
but this is not yet clear. Data on side-effects vary from
institution to institution, often depending on the skill of the
physician who performs the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of that [variability] has to do with the fact that it's
still not a wide-scale procedure yet,'' said Daniel George, M.D., a
urologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, who does not
perform cryosurgery.
</P>
<P>
   Babaian said one of the biggest pluses of cryosurgery as primary
treatment is a low rate of incontinence following the procedure,
typically 3 to 5 percent. Depending on the source of the data,
rates of incontinence following cryosurgery are comparable to or
less than radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy.
</P>
<P>
   But impotence in those who receive cryotherapy, as with radical
prostatectomy and brachytherapy, remains a vexing problem. ``We're
not aware of long-term studies of potency following cryotherapy,''
Babaian said.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 to 30 percent of patients experience sloughing of
tissue in the region, which involves dead tissue peeling off the
prostate and obstructing urinary flow, said Gould, and a few will
have some degree of pain in the area between the genitals and the
anus.
</P>
<P>
   The most important question is whether cryosurgery is as
effective in eradicating the disease as the two standard options.
That has not been definitively answered.
</P>
<P>
   One study from researchers at the Medical College of
Pennsylvania in Pittsburgh presented this year found that about 43
percent of 107 patients who received cryosurgery using a
single-freeze technique showed no chemical evidence of the disease
after five years, a rate that matches radiation but falls
considerably short of radical prostatectomy, which is in the range
of 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, brachytherapy was in the same position as
cryosurgery. For years, seed implants were not widely accepted as a
primary treatment option because relatively few clinicians had
extensive experience with the technique, and little was known about
the rates of long-term success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the same is true [today] with cryotherapy,'' George
said. ``In younger men, [the lack of data on long-term survival] is
a concern. I think that's a drawback, but that in itself won't
prohibit cryosurgery from gaining in popularity.''
</P>
<P>
   The question remains: Who should consider cryosurgery?
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who has localized prostate cancer, period,'' said
Gould. He recently published a study in the Journal of Urology
showing the benefits of total cryoablation, a procedure he
developed that extends the freezing well beyond the capsule of the
prostate.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, Gould advocates cryosurgery -- specifically
total cryoablation -- for even the more extreme cases. ``If you're
talking about somebody with a PSA [prostate-specific antigen, a
marker of the severity of the disease] of 15 and above, and grade 8
[advanced] cancer and up, you have to pull all the stops out,
because that patient is at a high risk of dying from cancer,''
Gould added.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that 96 percent of the 27 patients in his study who
underwent total cryoablation have undetectable PSA levels six to 12
months later. ``That's simply unmatched by anything else,'' he
added. A patient is considered cured only after remaining
disease-free for at least five years.
</P>
<P>
   Babaian said it's up to the physician to decide which patients
are best suited for cryotherapy. While he only recommends treating
patients older than 65 with localized disease, he said there are
some physicians who are treating more advanced disease, and some
who are treating patients younger than 65.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have other options that we know have much longer results,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   So the question remains, Why choose cryosurgery?
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, cryosurgery is an option for select patients
with good disease risk features, and a number of good treatment
options are already available,'' George said. ``In most cases,
these are options that are a little more appealing to the patient,
due to the expertise of clinicians [in those techniques].''
</P>
<P>
   He believes cryosurgery might be good for men with PSA levels
lower than 10, moderate Gleason scores of 6 or less [on a scale of
2 to 10], and clinical T1 or T2 [early stage] cancers. For these
men, he said, a combination of anti-hormone therapy and radiation
is the standard approach. Other options include surgery or seed
implants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can be treated effectively with surgery or radiation.''
</P>
<P>
   If a man does choose cryosurgery, George recommends that he
interview physicians and ask how many procedures they've done -- at
least 50 to 100 a year is a good guideline, he says -- as well as
about the rates of disease-free survival and side effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that in the right hands, it's a very reasonable
option, but I have seen some anecdotal difficulties and major
complications, and that's why I always fear when practitioners
aren't proficient,'' George said.
</P>
<P>
   As more institutions and clinicians perform the procedure and
long-term survival figures become more available, cryosurgery could
be on a par with brachytherapy and radical prostatectomy. But that
will still take some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great deal of complacency within the urological
community. I think urologists are taking a wait and see attitude
toward cryosurgery,'' said Gould. ``It's about time we found
something a little bit better [than what we have now].''

 &HT;    STEVE CASE A MEDIA VISIONARY, SAY HIS FANS IN VIRGINIA
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ted Turner, 61, and Gerald Levin, 60, have decades
more business experience than Steve Case, 41. But when the biggest
media merger in history was announced Monday, Case was the first
man at the mike, and the one with ``chairman'' behind his name at
the new AOL Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   That Case would emerge as No. 1 among such powerful men
surprises no one in the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington,
where America Online's spectacular growth has vastly enriched the
community. Here, Case is widely regarded as a visionary who helped
transform green pastures into seas of shiny Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   His success in the 1990s had the home town expecting great
things in the new century, a number of Virginians said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who has known him over the last five years would not
find this (merger) stunning,'' said Jerry Gordon, president of the
Fairfax County Economic Development Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Duval, secretary of commerce and trade for Virginia, said
people who have worked on economic development projects with Case
believe he represents ``a new generation of corporate leadership''
destined to define the Information Age. What makes Case the best
choice to head the new online/media company is his ``ability to
create a vision and follow it through,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That the quiet, almost somber, Case would turn out to be such a
phenomenal success was not so apparent in the early 1980s when,
after graduating from Williams College in Massachusetts, he was
hired by Pizza Hut to help develop new pizza toppings. Putting in
only a short stint in the oregano-and-cheese world, he moved online
in 1983 by joining Control Video Corp., a small company that let
Atari game fans play over telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Dulles, Va., quickly ran into trouble, and
the board of directors fired most of the managers. Case was among
the survivors who helped save the company and rename it Quantum
Computer Services Inc. in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Case headed up sales and marketing at Quantum, which launched an
online service called Q-Link for users of Commodore computers. In
1989, the company launched an online service called America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the company dropped the name Quantum to become
America Online Inc., with Case serving as executive vice president.
In 1992, AOL began selling stock to the public and Case joined the
board. In April 1993, he was named chief executive and added the
post of chairman in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Case's most crucial move came when he pushed for mass
mailings of 3.5-inch America Online disks, providing would-be
subscribers with quick access to the online service. He insisted
the company focus on simplicity and ease of use, making AOL seem
friendly and useful to the average customer who did not happen to
have an advanced degree in computer engineering.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, the Case survived the withering criticism that
resulted from extended service outages. By the late 1990s, the
company had straightened out most of its technical problems and was
wildly popular, with more than 20 million subscribers. In its
fiscal 1999, which ended June 30, America Online took in $4.8
billion in revenues and posted a profit of $762 million, or 62
cents a diluted share for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the vast increase in his personal net worth, Case has
carved out a reputation in Northern Virginia for being very
concerned with social issues and community betterment. For example,
he has spearheaded industry efforts to narrow the so-called
``digital divide,'' the big gap between computer use among whites
and ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said Case also has worked on improving schools and has
done ``a whole lot of good works'' for the county. Despite his
wealth and power, what Case likes to talk about is ``his children,
Little League and PTA,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   In news stories about Case, the words ``shy'' and ``unassuming''
appear regularly. His management style has been described as
``consensus-building'' and ``cool.'' With his thatch of dark brown
hair, Case has the bland good looks of a stereotypical ``soccer
dad'' in Northern Virginia. Compared with the woman-chasing,
yacht-sailing Ted Turner, the AOL leader will give tabloids little
to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   But in the wired world, the deliberate, low-keyed management
wonk has emerged as king. And at 41, he may have a good long reign.

 &HT;    STEVE CASE A MEDIA VISIONARY, SAY HIS FANS IN VIRGINIA
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ted Turner, 61, and Gerald Levin, 60, have decades
more business experience than Steve Case, 41. But when the biggest
media merger in history was announced Monday, Case was the first
man at the mike, and the one with ``chairman'' behind his name at
the new AOL Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   That Case would emerge as No. 1 among such powerful men
surprises no one in the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington,
where America Online's spectacular growth has vastly enriched the
community. Here, Case is widely regarded as a visionary who helped
transform green pastures into seas of shiny Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   His success in the 1990s had the home town expecting great
things in the new century, a number of Virginians said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who has known him over the last five years would not
find this (merger) stunning,'' said Jerry Gordon, president of the
Fairfax County Economic Development Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Duval, secretary of commerce and trade for Virginia, said
people who have worked on economic development projects with Case
believe he represents ``a new generation of corporate leadership''
destined to define the Information Age. What makes Case the best
choice to head the new online/media company is his ``ability to
create a vision and follow it through,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That the quiet, almost somber, Case would turn out to be such a
phenomenal success was not so apparent in the early 1980s when,
after graduating from Williams College in Massachusetts, he was
hired by Pizza Hut to help develop new pizza toppings. Putting in
only a short stint in the oregano-and-cheese world, he moved online
in 1983 by joining Control Video Corp., a small company that let
Atari game fans play over telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Dulles, Va., quickly ran into trouble, and
the board of directors fired most of the managers. Case was among
the survivors who helped save the company and rename it Quantum
Computer Services Inc. in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Case headed up sales and marketing at Quantum, which launched an
online service called Q-Link for users of Commodore computers. In
1989, the company launched an online service called America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the company dropped the name Quantum to become
America Online Inc., with Case serving as executive vice president.
In 1992, AOL began selling stock to the public and Case joined the
board. In April 1993, he was named chief executive and added the
post of chairman in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Case's most crucial move came when he pushed for mass
mailings of 3.5-inch America Online disks, providing would-be
subscribers with quick access to the online service. He insisted
the company focus on simplicity and ease of use, making AOL seem
friendly and useful to the average customer who did not happen to
have an advanced degree in computer engineering.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, the Case survived the withering criticism that
resulted from extended service outages. By the late 1990s, the
company had straightened out most of its technical problems and was
wildly popular, with more than 20 million subscribers. In its
fiscal 1999, which ended June 30, America Online took in $4.8
billion in revenues and posted a profit of $762 million, or 62
cents a diluted share for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the vast increase in his personal net worth, Case has
carved out a reputation in Northern Virginia for being very
concerned with social issues and community betterment. For example,
he has spearheaded industry efforts to narrow the so-called
``digital divide,'' the big gap between computer use among whites
and ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said Case also has worked on improving schools and has
done ``a whole lot of good works'' for the county. Despite his
wealth and power, what Case likes to talk about is ``his children,
Little League and PTA,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   In news stories about Case, the words ``shy'' and ``unassuming''
appear regularly. His management style has been described as
``consensus-building'' and ``cool.'' With his thatch of dark brown
hair, Case has the bland good looks of a stereotypical ``soccer
dad'' in Northern Virginia. Compared with the woman-chasing,
yacht-sailing Ted Turner, the AOL leader will give tabloids little
to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   But in the wired world, the deliberate, low-keyed management
wonk has emerged as king. And at 41, he may have a good long reign.

 &HT;    Post-hiatus `NYPD Blue' gets its gritty edge back
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``NYPD Blue'' should take a hike more often. With few exceptions
in the past several years _ Jimmy Smits' dramatic boo-hoo death-bed
scene last season being the most memorable _ the 7-year-old cop
melodrama had slipped into a predictable, overplayed parody of
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Even amid the colorful mayhem of New York, it had all become a
bore: the outbursts of Detective Andy Sipowicz (Dennis Franz); the
crackin'-tough cop patter; the Nowheresville station-house soap
operas.
</P>
<P>
   So ABC was in no rush to get the Steven Bochco drama back on
after ``Once and Again,'' originally ``Blue's'' temporary
replacement, did well in the ratings. ABC simply pushed this
season's ``Blue'' premiere back a couple of months, and the only
one who really grumbled about it was Bochco.
</P>
<P>
   But the wait was worth it. ``NYPD Blue'' returns tonight with a
renewed swagger. Its conventions are less annoying because of their
absence; when Detective Russell (Kim Delaney) notes, ``He's got
some skel in the pokey'' (translation: he's got some bad guy in
jail), it almost sounds original again. Tonight is a reminder of
why cop shows are such a TV staple, and why this one was once one
of the best.
</P>
<P>
   The opener takes the in-the-news story line that ``Law &AMP; Order''
reduces to a morality play and transforms it into a gritty,
street-level opera. Nobody milks more out of a detective's grinding
dreariness than ``Blue,'' and tonight it milks like a madman.
</P>
<P>
   The story centers on the aftermath of two street cops who
``tuned up'' _ knocked around _ a perpetrator who spit in the face
of one of them. The guy dies, and when Sipowicz and Sorenson (Rick
Schroder) are handed the case, they're immediately suspicious of
the cops, who claim the guy was fine when they left him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue'' manages to run competing views of police work, heroic
and dirty, at the same time. What we're left with is what's
thrillingly, depressingly human. It's what ``Blue,'' at its best,
does best.
</P>
<P>
   It's also grown up a little since we saw it last. Schroder, a
surprisingly adept replacement for Smits, now owns the role. He
takes nothin' from nobody _ ``You are about to burn down!'' he
shouts at a cop _ while being assured enough to buddy up to his
partner in surprising new ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy, you got 10 seconds for a personal observation?'' he asks
Sipowicz, whose wife was killed last season, leaving him to make
his way as a single dad. ``You are a very attractive man. I don't
know if you've shed weight or what, but. . . . '' He then flips
Andy the ``OK'' sign.
</P>
<P>
   Sipowicz, who has shed a little weight, also is thrown into a
touchingly awkward role with his young son. Rather than demand our
sympathy, he now prompts our concern: We root for him when he tries
to make meatloaf for his kid.
</P>
<P>
   New is Officer Mary Franco, played with cool cockiness by Sheeri
Rappaport. Her role? She's a woman. Sorenson's a man. This show has
made naked rear ends a plot point. Do the math.
</P>
<P>
   We may tire of it all again soon. But if we do, maybe ABC could
just bring ``NYPD Blue'' back every once in a while, like
``Columbo,'' so we can forever enjoy what it was.
</P>
<P>
   TV REVIEW
</P>
<P>
   ``NYPD Blue'' tonight at 10 on ABC.

 &HT;    On the Newsstand: Grisham takes on Oxford
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Grisham is back in print this week, but there's not a
courtroom or lawyer in sight. Published in The Oxford American
($5.95), Grisham's first serial novel, ``A Painted House,'' is the
story of a boy growing up on a cotton farm in Arkansas in the early
1950s. The novel will be published in six installments, with an
excerpt every two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``John's coming into town Wednesday with the next installment,''
says editor Marc Smirnoff in Oxford, Miss. ``I decided I wanted to
read it as he writes it, like everyone else. I don't want to know
what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Grisham, who is the publisher of The Oxford American, says he
hopes the novel will boost sales of the 8-year-old magazine.
Apparently he has nothing to worry about: Advance orders have
pushed the print run from 50,000 to 250,000 copies, according to
Smirnoff.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Grisham has not abandoned his legal thrillers. ``The
Brethren'' will be published in February by Doubleday.
</P>
<P>
   Plague years: In a compelling investigative cover story this
week, Newsweek ($3.50) reports on the growing AIDS epidemic in
Africa and the latest U.S. efforts to deal with it. According to a
Newsweek poll, 55 percent of Americans are not even aware of the
crisis. By the end of 2000, says reporter Jeffrey Bartholet, more
than 10 million African children younger than 15 will have lost
their mothers or both parents to AIDS. Meanwhile, Boston minister
and activist Eugene Rivers accuses black American leaders of
turning their backs on those in Africa because they worry that
highlighting the problem reinforces negative stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Bioterror defense: Author Richard Preston (``The Cobra Event'')
writes about a different kind of plague in this week's New Yorker
($3). Preston updates a story he wrote in the July 12 issue about
the threat of the smallpox virus being used as a bioweapon. Since
smallpox was eradicated worldwide in the 1970s, only the United
States and Russia kept small supplies of the vaccine. Efforts to
create a larger stockpile of the vaccine stalled because of
interagency rivalries, Preston writes, until Jeffrey Koplan,
director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta, called a meeting of top officials from the Pentagon, the
White House, the Food and Drug Administration, the National
Institutes of Health, and the Department of Health and Human
Services. Koplan locked everyone in a room and refused to let
anyone leave until the group had devised a way to create an
adequate stockpile of vaccine. After many hours, Preston says, they
finally agreed on a plan that allows for mass production of the
vaccine in case of a bioterrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   Custody battle: Maybe King Solomon would have found a wise
solution to this problem, but apparently no one else can. Time
($3.50) explores the controversial issues surrounding Elian
Gonzalez and efforts to send him back to his father in Cuba. What
it comes down to, reporter Joshua Cooper Ramo says, is a choice
between freedom and love. Elsewhere in the magazine, Time looks at
the proliferation of TV game shows and revisits the quiz shows of
the 1950s. In an accompanying essay, Richard Goodwin, who helped
expose the corruption of those early programs, says there is no way
the current shows can be fixed. Besides, he adds, ``The questions
are too easy.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Low pressure moving through northern Quebec will promote very
strong, gusty winds across the Northeast on Tuesday. In addition,
several disturbances rotating around this low will bring scattered
rain and snow showers to the region. Temperatures will remain
rather mild, with many locations along the Eastern Seaboard
reaching 50 degrees or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, snow showers will develop near the western Great
Lakes as cold air crosses warm water, creating instability and
clouds. These snow showers will produce fitful bursts of snow that
can cause quick accumulations in those locations that receive
squalls. Many places, however, will not see any snow showers, as
lake-effect snow showers are typically very localized events.
</P>
<P>
   In the South, readings will be more like those expected in the
springtime as ample sunshine pushes temperatures in the Gulf Coast
states into the 60s and 70s. Showers will develop in extreme
southern Florida, where the tail end of a cold front will become
stationary. Meanwhile, the western Plains will turn warmer as
strong, gusty winds from the west descend the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure over the Southwest will bring sunshine and very
warm readings to the Sonoran Desert. To the north, abundant amounts
of moisture will continue to surge into the Northwest, bringing
coastal rains from Washington to northern California along with
snows to the Cascades. Snow will also fall on many of the west
slopes of the Sierra Nevada and Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Strong Winds
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, warnings for high winds with gusts over 50 mph were
common in the Northeast and Middle West as a storm center
strengthened near the Great Lakes. Steady strong winds can be
traced to great horizontal pressure contrasts in the atmosphere.
Extreme gusts usually result when turbulent air motions, akin to
eddies in a rushing stream, mix winds from thousands of feet above
the ground toward the earth's surface. Winds at altitudes of 10,000
to 20,000 feet, unencumbered by frictional forces, commonly reach
50 to 100 knots, providing the impetus for gusty ground-level
winds.

 &HT;    Turner in on yet another major merger
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He's done it again.
</P>
<P>
   In the second time in three years and for the umpteenth time in
his long career, Ted Turner has helped turn the media industry on
its head.
</P>
<P>
   The latest instance is the $166 billion stock merger of America
Online and Time Warner. Turner is Time Warner's vice chairman and
largest single shareholder, owning about 100 million shares or 9
percent of his company.
</P>
<P>
   Without his support, the merger of AOL and Time Warner could not
take place, especially if he decided to fight the combination. But
Turner said Monday that he wholeheartedly supported the
combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Signing the piece of paper that voted my shares was as
exciting or more exciting than the first time I made love 42 years
ago,'' said Turner.
</P>
<P>
   On a more serious note, Turner added, ``what we have here is a
combination of winning brands and winning people. I'm very happy to
be part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   And no wonder. The value of Turner's stake in Time Warner
ballooned to $9 billion, up $2.5 billion in one day on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   What does the king of cable know about the Internet? If you had
listened to Turner during the past several years, you'd think: Not
much. At various industry conventions he repeatedly quipped that he
was too old, too old fashioned to understand, let alone use the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But as usual these comments were more a tease than truth. In
fact, Turner has closely followed the rise of the Internet, even if
he isn't a big personal user. He understands as well as anyone its
potential to change the business of media.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Turner's company while independent was among the first
to begin experimenting and investing in the Internet and digital
media. Today Turner Broadcasting's Internet sites, such as CNN.com,
are among the most popular online.
</P>
<P>
   Change such as this latest mega merger is nothing new to Turner.
Three years ago he sold his Atlanta-based company to Time Warner to
create the world's largest media company.
</P>
<P>
   And before that he tested the boundaries of his industry by
launching the first 24-hour TV news channel and assembling the
largest library of films and cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   For Turner, business is an endless struggle. Only those willing
to change tactics continually will survive. As Turner once put it,
``Business is war and you have to have the biggest weapons to
win.''

&HT;     WARRIORS COACH SEES THE POSITIVE SIDE OF LOSING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RAY RATTO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Garry St. Jean drove into the Coliseum parking
lot Sunday afternoon and noticed that people were chasing his car
and yelling at him.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news was, they weren't new fans of the Golden State
Warriors voting their stock. The good news was, he was stuck behind
the Iranian national soccer team's bus, and the people whacking his
truck with plastic horns were fans of the Mexican national team.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the abuse he thought he was receiving for coaching the
rickety Golden State ship was actually just misplaced, and
transitory.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Sunday was probably his best day at work since he took
owner Chris Cohan's worst wishes to P.J. Carlesimo on Dec. 27. The
Warriors didn't give him that elusive first win (he's now 0-6 and
running), but they did lose with more verve than is normally
associated with them.
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors lost to the Seattle SuperSonics, 100-95, and as is
usually the case, the score was exactly indicative of the way the
game was played.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the Warriors lose by 13 or more, and look a lot worse
doing it. After all, you don't get to be 6-27 by being edged at the
horn.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you don't get to be 6-27 without finding some small
enjoyment in the little things _ like not getting dope-slapped at
home. Even nagging tidbits like the Sonics coming off a dismal loss
to the Los Angeles Lakers the night before, or Gary Payton having
one of his worst games in years _ those are irrelevant details to a
team that has eaten its share of opponents' mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like that was a heck of a game to watch, coach and play
in,`` St. Jean said, finding the happy news a lot quicker than he
normally does. ``Our guys really, really worked hard, and I think
Mookie (Blaylock) summed it up best when we walked into the locker
room and he said, 'Little things, little things.'''
</P>
<P>
   Well, little things only to a certain extent. The nine players
the Warriors trotted out Sunday night bore only the slightest
resemblance to the media guide. Sam Mack (15 points, all on
three-pointers) was celebrating his second game as a Warrior. Jamel
Thomas, whose entire National Basketball Association experience was
19 minutes with the Boston Celtics and a DNP-CD (did not
play-coach's decision) with the Warriors, popped up again for 13
minutes Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Had Erick Dampier (rehabbing his cranky left knee) or Chris
Mills (right ankle surgery) shown up for the game, their civilian
clothes, plus those of John Starks and Terry Cummings, would have
matched the Warrior payroll on the floor at any given time.
</P>
<P>
   Nine guys who barely know each other trying to win an NBA game
is not a little thing.
</P>
<P>
   But this, too, is a quibble. The Warriors have been so hideous
for so long that standing up to a perennial playoff team for 53
minutes in a season that still has 49 more games has to mean
something, at least to the players themselves. If not, they may as
well just get their Class C truck-drivers' licenses and haul
livestock across the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing with a new group of players is tough,`` the
32-year-old Blaylock said, ``especially when you're trying to get a
critical shot off at the end of the game and really execute your
offense. When you get your chance at the end of a game, you can
win. It's just tough when you have a lot of new guys trying to
learn the offense and you stick them in at the end of a critical
ballgame.``
</P>
<P>
   True, except for two things. One, the Warriors have no choice
but to stick new guys in throughout a game, and two, there are no
more critical games for them this year.
</P>
<P>
   So until the new kids figure out structure and form and all that
other art-school argle-bargle, they'll have to do what they do on
the fly. In St. Jean's words, to ``go out there, fool me and fool
everyone else. Do something that just makes basketball sense.``
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is a very low setting for the bar. And yes, this is a
poor substitute for the long-term plan most teams prefer.
</P>
<P>
   But these are the Golden State Warriors. The owner isn't going
to change any time soon (or even be seen, for that matter). Michael
Jordan has no sudden itch to sign on for a year or six. The Jovian
gravity that has pulled this franchise to the floor and keeps it
there remains.
</P>
<P>
   So there are two choices. You can ignore, or you can see and
enjoy the mutant charm of their temporary ``Oh, what the hell,``
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   What else do they have at this point? More Bachman-Turner
Overdrive on the arena sound system? More preteens hauled out of
the stands and made to dance in ways they were never prepared to
do? Send out mimeographed apologies to all the people coming to
town for the All-Star Game?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, whatever. After all, when your work day begins with your
truck being chased by soccer fans, an overtime loss seems downright
celestial.

THE BENEFITS OF MARRIAGE (AND JUSTICE) FOR ALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAVIER J. ALDAPE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who would have thought that Vermont, of all places, would spark
a national debate on gay rights? Yet in December, the Green
Mountain State did exactly that. Ruling that gays and lesbians
cannot be denied the benefits of the state's civil marriage
statutes, the Vermont Supreme Court gave the fight for gay rights a
monumental boost.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly in Texas, many will be appalled at the decision, as
they see homosexuality as unnatural and immoral. They believe it to
be yet another sign of the continued fraying of our society.
Judicial recognition is merely additional evidence that courts have
become de facto legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision, however, does not impose morality or law.
The court did not grant gays a unilateral right to marriage;
rather, it identified their exclusion from the state-granted
benefits of marriage as discriminatory and in direct conflict with
the Vermont Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The jurists didn't dictate a remedy _ they just demanded one.
</P>
<P>
   In recent history, both federal and state courts have been
catalysts for social change. Some lambaste it as legislating from
the bench; it is best viewed as more broadly interpreting the
constitutional precepts of inalienable rights and equal protection.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's courts have helped guide our development as a
society. Through systematic and, yes, often cataclysmic decisions,
the courts have distributed rights more broadly. While discarding
the exclusionary sentiments evident in the Constitution, they
ensure that we embrace its ideal of equality under the law.
</P>
<P>
   The 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education ruling ending school
segregation, the 1967 Loving vs. Virginia case striking down
anti-miscegenation laws, and the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision on
abortion rights all firmly advocated a right to privacy and greater
personal freedoms, based on the 14th Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Grievously, personal freedoms for gays and lesbians were
excluded.
</P>
<P>
   The 1986 Bowers vs. Hardwick decision upheld the
constitutionality of anti-sodomy laws. Physical intimacy between
two men, even in the privacy of one's home, was found to be within
the purview of the state. Justice Lewis Powell later voiced regret
about his deciding vote.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, as most of society continues to celebrate
individuality and difference, the right to personal privacy and
freedom of intimacy must expand accordingly. In his impassioned
dissent in the Bowers case, Justice Harry Blackmun envisioned a
wide umbrella of constitutional protection around matters of
personal intimacy, noting the high standard that the state must
meet to ``justify invading the houses, hearts, and minds of
citizens who choose to live their lives differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, public opinion has shifted. There is greater
acceptance of the idea that the private lives of gays and lesbians
should not be criminalized. Homosexual conduct is still frequently
viewed with opprobrium, but the belief that personal opinions
should not equal state-sponsored persecution is rising.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, the anti-gay argument has changed to one against
``special rights.'' That is, that gays and lesbians are granted
rights as citizens but should not be given protected class status
in hate-crimes legislation and anti-discrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
   Though most are willing to grant gays the right to personal
freedom, far fewer Americans support any overt display _ either of
intimacy or approval.
</P>
<P>
   In this ``don't ask, don't tell'' world, the fight for gay
marriage rights is not really a war _ or if it is, it is a
hopelessly lopsided one. The Defense of Marriage Act already limits
federal marriage benefits to heterosexual couples and defines
marriage as a union between a man and a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Constitutional amendments in Alaska and Hawaii snuffed out
judicial efforts to recognize gay marriage. A similar initiative is
on the ballot in California.
</P>
<P>
   Despite greater public accommodation of gays and lesbians,
marriage stands as an apparently inaccessible governmental benefit.
It is a done deal.
</P>
<P>
   That may not be all bad. Marriage is a heterosexual union. Even
progressive countries that have granted gay couples equal rights do
so under a parallel system of domestic partnership, not marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The debate should focus on garnering equal legal protection for
gay and lesbian partnerships and not on the more contentious issue
of nomenclature.
</P>
<P>
   The religious ceremony of marriage revolves around doctrine and
morality. It is a sacred event, governed by faith and sprituality.
The parallel civil registration bestows a panoply of secular
benefits and responsibilities. In the minds of many, the two events
_ the religious and the civil _ are inextricably linked.
</P>
<P>
   Emotionally, they are. Physically, they often are.
Philosophically, they may be as well. But as a matter of law, they
are distinct.
</P>
<P>
   Civil marriage is a partnership contract freely entered into by
two citizens. The state grants the benefits of inheritance,
consortium, community property, hospital visitation rights and
evidentiary privileges while imposing the responsibilities of
mutual support, shelter, maintenance and joint property ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Offering a state-sponsored array of civil benefits to two
consenting adults but denying the same benefits to two other adults
_ merely because of their sex _ is discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   Legally, the rights of civil marriage must be made available to
gay couples. Merely extending them marriage licenses, though,
tramples on the deeply held beliefs and long-standing traditions of
a significant number of Americans. That may not be a decisive legal
reason for pause, but it makes a compelling political one.
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont court implicitly recognized this.
</P>
<P>
   It found no constitutional right to a marriage license, but it
ruled that the civil benefits of marriage must be available to all.
Anything less conflicts with the Vermont Constitution's
common-benefits clause and its proscription of instituting
government benefits ``for the particular emolument or advantage of
any single man, family or set of men.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Constitution and many others have strikingly similar
language.
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont Legislature, which returned to session Jan. 4, must
formulate a plan to extend the benefits of marriage to same-sex
couples, which could be through full-fledged marriage or domestic
partnership.
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont court correctly struck down the preferential
allocation of civil marriage benefits. But it spoke most
eloquently, and humanely, when it referred to those who struggle
for legal recognition of their same-sex partnerships. It said that
extending ``legal protection and security for their avowed
commitment to an intimate and lasting human relationship is simply,
when all is said and done, a recognition of our common humanity.''

 &HT;    EXPERTS SEE CLEARANCE FOR TIME WARNER-AOL MERGER
 &HT;    540&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Experts predicted Monday that the huge America
Online-Time Warner merger would win government approval, but only
after the firms satisfy regulators from Washington to state
capitals to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be some comparatively modest modifications, but
none that stand in the way of completing the transaction,'' said
William Kovacic, an antitrust expert at George Washington
University Law School.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of Time Warner, a news, entertainment and cable
company, with the world's largest Internet provider, AOL, into the
biggest media conglomerate in history raised concerns about
concentration of power.
</P>
<P>
   But company executives argued that the new entity would have no
monopolies in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``No single line of business really dominates its category, so
we don't expect there to be any antitrust issues,'' said Steve
Case, chairman and chief executive of AOL.
</P>
<P>
   A potential sticking point is whether customers of Time Warner's
cable services would be able to choose an Internet service other
than AOL for the increasingly popular high-speed ``broadband''
connections available through TV cable wires.
</P>
<P>
   Case pledged that customers would have free choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big issue, we thought, would be related to open access,
and we wanted to just take that off the table on day one by
committing to the principle,'' Case said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Kovacic outlined a ``fairly laborious and
time-consuming collection of regulatory reviews'' that are likely
to take at least a year. And he said that regulators might ask the
companies to issue a written agreement on the ``open access''
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, chairman of the Judiciary Committee's
antitrust subcommittee, announced he would hold hearings to review
the merger plans.
</P>
<P>
   The deal ``could make sense for consumers,'' DeWine said in a
statement. But he added that ``it raises a whole host of
competition and public policy issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee's top-ranking Democrat, Patrick
Leahy of Vermont, expressed doubts about the merger. ``The great
promise of the Internet has been to allow people a wide range of
information sources and choices,'' he said. ``What we should do is
make sure that all that information does not become funneled and
controlled by just two or three sources.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to congressional hearings, the companies face the
following hurdles to approval of the merger:
</P>
<P>
   _ Two federal agencies, the Federal Trade Commission and the
Department of Justice antitrust division, must determine between
themselves which one will review the merger to determine if it
would violate antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Federal Communication Commission reviews any change of
licensing and ownership for broadcast and cable operations. The FCC
has a general role of determining whether the change would benefit
the public.
</P>
<P>
   _ State attorneys general can be expected to scrutinize the
plans wherever Time Warner holds a cable franchise. Cities with
Time Warner service can also be expected to look over the plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ The European Union's competition directorate would also have a
role.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Some critics saw a dangerous trend in the mega-merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that this aggregation of power in a single entity is a
true threat to the democratic order,'' said Edward Herman,
professor emeritus at the Wharton School of Business at the
University of Pennsylvania. ``The antitrust laws have as part of
their function to maintain a decentralized system.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman said that the antitrust watchdogs in the federal
government ``have been ineffectual'' in stopping the escalating
trend toward mega-mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's partly because of the global competition, and it's partly
because these companies are so politically powerful,'' he said,
citing past campaign contributions. ``The money in elections is so
great that the political system seems unable to resist the force of
that power.''
</P>
<P>
   Kovacic said that many are beginning to ask if the push to merge
``is approaching a threshold at which we ought to slow down.''
These concerns may not translate into opposition to the Time
Warner-AOL marriage, he said, ``but they will mean that the
deliberative process will be cautious.''

 &HT;    CLINTON SAYS QUEST FOR MIDEAST PEACE FACES ``GREAT TENSION'' IN
WEEKS AHEAD
 &HT;    Moving in (i) international and (w) Washington categories
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As a week of Israeli-Syrian peace talks recessed
until Jan. 19, President Clinton warned Monday that the quest for
Mideast reconciliation faces ``a time of great tension'' in the
weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was ``hopeful'' that the peace process is
accelerating on several fronts, but he also appealed for the
support _ and prayers _ of the world community.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prayers of Muslims, Jews, Christians and people of
goodwill all over the world will be needed for us to get through
these next several weeks,'' Clinton said during White House remarks
centered on the end of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month. The
fractious Middle East is the cradle of all three religions.
</P>
<P>
   After years of slow going, U.S. efforts to broker peace between
Israel and its Arab neighbors have entered a pregnant phase.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa wrapped up a weeklong round of
U.S.-sponsored talks in Sheperdstown, W. Va. As expected, no issues
were resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The talks, however, marked the first time decision-makers from
the two countries ever held face-to-face negotiations on the
territorial and security divisions between the long-time foes. And
Clinton presented the men with a seven page document setting forth
areas of agreement and dispute, a working paper U.S. diplomats hope
will form the beginnings of a final peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``New formulations and new descriptions of concerns were put
down,'' State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters as
the talks wrapped up and the negotiating teams prepared to return
to their respective capitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were positive responses and reactions to the document we
laid down, there were serious discussions, there was a warming
trend in the atmospherics between the Syrians and the Israelis,''
said Rubin. ``You put all that together and I think it's fair to
say we're on the the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Sharaa agreed to pause for a week and a half to digest
and clarify their discussions so far and sound out key political
and strategic players back home. They are to resume talks at a
location yet to be determined on Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is due to visit
the White House for talks on how to advance the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the Barak and Arafat visits, though formally
unrelated, raises the possibility that Clinton could host a meeting
between those two men.
</P>
<P>
   They have pledged to draft a blueprint by Feb. 13 that frames up
a final round of negotiations aimed at resolving, by mid-September,
the most contentious issues between Israel and the Palestinians.
Those include the future of Jerusalem and the question of
Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another important date on the Mideast peace calendar is Feb.
1, when Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is slated to attend a
meeting in Moscow of major world powers working to end half a
century of bloodshed and enmity between Israel and its Arab
neighbors. That meeting is expected to group Albright with foreign
secretaries from Russia, the European Union, Japan and the central
powers of the Middle East _ Israel, Syria and the Palestinians
among them.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, parties opposed to one provision or another of the
peace process have struck with terrorist acts during times of
potential momentum, in an effort to derail the peace train.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who traveled to Sheperdstown five times during the past
week for extensive meetings with Barak and Sharaa, appeared to be
bracing the country _ and the people of the Middle East _ for the
possibility of just such activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a time of great tension, where all people will
have to search for wisdom
</P>
<P>
   and understanding, where there will be great reluctance to open
the closed fist and walk out into a new era,'' Clinton told
reporters at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clinton was upbeat about the prospects for an
agreement, in time, under which Israel would return the Golan
Heights to Syria in exchange for security guarantees and the
first-ever diplomatic and commercial relations between the two
Mideast neighbors. Israeli troops seized the strategic Golan
Heights from Syria during Arab-Israeli fighting in 1967. The terms
of that land's return lie at the heart of the peace talks that
recessed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very difficult issues,'' Clinton said. ``The good
news is they're not overwhelmingly complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton suggested that political will is more critical to the
success of the Syrian-Israeli track than crafty diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you have in these peace negotiations issues that are
both politically difficult and extremely complicated,'' said
Clinton. ``I think there is some complexity here, but it's all
quite manageable.''

were armed with a contraption that projects fake moons onto the
open sky.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``moon illusion,'' the moon rising or setting over the
horizon appears much bigger than the moon directly overhead, even
though both moons are exactly the same size. By allowing viewers to
move simulated moons toward and away from each other, the
scientists demonstrated that the so-called moon illusion seems to
be caused by the brain's inability to estimate huge distances in
the empty night sky. The brain has many similar perceptual
difficulties, they said, which produce a variety of convincing
optical illusions.
</P>
<P>
   An article explaining the moon illusion appears in the Jan. 4
issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, written
by Dr. Lloyd Kaufman, a professor emeritus of psychology from New
York University and senior research scientist at the C.W. Post
campus of Long Island University in Brookville, N.Y., and Dr. James
Kaufman, a physicist at IBM's Almaden Research Center in San Jose,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The moon illusion has baffled scientists since antiquity, the
Kaufmans said in separate telephone interviews. Aristotle, Ptolemy,
Leonardo da Vinci, Johannes Kepler, Rene Descartes and many others
have tried to explain it.
</P>
<P>
   But today scientists are able to take advantage of modern
insights into the nature of human perception. After an image falls
on the retina, where it resembles the image on a camera lens, it is
sent into the brain for further processing. Within the brain's
serpentine circuitry, every two-dimensional image is converted into
a richer, more accurate three-dimensional representation of the
world. It is within these many processing steps that illusions are
born, the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at a photograph of a person stretched out in front
of you on the grass, you see enormous feet and a tiny head,'' Dr.
Lloyd Kaufman said. But the brain takes that same image and makes
all sorts of so-called size constancy corrections so that the
person does not look distorted. The visual ``fact'' that the
person's body is not misshapen is actually an illusion.
</P>
<P>
   Given the understanding that the human brain constantly deals in
illusions, two theories have emerged to explain the moon illusion.
They are based on opposing views of how the perceptual system
computes size and distance.
</P>
<P>
   One theory attributes the moon illusion to how the brain deals
with the apparent size of distant objects. Because of how the light
falls on the retina, and other details, the brain judges the moon
to be smaller than it really is, and thus farther away, when it is
viewed in empty space.
</P>
<P>
   The second theory holds that the moon illusion arises from how
the brain deals with apparent distance, not size. When people view
the moon on the horizon, the story goes, their brains use myriad
signals from foreground terrain to compute the moon's size. Even in
flat terrain, the horizon appears very far away, so any large
object seen there, like a mountain, must be enormous.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the moon is treated like a mountain _ huge and very far
away. But when people look straight up at the moon, they no longer
have land clues to compute distances. Their brains _ and not their
eyes _ fail to adjust to the enormous distance involved and
perceive the moon as being closer and closer as it rises into the
night sky. The brain interprets this apparent distance discrepancy
to mean that the overhead moon is much smaller than it is.
</P>
<P>
   To find out which theory is correct, the Kaufmans invented a way
to measure how people perceive distances to the moon. Virtually all
other experiments have dealt with how people perceive the size of
the moon, the Kaufmans said.
</P>
<P>
   Their device consists of a laptop computer, a mirror and two
lenses that can project luminous discs, or simulated moons, into
the cloudless daytime sky. The apparatus works like a stereogram.
Double images are directed into each eye, where they fuse somewhere
inside the brain, giving the illusion of depth.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lloyd Kaufman took five people to a hilltop and had them
look through the apparatus until they saw two identical moons side
by side. One was a fixed moon that they could hold steady. The
other was a reference moon that they could move forward and back in
space. People were asked to position the reference moon so it was
halfway between themselves and fixed moon, the Kaufmans said.
</P>
<P>
   When moving the reference moon in relation to a fixed moon on
the horizon, people placed the reference moon about 100 feet away
from themselves, the scientists said. But when they moved the
reference moon in relation to an overhead moon, they placed it only
25 feet away. Thus the ``halfway'' point to a horizon moon was four
times farther away than the halfway point to an overhead moon.
</P>
<P>
   In a second experiment, subjects looked at two moons projected
high overhead and, pressing a key, moved one closer to themselves.
They were startled to find that as the moving moon got closer, it
always appeared to be getting smaller and not bigger.
</P>
<P>
   The two experiments confirm the second theory, the Kaufmans
said. If the brain were attending to size, the closer-in moon
should appear larger, but it does not.

A CRIME FOR `BLUE': TOO MUCH OF THE SAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
NYPD BLUE 
Starring: Dennis Franz, Rick Schroder, Andrea Thompson, Kim
Delaney 
On: ABC 
Time: Tuesday at 10 p.m. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Comes a time in the life span of many TV shows, even great ones
like ``MASH,'' when an insidious disorder threatens. It's called
unintentional self-parody, and ``NYPD Blue'' has been flirting with
it for the past two seasons. The crime plots have grown repetitive
and curiously unmoving; the blue atmospherics and the New
York-street-poetry dialogue have become merely theatrical; and,
well, there's Andy Sipowicz. With all due respect to Dennis Franz,
who brings admirable grace and consistency to his work, Sipowicz
has moved beyond the flawed and recovering hero and into the realm
of the cloyingly noble and stoic.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, as Sipowicz finds himself grieving yet another
loved one and on yet another mission to find ``who croaked this
DOA,'' ``NYPD Blue'' returns for its seventh season. It's back with
a vengeance of sorts, since the show had to wage a publicity war
with ABC to regain its Tuesday slot, after the network had planned
to give it to ``Once and Again.'' But it's back as a show in the
midst of confusion about where to go creatively, about how to
infuse new energy into a fairly played-out situation.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about the first two episodes of ``NYPD Blue'' is
Rick Schroder's Danny Sorenson. Since he joined the cast last year,
Schroder has managed not only to fit in but to look as if he's been
somewhere in the same neighborhood for years. He takes the script's
laconic, primitive-man dialogue and gives it an uncanny realism. It
is with his character, and his budding relationship with officer
Mary Franco (Sheeri Rappaport), that the show finds its freshest
moments. Schroder's Sorenson even makes Sipowicz easier to take.
``You are a very attractive man,'' he tells the slimmed-down
Sipowicz, simultaneously teasing him and helping him feel noticed.
</P>
<P>
   The weak elements of the show? The dashed-off crimes are a
significant problem. Two officers may have beaten a man to death;
next week a baby is found in a dumpster. Yawn. These cases are so
lacking in complexity and mystery that only a few high-pitched
guest performances _ a speed freak Tuesday, a transsexual next week
_ give them any hint of excitement or depth.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the melodrama among the regular characters is too obvious.
For the next two Tuesdays, Jill Kirkendall (Andrea Thompson) thinks
about returning to her former husband, who is clearly not to be
trusted. Diane Russell (Kim Delaney) gets stuck in the middle, and
in a few scenes it all goes exactly where you think it will go. No
subtlety, no surprise. Meanwhile, Sipowicz is giving single
fatherhood a try, a setup that will surely provide the show with
many big Hallmark opportunities for years to come. For instance,
Theo doesn't much care that humble Dad can't cook or make small
talk, and the little trooper gives the big guy a much-needed
consolation kiss at the dinner table. It's pretty hard to swallow,
and I'm not talking about the meatloaf.

   AOL-TIME-WARNER (New York) _ Ledeall: America Online, the
company that made the Internet accessible to the general public,
has agreed to buy the largest traditional media company, Time
Warner, for $165 billion in what would be the biggest merger in
history and the best evidence yet that the new media and the mass
media may finally be converging. By Saul Hansell.

   AOL-TIME-STRATEGY (Undated) _ Looking at the strategy behind
marrying a traditional media conglomerate with an online service
provider: The America Online-Time Warner merger represents the
triumph of the Internet as the irresistible force in business, not
just a fleeting enthusiasm on Wall Street and the obsession of the
nation's technology elite. The top executives of the two companies
presented the deal as a ``merger of equals'' on Monday. But it is
the shareholders of America Online Inc., that will own 55 percent
of the combined enterprise, though Time Warner will account for 80
percent of the revenues. Even the surviving stock symbol will be
AOL. By Steve Lohr.

   AOL-TIME-CASE (Undated) _ A profile of Steve Case of AOL:
Perhaps the only thing stranger than Steve Case, the chairman of an
Internet company perpetually thought to be doomed, assuming the
helm of the world's largest media conglomerate was that he wore a
suit to the press conference on Monday where he announced the
audacious merger plan. Case, 37, is known for clinging to his
casual costume of denim shirts and khakis even on the most formal
occasions, but if that changes when the merger of America Online
and Time Warner is completed, it may come as no surprise. Since
before the World Wide Web was invented, Case has survived the
quicksand of the Internet industry with a series of chameleon like
changes of which his deal with Time Warner is only the most recent.

   BUSH-ROVE (Austin, Texas) _ On a wall of Karl Rove's office at
George W. Bush's campaign headquarters here hangs an editorial
cartoon from a local newspaper that pretty much says it all. The
multipanel strip shows Gov. Bush, a would-be president, and Hillary
Rodham Clinton, a would-be senator, squabbling over ownership of a
narrow political spotlight. Each stakes a claim. Each grows
petulant. Then Bush plays his trump card. He hollers for Rove.
Readers outside of Texas might not get the reference, but give it a
few months. If Bush lopes to the Republican nomination as
decisively as many of his advisers and supporters believe that he
can, Rove will be hailed well beyond this state's boundaries as a
political mastermind. By Frank Bruni.

   MIDEAST-TALKS (Shepherdstown, W.Va.) _ After eight days of

   MIDEAST-ISRAEL (Tel Aviv, Israel) _ Taking over a plaza
associated with the peace camp, tens of thousands of Israelis
packed Rabin Square Monday night to protest a withdrawal from the
Golan Heights that would likely be a component of a peace deal with
Syria. As Prime Minister Ehud Barak prepared to fly home from an
intensive round of Israeli-Syrian negotiations in West Virginia,
busloads of yeshiva students, Golan residents and retired Russian
immigrants jammed the heart of secular, dovish Tel Aviv to send him
_ and President Clinton _ a few messages. By Deborah Sontag.

   CHINA-UFOS (Beijing) _ The last few months have been a boom time
for UFO enthusiasts in China. Just before the start of the year
2000, there were dozens of sightings. Strange shining objects were
observed scooting through the sky by hundreds of people, from
former airport workers to college deans. Buoyed in part by the
sightings, the ranks of the research societies in major Chinese
cities devoted to unidentified flying objects have grown to more
than 40,000 members. More important still, the normally
conservative official news media have been lavishing attention on
UFO news, with documentaries on the main government television
station and credulous newspaper articles. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.

   SAFETY: A Hidden Peril for Skiers in Woodlands
</P>
<P>
   Skiers who go into wooded areas in search of fresh powder should
be aware of a danger less obvious than hitting a tree: the risk of
falling into a ``tree well,'' a pit of deep, loose snow that forms
under low-lying branches sheltering a tree's base.
</P>
<P>
   A study of accidents in British Columbia ski resorts found that
eight of the 32 non-avalanche deaths from 1993 to 1998 happened
when a skier or snowboarder fell into a tree well or a deep drift
and suffocated. The wells, from 5 to 10 feet deep, are often
difficult to see because they are hidden by the same branches that
shield the tree's base from the snowfall. All the victims were
advanced skiers.
</P>
<P>
   The skiers were generally found buried head down in the snow.
The study's author, Dr. Robert Cadman, is a former member of the
British Columbia ski patrol who now lectures in the Edith Cowan
School of Nursing and Public Health in Perth. In tests he arranged
in the winter of 1998-99, volunteers who fell into simulated tree
wells were unable to extricate themselves; if they managed to
unbuckle their skis or snowboards, they only fell in deeper, he
wrote in last month's issue of The Physician and Sportsmedicine.
</P>
<P>
   While still rare, the dangers of such accidents may be increased
by the trend toward ``glading'' ski runs, or cutting down only
selected trees instead of clear cutting the trails, Cadman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   SIDE EFFECTS: For HIV, a Troublemaker in a Cocktail
</P>
<P>
   Ever since powerful new drugs to fight HIV were introduced in
1996, some patients have had to drop out of the treatment because
of liver damage. A new Johns Hopkins Medical Center study has found
that one particular drug, ritonavir, is responsible in about half
of such cases.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Sulkowski, the lead author of the study, published last
week in the Journal of the American Medical Association, said that
previous case reports appeared to implicate equally all of the new
drugs, called protease inhibitors, and seemed to indicate that the
problem was more common among patients also infected with hepatitis
C.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-year study of 211 HIV patients, researchers found that
10 percent developed severe liver toxicity, with only slightly
higher incidence in patients with hepatitis C. But rates of liver
damage were five times as high for those taking ritonavir as for
those who were not.
</P>
<P>
   ``These findings should not limit the use of ritonavir,''
Sulkowski said. ``They mean that treatment needs to be combined
with close monitoring.''
</P>
<P>
   Sulkowski said physicians should not give up on the medicine,
but carefully monitor patients receiving it.
</P>
<P>
   TRAUMA: Of Swollen Brains and Steep Coasters
</P>
<P>
   A roller-coaster day for a 24-year-old Japanese woman _ two
trips apiece on three rides, including the world's fastest _ left
her with a headache that took brain surgery to alleviate, a case
study in the journal Neurology reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The neurologists who treated her say that hers is the fourth
example in recent years of subdural hematomas _ bleeding that
collects in pockets under the brain's outer layer, usually produced
by a blow to the head _ caused by the new generation of giant
roller coasters.
</P>
<P>
   The woman was examined by the neurologists at the Chiba
University medical school, where she was treated. Her headache
began on her way home from the Fujikyu Highland Park, home of the
Fujiyama, which the authors describe as the world's highest (259
feet) and fastest (top speed of 81 mph during a drop of 230 feet)
roller coaster.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the diagnosis was tension headache. After the pain
persisted for two months, the doctors arranged for a brain scan,
which showed two hematomas. These were drained, and the headaches
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Toshio Fukutake, the author of the study, said he hoped the
report would prompt amusement parks to re-examine the risks of
giant rides. He suggested no more than two rides in a short period
and urged riders to see doctors immediately if unusual headaches
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Carley Ward, a specialist in biomechanics, whose
company, Biodynamic Engineering, has studied park rides, said she
found it ``hard to conceive'' that a roller-coaster could cause
such an injury.
</P>
<P>
   While riders experience changes in pressure, the body parts
generally move in tandem, leaving little chance for the kind of
brain injury described, she said.

<P>
   AT RISK: A Stress Test for the Mind and Heart
</P>
<P>
   Stress tests are routine tools in uncovering heart disease.
Patients run on treadmills, and instruments record the effects on
the heart's functioning. But what about mental stress, which has
also been shown to be a coronary risk factor?
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit recently tried
out an exam that they hoped would be able to pinpoint those
patients whose responses to emotional workloads could cause heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   In one part of the test, subjects were asked to match words and
colors in a ``game'' that speeded up with each correct answer. In
another, subjects were asked to play a role in a script of a
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   To see whether this exam could predict heart disease, the
researchers gave it to 184 patients who had already had heart
disease. They set up equipment that monitored their heart functions
while they performed those frustrating or anxiety-provoking tasks.
</P>
<P>
   The results, reported Monday in the Journal of Health
Psychology, were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, 58 percent of the patients showed ischemia, a
decrease in blood flow, during the scripted confrontation, a figure
that the study's lead author, Dr. Mark W. Ketterer, called
``amazing'' in connection with ``a trivial form of mental stress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To get this aroused over a contrived interaction with a
stranger in just five minutes means that most episodes of ischemia
in daily life are probably mentally rather than physically
induced,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   REACTIONS: When Insects Mean Trouble
</P>
<P>
   Allergic reactions to insects are the subjects of two articles
in the most recent issue of Allergy and Asthma Proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   One article reports that few people who use products containing
carmine _ among them makeup and certain foods and drinks _ realize
that it is an extract of the ground-up dried bodies of female
cochineal insects, scaly parasites that trigger allergies in some
consumers. The substance is found in products as diverse as yogurt
and eyeshadow, say researchers from the University of Michigan
Medical Center in Ann Arbor. Allergic reactions to the substance
can be controlled by treatment with histamines. But the best
strategy, avoidance, is complicated because carmine sometimes
appears on food labels only as ``artificial coloring'' and
cosmetics often preface long ingredient lists with ``may contain.''
</P>
<P>
   The other article deals with people who are allergic to bee
stings. On outings, such people often pack a syringe of
epinephrine, a hormone that can serve as an antidote. But
researchers from the University of Washington School of Medicine
wondered whether that was enough, given that the only guideline for
dosage was to keep giving epinephrine until the reaction was
controlled. A review of 105 patient charts found that in 38 cases
(36 percent), more than one injection was needed. They concluded
that patients had to be carefully monitored to see if such
follow-up shots were necessary and that those venturing into remote
areas should consider bringing additional supplies.

PONDERING THE MEDICAL ETHICS OF THE HUMAN GENOME PROJECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSIE MILLIGAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most significant medical experiences in the history
of mankind is taking place, in part, in an office not unlike the
ones most of us work in _ there's a blueberry iMac computer, potted
palms and a pothos plant, a peace-inducing windowsill fountain and
a stack of CDs including Pink Floyd's ``Dark Side of the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Except in this office, Skip Garner, 45, research physicist at
the Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development at the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, is
working to change life as we know it. He's working on a project
President Clinton frequently mentions in speeches as one of the
most significant of modern endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   Garner is one of about 175 Texans and neo-Texans in Dallas and
Houston joining other scientists nationwide on the Human Genome
Project, the federally funded endeavor to map the location and
function of the 100,000 or so human genes that control inherited
traits.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists in December completed mapping the first of the 23
chromosomes. A draft of the entire human genetic code is expected
to be complete by spring; a complete map of how we work is due by
2003.
</P>
<P>
   The research may someday cure hemophilia. Banish baldness.
Provide an antidote for biochemical warfare. Predict and perhaps
cure the diseases our children will get. Extend the quality and
quantity of life. It will, says Glen Evans, director of the genome
work at UT Southwestern, develop ``the computer-operating manual
for human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has been confounded by a computer-operating manual
may not feel comforted. For good reason, because though the
potential benefits of the project are many, critics of the program
are concerned that scientists are playing God.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some people's minds, this is a little scary,'' says Francis
Collins, a medical doctor who heads the National Institutes of
Health National Human Genome Research Institute in Washington, D.C.
``(People ask themselves), `What are they going to do here to
create the designer baby, or modify our own basic biology?'_ the
Frankenstein sort of scenario,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   No matter where the project is headed, we do know this: It's
going there very fast.
</P>
<P>
   In December, scientists announced they had completed mapping
chromosome 22, the second-smallest of the 23 human chromosome pairs
that make up our genetic code.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic research in Texas and throughout the nation, as well as
in other countries, is ``absolutely'' outpacing our ability to
understand how its outcome will be used, says Richard Gibbs, a
medical doctor and geneticist who heads the Baylor College of
Medicine Human Genome Project under an $80 million, five-year
federal grant.
</P>
<P>
   From Gibbs' point of view, that research toward unpredictable
ends is the normal province of science. He and other scientists say
what happens with the results of their research is dependent on
social and governmental controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``A public dialogue is needed,'' pleaded one of the nation's
premier genome scientists, J. Craig Venter, recently when he
announced that a team at the Institute for Genomic Research in
Rockville, Md., has isolated the minimum number of genes needed for
the tiniest known living organism, mycoplasma bacterium, to
survive. As such, they had isolated the essence of life on the
genetic level, an accomplishment that could lead to the scientific
creation of life.
</P>
<P>
   Fruits of genetic research are already being used in the
marketplace. Tests for genetic structures that cause Down syndrome
or predispose us to breast cancer or colon cancer already are in
use. Medical trials are under way in which humans are being
injected with new genes to replace the miscoded genes causing
disease.
</P>
<P>
   As well, there is multilayered governmental oversight of the
project. Funded by $3 billion in federal funds, the project to
determine the instructions for growth and development in each gene
is overseen by the federal National Institutes of Health and the
Department of Energy, which became interested after discovering
gene mutations caused by nuclear radiation. In 1990, federal
funding went to a handful of U.S. research universities to
determine the location and function of each part of the genome, the
term used for the complete set of human genes.
</P>
<P>
   The map of how humans work began with samples of DNA taken from
a large and diverse pool of volunteers, whose names are kept
confidential, in part to encourage volunteers, in part because it
doesn't matter who they are: 99.9 percent of DNA is common to any
two humans. We are, chemically, practically identical. The
remaining fraction of a percent that distinguishes us is made of a
multitude of chemically coded instructions for features such as
brown eyes or blue eyes.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has used this theme of genetic similarity in
many of his recent political speeches. The oldest problem of
society is the fact that we are prone to hate those who are
different from ourselves, he says. ``Think of all the bodies that
have been piled up,'' Clinton said recently during a memorial
salute to Israeli peacemaker Yitzhak Rabin, ``one after another,
the young and the old, throughout human history in tribute to that
one-tenth of 1 percent difference.''
</P>
<P>
   In the lobby of one of the offices at UT Southwestern is a large
and newly installed 16-foot-high sculpture by renowned Seattle
glass artist Dale Chihuly. It's composed of 1,100 tubes of shiny
orange glass squiggles, a beautiful work obviously created by a
passionate and brilliant artist who followed his own curiosity and
vision to build this innovative creation. Chihuly's work ultimately
is dependent upon public acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Steeves, public relations representative for the gene
doctors at UT Southwestern, shows the sculpture to visitors. It's a
stunning work, she notes, but who is going to dust it? That bit of
practicality is not the artist's concern.
</P>
<P>
   Like art, the success of science is dependent on public reaction
and public acceptance. Ultimately, it's up to the public to decide
upon the practical application of the fruits of the genome
research. Through politicians, through courts, through decisions
made in medical offices, the public will decide where this project
will go.

UNDATED: project will go. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A scientist's job, says Andrew Zinn, medical doctor and
researcher at UT Southwestern, is to do ``good science,'' to allow
his or her curiosity to follow the strands of DNA. Among Zinn's
accomplishments is discovering the gene required for male
fertility.
</P>
<P>
   ``But where will that discovery take us? We don't know. It could
someday be the path toward treating testicular cancer or may
someday result in a male contraceptive,'' Zinn says. ``In basic
research, you can't predict the value of the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Zinn and other researchers do care about how their
work will be used when it reaches the marketplace. Zinn teaches
ethical, legal and social issues surrounding gene research to
medical students at UT Southwestern.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone wanted to alter an embryo and put it back in its
mother, it's fine for us to say that's beyond bounds. We don't have
to work in a vacuum. If someone wanted to clone Hitler, it's
reasonable for the public to say we don't want to support that,''
Zinn says.
</P>
<P>
   Among the recommendations from scientists are new laws to
protect people from genetic discrimination as well as legislation
to more fully allow insurance coverage for pre-existing conditions.
Publicly funded scientists also say the research should stay
largely in the public realm so government can help control the
outcome of the research. In the Patient Bill of Rights passed in
the U.S. Congress in July 1999, a passage was included to prevent
discrimination by insurance companies based on genetic information
they have obtained from applicants.
</P>
<P>
   The fear is not without merit, says Sharon Davis, a researcher
with the national office of The Arc, formerly known as The
Association for Retarded Citizens. She tells of the day she opened
her mail and found a letter urging her to apply for mortgage
insurance. She read the fine print. If she signed the application,
she would be giving permission for the company to check her medical
records. She felt she could be turned down for mortgage insurance
if her files indicated she had even a predisposition for a risky
medical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Groups such as The Arc are worried that the first use of gene
research _ genetic tests for predispositions for certain medical
conditions _ will result in discrimination by life and medical
insurance providers, even by mortgage lenders, as well as employers
or even friends and families, says Davis, who helped move The Arc's
national headquarters from Arlington, Texas, to Maryland in
December.
</P>
<P>
   This is a concern of which scientists are well-aware. A test for
a genetic predisposition for Alzheimer's disease already has been
withdrawn because of a perplexing ethical problem, Zinn said. There
is no known preventive step to take against Alzheimer's yet. So
what could a person do if they found out they were at risk, besides
worry themselves into an unhappy life? ``Genetic testing should be
limited to conditions that are preventable,'' Zinn says.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the prevention itself becomes an issue? If a test
for the genetic predisposition for breast cancer turns out
positive, there are diet and lifestyle steps that may fend off the
disease, but some women may opt for a double mastectomy that may
never have been needed.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of prenatal genetic testing is already one faced by
prospective parents, who can opt to test their unborn baby for Down
syndrome. And if the test is positive, another ethical issue looms:
What to do about it?
</P>
<P>
   Another area of controversy: Gene therapy, the injection of
healthy genes to replace those with mutations, is already being
used in medical trials, with mixed success. An 18-year-old, Jesse
Gelsinger of Tucson, Ariz., died Sept. 17 at the University of
Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, where he was being treated with
experimental gene therapy for a rare metabolic disorder that blocks
the body's ability to break down ammonia, causing liver
dysfunction. That death is drawing concern that the National
Institutes of Health is not providing enough federal oversight in
medical trials. The Washington Post recently predicted battles
between supporters of federal control and drug companies who
already feel overburdened by government requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond those issues, organizations for people with disabilities,
such as The Arc, question whether everything needs to be ``cured.''
Disabilities are not diseases, and people with disabilities often
say they live meaningful lives, not in spite of their condition,
but because of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A segment of deaf people refers to itself as the deaf culture
and prefers to have children who are deaf,'' Davis says.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the project presents this conundrum: Should the genetic
code ``belong'' to someone?
</P>
<P>
   U.S. patent law treats DNA as a chemical, and chemicals may be
patented. Patents have been awarded on genes involved with the
humane growth hormone, blood clotting, and inherited forms of
breast and ovarian cancer. The patent gives the holder the right to
make money off his or her discovery as private drug companies use
the information to create therapies.
</P>
<P>
   The patenting process has fueled a race between privately funded
and publicly funded researchers to be the first discoverers and
patent holders of genes. Patenting is good, some say, because it
stimulates the pace of research; others are concerned that the lure
of drug-company money is problematic because it means vital
discoveries might not be available for shared research, Gibbs says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If only one or two large companies have this information, we
will have a society where health care is directed by only their
efforts,'' Gibbs says.
</P>
<P>
   And beyond all the issues of privacy and patents, how much
should we know? How will society react if a gay gene is discovered?
Or a gene that predisposes us to violence? Or a gene that makes
some people less intelligent than others? Can we even measure
intelligence?
</P>
<P>
   And those are just the controversial issues arising in public
debate in the earliest stages of our understanding of genes. These
are just building blocks to the vast world of research that looms
before us.

   The advent of DNA testing held out the promise of definitive
proof of innocence against charges of rape: if the DNA did not
match the suspect's he would be exonerated. But as ``The Case for
Innocence,'' Tuesday night's disturbing ``Frontline'' report,
demonstrates, many of those who come through the test successfully
do not find freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The point is made in case histories, beginning with that of Roy
Criner, a Texas man who was sentenced to 99 years in prison in 1990
for the aggravated sexual assault of a murdered 16-year-old girl.
He was convicted largely on the testimony of three acquaintances
who said Criner had bragged about the assault. In 1997 an appeals
lawyer had a specimen of Criner's DNA tested to determine whether
it matched the DNA in semen found in the victim's vagina. The
findings: It was not Criner's.
</P>
<P>
   Even after a retesting by the district attorney's office
confirmed the results, Criner remained in jail. The district
attorney declares that the DNA test was not conclusive. He says the
test ``means that the sperm found in her was not his.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean he didn't rape her,'' he added. ``Doesn't mean
he didn't kill her.''
</P>
<P>
   A majority on the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals agreed, on the
grounds that Crier might have worn a condom or did not ejaculate or
perhaps the semen belonged to a third person. Judge Sharon Keller
tells Ofra Bikel, the program's producer, that Criner ``has to
establish unquestionably that he is innocent, and he hasn't done
it.'' Judge Charles Baird, who dissented, says, ``Justice has
turned itself on the head when you have individuals who can prove
their innocence and prove that they're wrongfully confined, yet
still remain locked up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bikel relies for exasperated criticism of the law's workings
or nonworkings on Barry Scheck and Peter J. Neufeld, defense
lawyers best known for their appearances on behalf of O.J. Simpson.
As founders of the Innocence Project at the Benjamin N. Cardoza
School of Law, they are now devoting their efforts to less
celebrated, less affluent clients and running up against
prosecutorial resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Neufeld puts the typical prosecution argument this way: ``They
simply say the `doctrine of finality controls: what's over is
over.''' He reports that of 65 DNA exonerations after conviction,
not one was reopened for investigation by the police or the
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bikel persuaded Scheck to come to the aid of Clyde Charles,
a Louisiana man who is serving a life sentence for a 1981 rape. At
the program's end, she notifies viewers that his DNA test in
November was negative: ``He is not the rapist. Now the state of
Louisiana has to agree to let him out. Having just seen the
program, you probably realize that this is not something you want
to bet on.''

RIGHT ANGLE: SIDEWAYS THINKING DOES THE TRICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (RESENDING - ALSO MOVE IN `L' CATEGGORY)
 &UR; Thaddeus Steele was a man who could think sideways. In fact, he
invented the art.
</P>
<P>
   He was my wife's grandfather, and he was never completely
socialized. He kept rattlesnakes under the house. He fished and
hunted for a living, and although he sometimes held a job, if he
thought the fish were biting, he left the job site for the fishing
pond without a single wince of conscience.
</P>
<P>
   He also believed that traffic signs and stoplights were there to
``instruct those who didn't know how to drive.'' Because he knew
what he was doing, he ignored them.
</P>
<P>
   But it is for his inventive method of problem solving that I
remember him here. Thad Steele never met a problem he couldn't
solve, and in a way no one else might have thought of.
</P>
<P>
   When the corner post of his back porch cracked, and the porch
roof sagged on one side, he lassoed a nearby sapling and pulled it
down under the porch eave, using the natural springiness of the
tree to keep the roof from falling.
</P>
<P>
   STILL THAT WAY &QL; 
``It was still that way the last time I saw it,'' my wife says.
</P>
<P>
   Once, when a neighbor used a shortcut across his lawn,
eventually wearing a path in the grass, Thad Steele knew how to
stop her. He never would have confronted her directly; that wasn't
his style.
</P>
<P>
   No, he dug a person-size hole hip deep in the center of the
path, mixed up a load of pudding-quality mud to fill it in, used
carpet tacks to secure a cloth across the hole and sprinkled it
with dirt and grass to camouflage the hole.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the woman stepped into the hole up to her waist in
brown goo. She stopped shortcutting across his yard.
</P>
<P>
   I especially like the touch of the carpet tacks.
</P>
<P>
   There are many examples of Thad Steele's peculiar approach to
life.
</P>
<P>
   SHOOTING SCARE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His friend Hub Hawkins had a stutter. Thad had said many times
that ``if Hub were frightened enough, he'd talk as plain as the
next man.'' One day, while Thad and Hub's cousin Dewey were sitting
on the front porch, they saw Hub walking toward them on the
railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Thad leveled the pistol he always carried _ as all real men in
Madison, N.C., did in those days _ and fired several times at Hub's
feet, making him dance. Hub yelled back, ``D-D-Dod d-damn you,
D-Dad D-D-Deele!''
</P>
<P>
   That was one solution that didn't take.
</P>
<P>
   But sideways thinking often did work. Thad Steele kept five blue
Dodges in his backyard so he always had parts for the blue Dodge he
drove.
</P>
<P>
   When his wife and her sister argued violently over who owned a
beautiful pitcher and bowl that had belonged to their mother, Thad
Steele took the crockery down to the creek and broke them on the
rocks. It stopped the squabble.
</P>
<P>
   STRAIGHT TO REALITY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He pierced straight through to the reality, to the heart of
the matter,'' my wife says. ``He was not about social acceptance.
He thought it silly.''
</P>
<P>
   She remembers once, when she was about five years old, her
grandfather was asked to baby-sit her. For Thad Steele,
baby-sitting meant the child adapting to him, not the other way
around.
</P>
<P>
   And so, because he had intended to go hunting that day, the
child went hunting with him.
</P>
<P>
   He had seen a bunch of flying squirrels in the woods near the
house, and so the three of them _ Thad Steele, his gun and the
five-year-old girl _ went out shooting.
</P>
<P>
   After he had shot three of them, he wrapped them in a blanket
and handed them to the child, telling her, ``Take care of them like
babies.''
</P>
<P>
   There are perhaps more appropriate ways to deal with a child,
but the old man knew who he was dealing with.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have said, `Watch these while I go down the path
looking for more,' but he didn't. He turned them into baby dolls
for me. He understood me and made me feel like a million dollars. I
was their mother because of what he said to me.''
</P>
<P>
   My wife has learned her lessons from Thad Steele well. She is
also a master of sideways thinking.
</P>
<P>
   When she was young and poor, recently divorced, she couldn't
afford her automobile inspection, so she painted the inspection
sticker on the windshield of the car and used it for the full year.
</P>
<P>
   As an adult and an art teacher in Arizona, she was given an art
room with carpet _ not the best kind of floor for a room full of
second-graders with jars of tempera paint. And when the inevitable
spill happened and she couldn't scrub out the stain, she realized:
``I'm an art teacher; I can mix that color.''
</P>
<P>
   So she matched the color of the original carpet and painted over
the stain.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, in another school, after a month of working with
clay, the dried gray powder was ground into the tile floor. When
she asked the janitor to mop the floor to prevent the clouds of
dust from clay choking the kids, the janitor replied ``mopping is
not in my job description,'' and ignored her.
</P>
<P>
   So, as a master of sideways thinking, she and the kids filled up
a dozen or so 10-gallon buckets with tap water and then, in one
grand cascade, poured it all out onto the floor. She sent one of
the kids to the janitor with the message: ``Help! The room's
flooded!'' And the janitor came and mopped up the mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``The floor was the cleanest it had ever been,'' she notes.
</P>
<P>
   Sideways thinking helps get things done when ordinary thinking
is stymied.
</P>
<P>
   From the evidence of our family, sideways thinking skips
generations, like some genetic traits. My wife's grandfather had it
in spades, but her father did not. He was a thoroughly socialized
man, well-thought of in the community.
</P>
<P>
   My wife got the gene, but her daughter didn't. She is a reporter
on a newspaper in the South, and she has all the people skills
necessary for the job. But although she is very smart, her
intelligence travels in a straight line, not crabwise.
</P>
<P>
   But that daughter is now pregnant, and if the pattern holds
true, the twins she is carrying will turn out to think sideways,
like their grandmother and great-great grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   My wife looks forward to subverting them, showing them the
secrets of sideways life, hoping to explore a world free from
social and cultural expectations.
</P>
<P>
   And she looks forward to baby-sitting them, just like her
grandad baby-sat her.

<P>
   So she matched the color of the original carpet and painted over
the stain.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, in another school, after a month of working with
clay, the dried gray powder was ground into the tile floor. When
she asked the janitor to mop the floor to prevent the clouds of
dust from clay choking the kids, the janitor replied ``mopping is
not in my job description,'' and ignored her.
</P>
<P>
   So, as a master of sideways thinking, she and the kids filled up
a dozen or so 10-gallon buckets with tap water and then, in one
grand cascade, poured it all out onto the floor. She sent one of
the kids to the janitor with the message: ``Help! The room's
flooded!'' And the janitor came and mopped up the mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``The floor was the cleanest it had ever been,'' she notes.
</P>
<P>
   Sideways thinking helps get things done when ordinary thinking
is stymied.
</P>
<P>
   From the evidence of our family, sideways thinking skips
generations, like some genetic traits. My wife's grandfather had it
in spades, but her father did not. He was a thoroughly socialized
man, well-thought of in the community.
</P>
<P>
   My wife got the gene, but her daughter didn't. She is a reporter
on a newspaper in the South, and she has all the people skills
necessary for the job. But although she is very smart, her
intelligence travels in a straight line, not crabwise.
</P>
<P>
   But that daughter is now pregnant, and if the pattern holds
true, the twins she is carrying will turn out to think sideways,
like their grandmother and great-great grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   My wife looks forward to subverting them, showing them the
secrets of sideways life, hoping to explore a world free from
social and cultural expectations.
</P>
<P>
   And she looks forward to baby-sitting them, just like her
grandad baby-sat her.

   NEW YORK _ Obsession isn't a dirty word in ``Dirty Blonde,'' the
wonderfully warmblooded new play about the importance of being and
of worshipping Mae West, that steel tomato of a sex goddess. This
smart, tough and tenderhearted comedy at the New York Theater
Workshop, written by and starring Claudia Shear (of ``Blown
Sideways Through Life'' fame), redeems a type that hasn't gotten
great press of late: the religiously fixated fan.
</P>
<P>
   In tracing the contemporary friendship of two West idolizers,
the kind for whom swapped movie dialogue constitutes a
conversation, ``Dirty Blonde'' makes a persuasive and entertaining
case for stargazing as healthy exercise. Though you can understand
why they have mostly kept their fanaticism to themselves, these
characters aren't Mark David Chapmans in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of getting lost in their shared obsession, Jo (Ms.
Shear), a brassy sometime actress, and Charlie (Kevin Chamberlin),
a shy film archivist, use it to find themselves and each other. And
along the way, ``Dirty Blonde,'' which opened Monday night under
the stylish and compassionate direction of James Lapine, completely
conjures an iconic personality in a way that more earnest stage
biographies, like Terrence McNally's ``Master Class,'' seldom
manage.
</P>
<P>
   Both a man and a woman turn into Mae West, in full costume, but
this is no evening of mere impersonation or drag. Being a
caricature, it seems, doesn't mean you can't be a character, too.
</P>
<P>
   It is double vision that gives ``Dirty Blonde'' its edge over
the usual dead-celebrity theater. The show is in part a portrait of
the shaping, into solid hourglass form, of the Depression-era movie
star Mae West, whom Ms. Shear portrays in every phase of her adult
life, from the steamroller robustness of youth to the Gothic
self-exaggerations of her old age.
</P>
<P>
   Framing this chronicle is the story of two lost souls in New
York City in the early 21st century who draw talismanic comfort
from West's brassy image. Certain presidential candidates say they
ask themselves, when at a crossroads, ``What would Jesus do?'' For
Jo and Charlie the question is ``What would Mae do?''
</P>
<P>
   As she demonstrated in ``Blown Sideways,'' her one-woman
autobiographical tale of holding and losing 64 jobs, Ms. Shear has
an eloquent affinity for those who have never found their niche. In
``Dirty Blonde,'' which was conceived by Ms. Shear with Lapine, she
presents a Hollywood success story through the eyes of people who
see themselves, in different ways, as losers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this beautifully written work, which also features the
excellent Bob Stillman, a dream of a chameleon, in an assortment of
roles, never sees its characters as pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   There is dignity and clearsightedness in Jo and Charlie's
reverence for Mae. Going over the chapters of her life, they see
the woman, both monstrous and human, behind the gloriously vulgar
screen siren. Charlie, who met Mae when he was 17 and she was a
very senior citizen, knows vividly the price that her stardom
exacted.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this doesn't dim the sense of wonder Mae inspires. Indeed,
perhaps the most impressive achievement of ``Dirty Blonde,'' which
has its (forgivable) flaws, is how it takes apart a celluloid
illusion without destroying it. It's deconstruction without
demolition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dirty Blonde'' begins, as befits a religious observance, with
a litany, as Jo and Charlie, standing before Douglas Stein's
scrumptious pink trapezoidal set, deliver in counterpoint some
definitions of the archetypal ``tough girl,'' who ``goes where she
shouldn't and when she gets there she does exactly what she
wants,'' who never talks ``like she'd like to be somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   As the play continues, it turns into a triptych on the process
of becoming Mae West: for Jo, Charlie and Mae herself.
</P>
<P>
   With minimal confusion, ``Dirty Blonde'' bleeds between scenes
of Jo and Charlie's developing relationship (they meet at Mae's
grave on her birthday) and of the stages in the evolution of their
idol. Stillman and Chamberlin play the various men in Mae's life,
who range from boxers to drag queens, from a vaudeville partner and
discardable husband to the elegant director who taught her not to
act.
</P>
<P>
   Stein's impeccably conceived sets and Susan Hilferty's terrific
period costumes are key, of course, in sustaining the play's levels
of illusion. But so is David Lander's lighting. (Watch for the
film-noir-style Venetian-blind effect he uses for the scenes of
Charlie's encounters with the ancient Mae.)
</P>
<P>
   Stillman is also the show's musical director, arranging such
West classics as ``I'm No Angel'' and contributing the show's title
song, which is used for a surreally realistic sequence showing the
aged Mae in a Las Vegas act performing with muscle men. These
musical moments, artfully staged by John Carrafa, never exist as
mere diversions.
</P>
<P>
   They are all designed to comment on different phases of the West
persona. And the show's shiver-making pinnacle comes when you see
Ms. Shear's Mae, who has been observed experimenting with different
styles, turn into the figure who would launch a thousand _ nay, a
million _ imitators and impersonators: the confident, corseted
belle of her Broadway hit of 1928, ``Diamond Lil.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, in a particularly ingenious instance of
overlap, Ms. Shear is also Jo, dressing up as Mae for a Halloween
costume party.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlin is superb as Charlie, who locates the affirmative
strength in a man who finds himself in a dress and whose awkward
self-effacement is the perfect foil to the self-dramatizing of Jo,
a wisecracking big-bodied single woman with a distinct resemblance
to Claudia Shear. You understand immediately why these people were
meant to be together.
</P>
<P>
   The play cheats itself in its overpadded final half-hour,
concentrating on unnecessary, if delicious, anecdotes of Mae's
later career, when the focus should be more squarely on Jo and
Charlie. Jo, curiously, feels less finely detailed as a character
than Charlie. But Ms. Shear's Mae is beyond reproach, never
settling into obvious cartoonishness. There is always somebody at
home behind the extravagantly stylized gestures.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the frighteningly willful, tenacious and man-eating Mae
of her early professional years, her latter-day peer in the art of
scandalous self-promotion, Madonna, inevitably comes to mind.
Indeed, you come to realize the extent to which screen sirens from
Marilyn Monroe to Sharon Stone were made possible by the existence
of Mae West.
</P>
<P>
   She's an abiding pole star in the constellation of self-created,
nonpassive sex objects, someone who remains, as Jo points out, so
legendary that she has had a cruller named after her. Not that Mae
West emerged full-blown. ``Dirty Blonde'' expertly demonstrates how
much Mae borrowed from others, including the sort of drag queens
who would later dress up like her.
</P>
<P>
   Jo and Charlie, in turn, take what they need from their images
of Mae to define and solidify their own personalities. The creation
of self is the art form in which we all participate, and all
artists, of course, borrow from their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind what Will Hays, the code-enforcing Hollywood censor,
or the virginal movie star Mary Pickford thought of Mae West as a
corrupting influence. ``Dirty Blonde'' demonstrates that this
immortal sinner, who started life with little traditional beauty or
classic talent, is a worthy saint for those seeking the divinity in
their own mortal clay.

DOORS OPEN TO FUN WHEN GORDON ELLIOTT SHOWS UP FOR DINNER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAY HANDELMAN   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gordon Elliott is getting used to having doors slammed in his
face. But homeowners who welcome the former talk-show host inside
are in for a gourmet treat.
</P>
<P>
   It's understandable why some people might be a bit put off when
the 6-foot-7, Australian-born Elliott shows up unexpectedly at the
door, large camera crew in tow. And what's that person in the
chef's outfit doing with him? And why do they want to look in your
refrigerator?
</P>
<P>
   Slamming doors are all part of the fun on ``Gordon Elliott's
DoorKnock Dinners,'' a new series on cable's Food Network. Each
week, Elliott and his crew travel around a suburban neighborhood
(mostly in the New York area to start), and ask homeowners to let a
chef into their kitchen to make a gourmet meal out of whatever they
find in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   What would you do?
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days we're lucky. We step off the `dinnerbago' (a mobile
home) and right into somebody's home,'' Elliott said in a telephone
interview. ``But we've been thrown out by a vast collection of
intelligent citizenry. I wouldn't let me in. I think it disrupts
people's established routines.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it is the Food Network, the focus is partly on the dinner
being prepared by the guest chefs, many of them rising culinary
stars who may wind up with their own shows a la Emeril Lagasse.
While the chef scours the refrigerator (sometimes empty or filled
with once-edible foodstuffs) to make something out of nothing,
Elliott runs around the house, interviewing the residents and even
airing some dirty laundry (literally).
</P>
<P>
   Hesitancy at the front door is great fodder for Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been asked to produce ID. People are naturally
suspicious,'' Elliott said. ``I think that helps the show, when
you've got a really tough nut to crack at the front door, it makes
it more entertaining. I get on my knees and beg quite a bit. Good
old fashioned begging. I also play the pitiful immigrant sometimes.
That seems to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The new series grew out of a routine Elliott developed a dozen
years ago while working on ``Good Day New York'' in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be on a street corner in New York and go to knock on a
door. Of course, I'd find a lovely Cuban family who didn't speak
English. But it worked so well, I ended up cooking them
breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, he's returned to a familiar format.
</P>
<P>
   ``These doorknocks are like career herpes. They keep coming
back.'' But this time around, he comes with a larger crew and a
chef. The mix of Elliott's comical banter and the food preparation
is providing a showcase for the chefs. ``It's a good way for the
food network to give me their hot young talent, try them out and
see how they like television. This is not an easy show.''
Especially when the refrigerator is empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that as much as I love a door where they don't want to
let me in,'' Elliott said. Chef Cheryl Smith had the assignment to
make a meal for a couple of teachers who had nothing in the
refrigerator but old Chinese food.
</P>
<P>
   ``She found two pork chops in the freezer that had been there
since the 1960s, crushed up matzo crackers, used the duck sauce and
rice from the Chinese food and we had Matzo Crusted Pork, which the
rabbi wasn't too pleased with.''
</P>
<P>
   A bottle of Sunny Delight was used to turn some tossed-out
chicken (the homeowners were leaving on a long trip) into a
Hawaiian feast for the whole neighborhood. ``I never saw anybody
make a gourmet meal from Sunny Delight,'' Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   It's just such food combination challenges that excite Tyler
Florence, a chef at Cafeteria in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did two doorknocks, and it was a riot,'' he said. ``The last
show we did, we were kicked out of three homes, but Gordon keeps it
lively the whole time.
</P>
<P>
   Florence said the cooking was the best part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get to actually walk into someone's kitchen, use their pots
and pans and knives and their food, and sometimes all you find is a
set of AA batteries and milk of magnesia. But sometimes you get
good stuff, too.'' Florence has been seen in numerous Food network
shows, which he said was making culinary personalities more
personable.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the crew is busy creating a picture-perfect table
setting, with good china and silverware. Sometimes, Elliott brings
along surprise guests, like a trio of singing waiters or a team of
ice sculptors who created a 300-pound turkey from a block of ice
for a Thanksgiving week episode.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever fun Elliott is creating in the rest of the house, he
said ``the cooking is the cement that holds my silliness together.
If it was all me, it wouldn't have the weight that it needs. I
think the chef is the grownup taking charge and I'm the large house
pet let loose for a half an hour.''

 &HT;    AOL/Time Warner: New, fresh company or confusing mess?
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The combination of AOL and Time Warner creates one of
the richest collections of brands since Mr. Procter met Mr. Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Is that creation a work of genius in synergy? That's the belief
of J. Walker Smith, president of Yankelovich Partners, the national
marketing and research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``An established brand name is a lot cheaper than building a new
brand identity,'' he said. ``What it takes to build a brand is
either a huge amount of money ... or brand new territory to
conquer, and what the Internet brought was brand new territory to
conquer.''
</P>
<P>
   Or is the deal a $350 billion mistake that will erase some of
the value of the brands _ ``mushing them together'' into a bland
customer confusing mess? That's the thinking of Al Ries, chairman
of Ries &AMP; Ries, an Atlanta-based marketing firm that does strategic
planning for ABC Radio, Coca-Cola, Dell, Frito-Lay, IBM, Pillsbury,
Turner Broadcasting and Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing unusual in experts that disagree. But both men
and most marketing experts do agree with Jagdish N. Sheth,
Kellstadt professor of marketing and strategy at Emory University's
Goizueta Business School, that the deal creates both pitfalls and
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at those pitfalls, Ries said the new media monolith must
work hard ``to keep each brand separate. When you mush brands
together, you cause confusion on the part of your customers and
prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes _ after spending so much money for Time Warner _ the
temptation will be to milk the brands and meld them to ``make the
synergy pay off. The tendency is that you buy something for more
than book value, otherwise why sell, and now one plus one has to
equal three.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that's just the kind of new math created by what he
calls a genius of a deal.
</P>
<P>
   He believes the umbrella of brands does add up to more than
their separate values. That added value comes in being able to
collect marketing information from customers of one brand and use
it to sell those customers another brand under that big umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, consumers could care less if People magazine is owned by
Time magazine. They don't care if it's owned by AOL,'' he said.
``However, from a marketing standpoint it (this deal) has to do
with what the real battle of the Internet is all about _ who owns
the customer. The Internet has made every business into a database
business. The real genius of the AOL Time Warner merger is that
they now have synergistic ways to leverage the ways that they can
sell to their customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheth also believes that owning such a premier collection of
brands ``has more opportunity than dangers.''
</P>
<P>
   For him, an almost hidden value in the deal is the creation of
brands that will have global clout and awareness with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately all media have to go global,'' he said. ``AOL is a
global medium, CNN is a semi-global medium, Time is semi-global. It
is a brilliant thing to do. AOL will be the opportunity for them to
become the global media company.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ries believes that the deal will create enough problems
right here at home to keep executives of the new company busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some of the synergies are phony synergies. (At CNN,
after it become part of Time Warner) did the additions of Time and
Sports Illustrated make the programming any better? It didn't
increase the number of viewers to CNN. It's the same thing as the
Disney/ABC merger. You are competing with yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheth says ``that's a legitimate fear, but the opposite is true
too.'' He sees value in consolidating some of the brands since
``too many brands also create tremendous amount of cost of
maintaining those brands. There are no economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what will eventually happen is that you will have
brands created for a specific medium ... and each medium could have
a common brand name. CNN becomes identified with cable; AOL with
the Internet, Time Life with publishing.''

   The evening's opening act, Mike Albo, a monologuist, described
his first crush on a boy with Big Country hair and a football
fetish. Then came the Scottish fellows, the Nimmo Twins, who told a
story about feeding their cook to their dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there was Lewis Black, perhaps the world's most
combustible comedian, who used most of his time onstage to scream
at the audience, a crowd packed with talent agents and other
``industry'' types.
</P>
<P>
   ``What, exactly,'' Black asked, ``do you people do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Must See TV'' it wasn't. But that may be exactly what NBC is
looking for in its latest adventure in development: a newly opened
downtown cabaret space the network is calling P.S. NBC. The
cabaret, housed in the Here Arts Center in SoHo, formally opened
last Thursday night with a hourlong performance by three local solo
acts and an import from the Edinburgh Fringe festival (the guys
with the dogs).
</P>
<P>
   The idea, said NBC officials, is to use the space as a testing
ground for New York-based writers and performers whose work might
not otherwise ever be seen by network executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt there was this plethora of untapped talent,
particularly in New York, that was falling under the radar,'' said
Marc Hirschfeld, executive vice president for casting at NBC, who
oversaw the opening. ``We want to establish relationships with
these people in their nascent stages.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the network has booked a roster of downtown
comedians and solo performers, including Marc Maron, Sarah Jones
and Elisa DeCarlo, to try out their acts in front of a live
audience.
</P>
<P>
   The cabaret, which will run Monday through Thursdays and is free
to the public, will also feature staged readings of new plays and
more fully completed productions. Each performance will be taped so
it can be viewed later by network officials on both coasts.
</P>
<P>
   Although the performers are unpaid, anyone who appears at P.S.
NBC signs a 30-day option agreement giving the network the
exclusive right to sign the performer or writer to potential
development deals. That promise, said Hirschfeld, has resulted in a
4-foot pile of unsolicited submissions on his office floor.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is not completely new. HBO, for instance, has a
workshop theater in Los Angeles where comedians try out material.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the idea is new to New York, and certainly new to
off-off-Broadway, where many performers still view Hollywood as
anathema to real creative work.
</P>
<P>
   That strange juxtaposition of network power and downtown grit
was on display last Thursday night inside the 99-seat cabaret as a
well-dressed crowd walked up creaky risers and crammed into folding
chairs. ``Access Hollywood,'' an entertainment news show, was
represented, as were William Morris and several other major talent
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   There was ample lighthearted skepticism about the project.
</P>
<P>
   After reading a mission statement drafted by NBC and packed with
words like ``safe haven,'' ``collaboration'' and ``nurture,'' the
comedian Andy Richter, the evening's host, said: ``What is this
`safe space' stuff? Are there snakes in other theaters?''
</P>
<P>
   Black, not surprisingly, also took a few swipes. ``What are they
going to do here?'' he asked. ``Leo DiCaprio as Hamlet? Molly
Ringwald does Beckett? I mean, what?''
</P>
<P>
   Jokes aside, Hirschfeld says he is confident that his experiment
will pay dividends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the material is not going to be mainstream enough to
be embraced by a large audience,'' he said. ``But the performer
might be.''

CARNEGIE HALL PLANS 140 EVENTS   WITH 22 MAJOR ENSEMBLES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Austria, Germany, Ill., Calif., Ohio)   By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The schedule for the 2000-2001 season of Carnegie
Hall presentations, more than 140 events, was announced Monday by
Franz Xaver Ohnesorg, who is in his first full year as the
institution's executive and artistic director. The 110th season at
``the mother of all concert halls,'' as Ohnesorg called it during a
news conference, will begin on Oct. 3 with a benefit program by the
Cleveland Orchestra, with Christoph von Dohnanyi conducting
Schumann's Symphony No. 2 and Brahms' Piano Concerto No. 2 with the
pianist Maurizio Pollini as soloist.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of next season's offerings were planned by Ohnesorg's
predecessor, Judith Arron, who died in late 1998. But Ohnesorg said
he and Ms. Arron shared ideas and artistic and aesthetic
principles. ``It's easy to embrace the programs I found,'' he said.
He was able to add many projects of his own devising, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Next season 22 major international and important regional
orchestras will perform at the hall, many of them in series of two
or more concerts. Among the highlights are the Vienna Philharmonic
in three programs conducted by Pierre Boulez; the Vienna Symphony,
on its 100th-anniversary tour, conducted by Vladimir Fedoseyev; the
Chicago Symphony in three programs conducted by Daniel Barenboim;
the San Francisco Symphony in two programs conducted by Michael
Tilson Thomas; and the Philadelphia Orchestra in seven programs,
four led by Wolfgang Sawallisch. The season includes a special
focus on Stravinsky, with 19 major works to be performed by 10
orchestras.
</P>
<P>
   Carnegie Hall will continue its Perspectives concerts, begun
this season, through which an artist is invited to devise a series
of integrated programs. The pianist Peter Serkin, a new
Perspectives presenter, has planned four programs with the London
Sinfonietta, directed by the composer and conductor Oliver Knussen,
and the Orion String Quartet. Serkin's programs will center on his
fascination with the late works of Stravinsky, branching out to
include works by Webern, Takemitsu, Wolpe and Charles Wuorinen and
the world premieres of piano quintets by Peter Lieberson and
Alexander Goehr.
</P>
<P>
   Next season Pollini and Barenboim will complete the Perspectives
series they began this season, Pollini with the Cleveland
Orchestra, the Emerson String Quartet, the Accardo Quartet and the
Ensemble Wien-Berlin, and Barenboim with the the Staatskapelle
Berlin and distinguished individual colleagues, including Yo-Yo Ma
and Itzhak Perlman.
</P>
<P>
   Among other notable events, the celebrated Met Orchestra will
offer three programs conducted by James Levine (to include
performances of Verdi's Requiem and Schoenberg's ``Gurrelieder''),
and a Scriabin-Shostakovich program conducted by Valery Gergiev. As
a pianist, Levine will accompany the soprano Jessye Norman in three
recital programs. Other recitalists include the mezzo-soprano
Cecilia Bartoli (Barenboim accompanying) and the pianists Alfred
Brendel, Evgeny Kissin and Andras Schiff (three programs to
commemorate the Bach anniversary).
</P>
<P>
   Boulez, who this year holds the Richard and Barbara Debs
Composer's Chair at Carnegie Hall, will extend his tenure through
the 2002-3 season. As an expression of ``our desire to make our
concerts more accessible to the community,'' Ohnesorg said, a new
program will provide 72 reduced-price tickets at $10 each to every
event sponsored by Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   As a prelude to the season, Sept. 24 will be Isaac Stern Day at
Carnegie Hall, with a full roster of family concerts, exhibits and
celebrations for the 80th birthday of the musician who organized
support to save the hall from demolition in the early 1960's and
after whom the main auditorium is named.
</P>
<P>
   ``He molded this place,'' Ohnesorg said in tribute to Stern, who
also spoke at the news conference.

PLUTONIUM EXPOSURE EYED AS POSSIBLE CAUSE OF GULF WAR SYNDROME 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some veterans advocates have long worried that one
of the most effective weapons of the Gulf War _ powerful
armor-piercing rounds made from depleted uranium _ contributed to
the illnesses plaguing thousands who served in that conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Now those fears have been exacerbated by suspicions that the
ammunition and related armor shielding that thousands of Gulf
troops were exposed to could have been tainted with highly
radioactive plutonium and neptunium.
</P>
<P>
   Based on reviews made by the Department of Energy in light of
problems at a nuclear weapons plant in Paducah, Ky., Gulf War
Syndrome watchdogs are demanding the Pentagon and Department of
Veterans Affairs determine if the depleted uranium was contaminated
and what the health consequences would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pentagon had a moral and legal obligation to tell soldiers
of this extraordinarily serious hazard,'' said Paul Sullivan,
executive director of the National Gulf War Research Center. ``The
scientists who advise us tell us there is no safe amount of
plutonium exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential of plutonium exposure represents an escalation in
the dispute veterans are waging with the Pentagon and other experts
over the risks posed by munitions manufactured out of depleted
uranium _ the material remaining after uranium is stripped of its
most radioactive elements for use in nuclear weapons and fuel.
</P>
<P>
   This low-level radioactive byproduct is valuable as a weapon
because of its extreme density. Traveling at almost 4,000 mph, the
uranium shells can slice through armor like butter, touching off
fires and explosions upon penetration. More than 800,000 rounds
were expended in the Gulf and they were also employed in Bosnia and
Kosovo. An estimated 300 tons of depleted uranium were deposited
throughout the Gulf theater.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans groups active on Gulf War issues contend the substance
presented a health risk to Gulf troops because the explosions
created toxic vapor clouds inhaled by soldiers fighting with Iraqi
forces, rushing to the aid of U.S. units hit by friendly fire or
working on disabled U.S. tanks. Some U.S. soldiers hit by shrapnel
still have depleted uranium fragments imbedded in their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Several Pentagon studies have dismissed the idea of depleted
uranium posing an inordinate radiological health threat.
Independent studies have agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The health risks associated with radiation from exposures to
depleted uranium are relatively low _ so low as to be statistically
undetectable,'' said a report published in the November/December
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. The review notes one exception.
``Radiation doses for soldiers with embedded fragments of depleted
uranium may be troublesome.''
</P>
<P>
   An official of a board appointed by the president to oversee the
Pentagon's study of Gulf War Syndrome said the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, Department of Defense and Department of Energy are now
investigating the possible contamination of depleted uranium
stockpiles with results due by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Kaplan, deputy executive director of the Special Oversight
Board, said preliminary indications are that even if plutonium were
present, the trace amounts would be so infinitesimal as to be
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, along with every other board that has looked into it, have
said DU is not the cause of this,'' said Kaplan, referring to
illnesses known collectively as Gulf War Syndrome. ``Based on what
we are getting from DOE, the NRC and DOD on the contaminated
depleted uranium at Paducah, it is not going to change our view.''
</P>
<P>
   The focus on plutonium arose out of revelations of environmental
and safety hazards at the energy department's Gaseous Diffusion
Plant in Paducah, one of three U.S. facilities capable of producing
depleted uranium through the uranium enrichment process.
</P>
<P>
   News accounts of the problems piqued the interest of veterans
advocates, who began examining DOE records and uncovered documents
showing that the depleted uranium from the plant could have been
contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it potentially much more hazardous,'' said Dan Fahey,
an analyst at the Military Toxics Project who closely follows
depleted uranium issues.
</P>
<P>
   He and others say they are not certain the depleted uranium from
Paducah was used in the Gulf weapons, but they want it
investigated, saying some senior Pentagon and VA officials seem to
have been aware of the potential contamination. They also contend
it is time for the Pentagon to carry out extended study on the
risks of depleted uranium in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is, we have gathered such a mass of evidence, we
think we have a pretty good basis for asking for new research,''
said Chris Kornkven, a Wisconsin veterans activist on depleted
uranium.
</P>
<P>
   He says the ramifications go beyond Gulf War Syndrome since
depleted uranium weapons were used by NATO forces in Eastern Europe
and are in the arsenals of 18 other nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we don't use it, troops should be trained to identify
it and avoid it,'' Kornkven said.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: AN OVERDOSE OF QUIZZES? NO QUESTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Quiz shows? Can you escape them? For the first time, each of the
four major broadcast networks offered a big-money prime-time quiz
show over the weekend. Is that coincidence? There are no
coincidences.
</P>
<P>
   The same weekend that this television history was being made,
Paul Thomas Anderson's film ``Magnolia'' went into national
release. Its lesson, repeated over (and over) during its three
hours, is that there are no coincidences. Of the tormented souls
who populate Anderson's entwined stories, most have had some
intimate association with what? A television quiz show. A
coincidence?
</P>
<P>
   Following hard on the heels of ABC's supersuccessful ``Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire'' and Fox's quickly mounted ``Greed: The
Series,'' two new shows arrived over the weekend. CBS unveiled
``Winning Lines,'' with Dick Clark as host, on Saturday night. NBC
revived the notorious ``Twenty-One,'' with Maury Povich, on Sunday
night. ``Twenty-One'' was a sensation in the 1950s until it was
shown to have been rigged.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: In the fall of 1958, just before the quiz-show scandal
broke, the prime-time schedules of CBS and NBC were loaded with
quiz shows. The third network, ABC, had no prime-time quiz show,
but that was the year it gave an evening slot to its avuncular
afternoon star, Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Then poor Charles Van Doren, America's favorite quiz show
contestant, had to admit that he collaborated with the producers of
``Twenty-One'' to fix the game in his favor. By the fall of 1959,
prime-time quiz shows were virtually gone. And while the attention
of viewers was being pulled in new directions, ABC offered two
shows a week featuring whom? Clark. The same Clark who is not only
the host of ``Winning Lines'' but an executive producer of ``Greed:
The Series.'' Coincidence?
</P>
<P>
   On the evidence of the ``Winning Lines'' premiere, this
particular game may be too dizzyingly complicated for even the
reliably glib Clark to explain. In fact he had trouble on occasion
explaining the rules. The show does have its pluses, beginning with
its brevity: a half-hour. (Its three current rivals are all twice
as long.) Its format allows ``Winning Lines'' to present an
ever-escalating drama in three acts in which 49 contestants are
winnowed down to a field of six and finally one, who participates
in what Clark calls ``the most intense three minutes in
television,'' with a potential top prize of $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Since the show is based around numbers, many of the questions in
the first two rounds sound like those ``word problems'' you hated
in junior high school, and the host recites them with uneasy care,
sounding like a substitute teacher giving a pop quiz:
</P>
<P>
   If Linda Tripp has received two more minutes of fame than the
amount that Andy Warhol said everybody gets, how many minutes of
fame has she received? Seventeen.
</P>
<P>
   If Ricky Martin's homeland of Puerto Rico becomes a state, how
many stripes will there be on the flag. Trick question; still 13.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the material here, as on the show's three rivals, is all of
the general-knowledge and brain-teaser type. The legacy of Van
Doren, college teacher and fallen hero: no advanced degrees are
required to compete in today's games.
</P>
<P>
   Finally the single survivor gets to match wits with the Wonder
Wall of answers, numbered from 1 to 49, swirling around a vast
video screen. The contestant must yell out the answers and their
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What university does Chelsea Clinton attend?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirteen! Stanford!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is the oldest living former vice president of the United
States?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-one! Ford!''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Saturday's contestant, Catherine Rahm, bailed out
with $500,000, everybody needed a drink of water. Or something.
Intense? Yes. Confusing? Too much so.
</P>
<P>
   The following night NBC offered ``Twenty-One,'' which looks like
the best of the current quiz crop. (Sure, that's like choosing the
most talented Spice Girl, but there you are.) Povich strikes the
right balance between authority and excitement. The rules are
effectively simple. Two contestants play a quick round, selecting
questions by point value (more points, harder question) in an
effort to reach 21 points first.
</P>
<P>
   For seven points, what product has the slogan ``When it rains,
it pours'': sugar, raincoats, salt or umbrellas?
</P>
<P>
   The round is quick. The winner gets $100,000 plus more for an
even quicker bonus round and then faces a challenger. Keep winning
and you keep playing, getting a higher amount each time without
limit. Theoretically a contestant can just keep winning forever.
Meanwhile the viewer can focus on the two players, see them as
individuals and follow the game. Unlike ``Winning Lines,'' however,
each show is bound to end anticlimactically in mid-round. See you
next time.
</P>
<P>
   There are some ``Millionaire''-inspired gimmicks, like the
``second chance'' rule that allows the player to bring out a friend
or relative to help answer one question. ``Look Jenny, it's your
husband, Julius!'' The prizes are presented as wads of cash dropped
into NBC tote bags.
</P>
<P>
   But pared down to a reasonable half-hour, this one could have a
long run, even steal some thunder from ``Greed'' and
``Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Greed,'' which returned for three shows last week and has now
settled into a single Friday night slot, bills itself as ``the
richest, most dangerous game in America.'' Its top prize is set at
$2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The host, Chuck Woolery, presides with unflagging bonhomie,
which is sometimes at odds with the cutthroat nature of the game.
Players who begin as teammates, standing to make money on one
another's correct answers, are periodically encouraged to try
pushing one of those teammates out of the game. The questions fly
by: How many cans of Spam are consumed in the United States every
minute? How many United States presidents are now alive? What
company produces the Game Boy?
</P>
<P>
   How much more of this trivia can the public take?
</P>
<P>
   Quite a bit, seems to be ABC's answer. The network sent
``Millionaire'' back into the fray on Sunday night with the host,
Regis Philbin, hard pressed to explain how often and on what nights
the show would be seen. ``I think they're trying to kill me!'' he
fairly screamed. ``I really do.''
</P>
<P>
   No, they're not trying to kill Philbin. But they _ all the
network theys _ stand a good chance of killing their
golden-egg-producing goose. Even the irrepressible Philbin seemed
to be growing a bit bored with his phenomenon. The game is still a
bit goofy. ``For $200, which is a blood type'': FM, AB, DA or ABBA?
</P>
<P>
   But all these hours? All these nights?
</P>
<P>
   The programmers should come to their senses and use restraint.
While they're at it, they should take a good look at Comedy
Central's ``Win Ben Stein's Money,'' currently the most
entertaining (and intellectually challenging) quiz show. Stripped
of its cable-ready sophomoric single-entendres, this game is a
natural for network exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, isn't anybody trying to figure out what the next big
thing will be? Many people, you can be sure. And when the new trend
does emerge, who will ride it for all it's worth? The answer is
Dick Clark. There are no coincidences.

 &HT;    With AOL/Time Warner merger, the rich get richer
 &HT;    By Robert Luke
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ted Turner made out like a bandit Monday with the
announced merger of Time Warner and America Online.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the media mogul was about $3.8 billion richer _ on
paper _ as Time Warner's shares surged to as high as $102 before
finishing at $90, up $25.25, or 39.1 percent, from Friday's closing
price.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, 61, owns about 9 percent of Time Warner's 1.5 billion
shares outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   According to the company's proxy statement for the 1999
shareholders meeting, Turner beneficially owned 112,077,517 shares
of Time Warner stock.
</P>
<P>
   But a more recent accounting by First Call/Thomson Financial
showed he owns 96,780,960 shares directly and 9,400,100 shares
indirectly. The latter includes 770,000 shares owned by his wife,
Jane Fonda, and 5 million shares owned by the Turner Foundation,
which promotes a variety of causes, including population control
and protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Turner gradually has been giving away portions of his Time
Warner stake, now valued at more than $9 billion. Last year, for
example, he gave away 896,260 shares, according to First
Call/Thomson Financial, which gets its data from Securities and
Exchange Commission filings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Atlanta media magnate announced a gift of $1
billion over 10 years to United Nations-related causes. Last
November, he began funding a World Health Organization advertising
campaign urging smokers in developing nations to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Turner has been giving away some of his shares, he
has the ability to acquire more.
</P>
<P>
   That's because he has options entitling him to purchase an
additional 4,175,000 shares at prices ranging from $20.63 to
$103.74 each, according to Paul Elliott of First Call/Thomson
Financial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of the options are in the money _ that is,
they are below the current market price,'' Elliott said. He noted
that, according to Time Warner's 1999 proxy statement, the options
become immediately exercisable on certain change of control
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems this would be one of them,'' Elliott said.

ISRAELI-SYRIAN PEACE TALKS TO RECONVENE ON JAN. 19
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Will be updated.) 
(With MIDEAST-ISRAEL) 
(nk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. _ After eight days of intense but
inconclusive talks, Israeli and Syrian leaders decided to return
home Monday and reconvene in the United States on Jan. 19 for the
second phase of negotiations over a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the United States, which is acting as mediator
in the talks, to bring Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and
Farouk al-Sharaa, the Syrian foreign minister, back to the table so
quickly reflected an upbeat sense that some momentum has built up _
and a fear that a longer recess would allow opponents of a peace
accord in both countries to undermine whatever small progress was
made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that to preserve whatever's happened, they couldn't go
home for long,'' one American official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in Tel
Aviv to oppose the return of the Golan Heights to Syria, the
linchpin of any peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators' return on Jan. 19 will coincide with a visit to
Washington by Yasser Arafat, the leader of the Palestinian
Authority, and it seems likely that he will meet together with
Barak and Clinton. Israel and the Palestinians are moving toward a
September deadline for a final peace treaty of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, did his best
Monday to put a positive spin on what clearly was a frustrating
week as President Clinton came here five times to coax the two
sides along. The major accomplishment of the week was the
acceptance by both sides of an American-drafted ``working paper''
defining the issues that remain to be resolved but laid out no new
proposals for resolving the most difficult issues. American
officials said such proposals would be counterproductive if offered
too early.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin insisted that the diplomatic talk here ``lays the
groundwork to bridge the important gaps that remain.''
</P>
<P>
   The outstanding disputes include the boundaries of a new border
between the two countries _ including access to water in the Sea of
Galilee and other sources _ and the form of a normalized diplomatic
and economic relationship between two countries that have been in a
state of war for half a century.
</P>
<P>
   It was a measure of the slow progress that a committee of
Syrian, Israeli, and American officials created to discuss the
border issues met only once in eight days here, and then only for
an hour and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian officials emerged complaining that the Israelis have been
vague and noncommittal. Israeli negotiators said they had to be
vague because they had not made any progress on the security
questions _ the quid pro quo for the return of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who was dining with and then cajoling Barak and
al-Sharaa here until nearly 1 a.m. Monday, said later in the day:
``We are on a track in which the Israelis, the Syrians, I hope soon
the Lebanese, and already the Palestinians, have committed
themselves to work through these very difficult, longstanding
issues over the course of the next two months _ the longstanding
commitment between the Palestinians and the Israelis to resolve
their business by next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``So this will be a time of great tension,'' he added, ``where
all people will have to search for wisdom and understanding, where
there will be great reluctance to open the closed fist and walk out
into a new era.''
</P>
<P>
   While both sides and a number of Mideast analysts were arguing
whether the week amounted to success, failure or something in
between, the fact is that this round of talks ended just about
where American diplomats predicted it would when they began on Jan.
3.
</P>
<P>
   The first round of talks was chiefly about posturing for
constituencies back in Israel and Syria, where every rumor about
whether Barak and al-Sharaa had shaken hands was treated as
front-page news.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said Monday that they hadn't actually shaken hands, but
they had joked together in the gymnasium of the Clarion Hotel and
conference center here. Observing a Syrian negotiator running on a
treadmill, Barak reportedly told al-Sharaa that, like the talks,
she was ``headed in the right direction but not getting anywhere.''
One of the leaders _ it is not clear who _ then apparently spoke of
how her run was ``the beginning of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear where the next round of negotiations will take
place. It may return here to Shepherdstown, where the negotiators
were locked away at the Clarion for a week. But the town's largest
institution, Shepherd College, will be back in session, and it is
unclear whether the talks can take place without disrupting the
life of the school.
</P>
<P>
   Barak promised during his campaign last year that any peace
treaty with Syria would be put to a national referendum. It is far
too early to tell whether that referendum would pass, because Barak
cannot present to the Israeli public a security agreement _
involving Syrian troop pullbacks and enhanced defense cooperation
from the United States _ before one is negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   But the tens of thousands who demonstrated in Tel Aviv on Monday
against any return of the Golan are evidence of the size of the
political challenge ahead for Barak's government. And it explains
why the pace of the talks here was so slow: The prime minister
could ill afford appearing too eager to give back the land that
Israel has long said is the critical buffer zone for its security.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrians do not have the problems of a referendum, but a
political and economic challenge that is no less daunting. While
Syrian President Hafez Assad sees a chance to regain by negotiation
a territory he cannot hope to regain by force, his government
clearly fears that too much integration with Israel and the West
could undermine his iron control over the country _ and his hopes
that his son will succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   If economics, rather than the passions of a half century of
conflict, controlled the outcome, there is little question a deal
would come together.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's gross domestic product in 1998 amounted to a mere $15
billion. By way of comparison, that is a less than a sixth of the
size of Israel's economy, and Israel has only 6 million people to
Syria's 15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, the value of Syria's economy is about one-25th
of the value of the merger agreement announced Monday between
America Online and Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   All that suggests that Assad, by focusing on power and border
conflicts, has missed out on developing a vibrant economy. That
puts a new pressure on the Syrians: Foreign investors, among them
Americans, Europeans and perhaps Israelis, will only come to Syria
after a cold peace, at least, is in place.

`NYPD BLUE': STILL-STRONG AS IT BEGINS NEW SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lh) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's quite a sight. Detective Andy Sipowicz _ alcoholic, racist,
explosively temperamental and perpetually gruff _ making meat loaf
and mashed potatoes for his little boy, explaining over dinner that
his job is about helping people, accepting a kiss from his son that
almost takes his breath away with unexpressed emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``NYPD Blue'' begins its new season Tuesday night on ABC. And
that scene with Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) is proof enough that the
six-and-a-half-year-old series is still solid, still intelligent
and still undeniably worth watching, even for those who find more
typical police shows a waste of time. And that it deserves to keep
its time slot (Tuesday nights at 10), which the network almost gave
away to a new romantic drama series, ``Once and Again.'' It was
only after Steven Bochco, co-creator of ``NYPD Blue,'' spoke up,
publicly accusing ABC of disloyalty, that the rescheduling plans
were shelved.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness, because it would be a shame for loyal fans to
wander away now. The character development of Sipowicz, whose
ex-wife was shot to death last season, may be the most dramatic
change in store. But it's only one of the show's current assets.
</P>
<P>
   Sipowicz's very young new partner, Sorenson (Rick Schroder, who
surprised everyone with his on-screen power when he joined the cast
last season after the departure of Jimmy Smits), would seem to have
a romance in his future. Tuesday night's season premiere ends with
a steamy love scene between Sorenson and a fellow officer, Mary
Franco (Sherri Rappaport). In the tradition of this series, which
has always been known for testing the boundaries of network
censorship, it involves partial nudity.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkendall (Andrea Thompson) has a private-life subplot going
on, too, but the strength of ``NYPD Blue'' is the balance between
its soap opera appeal and its aggressively gritty portrayal of
police work. Tuesday night's episode involves two officers who
report finding a beating victim and acknowledge that they slapped
him around a little, too. (``We gave him a minor tuneup.'') The
question becomes whether the policemen themselves administered the
entire beating and fabricated the rest of the story. ``I did what
was appropriate,'' one of the two says. ``These are our streets.''
</P>
<P>
   In next week's episode Kirkendall and Russell (Kim Delaney)
investigate the death of a baby found in a dumpster. The suspects
include a transsexual prostitute, who had promised to watch the

   &UR; AOL-TIME WARNER MERGER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times plans three pages of stories, photos and
graphics on the merger of AOL and Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-TIME-WARNER (New York) _ Ledeall: America Online, the
company that made the Internet accessible to the general public,
has agreed to buy the largest traditional media company, Time
Warner, for $165 billion in what would be the biggest merger in
history and the best evidence yet that the new media and the mass
media may finally be converging. By Saul Hansell.
</P>
<P>
   With graphics and photos, NYT17, 18 and 19 from the press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-TIME-STRATEGY (Undated) _ Looking at the strategy behind
marrying a traditional media conglomerate with an online service
provider: The America Online-Time Warner merger represents the
triumph of the Internet as the irresistible force in business, not
just a fleeting enthusiasm on Wall Street and the obsession of the
nation's technology elite. The top executives of the two companies
presented the deal as a ``merger of equals'' on Monday. But it is
the shareholders of America Online Inc., that will own 55 percent
of the combined enterprise, though Time Warner will account for 80
percent of the revenues. Even the surviving stock symbol will be
AOL. By Steve Lohr.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-TIME-NEXT (Undated) _ What media-Internet deals may come in
the wake of the AOL Time Warner deal: The announcement Monday of
the combination between America Online and Time Warner creates a
company without peer in the media and entertainment industry, a
colossus that will force competitors from Disney to AT&AMP;T to
Microsoft to reconsider their strategies as the Internet and
traditional media converge. The deal leaves Disney, Fox, and the
remaining giants of old media with a stark choice. They can try to
carve a future alone on the Internet, a place that has so far been
inhospitable to old media companies. Or they can merge with new
media companies like Yahoo, putting their future in the hands of
businesses that hardly existed five years ago. By Alex Berenson.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-TIME-IMPACT (Undated) _ A look at how the deal affects Time
Warner's television, magazine, movie and music businesses. By Bill
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-TIME-DEAL (Undated) _ How the deal came to be. By Laura
Holson and Alex Kuczynski.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-TIME-CULTURE (Undated) _ Looking at the two corporate
cultures. And what happens to journalism? By Felicity Barringer.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-TIME-CASE (Undated) _ A profile of Steve Case of AOL:
Perhaps the only thing stranger than Steve Case, the chairman of an
Internet company perpetually thought to be doomed, assuming the
helm of the world's largest media conglomerate was that he wore a
suit to the press conference on Monday where he announced the
audacious merger plan. Case, 37, is known for clinging to his
casual costume of denim shirts and khakis even on the most formal
occasions, but if that changes when the merger of America Online
and Time Warner is completed, it may come as no surprise. Since
before the World Wide Web was invented, Case has survived the
quicksand of the Internet industry with a series of chameleon like
changes of which his deal with Time Warner is only the most recent.

<P>
   AOL-TIME-LEVIN (Undated) _ A profile of Gerald Levin of Time
Warner: In the pantheon of prominent media executives, Gerald M.
Levin has long had a reputation as a shrewd gambler with a
scholarly mien: bookish, cerebral, self-effacing and yet tough.
True to form, on Monday the new chief executive of the hybrid of
Time Warner and America Online showed up without a tie for a New
York news conference to announce the planned merger, issuing a
formal greeting to what he called ``the suits from Virginia'' _ the
more formally-dressed executives from America Online's headquarters
in Dulles, Va. By Doreen Carvajal.

<P>
   AOL-TIME-AD-COLUMN (Undated) _ The view of the deal from Madison
Avenue: The $165 billion acquisition of Time Warner by America
Online could well be a transformative transaction, say senior
managers at leading agencies, remaking the advertising, marketing
and media landscapes as few deals have done. By Stuart Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-TIME-EUROPE (Frankfurt, Germany) _ Looking at how the deal
affects AOL's ambitions in Europe: The Internet may well be
borderless, but it remains remarkably American. Here in Europe,
America Online Inc.'s prospective merger with Time Warner Inc. is
likely to accentuate that phenomenon and to increase the pressure
among rivals for new alliances and mergers. America Online and
Bertelsmann AG of Germany are equal partners in AOL Europe, which
operates local-language networks across the continent. But the most
striking feature about the Internet in Europe is its fragmentation
along national boundaries. Traditional telephone companies are
often the biggest Internet providers in each individual country,
but few have extended their reach across Europe. By Edmund L.
Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-TIME-WINNERS (Undated) _ Ted Turner is knocking on the door
of the $10 billion club. Turner, the cable-TV pioneer who is vice
chairman of Time Warner, has more to gain than anybody from a sale
of the company to America Online. He is the biggest individual
shareholder of Time Warner, owning about 97 million shares, or
about 6.5 percent of the company. While the long-term effect of the
deal on AOL shareholders is uncertain so far, it will be a sure
winner for Time Warner investors, many of whom are employees of the
company's magazines and cable channels. By Patrick McGeehan.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ When Time Inc. acquired Warner
Communications 10 years ago, it took 7 years for shareholders in
the combined company to see any meaningful gains in their stock.
Will shareholders in AOL Time Warner, who choose to hold onto their
shares in this latest combination, show better returns than that?
This being the Internet age, most analysts believe that not only
will the benefits to shareholders in the combined company be
immediate, the deal will also justify higher valuations in the
already manic Internet arena. By Gretchen Morgenson.

 &HT;    Hawks president blasts team for disappointing playBy Jeffrey
Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Hawks president Stan Kasten said Monday he
will not continue to tolerate the team's disappointing performance.
Kasten promised unspecified changes if things are not turned around
by the all-star break.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has lost five in a row and 13 of its last 15 games. At
12-21, the Hawks are ahead of only Washington (11-23) and Chicago
(5-26) in the 15-team Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks sometimes are ``the most underachieving team in the
league,'' Kasten said. ``We aren't winning. We want it turned
around.''
</P>
<P>
   After losing in the second round of the playoffs last season,
the Hawks spent most of the off-season revamping their roster,
acquiring Isaiah Rider, Jim Jackson and Bimbo Coles in trades,
drafting Jason Terry, Cal Bowdler and Dion Glover and signing
free-agent Lorenzen Wright. Despite the moves, the Hawks, who are
off until Friday's game at Chicago, have the 22nd-best record in
the 29-team league.
</P>
<P>
   Kasten said the organization is ``undertaking a lot of internal
things to fix (the problems),'' although he did not elaborate on
the specific actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how disappointed we all are in the way this
team has played,'' he said. ``That goes for me, for (general
manager Pete Babcock) and for (coach Lenny Wilkens). I believe it
goes for the players, too. And I can say this: If there are any
people on this list who are not bothered by it, we'll find out
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not only the team's record that's frustrating for Kasten;
the team's performance in those games is also coming under
scrutiny. The Hawks have blown second-half leads of seven, 10 and
eight points in the latter stages of their three most recent
defeats.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks also have only two wins in 16 road games this season,
something that Kasten describes as ``unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, we're used to getting the very most out of our
players and in being an outstanding defensive team,'' he said.
``This year, we've shown flashes of being a pretty good team, but
most nights that's not the case. In fact, there are nights when we
are the most underachieving team in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Management is not bailing out on the season, Kasten said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the season began (Monday), we still would have time,'' he
said. ``Pete and I sat down before the season started and said, if
we could win 25-to-30 games in the second half of the year, that
would be good. We knew we wouldn't get off to a flying start early,
that there would be a period of adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``But while the time is there, it needs to start turning around
now,'' he added. ``If it doesn't happen by the all-star break, we
will think about doing anything we think we can to turn it
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had specific roster or staff changes in mind, Kasten
refused to tip his hand. ``We're all guilty, from me on down, and,
no, I can't share the remedies. It's not a one remedy thing or an
easy thing. Let's leave it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks will find out quickly if their changes are successful.
Beginning with the Chicago game, the Hawks will play six games in
nine days, four of those games against teams with better records.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think by Friday when we come out of this break we will be
ready to start winning again,'' said Kasten. ``We can do it. We
looked as good as any team for a while and for some reason we
stepped back. It's a good roster, not perfect, but I like veterans,
the youth and athleticism and our depth. But the results aren't
there. It's troubling to me.''

 FORMER STATE PARTY CHIEF LIKES BRADLEY'S
CHANCES AGAINST BUSH (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) By
JAY ROOT c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ |The former executive director of the Texas Democratic
Party, writing in a confidential memo, suggests that Vice President
Al Gore would lose in a presidential race with Gov. George W. Bush
and could drag down state Democrats with him.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Cook wrote in a Jan. 7 memo to fellow Democratic leaders
that nominating former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley as the party's
presidential candidate is in ``the best interest'' of Texas
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the memo was obtained by the Star-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, now a private consultant and an unpaid Bradley volunteer,
warned that Gore has been so tainted by his association with
President Clinton that he ``probably cannot defeat Bush
nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   That could spell trouble for local Democrats because the Bush
campaign, assuming the governor wins the GOP nomination, ``will
attempt to smear the president all over (Gore), and in Texas those
efforts will be highly effective,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the worst case scenario (Gore's) candidacy could be
extremely harmful to down-ballot Democrats, perhaps even resulting
in a Republican majority in the state House, preventing a return to
a Democratic majority in the Senate and potential losses among
Congressional incumbents,'' Cook wrote.
</P>
<P>
   For Texas Democrats, he said Bradley would be a better nominee
because voters _ even those who like Bush _ ``would not carry with
them the depth of angry energy against the top Democrat on the
ballot as they would with Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokeswoman Kathleen Begala dismissed Cook's memo, noting
that he no longer works for the party. She also said Gore has
garnered the endorsement of Lady Bird Johnson and all but two of
the 17 Democratic members of the Texas congressional delegation,
among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has strong support in the state of Texas, I would say
strong support with elected officials and former elected officials,
because he's right on the issues'' Begala said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the state party, meanwhile, said either Gore or
Bradley could beat Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job at the party is to make sure Democrats get to know
both candidates. We don't get involved with Democratic primary
races, but we will support the nominee,'' said state party
spokesman Mike Hailey. ``We believe that both Democratic candidates
can beat Bush in the general election because they are the two best
candidates in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   While no Republican is expected to give Bush any trouble in the
Texas GOP presidential primary, the March 14 Democratic primary
could become a key battleground between Gore and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the hot races are expected to center on legislative
contests. Control of the House and Senate will be key in 2001, when
lawmakers are supposed to redraw the district boundary lines of
state and federal lawmakers based on the new Census.

REDESIGNED LINCOLN ENTERS MILLENNIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
PHOENIX - Lincoln has perhaps
<TEXT>
<P>
   the most stodgy image in the auto industry, more so than
Cadillac, with a reputation for building oversize land yachts for
retirees. That, and creating the raw material for stretch
limousines.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the 2000 Lincoln LS, which is nothing less than a
major attempt by Ford's luxury division to reinvent itself. This is
the car that would carry Lincoln into the future, and maybe around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The hefty Navigator sport-utility vehicle is credited with
pulling Lincoln out of the hole, but the midsize LS is designed to
attract the 35-55 postwar generation away from imports.
</P>
<P>
   The LS is ``Motor Trend's`` Car of the Year for 2000, a major
coup against stiff competition, and the first time in two decades
that domestics and imports have been combined to vie for the prize.
</P>
<P>
   I drove the most unusual version of the LS, V-6 powered with a
five-speed stick shift. That's right, this Lincoln comes with stick
shift, although only with the six-cylinder engine. It's the first
stick-shift Lincoln since 1951, back before Ford Motor Co. had
developed a decent automatic.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad the automaker opted to skip the V-8 for stick, which
certainly would enhance the performance aura of the new sedan.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, I found the LS to be a sporting car with good balance
and road manners, and a unique character. I couldn't put the
rear-wheel-drive LS in a box with anything else I've driven. That
includes the Jaguar S-type, which shares its chassis with the LS _
the most tangible benefit gained by Ford since it bought Jaguar a
few years back.
</P>
<P>
   The test car was outfitted with stiffer suspension and 17-inch
aluminum wheels. Still, it had a smooth and comfortable ride, not
as soft as Lexus ES300 nor as edgy as BMW 528i. When called upon,
the LS is quick and responsive, with nicely balanced handling and
responsive steering. Freeway cruising is relaxed and seamless, and
control and stability are first-rate.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the handling equation is a 50-50 weight balance, front
to rear. Also, much of the body is weight-reducing aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   The V-6 provides plenty of power, especially coupled with the
quick, precise manual transmission, but I would like to sample the
torquey V-8, which puts out 252 horsepower over the six's 210. The
automatic transmission is also a five-speed, and 95 percent of all
the LS cars are expected to be automatic.
</P>
<P>
   One thing I didn't like about the stick shift was the position
of reverse: hard to the left and forward. It's too close to first
gear, and a couple of times, I slipped it into reverse instead of
first. I caught the mistake before I plowed into the car behind.
</P>
<P>
   The leather-lined interior is spacious and really quite nice,
understated for a Lincoln, looking more like something from Lexus
or Infiniti.
</P>
<P>
   The leather seats are firm and supportive, and the cabin has
plenty of leg, head and hip room, front and rear. But there is
scant stowage anywhere in the interior, aside from some minuscule
door pockets and a small compartment under the center armrest.
</P>
<P>
   My only major complaint with the LS is the exterior styling,
which is pleasant enough but highly derivative of Acura, Lexus,
what have you. Why come out with an all-new car, one that carves
out a new niche for Lincoln, and have it look pretty much like
everything else?
</P>
<P>
   Fit and finish on the test car was excellent throughout.
</P>
<P>
   There were just a few options added to the well-equipped base
V-6 model, including $365 for a special paint job, $995 for a power
moonroof, $595 for a six-disc CD changer and $850 for a convenience
package that included mist-sensing wipers, driver's seat memory and
glare-sensing rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   The V-8 model starts at about $3,500 more than the V-6 version.
Still, the pricing is moderate for this level of refinement and
compares well with the competition. Part of that competition is the
Cadillac Catera, a midsize car with a similar mission to that of
the LS, though not as successfully accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   The Lincoln LS is a car that's easy to like on several levels,
with enough luxury for traditional Lincoln buyers and enough sport
for the new generation. Other than the generic styling, the LS is a
winner that takes its place among the best sedans. &QL;

 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the pantheon of prominent media executives, Gerald
M. Levin has long had a reputation as a shrewd gambler with a
scholarly mien: bookish, cerebral, self-effacing and yet tough.
</P>
<P>
   True to form, on Monday the new chief executive of the hybrid of
Time Warner and America Online showed up without a tie for a New
York news conference to announce the planned merger, issuing a
formal greeting to what he called ``the suits from Virginia'' _ the
more formally-dressed executives from America Online's headquarters
in Dulles, Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that this week also marked the 10-year-anniversary of the
formation of Time Warner, Levin cast himself in this union of old
and new media in rather simple terms, clearly intending to ensure
that he is not portrayed as a symbol of the old, dinosaur media.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those of you who know me well, I am a broadband person,''
he said. ``I'm an interactive guy. I have been building networks
all my life, and this really provides an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, 60, has reached this point of chief interactive executive
by a rather circuitous route. At various points in his career,
``embattled'' has been a diplomatic term for his corporate ups and
downs as chief executive at Time Warner that have irritated and
dazzled Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   It was Levin who engineered the 1989 merger of Time Inc. and
Warner Communications, elbowing out competitors and maintaining
power despite criticism of his leadership style.
</P>
<P>
   A steadfast believer in cable, he invested millions of dollars
to upgrade Time Warner's cable system and presided over a plan to
build the world's first fully interactive cable system in Orlando,
Florida. But Time Warner abandoned the experiment, called the Full
Service Network, in 1994 because of uncertain demand for the
system. His upgrading strategy appears more prescient.
</P>
<P>
   Levin grew close to Steve Case, chairman and chief executive of
America Online, while they headed a global business network
together and traveled in China, Case said at a news conference
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hard work of managing this diverse company will be
shouldered by Gerry Levin,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From his early roots in Philadelphia, Levin might have seemed an
improbable pick for uber media executive. The grandson of Jews who
left Eastern Europe to escape persecution, Levin has been described
as a quiet child who grew up to major in biblical studies at
Haverford College in Haverford, Pa, composing a thesis about the
continuity between Old and New Testaments.
</P>
<P>
   After earning a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania,
Levin worked for a New York law firm and briefly in Tehran, Iran.
He joined Time Inc. in 1972, rising on the success of his advice to
the company to beam its new cable channel, Home Box Office, across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   He continued to be an important strategist for Time through the
1980s, advising the company to merge with Warner Communications in
1989. When Paramount tried to quash the deal, Levin and other
executives were forced to transform the merger into a $14 billion
acquisition of Warner.
</P>
<P>
   After Warner's charismatic chairman, Steven J. Ross, became ill
with cancer, Levin helped engineer the ouster of his competitor at
Time Inc., Nicholas J. Nicholas and then ultimately became the
chief executive of Time Warner in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   It was during an uncommon period of tranquility in Levin's
career in 1997 that his schoolteacher son, Jonathan M. Levin, was
murdered in his apartment by a former student who was later
convicted of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Levin insisted that the merger amounted to nothing less
than a ``digital transformation at Time Warner. For those of you
who know me well or have read things I've distributed within the
company, that's been my conviction and with this transaction that
dream is realized.''

`NYPD BLUE' RETURNS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Tonight is Tuesday. Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's certainly been an eventful season for ``NYPD Blue''
already, and the show doesn't even return until this evening. Any
chance to capitalize on the momentum of last season's emotional
melodrama _ which was more or less bookended by the deaths of Bobby
Simone (Jimmy Smits) and Sylvia Costas (Sharon Lawrence), detective
Sipowicz's partner and wife, respectively _ was torpedoed when ABC
elected to extend the run of critical darling ``Once and Again'' in
the stalwart cop show's time slot.
</P>
<P>
   Series creator Steven Bochco, never shy about speaking his mind,
immediately cried foul _ demanding an outright cancellation so he
could shop the series to another network. Even multiple Emmy winner
Dennis Franz, who has essayed one of TV history's most indelible
characters in Sipowicz, admitted hurt at the perceived lack of
respect. Viewers, for their part, were given plenty of time to find
a new show to watch _ specifically, the kinder, gentler ``Judging
Amy,'' which stars former ``Blue'' actress Amy Brenneman and reigns
as the season's breakout hit; it's ``NYPD Blue's'' competition.
</P>
<P>
   After the war of words comes tonight's chance for ``NYPD Blue''
to step up to the plate and belt one out of the park, thereby
simultaneously shaming ABC and silencing critics who charge the
series has lost some of its urgency. Instead, it hits a clean
double off the wall, a solid show, yet short of the series'
incendiary best. Worse, next week's episode is, to pursue our
baseball metaphor, merely a single through the hole. ABC clearly
has done the series a disservice by delaying its return to the
schedule _ it has put a magnifying glass to the mere competence of
the new episodes, rather than the expected brilliance of the past.
And maybe the show's writers have put themselves in something of a
hole: In writing out characters with such dramatic flair, they've
hamstrung themselves this season. If poor Sipowicz gets dumped on
any more, the show will veer dangerously toward soap opera. But
that also means Franz won't get to do what he does so exquisitely,
which is suffer stoically.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to tonight's episode, in which Sylvia's death
must be old news, because there's little acknowledgment of it;
detective Diane Russell (Kim Delaney) seems to be well over the
death of her husband Bobby, as well. Sipowicz and his latest
partner, Bobby Sorenson (Rick Schroder) investigate a beating death
that two cops swear they did not commit; they're lying of course,
and Sipowicz grouses that he has to mop up their ``bag of crap.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Sipowicz also complains about catching ``a bag of
crap.'' Careful _ that cold end up being the motto of this, the
series' seventh season. He and Sorenson deal with a parolee who's
apparently not succeeding in his efforts to stay on the straight
and narrow, while Russell and detective Jill Kirkendall suffer
professional friction from their personal lives while investigating
a crack prostitute's dead baby found in a dumpster. This plays as
tiredly manipulative, even without the seemingly requisite,
flamboyant transvestite hooker. Thompson still seems waiting for
the writers to give her something to do; Kirkendall's troubled-ex
story line is boring.
</P>
<P>
   These episodes introduce Sorenson's next squeeze, Mary Franco
(Sheeri Rappaport), who apparently will bring new levels of
emotional angst to the squad room. It will take more than that,
however, for the series to reclaim the intensity and veneration
that has made it compelling in the past. &QL;

AGAINST CIVILIZATION: EXECUTING CHILD OFFENDERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Our nation begins the new millennium by being the only country
in the Americas, Europe and most of the world to execute convicts
who were minors when they committed their murderous crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Only six nations are known to have put juvenile offenders to
death in the past decade: Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia,
Yemen and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Our country is the only one that has not signed the United
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child because it wants to
remain free to execute juvenile offenders. Article 37 (a) of the
U.N. Convention states: ``Neither capital punishment nor life
imprisonment without the possibility of release shall be imposed
for offenses committed by persons below eighteen years of age.''
</P>
<P>
   That position is apparently too civilized for us. Even China,
which has shown an intolerable lack of respect for human rights,
prohibits the death penalty for those under 18 years of age.
</P>
<P>
   The current U.S. Supreme Court, not known for its compassion,
doesn't find it ``cruel or unusual punishment'' to execute those
who were 16 years old when they committed a capital crime. This
same high court, however, recognizes that minors do not have the
maturity or judgment to sign contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The rights of minors are generally not equal to those of adults
_ but, according to the high court, their right to be executed IS
equal to that of adults.
</P>
<P>
   A minor's diminished capacity for sound judgment does not bother
the high court at all. In fact, this court has found it
constitutional to execute the mentally retarded and the mentally
ill if they were involved in a capital crime. Again, we are one of
the few nations to allow such execution.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the total number of death row inmates in the United
States tops 3,600. Seventy of those death row inmates are juvenile
offenders. Since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death
penalty in 1976, 600 men and women have been executed in state
penitentiaries _ approximately 2 percent of those executed were
juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Oklahoma executed Sean Sellers, a young man who was
16 years old at the time of the murders he was found guilty of
committing.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers had been diagnosed with multiple personality disorder,
but that fact was not revealed to the jury at his trial. According
to the Daily Oklahoman, a federal appeals court held that Sellers
may have been ``factually innocent'' of the murders because of his
mental illness, but that innocence alone is not sufficient to grant
federal relief. Sellers was executed on Feb. 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, 18 states allow juvenile offenders as young as 16
to be executed, including Alabama, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Virginia and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Five states allow the execution of those who were 17 or older
when they committed their crimes: Florida, Georgia, New Hampshire,
North Carolina and Texas. And 15 state legislatures have passed
statutes that set the age of 18 as the minimum for eligibility for
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In the next two months, the two states that have executed more
inmates than any other states _ Texas and Virginia _ have scheduled
the execution of five juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Christopher Thomas, 26, who was convicted of murdering
his girlfriend's mother and father at her request when he was 17
years old, died by lethal injection on Jan. 10, in a Virginia
prison. There is doubt about Thomas' guilt. Witnesses have come
forward stating that Thomas' girlfriend, Jessica Wiseman, admitted
to them that she had killed her mother, not Thomas. The murder of
Wiseman's mother was the crime for which Thomas was sentenced to
death.
</P>
<P>
   Steve E. Roach, who robbed and murdered a 70-year-old woman in
Stanardsville, Va., when he was 17, will be executed by lethal
injection on Jan. 13. Roach is only 23 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia has two other child offenders on death row _ both were
16 years old when they committed murder.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has three juvenile offenders and one mentally ill inmate
scheduled for execution in January and February.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Robison is scheduled to die by lethal injection on Jan.
21. He has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic, but was never
given adequate treatment by the state of Texas. He was discharged
by Veteran's Hospital in Waco and his parents were told he ``wasn't
violent'' and the hospital ``needed the bed.'' Weeks later, a
violent episode brought on by his mental illness left five dead.
</P>
<P>
   Glen McGinnis was 17 years old when he murdered a woman during a
robbery. He will be 26 when he is scheduled to be executed on Jan.
25.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, Texas is scheduled to execute Anzel Jones for
the murders he committed when he was 17. He won't reach his 22nd
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 24, Texas would have completed a ``hat trick,'' with its
third execution of a juvenile offender _ except that Toronto
Patterson, who committed multiple murders when he was 17, was
granted a temporary stay of execution. He is only 21 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The parade of executions continues. Last year, 98 death row
inmates were executed _ the highest number of executions since
1976. This year promises to exceed that grisly figure.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, which finally did away with the electric chair in favor
of lethal injection, wants to grease the wheels for its death
penalty _ fewer appeals and less time to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   When will our nation learn you cannot teach the sanctity of life
by sanctioning a state's right to kill?

NBC WANTS MORE VIEWERS _ AND MORE MINORITY WRITERS, ACTORS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ NBC executives discussed their latest efforts to
expand viewer numbers on Sunday, and elaborated on the network's
conciliatory efforts to hire and cast more minorities on TV
productions in the wake of a fall season of virtually all-white
programming. But they also took some time out to chide competitor
ABC for mortgaging that network's future on game shows, while
acknowledging that they're banking on one themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Among NBC's plans for addressing the lack of minority faces on
television is a pledge to hire an extra (minority) writer for every
show that enters its second season, as well as holding a seminar
for all providers of programming to the network ``co-managed by the
NAACP.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to fund, with no burden to the production
company, a position for years two, three and four (of a series's
run). It makes good business sense, and it's the right thing to
do,'' declared Scott Sassa, president of NBC's West Coast division.
``This is not something that we simply came up with as a compromise
to get these people away from us. We really believe in what we're
doing with the seminars and the writers and everything.''
Second-season series were picked in part due to the high percentage
of new shows that get canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Among current programming, struggling critics' favorite ``Freaks
and Geeks'' and the prestige hit ``The West Wing'' garnered the
most discussion. Sassa called ``Freaks and Geeks,'' a comedy with
dark overtones about kids at a Midwestern high school seeking
acceptance _ or at least not too much rejection _ ``one of my
favorite shows.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news for ``Freaks'' is that NBC moved it from its
Saturday night slot to see if it could win new viewers _ it began
its tenure on Mondays last night. The bad news is it opened
opposite ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We really thought that we would get at least a pretty fair
shot on Monday, (but) with `Millionaire' in there, it's going to be
virtually impossible for us to make a judgment based upon what most
likely would be a (high rating) against it,'' Ancier said. He added
that it was still ``rather likely'' that NBC would order more
episodes of the series.
</P>
<P>
   But Sassa warned that quality isn't necessarily a gauge for a
show's survival. ``Who would have known at the beginning of the
season what `Millionaire' would do?'' Sassa said. ``A lot of times,
the issues surrounding whether you keep a show on has little to do
with the show and a lot to do with the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ancier said ABC's wallpapering ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
all over its November sweeps schedule may have claimed a ratings
victory, but at the expense of the series the network pre-empted,
none of which were available for sampling during a key period of
heightened viewing. ``They took off every new comedy,'' Ancier
said. All _ ``Odd Man Out,'' ``Oh, Grow Up'' and ``It's Like, You
Know ...'' _ were eventually canceled. Game shows, expected to have
a limited shelf life, have inspired ABC to halt development on some
sitcoms. ``You're giving up precious time periods (in which you
could] start new shows up),'' Ancier added.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that didn't stop NBC from developing its own game show, a
retooling of the '50s hit ``Twenty-One,'' which debuted Sunday
night an hour before ``Millionaire'' returned to ABC. Ancier also
lauded ``Millionaire.'' ``If you're a programmer, you now have a
show that you can put on seven days a week, every single night in
any time period you want, and it gets not quite `ER' numbers, but
close. There's nothing like that in the modern history of
television, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Ancier also speculated that NBC, which airs Aaron Sorkin's
``West Wing,'' may be interested in picking up his struggling
series ``Sports Night'' were ABC to cancel it. ``NBC has a more
upscale audience than ABC in general, and the show would work
better on NBC, but the other school of thought is, `Do we really
want to pick up a show that's just barely surviving?' There are
certain places on our schedule where it'd be a nice fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sassa added that ``West Wing'' draws the audience with the
highest average income in television.
</P>
<P>
   During its portion of the semi-annual TV press tour in Pasadena,
NBC introduced its previously announced new series _ the sitcoms
``M.Y.O.B.'' and ``Battery Park,'' the animated series ``God, the
Devil and Bob'' and ``Sammy,'' and the supernatural drama ``The
Others'' _ Ancier also introduced other programs in development.
Among these: ``Daddio,'' a family comedy starring Michael Chiklis
as a stay-at-home father; a sitcom starring Tony winner Kristin
Chenoweth, produced by ``Cosby Show'' producer John Markus; and a
drama produced by ``Law &AMP; Order's'' Dick Wolf starring Oliver Platt
(``Bulworth'') as an investigative journalist. &QL;

PUTIN SHUFFLES TOP OFFICIALS IN RUSSIAN CABINET 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's Acting President Vladimir Putin on Monday
promoted his finance minister to serve as his top deputy prime
minister, and shunted aside two high-ranking government officials
closely linked with former President Boris Yeltsin's inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   With his Cabinet shuffle on Monday, Putin continued to strike a
note of independence from the Yeltsin team _ widely known as the
``Family'' _ which has been tainted with charges of corruption and
unsavory business dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, within days of Yeltsin's surprise Dec. 31
resignation, Putin removed Tatyana Dyachenko, Yeltsin's daughter,
from her Kremlin job as the president's ``imagemaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Now other members of that circle have been cast aside by the
47-year-old former KGB officer, as he puts together a team to carry
him through the presidential elections scheduled for March 26.
Until then, Putin, named by Yeltsin as his heir apparent, will stay
on as Russia's prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   By moving the finance minister, Mikhail Kasyanov, 42, into the
government's second-highest-ranking position, Putin signaled the
importance of Russia's relations with its Western creditors, and
also dropped a hint about his possible successor as prime minister,
if he wins the March 26 elections. Kasyanov has been the
government's lead debt negotiator with banks and foreign
governments.
</P>
<P>
   In ousting Pavel Borodin, one of Yeltsin's closest and
longest-surviving aides, from his job as chief of the Kremlin's
powerful property-management office, Putin showed that old
loyalties will not count for much in the run up to the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Borodin came under fire when Swiss investigators said
they were looking into the possibility that he had accepted
payments from a Swiss construction company in connection with its
extensive work in the Kremlin. Borodin denied the accusations and
has not been charged by the Swiss.
</P>
<P>
   Putin on Monday also demoted Nikolai Aksyonenko, a former first
deputy prime minister closely tied to financier Boris Berezovsky,
another Kremlin insider and master intriguer. Aksyonenko, who five
months ago was boasting that he had control over Russian economic
policy, was bounced back down to being a railways minister.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with top members of his Cabinet on Monday, Putin said
that the changes were purely ``technical.'' His press spokesman,
Mikhail Kozhukov, said Monday that it was premature to talk about
Kasyanov's chances of becoming prime minister if Putin is elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   But with most of his time now spent in the Kremlin, carrying out
presidential duties, Putin needs a loyal top deputy to head the
Cabinet in his absence, ``someone whom he fully trusts and whose
effectiveness he can be 100 percent sure of,'' Kozhukov said.
</P>
<P>
   Kasyanov, a former employee of the old Soviet central planning
committee who became finance minister last May, has earned a
reputation as a tough negotiator during talks with Russia's private
and government creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, which inherited the Soviet Union's old debts, has been
able to renegotiate the payment schedule for bills owed to foreign
governments in the so-called Paris Club, while talks with the
so-called London Club, made up of private investors, are still
continuing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kasyanov is not a genius, but he has shown himself to be
competent within the framework of the Finance Ministry's mandate,
which is budget preparation, and debt restructuring,'' said Margot
Jacobs, who is a financial analyst at United Financial Group, a
Moscow investment firm. ``It is important for Western investors to
have somebody with a familiar face.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important news is about Aksyonenko,'' said Eric
Kraus, head of strategy for Nikoil, a Russian brokerage house. ``He
is Berezovsky's creature, and so this is a substantial blow to the
Berezovsky bloc. The move indicates that after the elections, some
oligarchs are going to have their wings clipped. They won't be
expropriated, but they will be less influential.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But like Yeltsin before him, Putin seems determined not to
alienate even those whom he fires. No sooner was Borodin ousted
from his Kremlin job than Putin announced that he has already found
a spot for him as secretary to the newly forged union between
Russia and Belarus. Aksyonenko will also stay on as a member of the
Putin Cabinet, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Aksyonenko played a central role in the brusque management
takeover last September of Transneft, Russia's oil-pipeline
monopoly, which took place when Putin was out of Moscow. The
changeover in directors subsequently has been declared illegal by a
Moscow court.
</P>
<P>
   But even as he maneuvers to put distance between himself and the
politically unpopular Yeltsin team, it is still not clear if Putin
is simply positioning himself for the coming elections, balancing
off Moscow's various warring clans against one another or really
cutting loose from his old political mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's first appointment as acting president was to rename
Alexander Voloshin, an influential aide to Yeltsin, as his own
Kremlin chief of staff. According to some observers, Voloshin, who
advised Yeltsin on his resignation strategy, is expected to play a
central role in Putin's presidential campaign.

DAVID E. KELLEY RIDES WAVE OF HITS AND MISSES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Note italics in final graf) 
 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few people have enjoyed a year as exhilarating as David E.
Kelley's past 12 months. On the other hand, few have endured one as
frustrating. Five months ago, he was crowned the King of TV,
pulling off the unprecedented feat of winning both best drama and
best comedy series Emmys; he had his imprimatur on no fewer than
five TV series on the fall schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the fall _ literally, on the calendar, not to mention
metaphorically. ``Snoops,'' his series about sexy private
investigators, debuted to critical snipes and audience
indifference. ``Ally,'' a dietary portion of ``Ally McBeal''
episodes, never struck anyone as anything more than reruns with
attitude; both were canceled in the past month. To make matters
more vexing, he was flopping in two different media: His film,
``Mystery, Alaska,'' tanked, following the cue of his earlier
cinematic effort, ``Lake Placid.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, how many people even have two shows on the
air to get canceled in the first place? And he still has three
more: ``Ally McBeal''; the Emmy-winning legal series ``The
Practice''; and the medical drama ``Chicago Hope,'' with which he
has minimal involvement and which, after six years, is quite likely
in its final season, a fact Kelley seems to regard with equanimity.
</P>
<P>
   There was a curiously conciliatory tone in Kelley's voice as he
spoke in a press conference and a follow-up private interview on
Thursday, as the winter leg of the TV press tour opened with a
visit to Kelley's production offices in Manhattan Beach. What was
originally supposed to be an opportunity to promote ``Snoops''
instead became an occasion to apologize for the series.
</P>
<P>
   A guy who had a lot to gloat about _ including the fact that
``The Practice'' won the prime post-Super Bowl spot this year,
where it will begin a two-part whodunit episode bringing the
characters to Los Angeles _ rarely did. He instead offered up
measured and thoughtful analyses for his recent failures and
defended his successes against sundry charges and complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some perspective (here),'' Kelley said. ``We won two
Emmys one night and the next week `Snoops' debuted. ``You hope the
wins outnumber the losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed that we never got it to be a good show,''
Kelley admitted about ``Snoops.'' ``The writing was on the wall
from the network that it really wasn't in their future. The one
promise I made to myself at the beginning of the year was that I
wasn't going to let it cut into `Ally' or `The Practice,' and it
was at the point where there was a potential for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't look the people at ABC in the eye and say, `Hey,
this is a great show you've got here, don't squander it,''' he
continued, adding that there are worse things than to have the
ratings phenomenon ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' as ``The
Practice's'' lead-in. ``As disappointed as I was on `Snoops''
behalf,'' he said, ``it was juxtaposed with an odd sort of
enthusiasm on behalf of `The Practice.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Snoops'' taught Kelley that even if one is an artist, selling
out has its consequences. ``It's a mistake to create a show to try
to accommodate somebody else's vision or needs,'' he explained.
``The creation of `Snoops' came because I contractually owed
another series to ABC, and they wanted it sooner rather than later.
It was in my interest to give it to them sooner rather than later
because I was nearing a new exclusive deal with Fox.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Kelley admitted that he was perhaps a bit too
optimistic regarding an audience's appetite for the half-hour
``Ally.'' ``Fox maybe oversold it _ the idea of `repurposing' (the
series) was a tricky way of avoiding the word `rerun,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for those who have decried ``Ally McBeal's'' seemingly
sexually frisky season, Kelley pleaded innocent. ``If you look at
the balance of the first eight episodes, I don't think there's more
sex than last year,'' he said. ``I think because the first two
episodes had more sex than usual, and when you come back for a
debut of a series, there's a lot of focus on those first couple of
episodes, and maybe that was taken out of proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley _ and ``Ally'' star Calista Flockhart _ got steamy in the
latest season's first episode, with Ally enjoying an anonymous
tryst in a car wash. ``Certainly, that car-wash scene was intended
to be provocative, but the intent wasn't (so much) to be sexually
explicit as to send a wake-up call to the viewers that the show
would continue to change and grow,'' Kelley explained. ``That's
essential to the success of `Ally McBeal.' It can't stay in the
same place, it has to go in different directions and cross some
boundaries. In doing that, you'll alienate some viewers as you're
rewarding others and maybe gain others.''
</P>
<P>
   The second episode was infamous before it even aired, thanks to
a soulful lip-lock between Ally and her usual nemesis, Ling (Lucy
Liu). ``I've never sat down and said, `I want to do something just
because it's never been done before,''' Kelley related. ``The kiss
between Ally and Ling was not something where I said, `OK, this is
something that'll push an envelope, let's do this.' It really came
from many discussions with male friends and female friends, and
male heterosexuals think the idea of kissing another man is
repulsive. Women heterosexuals that I talk to ... do not think that
way. It's not something they want to do, but they don't find the
idea repugnant. Which I don't hear from male heterosexuals. That
was the genesis of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Kelley purports not to enjoy challenging his networks'
standards-and-practices, he conceded his lofty reputation allows
him to get away with material that others couldn't. ``I wouldn't
deny it,'' he said. ``The main thing with the studios or the
networks is, you demonstrate that you're going to deal with it
responsibly, they'll let you. If you're being gratuitous, they
wouldn't let you. If there wasn't any story beneath that kiss, I
think they would have had something to say about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Krakowski, who plays the daffy, eccentrically opinionated
Elaine, offered an example of one of ``Ally's'' battles with Fox
censors, concerning her character's performing a suggested act of
manual stimulation on a co-worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said the only way that they'd let us do the scene is if
my hand went down but came up with something in my hand, a tissue
or a pencil or something,'' Krakowski recalled. ``I brought a
tissue up as if I had taken it out of his pocket, and they allowed
it. It's like, I couldn't believe that was the fine line that
determined that I could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   More than his characters' sexual high jinx, Kelley has
astonished the industry with his exhausting work ethic _ he writes
almost every episode of both ``The Practice'' and ``Ally,'' roughly
40 scripts a year, which makes him at least four times as prolific
as the average TV writer. Factor in time on the set and dealing
with other aspects of television production, as well as having the
life experiences that inspire the scripts in the first place, and
the effort seems beyond Herculean _ and these are scripts for
Emmy-winning series, not ``Veronica's Closet.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley said he had spent the day writing ``The Practice,''
interspersed with one production meeting and a couple of visits to
the editing bay to watch progress on an ``Ally'' episode. ``That's
kind of a typical day,'' he said. ``I try not to write on both
shows in a single day. It's easy to keep focused if I'm doing one
show one day and the other another.
</P>
<P>
   ``'The Practice' and `Ally,' for whatever reason, it's a very
workable thing for me, going back and forth,'' he continued.
``Maybe because they're such different worlds, I feel I get a real
reprieve from one when I'm working on the other and the tones are
so different that it hasn't been that difficult doing two shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest surprise Kelley had for his interrogators
was the fact that the producer, famous for being captured at awards
shows in his tuxedo and casually tousled coif, actually sported a
neat, trim haircut. In fact, when ``Ally'' co-star Liu came upon
Kelley after the press conference, she gushed, ``You got a haircut!
I barely recognized you!''
</P>
<P>
   As for his own celebrity, Kelley said, ``It's not been something
I've enjoyed. It's been an ongoing source of dialogue with ABC on
how they promote the show. I don't agree with the philosophy that
shows should be advertised as the product of somebody or another.
People shouldn't know my name.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, after the press conference, his associates
handed out hats reading ``The Practice'' on the back. On the front?
``David E. Kelley Productions.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, a tour of Kelley production sets unearthed the
moderately fascinating factoid that the book ``You'll Never Eat
Lunch in This Town Again'' is tucked away in Ally's apartment. Who
knew she'd take it so (BEGIN ITAL)literally(END ITAL)? &QL;

`NYPD BLUE' RETURNS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Tonight is Tuesday. Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's certainly been an eventful season for ``NYPD Blue''
already, and the show doesn't even return until this evening. Any
chance to capitalize on the momentum of last season's emotional
melodrama _ which was more or less bookended by the deaths of Bobby
Simone (Jimmy Smits) and Sylvia Costas (Sharon Lawrence), detective
Sipowicz's partner and wife, respectively _ was torpedoed when ABC
elected to extend the run of critical darling ``Once and Again'' in
the stalwart cop show's time slot.
</P>
<P>
   Series creator Steven Bochco, never shy about speaking his mind,
immediately cried foul _ demanding an outright cancellation so he
could shop the series to another network. Even multiple Emmy winner
Dennis Franz, who has essayed one of TV history's most indelible
characters in Sipowicz, admitted hurt at the perceived lack of
respect. Viewers, for their part, were given plenty of time to find
a new show to watch _ specifically, the kinder, gentler ``Judging
Amy,'' which stars former ``Blue'' actress Amy Brenneman and reigns
as the season's breakout hit; it's ``NYPD Blue's'' competition.
</P>
<P>
   After the war of words comes tonight's chance for ``NYPD Blue''
to step up to the plate and belt one out of the park, thereby
simultaneously shaming ABC and silencing critics who charge the
series has lost some of its urgency. Instead, it hits a clean
double off the wall, a solid show, yet short of the series'
incendiary best. Worse, next week's episode is, to pursue our
baseball metaphor, merely a single through the hole. ABC clearly
has done the series a disservice by delaying its return to the
schedule _ it has put a magnifying glass to the mere competence of
the new episodes, rather than the expected brilliance of the past.
And maybe the show's writers have put themselves in something of a
hole: In writing out characters with such dramatic flair, they've
hamstrung themselves this season. If poor Sipowicz gets dumped on
any more, the show will veer dangerously toward soap opera. But
that also means Franz won't get to do what he does so exquisitely,
which is suffer stoically.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to tonight's episode, in which Sylvia's death
must be old news, because there's little acknowledgment of it;
detective Diane Russell (Kim Delaney) seems to be well over the
death of her husband Bobby, as well. Sipowicz and his latest
partner, Bobby Sorenson (Rick Schroder) investigate a beating death
that two cops swear they did not commit; they're lying of course,
and Sipowicz grouses that he has to mop up their ``bag of crap.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Sipowicz also complains about catching ``a bag of
crap.'' Careful _ that could end up being the motto of this, the
series' seventh season. He and Sorenson deal with a parolee who's
apparently not succeeding in his efforts to stay on the straight
and narrow, while Russell and detective Jill Kirkendall suffer
professional friction from their personal lives while investigating
a crack prostitute's dead baby found in a dumpster. This plays as
tiredly manipulative, even without the seemingly requisite,
flamboyant transvestite hooker. Thompson still seems waiting for
the writers to give her something to do; Kirkendall's troubled-ex
story line is boring.
</P>
<P>
   These episodes introduce Sorenson's next squeeze, Mary Franco
(Sheeri Rappaport), who apparently will bring new levels of
emotional angst to the squad room. It will take more than that,
however, for the series to reclaim the intensity and veneration
that has made it compelling in the past. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel _ Taking over a plaza associated with the peace
camp, about 100,000 Israelis packed Rabin Square on Monday night to
protest a withdrawal from the Golan Heights that would be a likely
component of a peace deal with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   As Prime Minister Ehud Barak prepared to fly home from an
intensive round of Israeli-Syrian negotiations in West Virginia,
scores of busloads of yeshiva students, Golan residents and retired
Russian immigrants jammed the heart of secular, dovish Tel Aviv to
send him _ and President Clinton _ a few messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Golan stays, Barak goes,'' read one among the many banners
in Hebrew, English and Russian that fluttered as old-fashioned
Zionist rallying songs _ ``I have no other land,'' was one _
reverberated through the cold, wet night.
</P>
<P>
   Although their campaign to keep the Golan Israeli is young,
organizers were aiming for a crowd to rival the 400,000 Israelis
who turned out to protest Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982. But
they fell short of that figure.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no doubt that the defenders of the Golan beat
the peace camp off the starting block. Theirs is the loudest public
opinion that Barak is returning to face: a budding nationwide
campaign to oppose a potential peace agreement if the price is
surrendering the Golan Heights that Israel seized from Syria in
1967.
</P>
<P>
   Since Barak, a former general, pledged in his campaign to put
the agreement to a vote in Israel's first-ever referendum on peace,
public opinion is as much his battlefield right now as the
negotiating tables in the United States. But his supporters prefer
not to mobilize until there is an agreement that spells out what
security arrangements and type of normalized relationship Israel
will get in exchange for the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just too early and too abstract, and our people are not
motivated yet to go into the streets in massive numbers,'' said
Janet Aviad, a spokeswoman for Peace Now in Israel. ``People from
the Golan Heights are out because they smell an agreement around
the corner and it's their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy about peace, but even for us, giving up the Golan
is going to be painful. It's going to be tough. The Israeli public
has been educated for the last 30 years that the Golan Heights is
vital for security.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the crowd here Monday night, Eli Malka, chairman of
the Golan residents committee, intentionally echoed the words,
``Good-bye, friend,'' that Clinton used to bid farewell to Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin at his funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't intervene, friend,'' Malka said, his voice booming
through the square where the huge peace rally was held that ended
in Rabin's assassination in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Some Israeli peace advocates were horrified by what they saw as
the manipulation of their place, their hero and their terminology
to serve the opposing camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Proclaiming nostalgia for the old Rabin, not the peacemaker but
the former general who led Israel in battle, the Golan leaders
showed on huge screens a well-known clip from his election campaign
in which he stated that Israel would never come down from the
Golan. Rabin's government later began the negotiation process with
Syria that Barak and Syria's President Hafez Assad have revived.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview before the rally, Dalia Itzik, the Environment
Minister and a leading member of Barak's Labor/One Israel party,
said the opponents' slogan proclaiming, ``Peace with the Golan,''
was cynical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also prefer peace with the Golan,'' Ms. Itzik said. ``But
there's no such animal who can make peace with Syria and keep the
Golan. Not even God can promise that.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   During the rally, Tamir Hezzi sat cross-legged on the pavement
reading a Talmud propped up on his back-pack. Smiling broadly,
Hezzi, who was bused in from his religious school in Bat Yam, said
he was ``learning here on the sidewalk because it strengthens our
people, such study.''
</P>
<P>
   As a type, Hezzi, a yeshiva student, does not represent the
Golan settlers, who tend to be secular and who voted overwhelmingly
for Barak despite his pledge to make peace with Syria. Hezzi would
be a more likely supporter of the West Bank settlers, who are more
religious and attached to the land for its biblical roots.
</P>
<P>
   The Golan settlers are divided now. But even those who sponsored
Monday night's rally do not fell entirely comfortable relying on
the right-wing movement of the West Bank settlers for their
organizational strength, fund-raising coffers and ability to summon
a crowd. Monday night, the square was filled with yeshiva students
and West Bank residents. On Sunday, Israeli television had
interviewed yeshiva students saying that they were being asked to
keep their skullcaps hidden under baseball caps. But there was no
hiding the sea of yarmulkes in Rabin Square.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Golan residents turned down a request to speak at
the rally made by opposition leader Ariel Sharon, head of the Likud
Party. ``It wasn't specifically about Sharon,'' said Uri Heitner, a
spokesman for the residents committee. ``We didn't want the
demonstration to take on a right-wing character. Rather, we want it
to be a popular, national demonstration.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The politicians on the stage at the rally did not represent a
broad spectrum. They were all conservative, including two members
of Barak's Cabinet, Natan Sharansky, leader of the Russian
immigrant party, and Yitzhak Levy, leader of the National Religious
Party. Both have said they would withdraw their parties from the
government if a deal ceding the Golan were signed.
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky has said that Russian immigrants, from experience,
cannot trust a ``dictator,'' which is how he describes Assad, to
keep his word.
</P>
<P>
   Holding a Russian banner supplied by Sharansky's party, Yona
Doctorovich, a photographer from Sfad in northern Israel, said,
``We're giving up land and what are we getting? A piece of paper?''
He raised flat palms and raised his eyes skyward. ``We're Russians.
We understand the value of such paper.''
</P>
<P>
   A retired clothier who lives outside Tel Aviv, Naftali Yosef was
born in Syria and said, ``I know them.'' Yosef clutched an umbrella
that he used for emphasis. ``There's an existential problem,''' he
continued. ``We see that Syria is weak militarily and economically
and its government is not stable. It's like a lion with rotten
teeth. So, what? If we make peace there on the Golan and they get
new American weapons and international financing, the lion will be
strong again.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An immigrant from Louisiana some 30 years ago, Chanan Lemann,
who lives in the West Bank settlement of Efrat, said he was a
peacenik. ``I spent 20 years in the army and I never killed
anybody, and I'm really happy about that,'' he said. ``I want to
live with my neighbors in peace. But Assad has attacked us three
times and before we give him a prize for his aggressive behavior,
show me he's changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemann's son, Daniel, who is 13, added, ``If Clinton wants us to
give the Golan to the Syrians, I think he should give back to the
Indians in America first.''

NBC WANTS MORE VIEWERS _ AND MORE MINORITY WRITERS, ACTORS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ NBC executives discussed their latest efforts to
expand viewer numbers on Sunday, and elaborated on the network's
conciliatory efforts to hire and cast more minorities on TV
productions in the wake of a fall season of virtually all-white
programming. But they also took some time out to chide competitor
ABC for mortgaging that network's future on game shows, while
acknowledging that they're banking on one themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Among NBC's plans for addressing the lack of minority faces on
television is a pledge to hire an extra (minority) writer for every
show that enters its second season, as well as holding a seminar
for all providers of programming to the network ``co-managed by the
NAACP.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to fund, with no burden to the production
company, a position for years two, three and four (of a series's
run). It makes good business sense, and it's the right thing to
do,'' declared Scott Sassa, president of NBC's West Coast division.
``This is not something that we simply came up with as a compromise
to get these people away from us. We really believe in what we're
doing with the seminars and the writers and everything.''
Second-season series were picked in part due to the high percentage
of new shows that get canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Among current programming, struggling critics' favorite ``Freaks
and Geeks'' and the prestige hit ``The West Wing'' garnered the
most discussion. Sassa called ``Freaks and Geeks,'' a comedy with
dark overtones about kids at a Midwestern high school seeking
acceptance _ or at least not too much rejection _ ``one of my
favorite shows.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news for ``Freaks'' is that NBC moved it from its
Saturday night slot to see if it could win new viewers _ it began
its tenure on Mondays last night. The bad news is it opened
opposite ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We really thought that we would get at least a pretty fair
shot on Monday, (but) with `Millionaire' in there, it's going to be
virtually impossible for us to make a judgment based upon what most
likely would be a (high rating) against it,'' Ancier said. He added
that it was still ``rather likely'' that NBC would order more
episodes of the series.
</P>
<P>
   But Sassa warned that quality isn't necessarily a gauge for a
show's survival. ``Who would have known at the beginning of the
season what `Millionaire' would do?'' Sassa said. ``A lot of times,
the issues surrounding whether you keep a show on has little to do
with the show and a lot to do with the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ancier said ABC's wallpapering ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
all over its November sweeps schedule may have claimed a ratings
victory, but at the expense of the series the network pre-empted,
none of which were available for sampling during a key period of
heightened viewing. ``They took off every new comedy,'' Ancier
said. All _ ``Odd Man Out,'' ``Oh, Grow Up'' and ``It's Like, You
Know ...'' _ were eventually canceled. Game shows, expected to have
a limited shelf life, have inspired ABC to halt development on some
sitcoms. ``You're giving up precious time periods (in which you
could] start new shows up),'' Ancier added.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that didn't stop NBC from developing its own game show, a
retooling of the '50s hit ``Twenty-One,'' which debuted Sunday
night an hour before ``Millionaire'' returned to ABC. Ancier also
lauded ``Millionaire.'' ``If you're a programmer, you now have a
show that you can put on seven days a week, every single night in
any time period you want, and it gets not quite `ER' numbers, but
close. There's nothing like that in the modern history of
television, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Ancier also speculated that NBC, which airs Aaron Sorkin's
``West Wing,'' may be interested in picking up his struggling
series ``Sports Night'' were ABC to cancel it. ``NBC has a more
upscale audience than ABC in general, and the show would work
better on NBC, but the other school of thought is, `Do we really
want to pick up a show that's just barely surviving?' There are
certain places on our schedule where it'd be a nice fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sassa added that ``West Wing'' draws the audience with the
highest average income in television.
</P>
<P>
   During its portion of the semi-annual TV press tour in Pasadena,
NBC introduced its previously announced new series _ the sitcoms
``M.Y.O.B.'' and ``Battery Park,'' the animated series ``God, the
Devil and Bob'' and ``Sammy,'' and the supernatural drama ``The
Others'' _ Ancier also introduced other programs in development.
Among these: ``Daddio,'' a family comedy starring Michael Chiklis
as a stay-at-home father; a sitcom starring Tony winner Kristin
Chenoweth, produced by ``Cosby Show'' producer John Markus; and a
drama produced by ``Law &AMP; Order's'' Dick Wolf starring Oliver Platt
(``Bulworth'') as an investigative journalist. &QL;

DAVID E. KELLEY RIDES WAVE OF HITS AND MISSES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Note italics in final graf) 
 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few people have enjoyed a year as exhilarating as David E.
Kelley's past 12 months. On the other hand, few have endured one as
frustrating. Five months ago, he was crowned the King of TV,
pulling off the unprecedented feat of winning both best drama and
best comedy series Emmys; he had his imprimatur on no fewer than
five TV series on the fall schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the fall _ literally, on the calendar, not to mention
metaphorically. ``Snoops,'' his series about sexy private
investigators, debuted to critical snipes and audience
indifference. ``Ally,'' a dietary portion of ``Ally McBeal''
episodes, never struck anyone as anything more than reruns with
attitude; both were canceled in the past month. To make matters
more vexing, he was flopping in two different media: His film,
``Mystery, Alaska,'' tanked, following the cue of his earlier
cinematic effort, ``Lake Placid.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, how many people even have two shows on the
air to get canceled in the first place? And he still has three
more: ``Ally McBeal''; the Emmy-winning legal series ``The
Practice''; and the medical drama ``Chicago Hope,'' with which he
has minimal involvement and which, after six years, is quite likely
in its final season, a fact Kelley seems to regard with equanimity.
</P>
<P>
   There was a curiously conciliatory tone in Kelley's voice as he
spoke in a press conference and a follow-up private interview on
Thursday, as the winter leg of the TV press tour opened with a
visit to Kelley's production offices in Manhattan Beach. What was
originally supposed to be an opportunity to promote ``Snoops''
instead became an occasion to apologize for the series.
</P>
<P>
   A guy who had a lot to gloat about _ including the fact that
``The Practice'' won the prime post-Super Bowl spot this year,
where it will begin a two-part whodunit episode bringing the
characters to Los Angeles _ rarely did. He instead offered up
measured and thoughtful analyses for his recent failures and
defended his successes against sundry charges and complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some perspective (here),'' Kelley said. ``We won two
Emmys one night and the next week `Snoops' debuted. ``You hope the
wins outnumber the losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed that we never got it to be a good show,''
Kelley admitted about ``Snoops.'' ``The writing was on the wall
from the network that it really wasn't in their future. The one
promise I made to myself at the beginning of the year was that I
wasn't going to let it cut into `Ally' or `The Practice,' and it
was at the point where there was a potential for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't look the people at ABC in the eye and say, `Hey,
this is a great show you've got here, don't squander it,''' he
continued, adding that there are worse things than to have the
ratings phenomenon ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' as ``The
Practice's'' lead-in. ``As disappointed as I was on `Snoops''
behalf,'' he said, ``it was juxtaposed with an odd sort of
enthusiasm on behalf of `The Practice.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Snoops'' taught Kelley that even if one is an artist, selling
out has its consequences. ``It's a mistake to create a show to try
to accommodate somebody else's vision or needs,'' he explained.
``The creation of `Snoops' came because I contractually owed
another series to ABC, and they wanted it sooner rather than later.
It was in my interest to give it to them sooner rather than later
because I was nearing a new exclusive deal with Fox.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Kelley admitted that he was perhaps a bit too
optimistic regarding an audience's appetite for the half-hour
``Ally.'' ``Fox maybe oversold it _ the idea of `repurposing' (the
series) was a tricky way of avoiding the word `rerun,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for those who have decried ``Ally McBeal's'' seemingly
sexually frisky season, Kelley pleaded innocent. ``If you look at
the balance of the first eight episodes, I don't think there's more
sex than last year,'' he said. ``I think because the first two
episodes had more sex than usual, and when you come back for a
debut of a series, there's a lot of focus on those first couple of
episodes, and maybe that was taken out of proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley _ and ``Ally'' star Calista Flockhart _ got steamy in the
latest season's first episode, with Ally enjoying an anonymous
tryst in a car wash. ``Certainly, that car-wash scene was intended
to be provocative, but the intent wasn't (so much) to be sexually
explicit as to send a wake-up call to the viewers that the show
would continue to change and grow,'' Kelley explained. ``That's
essential to the success of `Ally McBeal.' It can't stay in the
same place, it has to go in different directions and cross some
boundaries. In doing that, you'll alienate some viewers as you're
rewarding others and maybe gain others.''
</P>
<P>
   The second episode was infamous before it even aired, thanks to
a soulful lip-lock between Ally and her usual nemesis, Ling (Lucy
Liu). ``I've never sat down and said, `I want to do something just
because it's never been done before,''' Kelley related. ``The kiss
between Ally and Ling was not something where I said, `OK, this is
something that'll push an envelope, let's do this.' It really came
from many discussions with male friends and female friends, and
male heterosexuals think the idea of kissing another man is
repulsive. Women heterosexuals that I talk to ... do not think that
way. It's not something they want to do, but they don't find the
idea repugnant. Which I don't hear from male heterosexuals. That
was the genesis of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Kelley purports not to enjoy challenging his networks'
standards-and-practices, he conceded his lofty reputation allows
him to get away with material that others couldn't. ``I wouldn't
deny it,'' he said. ``The main thing with the studios or the
networks is, you demonstrate that you're going to deal with it
responsibly, they'll let you. If you're being gratuitous, they
wouldn't let you. If there wasn't any story beneath that kiss, I
think they would have had something to say about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Krakowski, who plays the daffy, eccentrically opinionated
Elaine, offered an example of one of ``Ally's'' battles with Fox
censors, concerning her character's performing a suggested act of
manual stimulation on a co-worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said the only way that they'd let us do the scene is if
my hand went down but came up with something in my hand, a tissue
or a pencil or something,'' Krakowski recalled. ``I brought a
tissue up as if I had taken it out of his pocket, and they allowed
it. It's like, I couldn't believe that was the fine line that
determined that I could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   More than his characters' sexual high jinx, Kelley has
astonished the industry with his exhausting work ethic _ he writes
almost every episode of both ``The Practice'' and ``Ally,'' roughly
40 scripts a year, which makes him at least four times as prolific
as the average TV writer. Factor in time on the set and dealing
with other aspects of television production, as well as having the
life experiences that inspire the scripts in the first place, and
the effort seems beyond Herculean _ and these are scripts for
Emmy-winning series, not ``Veronica's Closet.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley said he had spent the day writing ``The Practice,''
interspersed with one production meeting and a couple of visits to
the editing bay to watch progress on an ``Ally'' episode. ``That's
kind of a typical day,'' he said. ``I try not to write on both
shows in a single day. It's easy to keep focused if I'm doing one
show one day and the other another.
</P>
<P>
   ``'The Practice' and `Ally,' for whatever reason, it's a very
workable thing for me, going back and forth,'' he continued.
``Maybe because they're such different worlds, I feel I get a real
reprieve from one when I'm working on the other and the tones are
so different that it hasn't been that difficult doing two shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest surprise Kelley had for his interrogators
was the fact that the producer, famous for being captured at awards
shows in his tuxedo and casually tousled coif, actually sported a
neat, trim haircut. In fact, when ``Ally'' co-star Liu came upon
Kelley after the press conference, she gushed, ``You got a haircut!
I barely recognized you!''
</P>
<P>
   As for his own celebrity, Kelley said, ``It's not been something
I've enjoyed. It's been an ongoing source of dialogue with ABC on
how they promote the show. I don't agree with the philosophy that
shows should be advertised as the product of somebody or another.
People shouldn't know my name.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, after the press conference, his associates
handed out hats reading ``The Practice'' on the back. On the front?
``David E. Kelley Productions.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, a tour of Kelley production sets unearthed the
moderately fascinating factoid that the book ``You'll Never Eat
Lunch in This Town Again'' is tucked away in Ally's apartment. Who
knew she'd take it so (BEGIN ITAL)literally(END ITAL)? &QL;

SCIENTISTS CALL FOR END TO NEUROLOGY-PSYCHIATRY `DIVIDE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The turf battle between neurologists and psychiatrists has
historically been so intense that a medical official once said that
getting them ``to sit down together without police present was in
itself an accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   It may not really be necessary for law enforcement to intervene
between the two disciplines, but there is nevertheless a ``great
divide'' that must be closed if research and treatment are to
advance more quickly, says a group of Harvard scientists from both
fields.
</P>
<P>
   In an article published Tuesday in the journal Neurology,
researchers say the animosity of the past stems from a difference
of thinking about what causes disease _ the biology of the brain
vs. the psychiatry of the mind. But the latest science shows
biological aspects to psychiatric disorders, and psychiatric
aspects to neurological disorders, according to the article by
neurologists Bruce H. Price and Raymond D. Adams, and psychiatrist
Joseph T. Coyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two disciplines working together gives far more hope than
continuing these old turf wars,'' said Price, chairman of the
department of neurology at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., in an
interview. Price, the lead author, is also on the staff of
Massachusetts General Hospital and the faculty of Harvard Medical
School.
</P>
<P>
   The article, meant to stir controversy and debate among the
nearly 13,000 members of the American Academy of Neurology, calls
for changes in the medical education of both neurologists and
psychiatrists, and for better academic leadership in encouraging
collaboration between the two disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts has one of the highest per capita concentrations
of neurologists in the country, with nearly 10 members of the
neurology academy for every 100,000 people, according to the
academy's Web site, making it particularly noteworthy that the
article in Neurology is authored by Massachusetts scientists, Price
said.
</P>
<P>
   Neurology, as a practice, involves the study and treatment of
diseases like stroke, Alzheimer's disease and other neurological
disorders, while psychiatry looks at ailments like depression,
schizophrenia and other mental illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   There has already been cross-fertilization in the two
disciplines, with such recent subspecialties as biological
psychiatry and neuropsychiatry, and with the National Institute of
Mental Health and the National Institute of Neurological Diseases
and Stroke making multidisciplinary grants.
</P>
<P>
   A proposed new Neuroscience Center at the National Institutes of
Health is expected to tie together neuroscience research being
conducted at NIMH, NINDS and seven other institutes.
</P>
<P>
   But specialists in the field said there needs to be even more
such collaboration, and welcomed the article in the journal
Neurology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree wholeheartedly with everything in it,'' said Dr. Robin
Brey, chairwoman of the American Academy of Neurology's
professional and public information committee. The ``most important
point about this article,'' she said, is its summary of the latest
evidence that allows doctors to ``refine our viewpoints, update our
viewpoints and our theories.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the evidence cited in the article for making the case that
the biology of the brain and psychiatry of the mind are
inseparable: Brain imaging scans that allow researchers to see
differences in people with and without mental illness; studies of
the amazing plasticity of the brain, with neurons growing in
response to environmental stimuli, like learning; and brain imaging
research showing that people with obsessive-compulsive disorder who
respond to either behavioral therapy or medication both show the
same biologic changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brain vs. mind. . .it used to be either/or, nature or nurture.
What we're saying is it's really both,'' said Price.

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Vice President Al Gore, presiding over an
unusual Security Council session called to debate the AIDS crisis
in Africa, said Monday that the United States would add $150
million to next year's budget to help combat that and other
infectious diseases in the poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   Gore appeared during a primary campaign in which his opponent
for the Democratic presidential nomination, Bill Bradley, has
consistently backed more cooperation with the United Nations. The
occasion kicked off a month of a focus on Africa in the council
organized by Richard C. Holbrooke, the U.S. representative to the
United Nations and the council president for January.
</P>
<P>
   The pledge of more money is still subject to approval by
Congress. But it made less news here than Gore's presence itself
and the recognition by the council that the AIDS epidemic in Africa
had reached the level of an international security issue, because
it could decimate the economic, political and military
establishments in many countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is being more effective than war in destabilizing
countries,'' the president of the World Bank, James D. Wolfensohn,
said. ``We're rolling back some of the gains that have been made in
Africa over the past 40 years. We gained, under African leadership,
more than 20 years in life expectancy. In many countries, this will
be lost by the year 2010.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Piot, executive director of UNAIDS, a consortium of U.N.
agencies that has been providing assistance to a range of programs
in Africa for several years, told the council that he estimated
that his program needed $1 billion to $3 billion a year to fight
AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa alone.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS in Africa, several speakers noted, now kills more people
than wars _ and more wars are being fought there than on any other
continent. Furthermore, soldiers and international peacekeepers are
in the forefront of those spreading the human immunodeficiency
virus, which causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Across one society after another, the effects are devastating, a
lineup of international experts testified.
</P>
<P>
   Around the world, more than 33 million people have AIDS or the
virus that causes it. At least 70 percent are African.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just imagine that in Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe 25
percent of the people between 15 and 19 years of age are HIV
positive,'' Wolfensohn said. ``Just imagine that in Zambia and
Zimbabwe there is more chance of a child born today dying of AIDS
than of living free of AIDS. A third of teen-age girls in many of
the countries are subject to the scourge of AIDS. We're losing
teachers faster than we can replace them. We're losing judges,
lawyers, government officials, persons in the military.''
</P>
<P>
   In the face of the crisis, a number of African leaders have
refused to discuss the problem openly. The administrator of the
U.N. Development Program, Mark Malloch Brown, said Monday: ``In too
many places, individual ostracism, and hence denial, still prevail,
confounding good tracking and management of the disease. Change
must begin by confronting the region's troubled inheritance:
extensive migrant labor, social norms and gender inequality making
it hard for women and girls to deny men sex, leading to HIV
incidence rates among girls three or four times higher than boys,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that, ``The first battle to be
won in the war against AIDS is the battle to smash the wall of
silence and stigma surrounding it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who also spoke about the need to ``destigmatize'' AIDS,
said that the next Clinton administration budget would also include
money for the Pentagon to share its expertise on controlling AIDS
in the military with African nations.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda's minister of health, Dr. Crispus Kiyonga, told the
council Monday that one of the programs that has made his country
the continent's leader in the fight against AIDS is in the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Uganda has also established anti-AIDS campaigns in
educational institutions and 4,000 private organizations and is
using songs, billboards and radio and television to spread
information about the disease. By 1995, Kiyonga said, surveys found
that many more people were using condoms and reducing the number of
their sexual partners, often ``sticking to one.''

   Not all Security Council members approved of Monday's unusual
debate, in which more than two dozen diplomats spoke. China and
Russia refused to take part. Both have fought to keep social issues
out of the Council, fearing the introduction of human rights cases,
diplomats say. Holbrooke said that the Russians and Chinese agreed
to the debate only on the promise that it would not set a
precedent.
</P>
<P>
   For many at the United Nations it was the ``old Al Gore'' who
spoke Monday _ an American they remember as once deeply involved in
international issues. As a senator in 1992, he led a congressional
delegation to the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In 1994,
he went to Cairo, Egypt, for an international conference on
population and development.
</P>
<P>
   But during the second Clinton administration, as the White House
and State Department have become increasingly skittish about
involvement in international organizations in the face of
Republican hostility in Congress, Gore _ like Hillary Rodham
Clinton _ has been seen much less frequently at public U.N. events.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats said that Gore was the first U.S. vice president
to preside over the Security Council. But he was not the first vice
president of the United States to address the council. Vice
President George Bush spoke for the United States in July 1988 when
Iran attempted to win a condemnation of the United States after a
U.S. warship shot down an Iranian passenger plane over the Persian
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   That year was also a presidential election year, and Bush was
the likely Republican candidate. His advisers later acknowledged
that Bush, who had been the U.S. representative at the United
Nations in the early 1970s, was encouraged to go to the council to
demonstrate his presidential qualities in an international arena.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Jeffrey Laurenti, executive director of policy studies
at the U.N. Association of the United States, an independent
support and research group, contended that the same thinking may
have applied to Gore's appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was sold to the Gore office as a political stop, a
campaign stop that outshines what he might do on a bus in New
Hampshire or Iowa,'' said Laurenti, who has worked on Democratic
campaigns in New Jersey. ``It was sold not as an important step for
international policy but as a way to showcase the vice president as
an international leader.'' Gore's speech, Laurenti said, had
something to appeal to a gay audience, to blacks and to women.
</P>
<P>
   But Holbrooke, asked by reporters if Gore's appearance, lasting
less than an hour, had more to do with politics than Africa, called
the question ``a truly outrageous accusation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``He said that all his domestic advisers opposed this,''
Holbrooke said. ``He's in this building five or six hours today.
None of what he's doing here today has any direct impact on the
present phase of the primary season, which is intense, and being
conducted in two states which are far away from here _ and this is
not an issue. He and Senator Bradley agree on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan saw the political possibilities, however. In the only
light moment of the daylong debate on a grim subject, he expressed
gratitude to Gore for introducing him effusively. ``Thank you, Mr.
Vice President, or perhaps I should say Mr. President,'' Annan
said, leaving a long pause before adding ``of the Security
Council.'' By council standards, it brought down the house.

CHECHENS BATTLE BACK TO CONTROL AREAS IN 3 CITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV AND BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian troops battled back Monday against separatist
militants who had seized parts of three major cities in Chechnya in
a surprise counterattack that left scores of federal troops dead or
wounded and cast doubt on Moscow's predictions of an impending
military victory.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels' ability to launch powerful, sudden, and
well-organized attacks indicated that they remained a potent
fighting force, despite the Kremlin's repeated assurances that its
troops had surrounded the separatists and broken their resistance.
</P>
<P>
   As the war juggernaut that brought him to power sputtered in
Chechnya, acting President Vladimir V. Putin moved to consolidate
his control over the Kremlin by removing or demoting several key
players close to his predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   But the shakeup was overshadowed by the sudden attacks, which
threatened to dent the aura of competence of the military campaign
Putin has overseen in Chechnya. Large forces of rebels broke
through Russian lines on several fronts, reportedly taking control
of buildings in Gudermes, Chechnya's second largest city, as well
as two other towns, Argun and Shali, which had been under federal
control for weeks, according to reports from Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   One Russian force said 26 of its men were killed and 30 wounded
in past 24 hours, and the defense ministry in Moscow said rebels
were attacking Russian troops across the plain south of the
embattled capital, Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   A military spokesman later played down the significance of the
offensive and said the situation was ``under control.'' NTV
television, however, reported heavy fighting was continuing in all
three locales.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chechens have clearly seized the initiative and the
situation has become very bad for the federal forces,'' said
Alexander Pikayev, defense analyst for the Moscow Carnegie Center.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks came three days after Moscow called a temporary halt
to its assault on Grozny, which Putin said was a gesture in honor
of Orthodox Christmas and the end of the Muslims' Ramadan fasting
period, both of which were last Friday. The Russian effort to take
Grozny had stalled in recent weeks because of heavy rebel
resistance and poor weather that limited the effectiveness of
Russian artillery and aviation.
</P>
<P>
   In the attacks Sunday, about 2,000 Chechens assaulted Argun, 9
miles east of Grozny, occupying Russian checkpoints connecting
Argun with Gudermes, according to Russian news agencies. About
1,500 more attacked Shali, 15 miles south of the capital. Reports
from Gudermes said the rebels had taken several buildings and were
holding hostages in a local school.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials had described these areas as fully under their
control. Though unable to drive the separatists out of their
fortified positions in Grozny, the army had said the rebels were
trapped there and in mountain hideaways in the south.
</P>
<P>
   A military spokesman, Colonel Vadim Timichenko, denied that
Russia had suffered setbacks in the three towns. He said a few
hundred rebels had attacked but had been surrounded and were being
``destroyed'' by federal troops.
</P>
<P>
   The Interfax news agency, citing military sources, said a
Russian column was ambushed near Gudermes. The 26 dead and 33
wounded in that attack represented the largest single-day loss
acknowledged by Russia since its campaign began in October.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's high command abruptly replaced two of its top officers
in Chechnya last week. One of them, General Gennady Troshev, had
commanded the troops in the area where the rebels struck Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Chechnya's separatist leader, President Aslan
Maskhadov, had been promising a broad counteroffensive to coincide
with the end of Ramadan. But just as they did in the failed
1994-1996 war in Chechnya, Russian leaders, backed by state-run
media, have played down the ability of the rebels to respond and
have portrayed them as a defeated, desperate bunch with nowhere to
run.
</P>
<P>
   Military analysts in Moscow said that Russia's forces were
ill-equipped to wage the kind of guerrilla war that the badly
outnumbered Chechen rebels appear determined to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia's military has not learned from the lessons of Vietnam,
Afghanistan, and the first Chechen war. The generals are still
fighting World War II and think they can achieve victory by sheer
numbers and firepower,'' said Yevgeny Volk, a military analyst with
the Heritage Foundation in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kremlin, meanwhile, Putin firmed up his control by
demoting two key members of Yeltsin's inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Borodin, a longtime Yeltsin insider, lost his job as the
manager of the Kremlin's vast real estate empire and was relegated
to the largely ceremonial job of overseeing Russia's plans to
reunite with the former Soviet republic of Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also demoted First Deputy Prime Minister Nikolai
Aksyonenko, who held the number two spot in the Cabinet, shifting
him to the considerably less influential post of railways minister.
</P>
<P>
   Putin promoted Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov to replace
Aksyonenko in the second ranking Cabinet spot.
</P>
<P>
   Borodin and Aksyonenko have been tied to a group of Yeltsin
cronies known as ``The Family,'' which is widely believed to have
wielded great influence over Yeltsin's Kremlin.

CLINTON SAYS PEACE PROCESS ON TRACK 

</HEADLINE>

c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Israel and Syria took a break from their
slow-moving peace talks, President Clinton predicted Monday that a
framework for a comprehensive peace agreement for the Middle East
could be in place within two months.
</P>
<P>
   The president said halting progress of Israeli-Syrian talks over
the past week, coupled with interim agreements between Israel and
the Palestinian, and signs that Lebanon is ready to resume
negotiations indicate the Middle East peace puzzle is coming
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on a track in which the Israelis, the Syrians, I hope
soon the Lebanese and already the Palestinians, have committed
themselves to work through these very difficult long-standing
issues over the course of the next two months,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's prediction came as he prepared for an overnight
trip to the Grand Canyon, where he is scheduled Tuesday to announce
protections for federal land there over the objection of local
officials. Later Tuesday he is to fly to Houston for two
fund-raisers before returning to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Before setting out, Clinton said he is not discouraged by the
Israeli and Syrian decisions to adjourn their peace discussions in
nearby Shepherdstown, W.Va. Israeli President Ehud Barak and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara packed their bags to fly home
after tentatively agreeing to resume their dialog Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people really talked about the substance of their
differences for the first time,'' Clinton said. ``They were very
open, they were very candid, they covered all the issues and I
think ... they broke a lot of ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The long-standing dispute between the two nations ``is too
tough'' to expect a quick resolution, he said. ``These are very
difficult issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Clinton urged Muslims, Jews and Christians to pray for
success of the peace talks. At a White House ceremony marking the
end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Clinton said the Middle
East is going through ``a time of great tension, where all people
will have to search for wisdom and understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   The president, who mediated the Israeli-Syrian talks five of the
seven days the leaders were in Shepherdstown, added: ``There will
be great reluctance to open the closed fist and walk into a new
era.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, Clinton flew to Arizona, where early Tuesday he
plans to announce creation of two new national monuments that will
declare about 1 million acres of federal land off-limits to mining
or other commercial development.
</P>
<P>
   The largest parcel of land is in northern Arizona, and a much
smaller segment includes an archaeological site about 50 miles
north of Phoenix. Although the land already is owned by the federal
government, without action by Clinton or another president using
the 1906 Antiquities Act, the land could be sold to private
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Gov. Jane Hull, a Republican, joined members of the
state's congressional delegation last week in writing Clinton to
protest the protections until local officials are consulted. Hull,
who was invited to the ceremony on the South Rim of the Grand
Canyon, plans to skip the event.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday afternoon, Clinton plans to fly to Houston for two
fund-raising receptions that previously were scheduled for December
but were postponed when the president came down with the flu.
</P>
<P>
   The first official stop in Houston will be an early evening
fund-raiser for Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, in the private
home of one of her supporters.
</P>
<P>
   According to a spokeswoman for Jackson Lee, about 120 guests
have been invited to the event, which is expected to raise about
$75,000 for her congressional race.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee, one of Clinton's staunchest &UR;  &LR; supporters in
Congress, drew two Republican challengers to her bid for
re-election this year.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Clinton heads to the home of lawyer John Eddie
Williams and a reception to raise money for the Texas Legislative
Victory Fund. He will head back to Washington on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's last trip to Houston was in May 1999.

IN EUROPE, AOL MERGER IS VIEWED AS PRESSURE ON RIVALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (With AOL-TIME-WARNER)  
(ms) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The Internet may well be borderless, but it
remains remarkably American.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Europe, America Online Inc.'s prospective takeover of
Time Warner Inc. is likely to accentuate that phenomenon and
increase pressure among rivals for alliances and mergers.
</P>
<P>
   America Online and Bertelsmann AG of Germany are partners in AOL
Europe, which operates local-language networks across the
continent.
</P>
<P>
   But the most striking feature about the Internet in Europe is
its fragmentation along national boundaries. Traditional telephone
companies are often the biggest Internet providers in each country,
but few have extended their reach across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the closest thing to ``pan-European'' Internet
services are those owned by American companies such as Yahoo! Inc.,
Microsoft Corp. and America Online.
</P>
<P>
   According to data compiled in November by Mediametrix, those
three companies controlled three of the five most heavily visited
sites in Britain, France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   America Online has itself had a spotty record, stumbling
somewhat last year when British rivals like Freeserve PLC began
offering free Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   But America Online soon fought back with its own free-service
plans, and analysts say the proposed merger is likely to strengthen
the company by giving it access to Time Warner's vast storage of
movies, television shows, books, magazines and news services _
content that is just as popular in much of Europe as it is in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult for a European company to come up with a
pan-European offering,'' said Therese Torris, director of European
Internet Commerce at Forrester Research's office in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, there has always existed the import of U.S.
culture. It has been the case for years in film and television
shows. American companies start with U.S. content, and then just
translate it. They have content that European consumers are very
attuned to.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Ms. Torris, 70 percent of the material available on
the Internet still originates in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, news of America Online deal with Time-Warner
immediately strengthened European media stocks, partly on
speculation that they would become takeover targets as well.
</P>
<P>
   Share of Canal Plus SA of France, which operates cable and
satellite television services in many European companies, jumped
17.1 percent to 140 euros or $144 in Paris Monday. BskyB PLC, the
British pay-television service partly owned by Rupert Murdoch's
News Corp., rose 12.5 percent to 1,011.5 pence or about $166 in
London.
</P>
<P>
   If the merger is completed, America Online would be at the
center of two of the world's biggest traditional media
conglomerates _ Time Warner and Bertelsmann. Besides Bertelsmann's
joint venture with America Online and small stake in the company
itself, Bertelsmann owns Random House, stakes in European
television networks and other properties.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Lakelin, a senior analyst at Analysys Ltd. in Cambridge,
England, said America Online's merger with Time Warner would give
it the content that would allow it to expand its subscriber base in
the face of companies like Freeserve that provide free internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   ``What companies like Freeserve really is to build communities
of interest,'' Lakelin said. ``Obviously having premium content is
the way to do that, and I don't think anybody can compete with AOL,
Bertelsmann and Time-Warner.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q -- I went to lunch with an outstanding applicant, and I must
say that he has terrible manners. I'm not a stickler about this,
but he chews with his mouth open, talks with food in his mouth,
reaches across the table for food and so on. He's got the right
experience and credentials for the job, but I'm concerned about
this. Should I be? J.B.
</P>
<P>
   A -- If the only factor preventing you from hiring this
outstanding applicant is his lack of polished manners, then in a
manner of speaking, you need to polish your hiring skills. When you
find an applicant with questionable energy, persistence or
interpersonal skills, then you would have a real basis for being
concerned. But table manners? They can be easily fixed.
</P>
<P>
   There is a cottage industry premised on providing up-and-coming
professionals with training in manners, poise and etiquette. If
skills in these areas are truly important for success in your
company, you could consider providing this individual, and
presumably others in your company, with some training in this area.
</P>
<P>
   It may also be helpful, however, to step back and recognize that
this individual has done well in his career to this point, in spite
of his manners. Perhaps manners are less important for success in
your industry than you may think. Either way, unless you have
validated data that unequivocably prove that applicants can chew
and talk with their mouths open tend to fail on the job, it would
be impolite and impolitic to include table manners as one of your
hiring criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Q - Somehow a rumor started that I am romantically involved with
one of the women who report to me. We all work long hours, and I
stayed late with her a few weeks ago when she had a flat tire.
However, there was and is nothing going on between us, but the
rumors still fly. How do I stop them? M.T.
</P>
<P>
   A - Rumors fly in many organizations, but they run out of gas if
there are no incidents to fuel them. If the rumor mongers are
basing their stories on the flat tire incident, people will soon
tire of these reruns.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, as a manager, you should advise the employees
that rumors are destructive, disruptive and cruel, and those who
spread them are engaging in unacceptable behavior. You do not need
to dignify the rumor about you by mentioning it. If it comes up,
however, you should simply state the truth: You helped an employee,
just as you would help any of them.
</P>
<P>
   You do not have to adjust your behavior because there are some
employees who are intent on creating and spreading malicious
stories. However, if it is possible that you are showing some
favoritism toward the one employee in question, the rumor may be a
reaction to it. As a result, you may want to take a look at your
managerial style when dealing with her, while remembering that
employees who are intent on creating rumors will do so regardless
of your behavior. So, here's a tidbit just for them: Some companies
terminate employees for spreading rumors, and that's no rumor.
</P>
<P>
   Q - My manager gave me an assignment and said it was an easy one
that I should be able to handle without any problem. I am finding
that it is not so easy, and I have some questions, but I am afraid
to ask them for fear of looking foolish. What do you suggest? A.L.
</P>
<P>
   A - If you think you'll look foolish now, think how you are
going to look when this so-called easy project is done all wrong
because you were afraid to ask some questions. If your manager
thinks less of you because you ask a few questions, then there are
more than a few questions about his or her managerial skills.
</P>
<P>
   Since you should definitely ask the questions that are on your
mind, one way to do so under these circumstances is to put them in
the context of a broader discussion. Tell your manager that you
would like to meet with him or her to discuss where you are on the
project. You can place any of your questions within this framework,
and there is virtually no way that you will appear overwhelmed or
befuddled.
</P>
<P>
   A project at its outset can easily appear to be simple, but once
the superficialities are peeled away, the complexities can be
enormous. By asking questions, you are showing that there is no
question about your self-confidence and desire to produce high
quality work.

ISRAEL, SYRIA AGREE TO RESUME TALKS NEXT WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W. Va. _ In a clear sign of progress in the
Israel-Syria peace talks, the two longtime enemies agreed Monday to
return to Washington in a mere nine days for further negotiations,
this time with a treaty-in-the-making in hand.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton, who traveled here five times in seven
days to lead the discussions, cautioned that many obstacles
remained, especially with the depth of public opposition in the
Middle East. He called it a ``time of great tension where all
people will have to search for wisdom and understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring his words, tens of thousands of Israelis protested
in Tel Aviv against returning the Golan Heights to Syria, which
lost the verdant high plateau in the 1967 Six-Day War. About 17,000
Israelis live on the Golan, beloved by residents for its wildness
and sweeping vistas.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Sharaa and their delegations began their journeys home
after substantive discussions on all the major issues that divide
them _ the border line, security arrangements on the Golan, water
rights, and the nature of peaceful relations.
</P>
<P>
   Both Barak and Sharaa will return with basically the same teams
of experts for the next round of talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people really talked about the substance of their
differences for the first time,'' Clinton said. ``They were very
open, they were very candid. . . .They broke a lot of ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The key difference in the upcoming round: Both sides will come
back toting a marked-up ``working document'' based on a draft
written by American diplomats that was handed to both sides on
Friday. US officials privately are calling it a
treaty-in-the-making, and State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
said the United States hopes it will form the basis of a ``core
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The document was given to Barak and Sharaa when US mediators
believed both sides were ``psychologically ready'' to advance the
talks, said a US official involved in the process, speaking on the
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's easy on either side,'' the US official
said. ``If they closed in a week, who would have thought they tried
hard enough for the best deal. It's like buying a piece of
furniture. You don't buy the first piece of furniture you see. They
are taking decisions that will affect multiple future generations,
so they better be sure about what they accept. . . I don't think
we've seen the bulk of the fighting yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Another new dynamic in the resumption of the talks Jan. 19 _ the
exact location hasn't been selected _ are the intriguing
possibilities of other Middle East peacemaking at the exact same
moment. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is due to see Clinton Jan.
20 at the White House, and Rubin said he would not rule out a
three-way meeting among Clinton, Arafat and Israel's Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and the Palestinians are in the midst of working out a
final agreement over the fate of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip,
home to more than 2 million Palestinians and about 150,000 Israeli
settlers. A tentative deadline for a framework deal had been set
for Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the United States was ready to juggle both peace talks,
Rubin called it a ``happy juggling act'' that presented both
``opportunities and challenges.'' Palestinian leaders have been
extremely nervous that their talks will be left behind, a worry
that surely will grow in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will continue to play an integral role in the
Israeli-Syrian talks, by Syrian demand. Syrian officials, who
generally believe that the United States has a bias toward Israel,
distrust the Israelis to such an extent that they want the
Americans to witness all aspects of a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, Rubin said, ``some new ideas have surfaced''
between the two sides. He declined to elaborate but said that the
border issue in particular had not been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   While arguably the most substantive and difficult negotiations
will be over the security arrangements on the Golan Heights _
including whether Israel will have complete access to intelligence
on Syrian military maneuvers, the number of Syrian and Israeli
troops close to the border, and whether US and other third-party
troops will act as peacemakers _ the most publicly sensitive issue
is likely to be over the border line.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's public position has been unwavering: it wants the border
to be what it was on June 4, 1967, the last day it controlled the
Golan Heights, all the way down to the edge of the Sea of Galilee.
But, noted several experts, Sharaa did not demand a return to the
June 4, 1967 lines in his long opening remarks at a White House
ceremony this past December.
</P>
<P>
   Israel greatly prefers a return to the border of 1923, drawn up
by British and French mapmakers, which gave an eastern buffer of
about 30 feet from the Sea of Galilee to what was then Palestine.
For Barak, this would not only represent a symbolic victory but
would also provide further protection for the important water
source.
</P>
<P>
   Robert H. Pelletreau, the former assistant secretary for Near
Eastern Affairs at the State Department and a participant in past
Israel-Syria talks, said that he believed the two sides had ``made
realistic progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Syrian President Hafez Assad's absence did not impede the talks,
Rubin said, adding that Sharaa seemed to have wide latitude to make
decisions, but ``anything decided in West Virginia has to go back
to Damascus, to Mr. Assad.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts believe the deal is much further along than is
publicly described. Geoffrey Aronson, director of the Foundation
for Middle East Peace, a Washington think tank, said the protracted
talks may be a way of winning public support in Israel, Syria _ and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to make it clear to the United States that this is
hard going, and this is the price they are going to have to pay,''
Aronson said.
</P>
<P>
   If it were too easy, the Americans probably wouldn't see the
point of paying a huge price.

COURT DEBATES SUIT THAT ACCUSES OFFICIALS OF GRUDGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Pa.)  (lb) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One proposition was undisputed in a case argued
before the Supreme Court on Monday: that people whose race or sex
makes them the targets of unfavorable official action can sue the
government for violating their constitutional right to equal
protection.
</P>
<P>
   But what about someone who is singled out not because of
membership in a particular group but because a government official
simply bears a personal grudge? As Justice Sandra Day O'Connor put
the question: ``Is there a lawsuit just because the mayor in his
heart of hearts hated the plaintiff?''
</P>
<P>
   The case grew out of an Illinois village's delay in connecting a
homeowner's property to the public water supply. But in legal
terms, the justices were being asked Monday to decide whether
someone can bring an equal-protection case as a ``class of one'' _
as the target of official ill will or vindictiveness, unrelated to
membership in a historically vulnerable group to which the court
has given special protection.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat surprisingly, in dozens of equal-protection decisions
over the decades, this is a question the Supreme Court has never
answered.
</P>
<P>
   The justices appeared almost to assume the answer was yes, but
with important qualifications, and it was there that a seemingly
simple case became complex. The justices were concerned at least as
much with how, assuming such a suit could be brought, a
municipality could defend itself.
</P>
<P>
   As Justice Anthony Kennedy put it to the homeowner's lawyer:
``What's bothering us, if we accept your theory, is that the tens
of thousands of zoning decisions, where local personalities are
involved, will always be followed by lawsuits, and the federal
courts will become the ultimate policemen of zoning disputes.''
</P>
<P>
   One possible defense that emerged from the argument was to grant
the government defendants a large benefit of the doubt: As long as
they might have had a rational basis for their actions, there would
be no constitutional violation even if a personal grudge might
really have been at the heart of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is that the motive need not be delved into if the
ultimate government purpose is legitimate,'' James DeAno, the
lawyer representing the village of Willowbrook, told the justices.
The ultimate question, he said, was ``Is there a conceivable
rational basis for what was done?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rational basis'' is a familiar concept in constitutional law;
under Supreme Court precedent, courts generally reject challenges
to economic regulations as long as the government had a rational
basis for its policy. But official actions singling out members of
protected groups are subject to higher levels of judicial scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of applying the rational-basis test in the case
Monday posed several theoretical problems for the court. ``So this
case is a tempest in a teapot?'' Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked
DeAno, adding: ``Yeah, we can have a `class of one,' but a court
can always dream up a rational basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens asked John Wimmer, the lawyer for the
homeowner, what should happen if a city conceded that
vindictiveness was the real motive but also asserted that its
lawyer had advised it that a rational basis was available that the
city could have claimed.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff should win such a case, Wimmer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration took a middle-ground position in the
case, Village of Willowbrook vs. Olech, No. 98-1288.
</P>
<P>
   Irving Gornstein, an assistant solicitor general, told the
justices that while courts should recognize an equal protection
suit on behalf of a class of one, the government should prevail as
long as it could show it had a ``conceivable rational basis.''
Gornstein said the equal-protection guarantee offered ``a baseline
protection only against those differences that lack any rational
basis.'' He added: ``You don't inquire into motive.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is an appeal by the village from a 1998 ruling by the
7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Chicago. That court, applying
one of its own precedents, held that a federal district judge was
wrong to have dismissed a suit against the village brought by Grace
Olech, a homeowner who had asked to have her property connected to
the public water supply.
</P>
<P>
   Olech alleged that because she had earlier angered village
officials by filing a lawsuit about flooding, she was singled out
for the demand that she grant the village an unusually large
easement for road construction before she could get her water.
After three months, the village backed down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The village does not deny that it has a legal obligation to
provide water to all its residents,'' Judge Richard Posner wrote in
the appeals court's opinion reinstating the lawsuit. He added: ``If
it refuses to perform this obligation for one of the residents, for
no reason other than a baseless hatred, then it denies that
resident the equal protection of the laws.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   These were among the other developments at the court Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Megan's Law
</P>
<P>
   The court turned down an appeal filed by Pennsylvania from a
ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that the procedure for
determining whether a convicted sex offender is a ``sexually
violent predator'' under the state's version of Megan's Law
violated the constitutional guarantee of due process of law. The
justices offered no comment in rejecting the state's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   While all 50 states have adopted laws, patterned after the
original 1994 law in New Jersey, to provide for continued
surveillance and community notification of the whereabouts of sex
offenders, the Pennsylvania law imposed an additional legal burden
on the offenders.
</P>
<P>
   The law contained a legal presumption that anyone convicted of a
variety of sex crimes, from misdemeanors to serious felonies, fit
the category of ``sexually violent predator'' and was therefore
subject to a maximum sentence of life in prison no matter what the
sentence for the actual offense. The defendant could rebut the
presumption by clear and convincing evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In striking down this provision in a ruling last June, the state
Supreme Court said it violated due process for the state to shift
the burden of proof from itself to the defendant. The case was
Pennsylvania vs. Williams, No. 99-709.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS Insurance Cap
</P>
<P>
   Also without comment, the court refused to hear an appeal
challenging an insurance company's imposition of a cap of lifetime
benefits for treatment of medical needs related to HIV or AIDS. The
lifetime maximum benefits under policies issued by Mutual of Omaha
are either $25,000 or $100,000, depending on the policy, compared
with maximums of $1 million or more for coverage of conditions not
related to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Two policyholders, both HIV-positive, challenged the benefit
caps as a violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   They won in a 1998 decision by the U.S. District Court in
Chicago that the 7th Circuit overturned last June. The appeals
court ruled that the disabilities act, which bars discrimination on
the basis of disability, guarantees access to insurance but does
not regulate the ``content'' of insurance policies. The appeal was
Doe vs. Mutual of Omaha, No. 99-772.

FIRM SAYS IT HAS UNRAVELED 90 PERCENT OF HUMAN GENOME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A biotech company said Monday it has decoded 90 percent of the
``Book of Life'' _ the DNA information inside human cells that
governs many traits and strongly influences health and illness.
</P>
<P>
   By later this year, the company said it will have deciphered
almost all the information, which is written in some 3 billion
``letters'' of chemical code and that make up the 80,000 different
genes estimated to exist in humans.
</P>
<P>
   The gene information, scientists say, will revolutionize
medicine by revealing the fundamental mechanisms of how the body
works and diseases develop. The earliest benefits could be new
drugs that will be tailored to fit the genetic profiles of
different individuals.
</P>
<P>
   In making the claim Monday, Celera, of Rockville, Md., appeared
to be declaring victory over a similar, publicly funded, project
that had promised it would have a 90 percent ``rough draft'' of the
human genome by spring.
</P>
<P>
   Celera scientists are aided by supercomputers and hundreds of
robotic machines that ``read'' the DNA messages by identifying the
sequence of their chemical letters. After decoding the DNA of the
fruit fly, they began human sequencing last September. Already,
said Celera president J. Craig Venter, ``we have discovered
thousands and thousands of new genes that are clearly going to be
important to the the pharmaceutical industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Celera, founded only 20 months ago, has challenged the public,
international Human Genome Project which was launched a decade ago
to first locate and map, and then sequence, the human genes.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, scientists at the National Center for Human Genome
Research _ the government body that leads the public genome effort
_ downplayed the milestone that Celera claimed. And the government
scientists emphasized that in contrast to Celera, which is
initially making its DNA sequence information accessible only to
paying subscribers, the government project immediately places its
new findings into a public database.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no suprise here,'' said Kathy Hudson, assistant
director of the national center. ``The public effort remains
committed to the values that had steadfastly motivated us _ to have
the sequence out in the public domain for everyone to use,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   The two rival efforts use different techniques. Celera's
strategy is a so-called ``shotgun'' approach. Scientists chop up
all the DNA into millions of short fragments that can be handled by
gene-reading machines. Once the sequence of each piece has been
deciphered by the machines, the fragments have to be put back
together in the correct order, using the power of supercomputers to
find which piece goes where.
</P>
<P>
   So far, said Venter, what Celera has is millions of DNA pieces
that have been sequenced, but not yet reassembled. But, he added,
that doesn't mean the functions of all the genes are unknown: many
of them have been identified by their similarity to known genes in
other animals, like fruit flies and roundworms.
</P>
<P>
   The public Human Genome Project uses a different approach, in
which pieces of DNA that already are mapped to known locations are
then sequenced, so it's not necessary to later assemble them.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which effort they're involved in, scientists agree
that the DNA information must be sequenced several times over to
eliminate mistakes that inevitably creep into reading millions of
chemical units _ represented by the letters, g,t,a and c _ that
make up the gene messages.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Lander, head of the government-funded genome center at the
Whitehead Institute and Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
Cambridge, Mass., said that although the Human Genome Project has
sequenced fewer genes _ about 50 percent of them compared to
Celera's estimated 97 percent _ it has read them more thoroughly.
The public effort has read out 11 billion letters compared to
Celera's 5.3 billion letters.
</P>
<P>
   The public genome scientists intend to read the DNA letters 10
times, which would mean deciphering a total of 30 billion, before
declaring they have the messages decoded accurately.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, said Lander, the Celera milestone ``is good progress along
the way. It's an incremental step'' toward the goal that won't be
reached by either group until about a year from now.

CLINTON PLANS CAMPAIGN TO PRESSURE CONGRESS FOR CHINA TRADE
ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton Monday promised an all-out
campaign to get Congress to back a landmark trade deal with China,
and administration officials have enlisted numerous corporate chief
executives for what they describe as the most aggressive pro-trade
lobbying effort since the United States opened its borders to free
trade with Canada and Mexico seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will pit the administration and its business allies
against a network of labor, environmental and consumer groups,
which oppose the new trade agreement with China and are eager to
test their strength after successfully mobilizing street
demonstrations that helped to scuttle world trade talks in Seattle
late last year.
</P>
<P>
   The vote concerns the November agreement between the United
States and China that paves the way for China to enter the World
Trade Organization. American companies will not benefit from the
deal, which slashes tariffs and clears barriers to freer trade in
agriculture and services, unless Congress grants China the same
access to the United States market that most other major trading
partners have, forgoing an annual review of that country's trade
status.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials say they are cautiously
optimistic that Congress will approve the terms of the deal. But
having been stung by surprise defeats on previous trade accords and
by the collapse of trade negotiations in Seattle, they are
promising a steady stream of pro-trade events, speeches by Clinton
and high-level administration attention until Congress votes on the
issue in the spring or summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be working hard over the coming weeks and coming months
to make sure we don't let this opportunity slip away,'' Clinton
said at a news conference to announce the members of an
administration team appointed to oversee the campaign. ``This is
something that is in the national interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton named William M. Daley, the commerce secretary, to lead
the effort, a signal to many in the business community that the
China trade deal has a higher political priority than some other
recent votes on trade. Daley led the successful effort to win
backing for the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993 and
1994, and is now seen as one of the few members of the
administration who can orchestrate a successful political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Daley will be working on the issue with Steve Ricchetti,
Clinton's deputy chief of staff, and they have already begun lining
up some top corporate leaders, including the top bosses at Boeing,
America Online and Intel, to become directly involved in selling
the benefits of the trade accord to Congress and the public. The
hope is that the lobbying campaign will have a high-technology
edge, with popular companies that are pillars of the new economy
supplementing stalwart trade supporters like Boeing and General
Electric.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies and farmers have much to gain from the
trade deal, which will, at least on paper, pry open parts of the
Chinese economy that Beijing has tended to shelter from foreign
competition. These include telecommunications, the Internet, and
grain and meat products, all which are particular areas of America
strength.
</P>
<P>
   But the vote is nonetheless seen as a close contest. Trade
divides Democrats like few political issues, pitting core labor and
environmental supporters against business support. The
administration fears that the Republicans, who control Congress,
will seek to delay the vote until the fall, when the election
season is at its peak, to make the vote as politically costly as
possible for their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In part for that reason, Clinton vowed Monday to put pressure on
Congress to bring the China trade accord to a vote before the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Labor groups, meanwhile, have vowed to see the China trade deal
defeated, with many expressing optimism that the momentum they
generated in Seattle will propel opposition to the China accord.
Unions say that Congress cannot treat China like any other big
trading partner because it treats its workers badly and regularly
violates trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will flood every congressional office with phone calls,
letters and visits,'' James P. Hoffa, president of the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said. ``We will do whatever
it takes. And with the momentum from Seattle, we will win.''

FORMER STATE PARTY CHIEF LIKES BRADLEY'S CHANCES AGAINST BUSH
</HEADLINE>
 (Resending to fix coding) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ The former executive director of the Texas Democratic
Party, writing in a confidential memo, suggests that Vice President
Al Gore would lose in a presidential race with Gov. George W. Bush
and could drag down state Democrats with him.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Cook wrote in a Jan. 7 memo to fellow Democratic leaders
that nominating former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley as the party's
presidential candidate is in ``the best interest'' of Texas
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the memo was obtained by the Star-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, now a private consultant and an unpaid Bradley volunteer,
warned that Gore has been so tainted by his association with
President Clinton that he ``probably cannot defeat Bush
nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   That could spell trouble for local Democrats because the Bush
campaign, assuming the governor wins the GOP nomination, ``will
attempt to smear the president all over (Gore), and in Texas those
efforts will be highly effective,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the worst case scenario (Gore's) candidacy could be
extremely harmful to down-ballot Democrats, perhaps even resulting
in a Republican majority in the state House, preventing a return to
a Democratic majority in the Senate and potential losses among
Congressional incumbents,'' Cook wrote.
</P>
<P>
   For Texas Democrats, he said Bradley would be a better nominee
because voters _ even those who like Bush _ ``would not carry with
them the depth of angry energy against the top Democrat on the
ballot as they would with Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokeswoman Kathleen Begala dismissed Cook's memo, noting
that he no longer works for the party. She also said Gore has
garnered the endorsement of Lady Bird Johnson and all but two of
the 17 Democratic members of the Texas congressional delegation,
among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has strong support in the state of Texas, I would say
strong support with elected officials and former elected officials,
because he's right on the issues'' Begala said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the state party, meanwhile, said either Gore or
Bradley could beat Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job at the party is to make sure Democrats get to know
both candidates. We don't get involved with Democratic primary
races, but we will support the nominee,'' said state party
spokesman Mike Hailey. ``We believe that both Democratic candidates
can beat Bush in the general election because they are the two best
candidates in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   While no Republican is expected to give Bush any trouble in the
Texas GOP presidential primary, the March 14 Democratic primary
could become a key battleground between Gore and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the hot races are expected to center on legislative
contests. Control of the House and Senate will be key in 2001, when
lawmakers are supposed to redraw the district boundary lines of
state and federal lawmakers based on the new Census.

 &HT;    NFL Playoff notebook
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey had an hour-long meeting with owner
Jerry Jones on Monday, but Gailey said the conversation focused on
personnel matters and his future with the team wasn't discussed.
</P>
<P>
   After the Cowboys lost to the Vikings 27-10 in Sunday's NFC
wild-card game, Gailey's job could be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, a native of Americus, Ga., has an 18-15 record in two
seasons in Dallas. His winning percentage of .563 is lower than his
predecessors, current Miami Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson (.672) and
Barry Switzer (.625).
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said he senses he could be fired because of what he's
read.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets asked the question and he doesn't deny it,'' Gailey
said. ``That's what I read in the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, an offensive coordinator with the Steelers before
replacing Switzer in February 1998, has three years left on his
contract. The Cowboys finished 8-9 this season and have lost both
of their playoff games under Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really have any different idea or better idea (of my
future) than before that meeting,'' Gailey said. ``I'm going to
work as hard as I can work today, and I'll work as hard as I can
work tomorrow. If Jerry decides to make a change, he decides to
make a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to discuss it any further,'' Gailey said. ``I'm
the wrong guy to talk to. I enjoy coaching football and I enjoy
coaching here. Let's leave it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Cowboys lost to Minnesota, Jones made it clear that he
is not going to tolerate what he witnessed this season: a losing
record and underachieving.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't operate this way,'' Jones said. ``We have to give
ourselves a better shot. I'm disappointed. Everybody's
disappointed. We had higher expectations than this. We had much
higher expectations this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much higher expectations,'' he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   After a four-year span in which Dallas won three Super Bowls,
the Cowboys have won one playoff game the past four years. They are
24-24 in the last three regular seasons.
</P>
<P>
   And the Cowboys face an uncertain future. Jones has more than
$65 million committed to 34 players next season. That's roughly $3
million over the salary cap and 19 players shy of a full roster.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Bowl cornerback Deion Sanders might be a salary-cap
casualty, because his contract can be voided to avoid a $12.7
million hit next season. Injured receiver Michael Irvin and
fullback Daryl Johnston probably won't be back, either.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the biggest question seems to be whether Gailey will
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reserve any comment on (Gailey's status) for later in the
week,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Levy itching for return?
</P>
<P>
   Former Bills coach Marv Levy, 74, caused quite a stir Monday in
Boston when he met with Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who's
searching for a head coach after firing Pete Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Levy, who led Buffalo to four Super Bowls in a row in the early
1990s, was consulting Kraft and not interviewing for the job, a
team official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a personal friendship, a relationship there and
Robert was consulting with Marv,'' Patriots spokesman Stacey James
said. ``I don't think (coaching) is Marv's interest.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the team's official web site, however, ``Levy
apparently contacted the Patriots about a job, but what that job
might be remains unclear.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy spent 11 seasons coaching the Bills and had a 113-71 record
before stepping down after a 6-10 season in 1996. He was succeeded
by Wade Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Levy was an analyst for Fox Sports Net's pregame
show ``NFL This Morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Jets assistant head coach/defensive coordinator Bill
Belichick remains the top candidate for the Patriots job. NFL
commissioner Paul Tagliabue could decide this week what
compensation, if any, the Patriots would have to give the Jets to
hire Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Patriots interviewed defensive coordinators
Marvin Lewis of Baltimore, Willie Shaw of Oakland and Steve Sidwell
of New England and offensive coordinator Gary Crowton of Chicago
for the coaching opening.
</P>
<P>
   Taking blame
</P>
<P>
   Give Bills special-teams coach Bruce DeHaven credit. He's a man
on the hot seat, but he isn't blaming his unit's failure on a
questionable instant-replay ruling.
</P>
<P>
   DeHaven's kickoff-coverage team allowed Titans receiver Kevin
Dyson to score on a 75-yard kickoff return with only three seconds
left in Saturday's AFC wild-card game at Adelphia Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Dyson scored after catching a cross-field lateral thrown by
tight end Frank Wycheck, giving the Titans an improbable 22-16
victory. Some Bills players claimed Wycheck's lateral was an
illegal forward pass, but DeHaven said his unit blew coverage on
the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of whether it's a backward pass or a forward pass,
you just can't allow that to ever happen in a situation like that
at the end of a ball game,'' DeHaven said. ``In the (players')
defense, the error they made was one of being too aggressive on the
play. We had talked at great lengths that it's a team that runs
gadget plays. We had talked during the week they possibly could run
a throwback.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, DeHaven's unit showed little discipline. The right side
of the coverage -- namely running back Jonathan Linton, cornerback
Donovan Greer and linebacker Joe Cummings -- broke toward the
middle of the field after Lorenzo Neal fielded the kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like it was almost the perfect kick,'' DeHaven said.
``We wanted to keep it out of the hands of their guys deep if we
could. You'd hope we'd cover it better in that situation.
</P>
<P>
   DeHaven didn't regret not kicking it deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you kick it deeper, then there's a better chance to run the
throwback and lateral,'' he said. ``But based on what happened, I
wished we would have kicked it deep, onside, out of bounds,
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Brunell vows to play
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell, who missed the final
regular-season game with a sprained left knee, vows to play in
Saturday's AFC divisional playoffs against the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to play,'' Brunell said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Brunell is recovering from a strained medial collateral ligament
he sustained during a 41-14 loss at Tennessee on Dec. 26. Brunell,
voted a backup in the Pro Bowl, threw during practice last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville coach Tom Coughlin said he was uncertain what
Brunell would do when the Jaguars return to practice today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark did well'' over the weekend, Coughlin said. ``But I can't
tell you he made any significant progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars, who will be without injured left tackle Tony
Boselli, said protecting their quarterback will be a key against
the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand we have to pick it up,'' said Ben Coleman, a
guard who will replace Boselli. ``We can't have any hits on him.
We've got to limit the pressure we know they're going to try to
bring.''
</P>
<P>
   Saints eyeing Casserly
</P>
<P>
   Charley Casserly, the ousted general manager who assembled the
Redskins, said he's been contacted by the New Orleans Saints.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have talked to them, and we're going to talk again in the
next couple of days,'' Casserly told The Times-Picayune newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly also has met with Bob McNair, owner of the expansion
Houston franchise, which will begin play in 2002. Casserly, pushed
out in Washington by new owner Daniel Snyder, said he hasn't spoken
with New England officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drop New England. I've never talked to them,'' Casserly said.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints are looking for a replacement for president-general
manager Bill Kuharich, who along with Mike Ditka and his entire
coaching staff, were fired last week after a 3-13 season.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, one of Casserly's last moves with the Redskins was
trading the fifth choice in last year's NFL draft to the Saints,
who gave up eight draft choices to select Heisman Trophy winner
Ricky Williams.

 &HT;    For Thrashers, wins hard to come by, but errors decreasing
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The NHL coach with the fewest wins, the most losses
and the worst defense has lost neither his mind nor his sense of
humor.
</P>
<P>
   Warnings helped. Friends told him to forget about that .625
minor-league winning percentage of his. New league. Better have a
new philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wanted to, I could find a reason to get mad every day,''
Thrashers coach Curt Fraser said Monday. ``But that's not the right
way to approach this. The right way is to become a person who can
fix things. I'm like a plumber coming to your house when the
problem is you have old pipes.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, as the Thrashers hit the midway point of the
season, Fraser has been exercised on occasion. He has engaged in
enough stick-slamming and creative-adjective placement in practice
for him to get his point across. The motivational speeches, the
teachings and general manager Don Waddell's frequent pipe
replacement have resulted in something that might be lost in a
10-26-4 record _ namely, progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all thought we'd have a lot more wins by now,'' team
captain Kelly Buchberger said. ``Nashville finished off their first
season with 28 wins. But we're getting more confident scoring goals
now, and we're having more guys contribute. When you have that, you
start winning more games. Obviously we can play better. But we made
a lot of mistakes early in the season that we've been correcting
for the last 10 games or so.''
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers play game No. 41 of 82 Wednesday night against
Washington. They have lost as many as seven in a row and won no
more than two.
</P>
<P>
   Their midseason grade is what should be expected: straight eh's.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell has churned through 38 players, including nine rookies.
Seven of them are still on the roster; one, Per Svartvadet, has
been reassigned to Orlando but is expected to return; and only one,
Eric Bertrand; has flopped. ``We're extremely happy with a lot of
the young guys,'' Waddell said. ``That's been the bright spot. We
thought some of them would take a lot longer to break in.''
</P>
<P>
   But Waddell also knew the team's success would be linked to
goaltending. That Scott Fankhouser ranks as the highlight speaks to
that problem. Damian Rhodes was the first player signed by Waddell
and the first reason to expect some success in the first year. But
the former Ottawa goalie was inconsistent in 13 starts, then
suffered an ankle sprain Nov. 17. He hasn't played since. The right
ankle has been placed in a cast, and the left knee has undergone
arthroscopic surgery. The latest prognosis has him back in a month.
</P>
<P>
   The team has used five goalies, including three rookies. Both of
the goalies suiting up these days are rookies _ Fankhouser, a free
agent from UMass-Lowell, and Norm Maracle. Fankhouser, expected to
spend the season in the minors, is the only one with a
goals-against average under three, 2.81, on a team with a
league-worst GAA of 3.61.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take a negative and turn it into a positive,''
Waddell said. ``If we were getting blown out every night, I'd be
concerned. Obviously, Rhodes getting hurt was not in the plan. When
he comes back, we'll re-evaluate the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Thrashers, as a whole, are far ahead of the
early weeks of the season. Giveaways, poor positioning and napping
on backdoor plays occur less often. Gord Murphy, after a slow
start, has become the team's steadiest defenseman. Darryl Shannon,
who has had ups and downs, is playing well now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe, hopefully, this means some of our veterans have settled
into their positions and getting accustomed to the amount of ice
time they're getting here,'' assistant coach Jay Leach said. ``It's
not easy when you ask a guy who's been playing five minutes to play
25.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the Thrashers continue to have their shortcomings.
They were shut out at Washington 3-0 Saturday, the seventh time
this season, and are averaging only 2.25 goals per game. The
positive is the strong play of several veterans in recent games.
Ray Ferraro, who had only two goals in his first 15 games, is
playing his best hockey of the season, and the ``thirtysomething
line'' of Ferraro (35), Mike Stapleton (33) and Denny Lambert (33)
has been the team's strongest of late.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Brunette,with team highs of 15 goals and 32 points, and
Dean Sylvester (10 goals in 24 games) have been the bargains of the
first half. Brunette was acquired from Nashville for a fifth-round
draft pick; Sylvester was a minor-league throw-in from Buffalo on
expansion draft day when the Thrashers agreed not to take a forward
off the Sabres' roster. Nelson Emerson (20 points) has played well
but missed nine games with a suspension, concussion and follow-up
headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Patrik Stefan, the poster boy of the future, has played to
mixed, but somewhat expected reviews. The talent is obvious, but
the 19-year-old is inconsistent in showing it. In the IHL and the
Czech Republic, the play came to him. In the NHL, he needs to jump
into the play, a slow lesson for skilled young forwards. Neither
Waddell nor Fraser is worried.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, Fraser has benched all but a few players, but he
didn't expect things to come easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``You grow some thick skin going through this,'' he said.
``Resilience is something all of us will have by the time it's
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Waddell said, ``It's not about wins and losses this season,''
but small steps. Fraser added, ``I've learned there are no
shortcuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchberger, who played on winning teams in Edmonton, considers
the biggest positive to be that, during the worst times, such as
the seven-game skid, ``Nobody was pointing fingers at each other.
That's a good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   About Fraser, Buchberger said, ``He's been real positive. If I
was the coach, I think I would've snapped already.''
</P>
<P>
   No significant locker-room explosions?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Buchberger said. ``We've all been waiting for it,
though.''

PROTESTING TRUCKERS CREATE A BIG TRAFFIC JAM IN FRANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Truck owners blockaded highways and border crossings
throughout France Monday, protesting the rising cost of gasoline
and the shorter work week the government has imposed on businesses
with more than 20 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The protest, which began early Monday morning, caused huge
traffic jams and left thousands of truckers from other European
countries fuming at the side of the road. In most places, the
French truck owners allowed private cars to cross their picket
lines, though the cars had to move slowly and in single file.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of a long-term strategy, an escalation of
protests that will continue until the government begins to listen
to us,'' said Guillemette de Fos, a spokeswoman for the
15,000-member truck owners' association. ``We are waiting for a
gesture from the government that they are willing to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   The truck owners maintain that the rising costs of gasoline and
labor have eaten away any hope of profit and left them unable to
compete with truckers from other European countries.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fos said 1,500 truck owners were participating in the
blockades using their rigs to block highway lanes and tunnels,
focusing on border crossings with Italy, Britain, Belgium,
Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   By early morning, traffic to Italy had been throttled, with more
than 430 trucks backed up at the Frejus Tunnel, near Nice. The
owners also prevented trucks from leaving ferries as they docked
from Britain at a number of ports, including Calais, Le Havre and
Cherbourg.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 trucks, mainly Dutch and Belgian, were held back at
the Belgian border, where the French owners argued with the foreign
truckers about the regulations under which the French truck owners
are forced to operate. At Rekkem, one truck owner, Henri-Paul
Meynard, said the Belgian drivers were having a good laugh at the
French owners' expense. ``Here they are working 60 hours a week and
we can't,'' Meynard said. ``Now, who is going to earn more money?''
</P>
<P>
   Reducing the French work week from 39 to 35 hours without
reducing pay has been the hallmark of Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin's Socialist-led government. The policy is based on the idea
that there is only so much work to go around and that therefore it
must be shared. It was designed to reduce France's stubborn two
digit unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
   But few experts believe that the shorter work week, which went
into effect for most businesses on Jan. 1, will create the hundreds
of thousands of jobs promised. In some areas of commerce, the
policy has been seen as successful by some simply because
negotiations to get to a 35-hour week forced the elimination of
antiquated work rules and created a more flexible work force.
</P>
<P>
   But it has also caused social unrest, with bosses and workers
alike protesting the changes. While Monday's protests were by truck
owners, the truck drivers are also unhappy. They intend to meet
Tuesday to decide if they, too, will go on strike.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers' union officials say their threat to protest is partly
to counter the owners' blockade, so that the government will not
give in to their demands. But it is also to protest the new
regulations, which they say already give truck owners a special
break that other businesses do not get.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new system, truckers can still be asked to work 39
hours before they get overtime rates of pay. ``Truckers are already
paid very badly,'' said Francois Doublet, the federal secretary of
the transportation branch of the CGT, one of the country's largest
unions. ``Why shouldn't they start getting overtime at 35 hours?''
</P>
<P>
   Talk of truckers striking has a tendency to strike fear into the
hearts of the French. ``Truckers: The Nightmare Returns,'' the
daily France Soir said in a headline Monday. In 1996, French
truckers, who are among Europe's most militant, paralyzed the
country for 12 days. The issue then was pay rates, and most of
their demands were eventually met.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the work week, the truck owners were also
protesting rising gasoline prices, which have climbed 30 percent in
France since last January because of rising crude oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   The blockades have already triggered protests from France's
neighbors. The European Union's executive arm, the European
Commission, formally asked the French government for a report on
the transport disruption. It also sought information on what
measures France is taking to ensure the free flow of goods around
the European Union countries.
</P>
<P>
   A commission spokesman, Jonathan Todd, said the commission did
not challenge the truckers' right to strike, but he said member
states must ensure the free movement of goods. France has two days
to reply.
</P>
<P>
   The French Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the
authorities were doing everything they could to ensure the free
flow of traffic and were keeping the commission informed.

FIRM SAYS IT HAS UNRAVELED 90 PERCENT OF HUMAN GENOME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A biotech company said Monday it has decoded 90 percent of the
``Book of Life'' _ the DNA information inside human cells that
governs many traits and strongly influences health and illness.
</P>
<P>
   By later this year, the company said it will have deciphered
almost all the information, which is written in some 3 billion
``letters'' of chemical code and that make up the 80,000 different
genes estimated to exist in humans.
</P>
<P>
   The gene information, scientists say, will revolutionize
medicine by revealing the fundamental mechanisms of how the body
works and diseases develop. The earliest benefits could be new
drugs that will be tailored to fit the genetic profiles of
different individuals.
</P>
<P>
   In making the claim Monday, Celera, of Rockville, Md., appeared
to be declaring victory over a similar, publicly funded, project
that had promised it would have a 90 percent ``rough draft'' of the
human genome by spring.
</P>
<P>
   Celera scientists are aided by supercomputers and hundreds of
robotic machines that ``read'' the DNA messages by identifying the
sequence of their chemical letters. After decoding the DNA of the
fruit fly, they began human sequencing last September. Already,
said Celera president J. Craig Venter, ``we have discovered
thousands and thousands of new genes that are clearly going to be
important to the the pharmaceutical industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Celera, founded only 20 months ago, has challenged the public,
international Human Genome Project which was launched a decade ago
to first locate and map, and then sequence, the human genes.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, scientists at the National Center for Human Genome
Research _ the government body that leads the public genome effort
_ downplayed the milestone that Celera claimed. And the government
scientists emphasized that in contrast to Celera, which is
initially making its DNA sequence information accessible only to
paying subscribers, the government project immediately places its
new findings into a public database.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no suprise here,'' said Kathy Hudson, assistant
director of the national center. ``The public effort remains
committed to the values that had steadfastly motivated us _ to have
the sequence out in the public domain for everyone to use,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   The two rival efforts use different techniques. Celera's
strategy is a so-called ``shotgun'' approach. Scientists chop up
all the DNA into millions of short fragments that can be handled by
gene-reading machines. Once the sequence of each piece has been
deciphered by the machines, the fragments have to be put back
together in the correct order, using the power of supercomputers to
find which piece goes where.
</P>
<P>
   So far, said Venter, what Celera has is millions of DNA pieces
that have been sequenced, but not yet reassembled. But, he added,
that doesn't mean the functions of all the genes are unknown: many
of them have been identified by their similarity to known genes in
other animals, like fruit flies and roundworms.
</P>
<P>
   The public Human Genome Project uses a different approach, in
which pieces of DNA that already are mapped to known locations are
then sequenced, so it's not necessary to later assemble them.
</P>
<P>
   No matter which effort they're involved in, scientists agree
that the DNA information must be sequenced several times over to
eliminate mistakes that inevitably creep into reading millions of
chemical units _ represented by the letters, g,t,a and c _ that
make up the gene messages.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Lander, head of the government-funded genome center at the
Whitehead Institute and Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
Cambridge, Mass., said that although the Human Genome Project has
sequenced fewer genes _ about 50 percent of them compared to
Celera's estimated 97 percent _ it has read them more thoroughly.
The public effort has read out 11 billion letters compared to
Celera's 5.3 billion letters.
</P>
<P>
   The public genome scientists intend to read the DNA letters 10
times, which would mean deciphering a total of 30 billion, before
declaring they have the messages decoded accurately.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, said Lander, the Celera milestone ``is good progress along
the way. It's an incremental step'' toward the goal that won't be
reached by either group until about a year from now.

FEW ANTITRUST RISKS SEEN IN AOL-TIME WARNER MARRIAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At first glance, America Online and Time Warner
seem to face no major problems from antitrust regulators as they
merge their giant companies.
</P>
<P>
   America Online offers its services over the Internet, while Time
Warner is a leading player in cable, film, and other media and
entertainment sectors. Because those services do not overlap, a
merged AOL-Time Warner would not gain a stranglehold in any one
market because of the deal, company officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But seen in another light, the merger could let regulators find
points to pick at. Television and the Internet are now converging
into a single market. Regulators could argue that America Online is
becoming somthing like a cable outlet itself, just as cable and
broadcast systems are trying to find ways to marry their services
to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And if television and the Internet are truly becoming one
market, the new AOL-Time Warner would have a commanding presence.
</P>
<P>
   Several government agencies have the opportunity to study the
merger and to try to alter its terms. They include the antitrust
divisions at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade
Commission, as well as the Federal Communications Commission and
possibly the local and state authorities that control cable
franchise licenses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Congress has held three hearings in recent months
on consolidation in the communications industry. Monday, Senator
Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a
Republican presidential candidate, said he would hold one more,
this one on the America Online deal.
</P>
<P>
   The scrutiny is sure to take in several unresolved issues in
public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Already, when Time Warner sells the HBO programs it owns to the
cable companies it owns, it must also sell those HBO programs to
competing cable systems. What happens when Time Warner sells its
CNN news service to America Online? Will it now be forced to sell
CNN to every other online company?
</P>
<P>
   Already, cable giants like Time Warner and AT&AMP;T are using their
cable lines to offer high-speed Internet service. If Time Warner
uses its cable lines to help America Online offer high-speed
service, must it also open its network to other companies who want
to do the same?
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade
Commission share responsiblity for reviewing mergers to see if they
violate antitrust law. The two agencies usually confer on each
merger and assign one of them to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Each agency has its special competence, but both can claim to
have the experience to review the America Online merger. The trade
commission reviewed Time Warner's acquisition of Ted Turner's cable
company, while Justice lawyers took charge when AOL acquired the
browser company Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   There was no word Monday on which agency would handle the AOL
merger. Nor would the FCC comment on whether it plans to review the
deal. The FCC would have the authority to act if Time Warner
transfers any of its many licenses to AOL, which cover such things
as its wireless phone services and its right to operate the
satellite uplinks by which Time Warner sends programming to its
cable operators.
</P>
<P>
   Local authorities could also cause problems for the merger. In
the process of acquiring cable properties, AT&AMP;T found itself under
orders from city officials in Portland, Ore., to open its cable
lines to Internet service providers owned by competing companies.
The issue is now in court.

 &HT;    NFL DRAFT: Weinke staying at Florida State
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Florida State football fans continued their national
championship celebration Monday. Quarterback Chris Weinke announced
he would return for his senior season with the Seminoles.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke was believed to be leaning toward the NFL after Florida
State went 12-0 and won the national title. The former professional
baseball player will turn 28 on July 31. He threw for 329 yards and
four touchdowns in the Seminoles' 46-29 win over Virginia Tech in
the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But in a news conference in Tallahassee, Weinke said he couldn't
pass up the opportunity to come back and attempt to lead the
Seminoles to another national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough decision, but now that it's made I couldn't be
happier,'' said Weinke, who threw for 3,103 yards and 25 touchdowns
this season. ``I will secure my future by coming back. I will get a
degree, which you can't ever take away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinke has a 21-1 record as Florida State's quarterback. Only
1993 Heisman Trophy winner Charlie Ward has won more games (22) for
the Seminoles.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke, from St. Paul, Minn., won the ACC's Brian Piccolo Award
last month after coming back from a potentially career-ending neck
injury in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee was not celebrating Monday, however, as All-America
guard Cosey Coleman of Atlanta became the fifth Tennessee player to
announce he would leave early to turn pro. The others are running
back Jamal Lewis of Atlanta, safety Deon Grant of Augusta,
linebacker Raynoch Thompson and defensive end Shaun Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee expects to lose eight to 10 players in the NFL draft
in April.
</P>
<P>
   As of the Monday deadline, 19 underclassmen had declared their
intentions to enter the draft. Florida is losing a pair of
receivers in Travis Taylor and Darrell Jackson, and Georgia Tech
receiver Dez White also is leaving. Headling the class will be Penn
State linebacker LaVar Arrington.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Michigan running back Anthony Thomas announced he
would return for his senior season with the Wolverines.

Warner, for $165 billion in what would be the biggest merger in
history and the best evidence yet that the new media and the mass

   BUSH-ROVE (Austin, Texas) _ On a wall of Karl Rove's office at
George W. Bush's campaign headquarters here hangs an editorial
cartoon from a local newspaper that pretty much says it all. The
multipanel strip shows Gov. Bush, a would-be president, and Hillary
Rodham Clinton, a would-be senator, squabbling over ownership of a
narrow political spotlight. Each stakes a claim. Each grows
petulant. Then Bush plays his trump card. He hollers for Rove.
Readers outside of Texas might not get the reference, but give it a
few months. If Bush lopes to the Republican nomination as
decisively as many of his advisers and supporters believe that he
can, Rove will be hailed well beyond this state's boundaries as a
political mastermind. By Frank Bruni.

Perhaps the only thing stranger than Steve Case, the chairman of an
Internet company perpetually thought to be doomed, assuming the
helm of the world's largest media conglomerate was that he wore a
suit to the press conference on Monday where he announced the
audacious merger plan. Case, 37, is known for clinging to his
casual costume of denim shirts and khakis even on the most formal
occasions, but if that changes when the merger of America Online
and Time Warner is completed, it may come as no surprise. Since
before the World Wide Web was invented, Case has survived the
quicksand of the Internet industry with a series of chameleon like
changes of which his deal with Time Warner is only the most recent.

marrying a traditional media conglomerate with an online service

triumph of the Internet as the irresistible force in business, not
just a fleeting enthusiasm on Wall Street and the obsession of the
nation's technology elite. The top executives of the two companies
presented the deal as a ``merger of equals'' on Monday. But it is

of the combined enterprise, though Time Warner will account for 80
percent of the revenues. Even the surviving stock symbol will be

former airport workers to college deans. Buoyed in part by the

UFO news, with documentaries on the main government television

HALFWAY, ORE., IS UNDECIDED: HALF FOR, HALF AGAINST BECOMING

<P>
   HALFWAY, Ore._ If the nation must have its first official
``dot-com'' city, Halfway hardly seems the obvious choice. Tucked
away in the shadow of the snowy Wallowa Mountains in eastern
Oregon's sagebrush country, hard by the Idaho border and just south
of Hells Canyon, the community is decidedly not an Internet
boomtown.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway's glory days from the gold-rush era are long past. The
logging industry is virtually shut down. The communities between
which it once served as a stagecoach stop, thus taking its name,
are hardly thriving either.
</P>
<P>
   ``One's a ghost town, and the other's underwater,'' said
Halfway's city planner, Patti Huff.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with some bewilderment that citizens of Halfway, a
pretty but economically challenged city of 362, greeted an
announcement recently that their City Council had abruptly agreed
to change the community's name for the year 2000 to half.com, after
an Internet start-up based in suburban Philadelphia. Half.com, the
company, sought the name change as a publicity gimmick on the eve
of launching its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   All hell broke loose when Halfway heard the news, and the city's
leaders quickly said final approval of the name change had been
incorrectly recorded in the minutes of their December meeting. But,
they said, the idea of becoming the first community anywhere with a
dot-com in its name was under serious discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the matter is the dominant topic of conversation, even
surpassing the 2 and a half feet of snow that fell in recent days,
covering Halfway in lustrous winter beauty. It has been the subject
of three raucous public meetings and is ``absolutely the most
controversial issue ever to hit this town,'' in the words of
Cynthia Valcarcel, a broker for Hells Canyon Realty. The City
Council is expected to vote later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Just what's in it for Halfway remains a bit murky. The company
says it will promote the town as a tourist destination on its Web
site, and it has offered several inducements, like computers for
the schools. Many people here insist the community should hold out
for _ what else? _ stock options.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the fracas has a humorous air, a bizarre meeting
of a proudly quirky mountain town straight out of ``Northern
Exposure'' with some young barons of the Internet age. It has a
bittersweet tinge, reminiscent of how the struggling Montana town
of Ismay, population 22, unofficially renamed itself ``Joe''
several years ago in a desperate bid to lure tourists to a place
that shared the name of a football superstar, Joe Montana.
</P>
<P>
   The basic idea is not unprecedented: after all, Hot Springs,
N.M., legally renamed itself Truth or Consequences, after the game
show, in 1950. The mayor of West Homestead, Pa., noting that sports
stadiums seem to be renamed left and right after corporate
sponsors, announced last year that his small town would rename
itself if a sponsor could be found to pay it $1 million (no takers
yet).
</P>
<P>
   So the upcoming vote here is a serious matter, generating
petitions and passionate opinions. It hardly seems an exaggeration
to declare that the people of Halfway are split, well, halfway on
what they should do.
</P>
<P>
   ``My great-great grandfather named this town, so if anyone
should be against it, I should be,'' said Lynne Melchior, the
bartender at Wild Bill's Saloon. ``But I'm not. I think it's great.
I think it's visionary, it's creative. It's just fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The opponents are no less animated. ``Personally, I don't want
to see the town of Halfway become half.com,'' said Bruce Honeyman,
a carpenter, virtually spitting out the dot-com. ``Everything in
the world seems to be going into Internet lingo. It's crazy and
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Bud Riggs, a retired installer of telephone equipment, said his
son, across the state in Portland, had called to rib him. ``He
says, `So Dad, I hear you're living in the nerd capital of the
world right now,''' Riggs recalled. ``Now he was only joking, but
still, it kind of bothered me a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   No one here seriously seems to think that adopting the name
half.com will turn Halfway into a mini-Silicon Valley, or bring a
wave of high-paying computer jobs to town.
</P>
<P>
   The precise benefits to Halfway remain under negotiation with
half.com's marketing director, Mark Hughes, who flew into Boise,
Idaho, and drove four hours over the mountains this week to work
out the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said his company was interested in wrapping up a deal
soon, to help promote the unveiling of a new form of
``person-to-person e-commerce'' on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a completely unique space,'' said Hughes, declining to
discuss the details. ``We think it will be the most exciting site
since eBay or Amazon.com.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a link to Halfway on its Web site, half.com has
offered other options, including half-price Internet access for
everyone in town with a computer, or maybe free access for everyone
for half a year, or a raffle at the annual rodeo and fair in which
the winner would get half of his or her mortgage paid off by the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Legally changing Halfway's name could take years and require
state approval, so, for now, the idea seems to be that the
community would do it by unofficial proclamation, putting the new
name, say, on signposts at the entrance to town or on the city's
letterhead. (The postmaster here, Lon Nadler, said he had gotten
two letters with half.com in the address, and he seemed unfazed:
``The correct zip code's the main thing,'' he said.)
</P>
<P>
   Halfway's mayor, Dick Crow, a retired fire management officer
for the Forest Service, said he was amazed at all the interest.
``When the Council met the other night, we had 50 people there,''
Crow said. ``Before that, you're lucky if one or two people show up
to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Crow is favorably inclined. ``If it helps the schools, if it
helps the city at all, it's a good thing,'' he said. ``We're in
dire need of snow removal equipment, as you can see. It might be an
opportunity to get kids to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the half.com name might generate jobs is clearly a
strong factor at work, if a somewhat vague one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just looking for small cottage industries,'' said Ms.
Huff, the city planner. ``If it's with computers, fine. Antiques.
Anything.''
</P>
<P>
   While many people here seem enthusiastic about the idea of
becoming half.com and amused by the attention, others are angry. At
least 40 people signed a letter to the Hells Canyon Journal
opposing the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Valcarcel, the real estate broker, still making up her mind,
said she thought that whatever happened, the debate had been a good
thing for Halfway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really got everybody talking, and thinking,'' she said.
``The question is, Where do we want to go? Or do we want to go
anyplace at all?''

GORE STILL UNDER FIRE FOR STANCE ON GAYS IN MILITARY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Al Gore sought to burnish his international
credentials Monday but was dogged by questions about how he would
implement his plan to allow gays to serve openly in the military.
</P>
<P>
   In a vice-presidential first, Gore represented the United States
at a U.N. Security Council meeting and led the opening of a
discussion on combating AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, a region
ravaged by the modern plague.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time of the mid-morning session at U.N. headquarters,
Gore already had to defend and refine his stance on homosexual
service members. Republicans appeared to wallop his pro-gay stance
in a television commercial, and it was the lead question in a
nationally televised interview.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said in a presidential campaign debate last week that he
would require prospective nominees for the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
the highest uniformed posts in the military, to agree with his view
that gay men and lesbians need not be closeted while serving in the
armed forces. When asked if that would be a litmus test for
appointees to top military posts, Gore said it would be.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later and under fire, Gore said the issue would not be
a litmus test, even though as commander in chief he would expect
military officers to follow his orders. The answer was similar to
that given initially in the debate by former Sen. Bill Bradley,
Gore's challenger for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was not raised in a crucial debate in Iowa on
Saturday, but if Gore thought the topic had faded, he was brought
up short early Monday in a show-opening appearance on NBC-TV's
``Today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would require, as would any commander in chief, that
military officers support the policies of the commander in chief
and the country,'' Gore said in response to an opening question
from host Katie Couric. ``And you know, one of the great things
about our nation is that that should go without saying because our
military has always done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he ``would never inquire into the personal political
views of an officer in the military, because following orders is a
point of honor in our military.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore denied he was setting up a litmus test.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference between asking for support of policies
that are set by our country ... and, on the other hand, asking in
advance for one's personal views. If that's what you mean by litmus
test, no, I would, of course, not do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore restated his intention to press ahead with his plan to
scrap the ``don't ask, don't tell'' plan that President Clinton
implemented after his own pledge to allow gays to serve openly
unraveled in the opening days of his administration. Gore indicated
that allowing gays to serve openly would be ``right at the top'' of
his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think the time has come to end the unfair discrimination
against these people who've been persecuted because they want to
serve our country,'' Gore said. ``And I think that a firmness and
determination to widen the circle of human dignity is called for.''
</P>
<P>
   Before 1997, homosexuals were barred by law from serving in the
military; and even though many persons did, it was grounds for
dishonorable discharge. In the 1992 campaign, Clinton said he
wanted to change that. But soon after taking office, he stepped
back from the pledge because of criticism and agreed to the policy
that says gays can serve and that they should not be asked about
nor discuss their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Gore reportedly opposed ``don't ask, don't tell'' at the time
and urged Clinton not to bow to the pressure, feeling it would be
an early sign of weakness, a point the vice president has never
publicly confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   By many accounts, the seven-year-old program has been a
shambles. Clinton has joined his wife, prospective Senate candidate
Hillary Rodham Clinton from New York, and Gore in calling for its
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ask, don't tell,'' however, has drawn support from the
two leading Republican presidential contenders, Texas Gov. George
W. Bush and Sen. John McCain of Arizona. McCain, a prisoner of war
from the Vietnam conflict, said Sunday that Gore and Bradley had
shown themselves ``not qualified'' to be president because they
want to allow gays to serve openly.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee ad says that neither Gulf War
commander Norman Schwarzkopf nor former Joint Chiefs chairman Colin
Powell could pass Gore's test.
</P>
<P>
   Gore met Monday with gay activists, in part to attempt to assure
them that he would not give in to pressure such as that faced by
Clinton, which is almost certain to arise if he is elected and
moves forward on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Gore headed back to Iowa late Monday for more campaigning in the
state where precinct caucuses Jan. 24 formally kick off the
presidential nominating season.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was clearly politicking during his visit to the United
Nations. He got to preside because the United States currently
holds the rotating presidency of the Security Council. The post
allowed U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan a stab at humor.
</P>
<P>
   Annan welcomed the vice president, ``or perhaps I should say Mr.
President ... '' (pause, applause) ``of the Security Council.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore took the bait gamely, commenting: ``I'm working on it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to any serious policy implications, the Clinton
administration's attention to AIDS in Africa is a ``two-fer'' with
two bedrock Democratic constituencies. It allows Gore to express
concern not only for Africa, an important issue to many black
Americans, but also for a disease that has stricken the nation's
gay community.

 &HT;    Multiple injuries worry Redskins
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Four teams made it through the NFL's wild-card round,
but two of them barely survived.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins and Titans go into this weekend's divisional
playoffs hurting and limping. Washington plays at Tampa Bay on
Saturday; Tennessee faces the Colts in Indianapolis on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Washington will be without left offensive tackle Andy Heck, who
has been ruled out with a torn left hamstring. Also, running back
Stephen Davis, the NFC's leading rusher, and center Corey Raymer
are doubtful after getting hurt Saturday in a 27-13 victory over
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very scary,'' Redskins coach Norv Turner said.
``We've been fortunate to go through the season with great
health.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who already had a sprained left ankle, sprained his right
knee against the Lions. The former Auburn star rushed for 119 yards
and two touchdowns before leaving in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Davis) certainly wants to play (against the Bucs),'' Turner
said. ``I'm an optimist and think he'll play and hope he'll play.
But medically, the problems have just been doubled. . . . He's got
two things he's got to come off of.''
</P>
<P>
   If Davis can't play, backup Skip Hicks, a second-year pro from
UCLA, would get most of the carries. Veteran Brian Mitchell also
would carry some of the load. Against the Lions, Hicks had 46 yards
on 23 carries; Mitchell had 55 yards on seven attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ankle is more sore than the knee,'' Davis said. ``But it's
fine. I'll be ready to go this week, hopefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymer pulled a rib muscle and will be re-evaluated today. If
Raymer can't play, second-year pro Mark Fischer, who never has
played in a regular-season game, would start at center.
</P>
<P>
   Heck's backup is fifth-year tackle Kipp Vickers, who started a
playoff game with Indianapolis four years ago. Vickers also started
six regular-season games for the Colts in 1996 but hasn't started
one since.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Redskins probably will have Pro Bowl guard Tre
Johnson, who inadvertently hit an official with his fist during a
third-quarter scuffle against the Lions. Johnson probably will be
fined $20,000 but is unlikely to be suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Titans could be without tight end Frank Wycheck,
whose cross-field lateral set up Kevin Dyson's 75-yard kickoff
return for the game-winning touchdown in Tennessee's 22-16 victory
over Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Wycheck sprained the medial collateral ligament in his left knee
and will be questionable for the Colts game. It's the same ligament
he sprained Oct. 31 in a victory over St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Titans coach Jeff Fisher said running back Eddie George suffered
a slight concussion and a strained neck and ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he'll bounce back,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, punter Craig Hentrich strained his neck when he made a
tackle on the final play of Saturday's game, a kickoff to the Bills
after Dyson's return.

<P>
   MOZDOK, Russia _ Russian forces battled Monday to restore
control behind their front lines after surprise attacks Sunday by
the rebels. The Russian defense minister also announced he was
lifting the suspension of air and artillery attacks on Grozny, the
Chechen capital, and resuming a full-scale offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There cannot be any talk about a cease-fire,'' Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev said. Russia also imposed an evening curfew
on the entire rebellious republic and announced that officials said
every male under the age of 65 traveling around Chechnya would be
stopped and questioned.
</P>
<P>
   The actions followed a rebel counteroffensive that apparently
threw the Russian forces offbalance and raised serious questions
about the Russian strategy in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Russian television reported that the Russian army's toll was 26
dead and 30 wounded, citing military spokesman for the Eastern
Group of Russian forces in Chechnya. That would be the highest
reported one-day loss in the three-month-old campaign in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures did not include the Interior Ministry troops,
which have had the main responsibility for finding and destroying
the rebels inside Grozny and other Chechen towns.
</P>
<P>
   The official military situation report, however, put the total
number of military and Interior Ministry losses at only six dead,
twelve wounded. Russian forces have generally understated Russian
casualties, and the toll may not be exhaustive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are losses among the Interior Ministry troops, and their
number is being determined,'' Acting President Vladimir Putin
acknowledged Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military officials insisted that as many as 100 rebels
had been killed, including senior rebel commanders. But there was
no way to verify these claims.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month it was the Russian forces that seemed to have
the initiative. They claimed to have to cornered the rebels in two
areas of the breakaway republic: the Chechen capital of Grozny and
the highlands to the south. They were talking boldly about wiping
out their adversary once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the rebels have demonstrated that virtually no part of
Chechnya is secure. The Russians are looking over their shoulder
behind their front lines, and the militants have fought to create a
corridor between their forces in the Caucasus Mountains and in
Grozny. Bad weather has also hobbled Russian aviation and
interfered with Russian artillery, temporarily eliminating an
important Russian advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Kazantsev, the commander of Russian forces in the North
Caucasus region, told reporters here that the rebel attacks were
intended to relieve the pressure on the militants fighting in
Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Assessing the rebel counterstroke, however, is not easy. Both
sides have exaggerated their prowess on the battlefield. Reporters
at the large military base here were not taken to Chechnya Monday
by Russian military officers who asserted that bad weather made
helicopters flights impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The ability of the rebels to threaten three major towns under
Russian control was all the more surprising since Russian
authorities had warned that the militants were preparing a
counterblow. For the past several days, situation reports issued by
the Russian command have cautioned that the rebels were preparing
to mount a guerrilla offensive behind Russian lines to coincide
with the end of Ramadan, the Muslim religious holiday, and would
try to capture Gudermes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their heightened vigilance, however, the Russians forces
appeared to have been caught flatfooted. In Argun, a city in
southern Chechnya that the Russians seized in early December,
rebels surrounded the office of the Russian military commandant.
Russian forces Monday fought to reclaim the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Argun, the bandits blocked the militia building and the
railroad station,'' Putin asserted Monday. ``Measures have been
taken, and the blockade of these places has been broken. Our
servicemen are out of danger.''
</P>
<P>
   In Shali, a town south of Grozny, the rebels infiltrated the
city and seized two schools. Russian forces fought Monday to evict
the militants and re-establish control.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gudermes, Chechnya's second-largest city, was not entirely
secure. The Russians have been thinking about making Gudermes the
administrative capital of the Russian-controlled areas of Chechnya
until Grozny's fate was decided.
</P>
<P>
   The city was also to serve as an example of how life could be
restored to normal under Russian rule. But on Sunday there was
fighting on the eastern outskirts of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Putting the best face on the situation, senior Russian offices
said the rebels had been routed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Groups of militants made attempts to seize administrative
buildings in Argun and Shali, but none have been captured by the
militants,'' said Maj. Gen. Vadim Timchenko, chief of the
operations department of the Russian forces in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to head off further attacks, the Russian military
reinforced units guarding the headquarters of Russian commandants
in Russian-controlled areas. But the situation remained tense, with
the Russian military warning that the militants were mining the
roads.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Grozny remained at a stalemate. Russian forces
announced last Friday that they were halting air and artillery
strikes against Grozny last Friday, describing the move as a
humanitarian gesture to allow the thousands of civilians to escape.
</P>
<P>
   The military has not said how many civilians may have left since
them. And the moratorium did not cover the Russian infantry, which
has been fighting within the city.

MERGER POSES SOME TOUGH QUESTIONS FOR SHAREHOLDERS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Time Inc. acquired Warner Communications 10 years ago, it
took seven years for shareholders in the combined company to see
any meaningful gain in their stock. Will shareholders in a merged
AOL Time Warner see better returns?
</P>
<P>
   News of the deal sent Time Warner shares soaring Monday morning
to a high of $102, a 58 percent gain from their closing price on
Friday. By the end of the day, the stock was trading at $90.0625.
AOL's shares rose to $80 early in the day but closed at $71.50,
down 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, Time Warner's stock remained 16 percent
below the roughly $110 value assigned to it by AOL's closing price
last Friday. This suggests that investors have some questions about
the deal's viability and that few expect another company to swoop
in with a counteroffer for Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   For shareholders, the decision about whether to sell comes down
to whether they are enamored of the Internet growth story or more
concerned with earnings.
</P>
<P>
   This being the Internet age, most analysts believe that the
benefits to shareholders in the combined company will be immediate
and that the deal will justify even higher valuations among already
manic Web stocks. ``Just as Home Box Office redefined the cable
industry and provided the catalyst that made cable companies go out
and offer new services, the combination of Time Warner and AOL
should act as a stimulus of the broadband adoption of Internet
experiences,'' said Christopher Dixon, new media analyst at Paine
Webber in New York. ``Should that take place, then all the business
models of Internet startups become accelerated. That results in
higher valuations as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   The widespread acceptance of this view explains why the Nasdaq
composite rose 167.05 points, or 4.3 percent, on Monday. Internet
stocks surged; Yahoo rose 7 percent, CMGI climbed 11.4 percent and
Doubleclick moved 5.6 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
   So, to Internet boosters, the merger of the nation's leading
Internet company with a top media concern, which will have a market
value of $350 billion, is epochal. It opens wide the door to the
Web; many more people will become users at a much faster rate than
had previously been estimated. And it places sky-high Internet
valuations on what had been an earth-bound media company.
</P>
<P>
   Stratospheric Internet valuations come with a cost, however.
These stocks trade with much greater swings than so-called old
economy shares. Before the announcement, Time Warner's shares had
roughly the same volatility as the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index.
AOL, by comparison, trades with almost twice as much volatility.
Time Warner shareholders can expect a wilder ride than they are
used to.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, each Time Warner share will be
exchanged for 1.5 shares of the combined company, while AOL
stockholders will receive one share. AOL shareholders will wind up
with 55 percent of the company, and the transaction will be free of
taxes to all shareholders. The deal is expected to close by the end
of the year; the stock in the combined company will be traded under
the symbol AOL on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Because the deal does not carry a set price for Time Warner
shares, investors who choose to hold on to the stock for the long
haul must not only believe in the Internet as a place to shop and
gather information, but also as a profitable business.
</P>
<P>
   Not every stock analyst is willing to go that far. Monday, some
recalled Time Inc.'s $14 billion acquisition a decade ago of Warner
Communications. In that deal, Time Inc. had to take on $11 billion
in debt. During that era, enormous debt loads were justified for
companies in search of growth through acquisition. But the Time
Warner merger turned out to be the final deal of the debt-crazed
1980s, and the combined company's stock suffered tremendously.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the deal springs from investor ardor for
Internet stocks, regardless of whether or not they are profitable.
Carol Levenson, a fixed-income analyst whose daily market letter,
``Gimme Credit,'' covers investment-grade bonds, said this of the
deal: ``What's most striking to me is neither company had much in
the way of old-fashioned profit and now will have even less, thanks
to an astonishing amount of goodwill.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the more spectacular figures ever to emerge from
a merger comes out of this one. The premium that AOL is paying Time
Warner shareholders over the value of the media company's assets _
an intangible asset known as goodwill in accounting parlance _
approaches $160 billion, according to Robert Willens, managing
director of tax and accounting at Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   As stocks have rocketed and mergers proliferated, the goodwill
resulting from high-priced acquisitions has grown. But $160 billion
in goodwill _ including such intangibles as a company's brand names
or the loyalty of its customers _ is so huge that it puts this deal
in a class by itself.
</P>
<P>
   According to generally accepted accounting principles, the
combined company will have to take a charge of nearly $2 a share
against earnings for each of the next 20 years to cover the
goodwill. Such a figure could easily consume both companies'
earnings; in the most recent 12 months, Time Warner and AOL
together made 52 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   But investors, instructed by Wall Street analysts to ignore such
amortization charges as irrelevant, seem unconcerned by the
prospect. In fact, some analysts say the deal is likely to become a
model for what a company with little in hard assets can pay to
acquire another company in a similar circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Time Warner's goodwill is a wasting asset,''
Willens said. ``You can justify ignoring goodwill amortization if
you acknowledge that Time Warner's goodwill is an appreciating
asset.'' Of course, the asset has to keep appreciating for
investors not to care that earnings are wiped out by goodwill
charges. Such appreciation is never guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the argument that investors should ignore goodwill may
lose some of its punch by the end of 2000, just about the time that
the Time Warner AOL deal is expected to close.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which oversees and
promulgates accounting guidelines, is expected to propose a new
standard that will require companies to be much more explicit in
assigning values to intangible assets. Jack Ciesielski, president
of R.G. Associates Inc. in Baltimore and editor of the Analyst's
Accounting Observer, said: ``If this deal doesn't get done until
late in the year, the companies may be falling under new rules
regarding intangible assets that might be harder for investors to
ignore.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a big chunk of that goodwill turns out to be the
value of film libraries or customer lists, things that produce
revenues, investors might find them hard to ignore. Anything that
generates revenues should have an associated expense, which gets
charged against earnings. And if earnings are reduced, the stock
could be assigned a lower valuation.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, earnings have never mattered much for Internet
stocks. Until they do, Time Warner shareholders may enjoy their
inclusion in this very exclusive club.

&HT;     MEXICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES FOCUS ON CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SUSANA HAYWARD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Amid accusations of oppression and promises to
battle corruption, the leading contenders for the Mexican
presidency moved earnestly Monday to woo voters before the July
election.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Labastida of the Institutional Revolutionary Party
(PRI), defined his campaign platform with a popular theme: his
government would not tolerate corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The not-so-novel proposal somehow came out sounding new because
he made the declaration to the national hierarchy of the PRI.
Several party leaders present have been involved in scandals and
inquiries involving corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Fox, the popular former businessman who is running under
the banner of the conservative National Action Party, or PAN, has
emerged as a victim of ``repression'' after an elections court
ruled he couldn't use his photograph in his party's logo.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the Federal Electoral Tribunal, responding to a
complaint by the PRI, said the image of Fox in the PAN logo
fomented the cult of personality.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the logo reappeared with Fox's image cut out.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, well-heeled protesters paraded at Mexico
City's international airport carrying signs in English and Spanish
denouncing the court's decision, which cannot be appealed.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters also gave out pamphlets to passengers in five
languages that read: ``Tell the world that repression begins. They
won't let candidate Vicente Fox use his photograph.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said the decision proved the PRI is running scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear evidence of the fear they have _ clear evidence
that we are ahead in the race for the presidency,'' said Fox, a
former Coca-Cola executive and governor of Guanajuato state who
stands the best chance of defeating Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has ruled Mexico for 70 years, and it is the only party
allowed to use the green, white and red colors of the Mexican flag
in its political logo _ a clear advantage over opponents who can't
use the flag colors in advertising of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not even the use of Fox's photograph would have been enough to
compensate for the advantage the PRI has,'' renowned political
commentator Sergio Sarmiento wrote in Monday's newspaper Reforma.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Fox can't use the photograph it is not understandable how
the PRI can use the national colors in its emblem,'' Sarmiento
said.
</P>
<P>
   After Labastida and Fox, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the center-left
Democratic Revolutionary Party is the strongest candidate for the
presidency, although he is running behind in some polls.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men will succeed President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has entered the campaign strengthened following its
first-ever-presidential primary in November, when Labastida, an
economist who has held several Cabinet posts, won in a landslide.
For some time now, the party has been trying to show a gentler face
to voters fed up with almost institutionalized corruption and fraud
that kept the party in power for most of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's demonstrate, with acts, that there is no room for
corruption in the new PRI that we are building,'' Labastida, 57,
told national PRI leaders last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corruption, in short, is one of the diseases that represent
the worst threat for modern societies and democracies,'' added
Labastida, who held the powerful post of secretary of the interior
before launching his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Erick Fernandez, a political scientist at the Universidad
Iberoamericana of Mexico City, said Labastida's statement put the
PRI on notice, but it remains to be seen whether the promise of a
new PRI goes beyond rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message defines the electoral agenda of Labastida, but on
the other hand it is a boomerang within the PRI,'' Fernandez said.
``Even though not everyone in the PRI is corrupt, many are, and it
puts them on notice. I doubt it, though, that Labastida can make
good on the promise.''

DEPUTY DEFENSE SECRETARY PLANS TO RESIGN ON MARCH 31 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Deputy Secretary of Defense John J. Hamre, who
oversaw the Pentagon's preparations for the Year 2000 computer
problem and was a significant voice for enhancing the military's
role in responding to terrorist attacks in America, is stepping
down, the Pentagon announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hamre, who arrived at the Pentagon with President Clinton's
first secretary of defense, Les Aspin, in 1993, plans to resign on
March 31 to become president of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a research organization in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced he would nominate Rudy De Leon, the
undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, to take over
the second-highest civilian defense position for what remains of
the president's term. Like Hamre, De Leon arrived at the Pentagon
in 1993 during Aspin's short tenure as secretary and stayed on
under two more secretaries.
</P>
<P>
   Hamre's departure was an early sign of what is likely to be a
string of departures from prominent positions in the administration
as the election and the end of Clinton's second term nears.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen selected Hamre as his deputy in
1997. Before that, Hamre served as comptroller for the Department
of Defense for four years. As deputy secretary, Hamre oversaw
budgeting and management issues. He also oversaw efforts to
increase security for military computers and to goad the Pentagon
bureaucracy to adopt more business-like practices in purchasing and
budgeting.
</P>
<P>
   Hamre's most prominent role was his advocacy for greater
military involvement in potential domestic threats. With analysts
warning that the United States could face a chemical or biological
attack at home, he pressed for the creation of a joint office in
Norfolk, Va., to coordinate the Pentagon's strategy for assuming
such a role.
</P>
<P>
   De Leon became undersecretary of defense in August 1997. He
previously served as undersecretary of the Air Force and before
that as a special assistant to Aspin.
</P>
<P>
   As undersecretary, De Leon has been involved in many of the most
controversial social issues facing the Pentagon, from the role of
women in combat to the dispute over the Navy's bombing range in
Puerto Rico. As Aspin's aide, he was a pivotal figure in forging
the compromise between the White House and the Pentagon that led to
the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy for gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
   De Leon's appointment is subject to confirmation by the Senate,
but it is not expected to face any significant obstacles.

REINSURANCE CONTROVERSY COULD HURT JOHN HANCOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. faces potential
losses of nearly $1 billion under a controversial insurance program
that has already caused damage at some insurers, threatened to hurt
others, and shaken the industry from London to Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   The insurer will probably wind up with smaller net losses,
perhaps totalling hundreds of millions of dollars, once lawsuits
involving the matter are untangled, industry players familiar with
the matter told The Boston Globe in interviews in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Settlements reached Monday among other insurers involved in the
same business that tripped up Hancock could help the Boston company
reach its own deals and reduce any losses.
</P>
<P>
   But for now Hancock faces gross exposure of up to $1.05 billion
on contracts whose holders are refusing to pay up, according to
Paine Webber analyst, Alice Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   A Hancock spokesman, Stephen Burgay, said that ``at the end of
the day, we don't expect that this will impair either our brand or
our strong capital position.'' He declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock's predicament comes at an inopportune time for the
company, which is scheduled to hold a $1.8 billion initial public
offering Jan. 27. While company executives, who are traversing the
globe promoting their IPO, have told institutional investors that
they cannot quantify potential losses, they have reportedly said
that any charges would be a one-time event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the type of thing (Hancock) can absorb,'' said one senior
industry analyst who declined to be identified. ``In our worst-case
scenario, it would probably wipe out a year's worth of earnings.
But we believe they can withstand it.'' Hancock's net gain from
operations in 1998 was $617 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock is in litigation and arbitration with insurers,
insurance brokers, and other intermediaries over its exposure.
Industry analysts said it was uncertain when any agreements might
be reached.
</P>
<P>
   The insurer's 3.3 million policyholders are not in danger, since
it has more than enough capital _ more than $5 billion _ to cover
any losses.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, who covers the insurance industry and has closely
studied the matter, put Hancock's exposure to disputed contracts in
the range of $650 million to $1.05 billion. ``Based on their
statutory filings, we believe that John Hancock's exposure, should
they not be able to collect, will be in the neighborhood of this
range,'' she said. Schroeder said she computed the figures from
statutory statements and premium schedules, among other documents.
Hancock's gross exposure was originally as high as $1.3 billion,
but Monday's settlements, while not involving Hancock directly,
reduced that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock's exposure to big potential losses stems from its
involvement in a complex, murky, ill-regulated corner of the
insurance world known as reinsurance. Putatively a means for
spreading around risk, reinsurance involves one insurer selling
part of a policy's liability to another insurer, who then does the
same thing with another insurer, and so on, until a convoluted
chain of ownership results.
</P>
<P>
   There are myriad ways to parcel out the liabilities in reinsured
policies, and the abstruse economics of the business are difficult
even for actuaries. In a risky dynamic known as a ``spiral,''
insurers who have sold off risk can end up buying back that same
risk further down the daisy chain. Spirals, in which Hancock found
itself, can become cesspools of losses.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Hancock's exposure stems from the company's involvement
in a gigantic, collapsed reinsurance pool run by Unicover Managers,
a South Plainfield, N.J. insurance brokerage that brought together
buyers and sellers of reinsurance in the $25 billion-a-year
workers' compensation market.
</P>
<P>
   The Unicover business, which Schroeder said eventually sucked up
15 percent of the workers' comp market, unraveled last February,
when one of the participants, Cologne Life Re, announced losses of
$275 million. (Germany-based Cologne is part of billionaire
investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.) Other principle
players in the Unicover pool _ Sun Life Assurance of Canada (which
owns Boston mutual fund giant MFS Investment Management) and
Phoenix Home Life _ also face losses.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock is one of a number of companies that reinsured Sun's and
Phoenix's Unicover work; Hancock in turn sought more reinsurance
for that business. The Boston firm said in a recent regulatory
filing that it had farmed out 95 percent of the reinsurance risk it
assumed and kept 5 percent of the premiums. But liabilities that
Hancock passed on to other insurers later spiraled back onto the
Boston company's books.
</P>
<P>
   Unicover was supposed to produce $600 million of business over
three years. Instead, it spun out of control, creating $8 billion
worth of business in four months in 1999, with claims far
outweighing premiums. In the Unicover pool and similar chains,
Hancock and others are declining to pay the insurers and brokers
above them because those below are refusing to pay them.
</P>
<P>
   The Unicover debacle has produced scores of lawsuits and
accusations of fraud and trickery, with insurers lined up against
each other and against brokers and Unicover. The fallout has also
contributed to limp stock prices at publicly traded insurers and
hobbled the workers' comp market's recovery. Schroeder and Gregory
Lapin, also of Paine Webber, wrote an analysis of the Unicover saga
last month.
</P>
<P>
   While Hancock is but one of many players in Unicover, the Boston
firm may face the most exposure after Reliance Group Holdings Inc,
a New York insurer. According to Paine Webber, Hancock is exposed
to more than half of what were originally nearly $2 billion in
losses for Unicover participants.
</P>
<P>
   Actual losses suffered by companies are likely to fall below
exposure levels. Many companies have already collected premiums;
brokers and intermediaries will likely be forced to return some of
their profits; and ongoing litigation will likely result in
settlements that will reduce amounts owed.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Reliance said it would pay $100 million to a group of
life insurers to avoid costly court battles over Unicover. As part
of the deal, Marsh &AMP; McLennan, the world's largest insurance broker
that also owns Boston fund firm Putnam Investments, agreed to
rebate Unicover-related fees.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Aon Corp, the world's second-largest insurance
broker, said Monday that losses from Unicover, for which it earned
fees and commissions as a broker, caused fourth-quarter profit to
plunge 91 percent. An Aon statement said Hancock and others ``faced
mounting losses on policies whose premiums they said were too small
to covered expected claims.''
</P>
<P>
   Hancock's exposure is unnerving to investors, who want clarity
about the insurer's position as it transforms itself from a mutual
firm owned by policyholders into a New York Stock Exchange-listed
company owned by shareholders. The reinsurance risks led two
ratings agencies to downgrade Hancock last fall. The insurer is
still highly rated by all four main agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the potential losses faced by Hancock comes from similar
business outside Unicover. Credit General, an Ohio insurer, is
suing Hancock in a Cleveland federal court over what it calls
Hancock's refusal to pay at least $8 million in claims. ``If we
exhibited the same behavior that John Hancock does towards its
reinsurers, the Departments of Insurance in every jurisdiction
would have a field day with us,'' said Ron Pipoly, a vice president
at PRS Group, Credit General's parent company. Hancock declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston insurer is battling the middleman that brokered the
Credit General business, London-based Stirling Cooke Brown, and has
claimed that the latter misrepresented the risks involved. Goldman
Sachs, the white-shoe investment bank, reportedly owns 25 percent
of Stirling Cooke, which owns part of a Bermuda intermediary that
is at the center of Hancock's woes. The intermediary, JEH Re, is
run by an English insurance broker, Reg Billyard, an avid skier who
frequents Chamonix. Billyard declined to return calls requesting
comment. Hancock's work with JEH Re expired last month, but Hancock
assumed responsibility for ongoing JEH business. Hancock is also in
arbitration or litigation with other insurers and intermediaries
over reinsurance contracts.

MARV LEVY, PATRIOTS OWNER CONFER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Longtime Bills and Chiefs head coach Marv Levy met with
Patriots owner Robert Kraft Monday, apparently to discuss some sort
of advisory role with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Levy, 74, retired from the Bills two years ago. The Patriots
wouldn't disclose why Levy was in town, but he and Kraft have
become good friends over the years through their interaction at
league meetings and at Bills-Patriots games. In Levy, Kraft would
have someone to advise him on football matters. Where this would
leave Bobby Grier, the Patriots' vice president of player
personnel, remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Levy, who ended his coaching career with a 113-71 record, has
been doing TV work for Fox Sports Net recently. The Harvard
graduate certainly wouldn't be averse to living in New England,
where he has lived before.
</P>
<P>
   However, if the Patriots are to hire Bill Belichick as coach and
general manager _ he will have his say before NFL commissioner Paul
Tagliabue Thursday about getting out of his Jets contract _ it
could affect a position Levy takes with New England.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists in Buffalo who covered Levy recalled that he didn't
have the best of relationships with Belichick when Belichick
coached the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   If Belichick is the Patriots' man, it could be that Levy would
work directly for Kraft, as the owner's eyes and ears in the
organization, with nothing to do with Belichick's running of the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Or it could be that Levy was just in for a chat. The Patriots
certainly weren't clarifying things Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft is due in New York Tuesday for Finance Committee business.
</P>
<P>
   A Jets official, meanwhile, confirmed a WBZ-TV report that the
Jets have phone records that could indicate possible tampering by
the Patriots with regard to Belichick, but he added, ``It won't
come to that.'' The inference was that the sides would hash out
compensation that would free Belichick to come to New England.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots assistant coaches, who are in limbo until the new
head coach is hired, were making preparations to head to Mobile,
Ala., for the Senior Bowl. That is usually where assistants begin
talking to head coaches about jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Only defensive coordinator Steve Sidwell has been interviewed
in-house by the Patriots, with Ray Hamilton waiting in the wings.
The Patriots also have interviewed Chicago offensive coordinator
Gary Crowton, and defensive coordinators Willie Shaw (Oakland) and
Marvin Lewis (Baltimore). Former Chiefs coach Marty Schottenheimer
told ESPN.com Monday that he has not been approached by any NFL
team but has heard through third parties about interest in him.
However, he added that he was happy at ESPN and not interested in
coaching in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers are said to be leaning toward University of Miami
coach Butch Davis, but there are reports that they may be able to
extract Steve Mariucci from his 49ers contract. If so, he would be
their top choice. They also plan on interviewing Wisconsin's Barry
Alvarez, but he may not want to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Sidwell is on the Packers' list; he was briefly a Green Bay
linebackers coach in 1995 after being fired by the Saints. A few
weeks after being hired, Sidwell left to become the Houston Oilers'
defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft also was trying to get square with Pete Carroll's payoff
Monday. Carroll is owed two years of pay, but if he takes another
job _ be it as a defensive coordinator or a head coach _ Kraft
would be off the hook for part of the money.
</P>
<P>
   In other Patriots news, left tackle Bruce Armstrong is scheduled
to have surgery Tuesday at Massachusetts General Hospital to repair
a torn ACL in his left knee. Armstrong was told by team doctors
that he could put the surgery off until after the Pro Bowl _ he was
a first alternate _ and still recover in time for training camp.
But Armstrong, wanting to start rehab as soon as possible, elected
to skip what would have been his seventh Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for Armstrong to hurry back is that training camp
could start as soon as July 17 because the Patriots will play in
the Hall of Fame Game at the end of July.

JUSTICES UPHOLD SOUTH CAROLINA ORDER BARRING PROTESTS NEAR ABORTION
CLINICS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Over the strong objections of two justices, the
Supreme Court on Monday let stand a judge's order barring abortion
opponents in South Carolina from protesting near medical clinics,
doctors or patients.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, exalting the
free-speech rights of peaceful protesters, equated abortion
protests to the civil disobedience of Southern blacks in the 1960s.
But the justices' fervent defense of the constitutionality of
protest failed to sway at least two of their colleagues to hear the
appeal brought by a pastor and his anti-abortion group.
</P>
<P>
   Under Supreme Court rules, at least four of the nine justices
must agree to hear a case before the court will consider an appeal.
The high court did not disclose whether any other justice joined
Scalia and Thomas in voting to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's refusal to wade into the abortion issue in
South Carolina sets no nationwide precedent.
</P>
<P>
   In the South Carolina case, abortion protester Michael Cloer and
his group Pastors for Life appealed a state trial judge's order
that barred them from trespassing on Palmetto State Medical Center
property or interfering with people entering or leaving the
facility. The order, which the state Supreme Court upheld, also
prohibits protesters from blocking traffic outside the clinic,
approaching any doctor who works at the facility, protesting within
12 feet of the center's driveway or making noise that can be heard
inside the Greenville, S.C., building.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia and Thomas, in their unsuccessful argument to their
colleagues, said the judge's ``unconstitutionally broad'' order
interferes with abortion opponents' First Amendment right to speak
out against legal practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This extraordinary application of state ... law to attempts to
persuade persons not to patronize certain businesses would outlaw
many activities long thought to be protected by the First Amendment
_ routine picketing by striking unions, for example, and the
civil-rights boycotts directed against businesses with segregated
lunch counters in the 1960s,'' Scalia wrote in a statement that
Thomas joined.
</P>
<P>
   Though they rejected the South Carolina protesters' appeal, the
justices are expected to rule by July on the constitutionality of a
Colorado law that requires abortion opponents in that state to be
at least 100 feet from a medical facility when trying to convince
pregnant women to forgo the controversial procedure. The Colorado
Supreme Court has upheld the law as legitimately protecting the
constitutional right of women to terminate their pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in that case next
week.

IN IOWA, BRADLEY ATTACKS GORE ON EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARROLL, Iowa _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley opened a new line of
attack Monday against Vice President Al Gore, asserting that Gore
had misplaced his priorities by proposing to increase military
spending by a larger amount than education spending.
</P>
<P>
   On the second of a two-day bus tour through western Iowa,
Bradley used events before students and teachers to promote his
proposals for expanding preschool programs, helping schools hire
60,000 new teachers a year and improving community colleges. Gore,
his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, has placed
education at the heart of his campaign and has repeatedly
criticized Bradley for not highlighting the issue more.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, Bradley issued a statement criticizing Gore for
proposing to increase military spending over the coming decade by
$12 billion more than he would increase funding for education _
$127 billion compared with $115 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cold War is over, and a new century has started,'' Bradley
said. ``We should place more emphasis on the challenges of the
future than on the conflicts of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposed increases for military spending are largely for
higher salaries for military personnel. Bradley has said he would
hold the defense budget level.
</P>
<P>
   In his attack Monday, Bradley seemed to be trying to court two
important groups of voters for the Jan. 24 Iowa caucuses: peace
activists and parents.
</P>
<P>
   Many Iowa Democrats support holding down military spending, in
part because there is a strong nuclear disarmament movement in the
state and in part because the state receives little money from the
Pentagon budget.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's aides also think it is essential for him to attract
parents and other younger voters in Iowa, because they expect
senior citizens to vote heavily for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gore called Bradley's education plan incomplete and
said the vice president would spend more on education over the
coming decade than Bradley would _ $115 billion compared with $90
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is the only presidential candidate to put forth a
comprehensive education plan that would be the largest increase in
education spending since the GI Bill,'' said Chris Lehane,
spokesman for the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is considered the heavy favorite in Iowa. Both sides say
Bradley needs to do well here to build momentum going into New
Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary a week later.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's efforts Monday to portray Gore as a politician with no
vision for the future echoed a line he used, with little apparent
success, during a debate with the vice president on Saturday in Des
Moines.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Gore attaked Bradley for having voted against a bill in
1993 that would have provided funds to help farmers after
devastating floods.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley says the bill contained wasteful spending for things
other than flood relief. But during the debate, Bradley sidestepped
the question by saying: ``This is not about the past. This is about
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Iowa voters seemed to have considered that a dodge, and
Bradley spent much of the first day of his bus tour touting his
proposals for helping small farmers, as well as criticizing the
Clinton administration for not having done enough to help them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gore has made education a major part of his platform and has
argued that Bradley has offered only incremental ideas on improving
education.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Bradley has begun talking more about education. And
on Monday, despite having said previously that he dislikes using
people as campaign props, he held two events before large groups of
students, few of whom were old enough to vote.
</P>
<P>
   At times the effort seemed to fall flat, as Bradley struggled to
explain his plan for universal health care to a group of elementary
students in the town of Exira.
</P>
<P>
   He also seemed to lose some of those children when he told a
parable about a student's efforts to trick a wise hermit. In the
story, a student holds a bird in his hand and asks the hermit
whether it is alive or dead. If the hermit answered ``alive,'' the
student planned to crush the bird to death; if he said ``dead,''
the student would release it alive.
</P>
<P>
   But the hermit outfoxes the youth by simply saying, ``As you
will.'' Bradley said the story was about the importance of
respecting teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Later, during a question and answer session, a second-grader
named Casey Simpson asked Bradley, ``Are you going to finish the
hermit story?''

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ On a wall of Karl Rove's office at George W.
Bush's campaign headquarters hangs an editorial cartoon from a
local newspaper that pretty much says it all.
</P>
<P>
   The multipanel strip shows Bush, a would-be president, and
Hillary Rodham Clinton, a would-be senator, squabbling over
ownership of a narrow political spotlight. Each stakes a claim.
Each grows petulant. Then Bush plays his trump card.
</P>
<P>
   He hollers for Rove.
</P>
<P>
   Readers outside Texas might not understand the reference, but in
a few months they probably will. If Bush lopes to the Republican
nomination as decisively as many of his advisers and supporters
believe he can, Rove will be hailed well beyond this state's
boundaries as a political mastermind.
</P>
<P>
   And if Bush limps or stumbles? That is not a possibility Rove is
willing to entertain, and the business of creating ample insurance
against it is what keeps a cell phone affixed to his ear, campaign
aides lined up patiently at his office door and a sometimes frantic
edge in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never worked so hard in my life,'' he said recently
during a rare quiet moment.
</P>
<P>
   Rove, a longtime political operative in Texas, where many
Republicans attribute their current domination of the political
scene to his influence, is Bush's chief strategist. And while he
officially has no more power or influence than Bush's other top
advisers, campaign aides say Rove is first among equals. Bush
readily tagged him as the sire of the campaign's shape, pacing and
densely staffed organizations in states with early primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karl gets credit for being the architect of it,'' Bush said in
an interview, ``and he should.''
</P>
<P>
   But, tellingly, Bush lavished more effusive praise on Rove for
something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I like most about Karl is that he cares about me as
a person,'' Bush said. ``He's got a single agenda when it comes to
my campaigns, and that's me.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Rove, who sold an extremely profitable consulting
business, at Bush's request, typifies the devotion that Bush
expects and receives from his closest advisers.
</P>
<P>
   The three at the heart of the operation _ Rove; Joe Allbaugh,
the campaign manager, and Karen Hughes, the communications director
_ have all worked with Bush in Texas since his first, successful
race for governor in 1994, and they are known around the state as
the ``iron triangle'' for their proximity to, and protectiveness
of, Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Allbaugh, with his beefy build and Marine-style buzz cut,
disciplines Bush's staff and watches over the purse strings with a
drill sergeant's intensity. Ms. Hughes, her eyes ablaze with true
belief, hangs on Bush's words, and she laughs the loudest whenever
he cracks a joke.
</P>
<P>
   And Rove, well, he has his fingers in everything, and everything
has his fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   This tight-lipped, tightly bound trio and the ethos of loyalty
they represent have helped the Bush campaign roar down the tracks
without many of the leaks, internal dissents, power grabs and
preening that frequently derail candidacies.
</P>
<P>
   But none of them has ever attempted anything so big before, and
their profound, palpable affection for Bush raises questions about
whether they see him clearly and dispassionately enough to
recognize problems before they become crises or to give him the
advice he needs for a contest with dramatically raised stakes.
</P>
<P>
   For example, political consultants in Texas said that Bush's
cautious adherence to scripted remarks all last year _ and his
seeming avoidance of some controversial issues _ were telltale
attributes of a Rove-counseled candidacy and holdovers from Bush's
campaigns for governor.
</P>
<P>
   But while those designs helped him in his statewide races, they
did him little good in his early debates, as he stumbled over
questions about the books he had read or the nation's relationship
to China. Before long, some Republican officials were questioning
his abilities as a candidate and Bush himself was battling an image
as an intellectual lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything is Karl's trademark, it's message discipline, and
he gets everybody sharing that discipline,'' said Chuck McDonald, a
Democratic consultant in Austin who worked for Gov. Ann Richards
when she lost her 1994 re-election bid to Bush. ``They're going to
do things the way they laid out their game plan, and that's not
going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a presidential campaign, McDonald added, ``It seems to me
that you have to throw some passes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove and other aides also watched Bush's lead in New Hampshire
evaporate as they paid less attention to the state than did his
chief Republican rival, Sen. John McCain of Arizona. Rove said that
it was not purely a matter of choice, because Bush's status as the
front-runner compelled him to campaign everywhere, while McCain
could pick and choose.
</P>
<P>
   But even some Bush supporters in New Hampshire charged Rove and
others with overconfidence, and Bush is now in New Hampshire more
often than before.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Rove has seemingly made few mistakes. McDonald and
other consultants noted that when Rove set up shop in Austin two
decades ago, Democrats held the lion's share of statewide offices.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Republicans do, ``and they're all Karl's candidates,''
McDonald said, adding: ``I admire him, because it's awfully lonely
to be a Republican consultant when there are no Republican
officeholders. That's how it started for him, and that's how it is
for Democratic consultants now.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove's ties to the Bush family go back even further. In the
early 1970s, when Rove was a student active with the College
Republicans, he became friendly with another rising political
operative, Lee Atwater, who went on to serve as the principal
strategist for the successful 1988 presidential bid of Bush's
father.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Atwater was the southern coordinator for Rove's
campaign for chairman of the College Republicans in 1973. Rove won.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Rove came under investigation by the National Republican
Committee after accusations that he had been supervising seminars
for college students on how to use ``dirty tricks'' in campaigns.
After the committee exonerated him, its chairman at the time,
Bush's father, gave Rove a job as his special assistant.
</P>
<P>
   It was around that time that Rove met George W. Bush, who swept
into Washington on a break from business school at Harvard
University. Rove was entrusted with giving Bush the keys to the
family car.
</P>
<P>
   Of that first encounter with Bush, Rove said that he recalled
``huge amounts of charisma, swagger, cowboy boots, flight jacket,
wonderful smile, just charisma _ you know, wow.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rove talks about Bush, he radiates a regard for him that
goes beyond professional obligation or selfish investment in Bush's
fortune. It is more like a crush, both platonic and political, and
it underscores the oddness of this particular couple: the pale,
intense, bookish Rove and the ruddy, easygoing, folksy Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '94, I couldn't believe how good a candidate he was,'' Rove
said. ``Then, once he got into office, it just blew my mind.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That mind, by all accounts and evidence, is a staggeringly
active one, stoked constantly by the thousands of thick volumes of
prose (almost all of it nonfiction) that he owns. These books are
carefully organized in his home study: political philosophy in one
section, the musings of Thomas Jefferson in another, the collected
works of Winston Churchill nearby. The walls around them are
adorned with vintage photographs and portraits of American
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Rove is so interested in history that he literally lives in it,
although that was not easy to arrange: He and his second wife,
Darby, a graphic artist, found the late 19th-century Texas
farmhouse of their dreams on a rural road far from Austin and had
it split into three pieces so that it could be moved 100 miles and
reassembled on a hill outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   Rove, 49, grew up in various states along the Rocky Mountains,
where his father's career as a geologist took the family. He
attended the University of Utah and George Mason University in
Virginia, but never received a college degree; he said he was too
distracted by, and preoccupied with, the political work he was
doing on the side.
</P>
<P>
   One summer, in an early indication of his killer instincts, Rove
got hold of some stationery with a Democratic candidate's
letterhead on it, forged an invitation promising ``free food, girls
and a good time'' at the candidate's headquarters and distributed
hundreds of the invitations to poor and homeless people.
</P>
<P>
   Rove said that such mischief is behind him, but some political
peers said that a ruthless competitive spirit is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who gets in the way of his ambitions for the governor
gets run off,'' said Tom Pauken, a former chairman of the
Republican Party in Texas. ``And if you're not with Karl 100
percent, you're an enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald put it more diplomatically. ``Karl plays as fair as
anybody else in politics,'' he said, ``but he plays for keeps. I
always knew where I stood with Karl. I knew he was trying to kill
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove's peers say that he is a master at creating a sense of
momentum, and they credit him with orchestrating the thick parade
of Republican luminaries to the governor's mansion in Austin and
the seemingly endless rollout of endorsements while Bush stayed off
the campaign trail last winter and spring, creating a keen sense of
anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, some of it was Bush's salesmanship,'' said Charles
Black, a Republican strategist in Washington. But, Black said,
``Karl's ability to use Austin as a base and organize the country
from there was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove has overseen the Bush campaign's effort in every
early-primary state to identify _ by phone, home visits and other
means _ potential supporters of Bush, and to try to ascertain that
Bush has the necessary votes to win.
</P>
<P>
   That is a vestige of Rove's extensive, earlier work in
direct-mail consulting. It is also where a good chunk of Bush's
financial war chest has gone, and it could ultimately prove more
critical to victory than the dazzling aspects of campaigning that
attract public notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karl's a meticulous planner,'' said Stuart Stevens, one of the
Bush campaign's principal media advisers. Stevens remembered
watching Rove, in a coffeehouse in Austin in April, map out the
Bush effort for the rest of the year on the only kind of paper
within reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five napkins later, you had the structure of an entire
presidential campaign,'' Stevens said. ``Then Karl just left. I
went back to get the napkins.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove has put boundless energy and thought into Bush's political
ascent _ at Rove's consulting firm there was always a special, red
phone for Bush's incoming calls _ and he has sacrificed for it.
</P>
<P>
   He once had a lucrative consulting contract with the tobacco
industry, but he gave it up when it became an embarrassing
political situation for the Texas governor. He was once his own
boss, with his own eponymous business, but no more.
</P>
<P>
   And after a few episodes in which he seemed to upstage and upset
Bush, he learned to bury his ego, to belittle his own
contributions. Much as Ms. Hughes kept her name off the cover of
the autobiography of Bush that she wrote, Rove spent considerable
time during interviews deferring to Bush as the real political
genius, the leader whose insights are the most vital, whose
interests can never be promoted too zealously.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my friend,'' Rove said. ``He's my friend, and I love
him.''

SBC SEEKS FCC APPROVAL FOR LONG-DISTANCE SERVICE IN TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trying to follow Bell Atlantic's trailblazing path into the
long-distance communications market, SBC Communications Inc., the
largest local phone company, asked federal regulators Monday for
permission to sell long-distance services in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   SBC's application with the Federal Communications Commission
will probably not be resolved until April, but many communications
analysts say the petition stands an excellent chance of being
approved. Approval would make SBC, which does business in Texas as
Southwestern Bell, the second Bell company allowed into the $80
billion long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic won the first such approval, for New York state,
last month and began selling bundles of local and long-distance
phone service to its New York customers last week. Both Bell
Atlantic and SBC hope to win millions of customers from
long-distance giants like AT&AMP;T by offering competitive rate plans
that do not include fixed monthly fees.
</P>
<P>
   As the Bells slowly push into the long-distance market, they
also appear to be stampeding the likes of AT&AMP;T and MCI WorldCom
Inc. to expand their local phone offerings, providing more options
for consumers. For instance, it was not until Bell Atlantic's
long-distance application for New York appeared close to approval
last fall that AT&AMP;T started marketing its own local service broadly
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Bell companies were forbidden to sell long-distance services
after they were spun off from the American Telephone and Telegraph
Co. under court supervision in 1984. The Telecommunications Act of
1996 said the Bells would be allowed into the long-distance arena
state by state but only after convincing the FCC that they had
opened their local networks to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   That is the task now before SBC. The last time SBC asked the
commission for long-distance approval _ in Oklahoma in 1997 _ the
petition was dismissed practically out of hand, as were three
subsequent applications by BellSouth Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But the stances of SBC and the other Bells have changed over the
last year. Rather than filing serial long-distance applications
that are broadly considered deficient, as they did, the Bells now
appear to be devoting serious time and money to opening their
networks. As part of their new strategy, the Bells appear to be
holding off on filing applications until they appear to have a more
realistic chance of success.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Texas regulators who have already approved SBC's
long-distance aspirations are not generally considered pushovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is surprising is how strong this Texas application is,''
said Scott Cleland, a communications policy analyst in Washington
for the Legg Mason Precursor Group. ``It's very comparable to the
Bell Atlantic New York application.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, SBC held out its application as even stronger
than Bell Atlantic's, implying that the company has done more to
open its systems than Bell Atlantic has in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas is actually a more competitive market than New York,''
Edward E. Whitacre Jr., SBC's chairman, said in a statement. Using
telecommunications shorthand for an alternate local phone provider
_ competitive local phone providers _ he added, ``There are more
competitors in Texas, and more Texans get their local service from
a CLEC than do New Yorkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Whitacre's point of view is embraced by the FCC, both
Bell Atlantic and the New York regulators will still be able to
claim some credit for establishing the path that other Bells must
follow into long distance. In a conference call Monday, SBC
officials said they had tweaked their application based on Bell
Atlantic's experience.

THE BIG BANG OF THE ADVERTISING UNIVERSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (With AOL-TIME-WARNER)  
(DW) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The $165 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc. by America
Online Inc. could well be a transformative transaction, say senior
managers at leading agencies, remaking the advertising, marketing
and media landscapes as few deals have done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark this date down,'' Page Thompson, worldwide media director
at DDB Worldwide in New York, part of the Omnicom Group, said
Monday as Madison Avenue learned details of the record takeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of a huge change in the paradigm of how
media are consumed, planned and bought.''
</P>
<P>
   That thought was echoed by Mark Stewart, executive vice
president and regional director for North America at Universal
McCann in New York, the media services arm of McCann-Erickson
Worldwide Advertising, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The network for the new millennium is a multimedia product
offering, moving ideas across platforms, online and offline,''
Stewart declared.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition would unite the traditional media in which Time
Warner specializes _ magazines, movies, music, broadcast and cable
television networks, cable systems _ with the new media expertise
of AOL in realms like e-mail, online chat, electronic commerce and
instant messaging.
</P>
<P>
   G.M. O'Connell, chairman and chief executive at a leading
interactive agency, Modem Media.Poppe Tyson in Norwalk, Conn.,
praised the acquisition for its union of ``the database Time Warner
has, its amazing knowledge of the American consumer'' that comes
from selling products like Time Inc. magazines and Time-Life books
and music, with the ``amazing knowledge AOL has of what its 20
million members do.
</P>
<P>
   ``This adds a whole new dimension to the opportunity to bundle
properties into neat packages for advertisers,'' he added, ``making
sure consumers get the information _ whether online, videos, print
or whatever _ they want on how to fix your house, your garden, your
computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Those opportunities, known as cross-media selling, are cited by
many media moguls proposing mergers or takeovers. Often, though,
such sales strategies worry the agency executives who make media
decisions for clients because of fears of overconcentration and
oligopolistic control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think those issues pertain here,'' said Allen Banks,
North American media director at Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi in New York,
part of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC, who is also chairman of the Media
Policy Committee of the American Association of Advertising
Agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Banks contrasted the AOL-Time Warner deal with another pending
media megamerger, the acquisition of the CBS Corp. by Viacom Inc.:
``This is a convergence, a confluence of old and new media,
creating new opportunities for our clients. CBS-Viacom could create
a much greater concentration of influence in media we're very much
invested in like syndicated TV, local market TV, cable TV, radio,
so there are concerns there among members of our committee to make
certain that deal won't be anticompetitive.''
</P>
<P>
   David Verklin, chief executive at Carat North America in New
York, part of the Aegis Group, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL and Time Warner are so different from the standpoint of
the media involved,'' he said, ``so from a clout standpoint,
there's not as much of a concern over concentration.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal is ``staggering news,'' according to Verklin, because
it represents ``an enormous step toward turning what's currently
known as a television set into an interactive appliance.''
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition brings together a disparate list of brand names,
venerable and fledgling, from the bland, ``family-friendly''
America Online to the spicy Maverick music label overseen by
Madonna. Others include AOL Instant Messenger, AOL Moviefone,
America Online, the Cartoon Network, CompuServe, Entertainment
Weekly, Fortune, Home Box Office, In Style, People, Sports
Illustrated, TBS, TNT, Time, the WB TV network, WCW wrestling and
Warner Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL, with its many users _ including my two children _ is
quite a powerful brand,'' said Rich Hamilton, chief executive for
the North America operations of Zenith Media Services in New York,
jointly owned by the Cordiant Communications Group and Saatchi &AMP;
Saatchi. ``I would hesitate to move away from the AOL acronym.''
</P>
<P>
   But what to call the new merged behemoth, which is being named
AOL Time Warner? How about Internet Time? Time Online? Presumably,
plays on words associated with the Time Warner cartoon franchise _
Looney Tunes _ are as verboten as X-rated fare on America Online.

 &HT;    AOL/TIME WARNER MERGER: How Dominant is too dominant?
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The long arm of AOL Time Warner will soon be able to
touch nearly every consumer in North America and, potentially, the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The merger announced Monday between the world's largest Internet
service provider and the world's largest media empire means
whenever you pick up a magazine, turn on the TV, flip to a cable
channel, go to the movies or log on to the Internet, AOL Time
Warner will probably be there with you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is too much to say that this really is a
historic merger; a time when we've transformed the landscape of
media and the Internet,'' AOL chairman and CEO Steve Case, 41, said
at a press conference Monday. He will become chairman of the new
company. ``This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make the
Internet as central to people's lives as the telephone and the
television.''
</P>
<P>
   In marrying old media with new media, the deal sets a completely
new agenda for the information and entertainment industry in this
country and the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very exciting,'' says Jeff Sadler, an analyst with
FAC/Equities in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opens up a lot of things. The big question is what's next
for AT&AMP;T, Yahoo and Disney. It's no longer good enough for AT&AMP;T to
bring connections to everybody everywhere. It's not good enough for
Disney to be a powerhouse media company, and it's not good enough
anymore for Yahoo to be the biggest portal,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to build something of equal consequence (to the AOL
Time Warner deal), you'd have to effectively merge all three of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal also makes Atlanta-based MindSpring Enterprises the
largest independent Internet Service provider in the country. After
its merger with California-based EarthLink Network, it will boast
three million subscribers and could eventually follow in merger
footsteps and partner with another major media player. For other
local companies, such as cable provider Cox Communications, the
deal changes the competitive landscape and will likely prompt them
to reexamine their strategies. In the near term, it's business as
usual at Turner Broadcasting, but long term plans remain
undetermined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a watershed moment for the Internet,'' said
Forrester Research senior analyst Dan O'Brien. ``The distinction
between old media and new media is gone, and there will be a lot of
scrambling among other media and Internet companies to find similar
combinations. O'Brien says the deal clearly solves a bigger problem
for Time Warner than it does for AOL. ``AOL has broadband issues,''
he says, ``but Time Warner has stubbed it's toe repeatedly in the
digital world.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet veterans will remember that Time Warner's ill-fated
Pathfinder.com, was literally one of the first commercial sites on
the Web. However, despite powerful brand names and a serious
commitment to new media, Time Warner has never been able to develop
an Internet strategy that works. With AOL, they are able to solve
their online dilemma without breaking a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Sadler, an analyst with FAC/Equities in Boston says how AOL
and Time Warner combine their assets in the future is the key to
how successful the merger will ultimately be. ``The $350 billion
question is what new things is AOL Time Warner going to create?''
Sadler says. ``Is this just a reshuffling of the card deck or is it
a whole new card deck? If this is just another way of looking at
content, this is not worth the $350 billion valuation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's optimistic that the size and scope of the merger
could bring on a new wave of creativity and innovation from smaller
companies from incubators like eCompanies or Atlanta's eHatchery to
pitch their technologies to AOL Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the promise of this merger,'' he says. ``That something
new _ some new aspect of new media _ will come out of it. What we
have today _ libraries of film, magazines, TV shows and movies and
millions of broadband and dial-up customers is not new,'' he says.
AOL Time Warner has to be something more than just another venue
for TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry is all about change,'' he says. ``Three years
ago we didn't know what the Internet was going to bring. What AOL
did was usher in all the tools to potentially give us things we
have not yet seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and observers agree that both sides will come up
winners in the deal, being billed as a ``merger of equals.''
</P>
<P>
   Jagdish Sheth, Kelllstadt Professor of marketing at Goizueta
School of Business says the merger was inevitable and very
practical. ``Basically, both companies are content companies,''
Sheth says, adding that the AOL/Time Warner deal will bring
together the various types of media ranging from print publishing
to Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all store, process and distribute information,'' he says.
``They are separated by technology, but soon we are going to see
three horizontal industries. The first is content _ integrated
content _ the original model of Time, Inc. The merger of publishing
and entertainment, that is now Time Warner is already done,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the biggest content nobody at Time Warner could understand
was the content on the Internet side, and that's where AOL comes
in. It was inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   From AOL's perspective, a deal with a major media company that
also owned a major cable operator was also inevitable, according to
Zia Daniell Wigder, an analyst with Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both needed each other,'' she says. ``AOL would have
floundered without access to the cable pipes. Time Warner was
everyone's favorite whipping boy with their Internet blunders. For
AOL, they were very anxious to get into the home and go through
cable. It's not surprising that AOL finally struck a deal with one
of the cable players,'' she says. ``We thought they had something
up their sleeve, but we didn't think it was of this magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts agree this is the most ambitious merger of its
time, combining a 21st century Internet company with a legendary
20th century media company. They also agree that CEO Gerald Levin
is the one person who can make the merger work and move the company
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great success story of Time Warner is that despite the
great difference in cultures (of the other companies they've merged
with including Atlanta's Turner Broadcasting) is they've been able
to merge it right,'' says Emory's Sheth. ``Levin has the great
knack of putting together those synergies and that creates value
for shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Levin is the manager,'' Sadler says. ``He is really going to
have to hit these guys hard to get them all to go in the same
direction. That's going to be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Forrester's O'Brien also cites the Byzantine corporate politics
of Time Warner that could keep the new company from moving forward
as some media watchers hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Warner comes from the world of slow decentralized
decision making,'' O'Brien says. ``AOL comes from an environment of
very quick deals. You have to move fast in the Internet. If the new
company is an 800 pound gorilla, then an 800 pound gorilla is not
going to be that light on its feet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think AOL's (president and COO) Bob Pittman and Ted Turner
are the key to the future of this company,'' Sadler says. ``I have
a feeling we'll all be watching the the Braves games from our
desktops before too long.''

DARTMOUTH TO PURGE CAMPUS OF FRATERNITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trying to shake its ``Animal House'' reputation once and for
all, Dartmouth College announced sweeping recommendations Monday
that would completely reshape residential life on campus and
effectively drive its storied fraternities out of business.
</P>
<P>
   The extent and expense of the proposals show just how far
Dartmouth is willing to go to purge the cozy Ivy League campus of
its party school atmosphere. The recommendations call for
construction of several residences, student centers, dining halls,
and an athletic facility, as well as new rules that officials
acknowledged will make it hard for fraternities and sororities to
stay open.
</P>
<P>
   They would also do away with quirkier residential privileges: in
a proposal officials say is sure to draw the most fire, the college
would force fraternities to shut off the beer taps that have become
standard plumbing in most Greek houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``A question has to be asked about whether a student residence
should be equipped in that manner, to allow 24-hour access to
alcohol,'' said James Larimore, the dean of the college. ``We're
hoping that as we discuss these recommendations, students and
others can rise to the challenge to move beyond merely stating
their disagreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations come after consultations with students,
faculty, and alumni in the year since President James Wright vowed
to ``end Greek life as we know it.''
</P>
<P>
   But a report accompanying the recommendations shows how
difficult change can be, citing in graphic detail several incidents
of ``uncivil behavior'' in the year since the college first
announced that it wanted to do away with fraternity culture.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, one fraternity staged a panty raid on two sororities,
another sent its pledges walking naked through the main library
during popular study hours. At another fraternity house, members
climbed on the roof with a bullhorn and shouted sexually suggestive
comments at passing women. When outraged officials asked what the
fraternity planned to do about the incident, members replied that
they had gotten rid of the bullhorn.
</P>
<P>
   While the incidents were ``mild in comparison to some past
activities,'' the report notes, they were ``puerile at best and
demeaning at worst.''
</P>
<P>
   The study quantifies what admissions officers at Dartmouth had
long feared _ that the school is failing to attract many of the
highest-caliber students because of its reputation as a school
primarily for beer-guzzling white males. In a survey of those
accepted to the class of 2003, many students who decided not to
attend Dartmouth cited their concerns about social life as their
primary reason to go elsewhere. These tended to be the best
students, with SAT scores, on average of 756 Verbal and 739 Math,
far above the class average of 713 Verbal, 713 Math.
</P>
<P>
   Dartmouth still has trouble attracting minority students,
admissions officials say. Any progress the campus has made in
attracting a more diverse student body is not reflected in the
fraternities: those who join sororities, for example, are 81
percent white, compared with 68 percent on the overall campus; 45
percent of sorority members come from families with incomes higher
than $150,000, compared with 32 percent overall. Similar numbers
exist at fraternities. With the Greek system dominating the social
life, that means that a small group of white, affluent students are
setting the social tone for the entire campus.
</P>
<P>
   The fraternities and sororities also have higher incidence of
binge drinking, and episodes of intolerance, such as a ``ghetto
party'' hosted by a fraternity and sorority last year.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals, which are to be discussed among students, alumni,
and faculty over the next 10 weeks before a final vote by the
trustees, aim at reducing alcohol abuse and increasing the
diversity of campus social life.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefly, the proposals suggest the building of at least two
350-bed housing clusters, which would be governed by student
councils that would plan activities, and would be attached to new
student centers. These clusters would replace the Greek system,
officials hope, as the ``bedrock'' of social and residential life
on campus. Faculty would live in housing attached to the clusters,
to increase the academic atmosphere of the residences, and students
would be able to eat in new dining facilities attached to the
residences.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also calls for setting aside housing for
first-years, to give them some sense of belonging. It would also
build a dining hall on the opposite end of the campus from where
the existing dining hall is now, and set up a catering system to
allow students to have smaller social functions like dinners or
teas. New arts spaces and a recreation center would give students
new outlets for their spare time.
</P>
<P>
   The report acknowledges that many of the trustees involved in
preparing it wanted to simply do away with the fraternities and
sororities. In the interest of student choice, it recommended
keeping them open, but under restrictions so heavy that they would
likely be unable to stay open.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals would ban hazing, including any initiation rites
that involve alcohol. They would end the pledge period, meaning
that students who want to be admitted would be admitted as full
members, not subject to any probationary or initiation period.
Students would be guaranteed entry to at least one organization to
which they sought entry, and they could not ``rush'' organizations
until winter of their sophomore year, a semester later than now.
</P>
<P>
   Only juniors and seniors who are officers of the Greek
organizations could live in the houses, and they would be required
to share the space with an alcohol abuse counselor, a sexual abuse
counselor, and a community service liaison. The organizations would
have to sign agreements not to violate the alcohol laws of New
Hampshire, something the report says is ``flagrant'' and
``routine'' now. Permanent bars, which, like the taps are standard
accessories, would be removed.

AOL TO BUY TIME WARNER FOR $165 BILLION

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ America Online, the company that brought the Internet
to the masses, has agreed to buy the largest traditional media
company, Time Warner, for $165 billion in what would be the biggest
merger in history and the best evidence yet that old and new media
are converging.
</P>
<P>
   By agreeing to give up its independence in return for an ample
premium on its stock price, Time Warner is acknowledging that the
Internet is central to its music, publishing and television
businesses and that its own efforts to create online operations
have been lackluster. America Online, despite the occasional
stumble, has surged far ahead of all of its online competitors,
largely on the strength of its marketing savvy and ability to make
technology easy to use for the average people.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, in turn, would gain access to Time Warner's
entertainment and information empire. And perhaps of more immediate
import, the company _ whose 22 million paying subscribers now use
modems and telephone lines to go online _ would get access to Time
Warner's cable television systems. Those cable systems, which now
serve 13 million subscribers, would enable America Online to start
offering much higher-speed Internet and interactive television
services. Until this deal, no major cable company would carry
America Online's services.
</P>
<P>
   The companies' customers might expect to see new Internet
versions of Time Warner's offerings, from CNN news to Home Box
Office movies, combined with a range of features more sophisticated
than the Web sites, chat rooms and e-mail services that are now
America Online staples. The earliest impact might come in music,
where America Online is already developing technology for a digital
jukebox that will store and play songs from Warner Music and other
labels.
</P>
<P>
   But for consumers generally, whether they now or ever subscribe
to America Online or Time Warner services, Monday's announcement
may very likely portend other mergers and alliances that could
hasten the development of and availability of high-capacity
information and entertainment networks.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's deal, which was negotiated with such secrecy that it
took the industry by surprise, also brought a new realization about
the extraordinary stock-market values that America Online and other
Internet companies have reached in the last 18 months. Analysts
have long predicted that the new stars of the Internet world would
wind up part of larger media empires. The surprise here, driven by
the soaring prices of Internet stocks, is that it is the Internet
companies doing the buying and the old media companies selling out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dot-com guys have sort of won,'' said David B. Readerman,
an analyst with Thomas Weisel Partners, a San Francisco brokerage
firm. ``AOL was able to serve up its stock and buy Time Warner,
walking a way with incredible media assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Another winner is Stephen M. Case, the chairman and chief
executive of America Online who will become the chairman of the new
company, to be called AOL Time Warner, which with a market value of
$350 billion, will be the fourth most valuable company in the
country, after Microsoft, General Electric and Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   The shy and aloof Case is a billionaire, but unlike the instant
sort created by some of the newer Internet companies, he worked for
15 years, through obscurity and ridicule, to achieve his vision
that chatting on a computer screen would become as important a
communications medium as the telephone or television.
</P>
<P>
   It was Case who proposed the combination last October to Gerald
Levin, the chairman and chief executive of Time Warner, winning an
initial hearing by offering Levin the chief executive's title in
the combed company. After much haggling over the financial terms,
the deal was cemented at a five-hour meeting at Case's house in
Virginia last Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The new company is suddenly a powerful competitor to companies
in a wide range of industries. Walt Disney, Time Warner's
traditional media rival, has been struggling with its own Go
Internet service. AT&AMP;T now faces an even more powerful challenge to
its cable television systems, which America Online has been trying
to gain access to. And Microsoft faces redoubled strength at AOL,
already seen as its most potent rival as software evolves into
Internet-based services.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in light of Monday's announcement, analysts and
executives were quick to predict that more media and technology
companies would run to the alter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of old and new media companies will happen far
faster because of this,'' said George Bell, the president of
Excite(AT)Home, the company controlled by AT&AMP;T that offers high
speed Internet services over cable systems. ``Fundamentally, Time
Warner has something AOL doesn't have: Great media brands built up
over decades. The time isn't there for Internet companies to build
that content. Time just won't hold still.''
</P>
<P>
   The combination faces the usual review by antitrust regulators
as well as a complex web of local reviews as cable television
franchises are transferred into AOL's name.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The biggest regulatory concerns are likely to be whether AOL
Time Warner, by controlling distribution on the Internet, on cable
systems and in other media, can choke off competing companies'
programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this merger the beginning of the end of the Internet as an
effective counterweight to traditional media outlets, or is this
just another step on the road to making the Internet a more useful
and usable source of information?'' asked Sen. Mike DeWine of Ohio,
the chairman of the antitrust subcommittee and Sen. Herb Kohl of
Wisconsin, its ranking Democratic member, in a joint statement
promising hearings into the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, the deal raises the thorny question of how
providers of high speed internet access over cable systems should
be regulated.

<P>
   The first detailed public images of a secretive North Korean
missile base, taken by a private spy satellite and quietly released
last week, show a small rural site that analysts clashed over
Monday as to whether it is perilously menacing or surprisingly
primitive.
</P>
<P>
   The most noteworthy features, said the Federation of American
Scientists, a private group in Washington, were those missing: the
rail links, paved roads, fuel tanks and staff housing needed to
support a major program for long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the mouse that roared,'' said John E. Pike, director of
the group's space program and author of the analysis. ``It's a
singularly unimpressive facility, and we've looked at all the main
ones in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But other experts see the base, from which a missile was
test-fired over Japan in August 1998, as a potentially deadly
example of how little technological infrastructure is needed for a
nation to have missiles that could threaten the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be surprised if the base were anything but modest,'' said
Frank J. Gaffney Jr., a former Pentagon official who directs the
Center for Security Policy, a conservative private Washington
group. ``North Korea can't feed its own people. But if crude will
do, then we're fools to ignore capabilities that have the potential
to do us grave harm.''
</P>
<P>
   He said of all missile threats now facing the United States,
``this is probably the highest.''
</P>
<P>
   The site, known as Rodong, is North Korean's only base for
launching long-range missiles, and is used for test flights and
potentially for mounting limited missile attacks. It has become an
international flashpoint in recent years and one of the main
threats cited by American proponents of a national antimissile
system, which the Clinton administration says it is weighing.
</P>
<P>
   The images of the top-secret military base were released quietly
last week by Space Imaging Inc., a company in Thornton, Colo.,
which built the world's first private spy satellite and markets the
photos. The company's space camera can make images of objects as
small as 3 feet in diameter and show cars, roads, buildings, tanks,
jets and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It contributes to informed debate,'' Jeffrey K. Harris,
president of Space Imaging, said Monday of the North Korean
imagery.
</P>
<P>
   This site has long been a top priority for American spy
satellites, but the government releases no information gathered by
such surveillance. The Russians have sold some crude imagery of the
base, but Space Imaging's is by far the best made public.
</P>
<P>
   The Federation of American Scientists, which generally backs
arms control and has a program that studies space photos, published
its analysis of the imagery on its Web site, www.fas.org, under the
heading ``What's New.''
</P>
<P>
   The federation said the space photos show that the North Korean
installation is roughly triangular, consisting of a single launch
pad, a control facility and a building for assembling missiles.
Those areas, it said, are linked by a network of unpaved roads and
trails.
</P>
<P>
   The federation called the base ``barely worthy of note,
consisting of the most minimal imaginable test infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy criticized the
group as naive, saying that only a more complete evaluation of the
base by federal analysts working with a range of intelligence data
and photos could reveal its true menace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This snapshot does not take into account what the North
Koreans can get by way of help from clients and friends,'' he said.
``There's lots of evidence they're getting help from China and the
Russians. That's a whole different problem.''

 &HT;    `Backdoor' benefits seen for MindSpring
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The AOL and Time Warner merger took nearly everyone by
surprise, including Atlanta-based MindSpring Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big, bad kid on the block just got a lot bigger and
badder,'' says Charles Brewer, MindSpring's founder, chairman and
chief executive. ``It's a pretty powerful-looking ship they are
building up there.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Miles Russ, Internet services analyst with Robinson
Humphrey, says the merger could be a ``backdoor benefit'' for the
MindSpring/EarthLink combination.
</P>
<P>
   Russ says that eventually AOL Time Warner will be seen more as a
traditional media company, with MindSpring the biggest pure
Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good psychological advantage for MindSpring to
have,'' Russ says, citing terms of future partnerships with media
companies. ``It really raises the profile of what MindSpring can be
in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring will come out of its merger with 3 million
subscribers. ``That's critical mass,'' Russ says, ``and the only
ISP out there that will offer the kind of audience to offer goods
and services and turn subscribers into shoppers as AOL has done.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also AOL Time Warner's stated decision to open its
high-speed cable modem lines to competitors such as MindSpring.
Brewer is enthusiastic but wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people don't want to be beholden to only one
option,'' Brewer says. ``People are looking for a viable other
choice, and I think that's the big obvious win from our point of
view. When I first heard the news, I wondered what it would mean
for open access, but this is just unambiguously great.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer has been one of the most vocal proponents in Washington
for the OpenNet coalition, which has been lobbying Congress and the
Federal Communications Commission to either legislate or regulate
access for Internet service providers over cable's high-speed modem
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first of many, many steps on the road,'' Brewer
says.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer says he views the AOL Time Warner deal in the same way he
views MindSpring's agreement with AT&AMP;T to allow MindSpring access
to AT&AMP;T's cable services. ``It's not the whole game,'' he says,
``but it's a big piece. ...The particulars of their commitment to
openness remain to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Russ:''Time will tell. Yes, there will be competitive
access, but how much of a head start this will give AOL is unclear,
and there is really no incentive to work with anyone now that they
have the big giant monolith. How much (competitors) will be willing
to pay is one question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a giant step forward,'' he says, ``but it's a giant step
with an asterisk.''

TURNER IS THE BIGGEST INDIVIDUAL WINNER AT $2.43 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ted Turner is knocking on the door of the $10-billion club.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, the cable television pioneer who is vice chairman of
Time Warner, has more to gain than anybody from a sale of the
company to America Online. He is the biggest individual shareholder
of Time Warner, owning about 97 million shares, or about 6.5
percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   When the stock jumped more than $25 a share Monday after the
proposed deal was announced, the value of Turner's stake rose by
$2.43 billion, to $8.73 billion. That is more than four times what
his stake in Time Warner was worth when he accepted its shares in
exchange for his stake in Turner Broadcasting System in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, Forbes magazine estimated Turner's net worth
at $6.9 billion. After Monday's gain, that number should be pushing
$9.5 billion, making him one of the 20 richest people in America.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a man who started out with a collection of
billboards in the South.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that Turner, 61, said he voted to accept America
Online's offer ``with as much or more excitement and enthusiasm as
I did on that night when I first made love some 42 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Jane Fonda, from whom Turner said last week he was
separating, probably got a thrill as well. According to Time
Warner's last proxy statement, she owned 770,000 shares of Time
Warner stock. If she still owned them Monday, their value increased
by $19.5 million, to $69.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Case, the chairman and chief executive of America Online,
owns about 9 million shares of the company, which were worth about
$645 million after their price dipped 3 percent Monday, to $71.50
from $73.75 on Friday. Case also owns options on several million
shares of AOL.
</P>
<P>
   While the long-term effect of the deal on America Online
shareholders is uncertain so far, it will be a sure winner for Time
Warner investors, many of whom are employees of the company's
magazines and cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   Some longtime employees of the company's flagship Time magazine
were debating Monday what to do with options on the company's stock
that they were given 10 years ago as compensation after Time merged
with Warner. Back then, Time employees disdainfully referred to the
options as ``Confederate scrip.'' They are not sneering now.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not hearing much complaining around here today,'' one
Time employee said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the options, which give holders the right to buy shares
at a pre-set price during a certain period, expire in mid-March.
Because they offer the opportunity to buy shares for about $15
each, there is no question that they should be exercised: At Time
Warner's closing price Monday of $90.0625, the options guaranteed a
pretax gain of about $75 each.
</P>
<P>
   The only decision is whether to exercise the options and sell
the shares now, after Monday's leap, or hang on with the hope that
America Online, whose fortunes are linked to investor attitudes
about the Internet, can sustain its high stock price. America
Online is offering 1.5 shares for each share of Time Warner, so, in
theory, the stocks should move in step. But there is still a big
gap between Time Warner's stock price and what America Online is
offering to pay because investors are unsure that the deal will be
completed.
</P>
<P>
   At Janus Capital, a mutual fund company in Denver that is a big
investor in both companies, there was no hint of uncertainty. The
reaction was closer to giddiness as fund managers measured the
effect of the deal on their portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a pretty good day,'' said Scott Schoelzel, manager of
the $31 billion Janus Twenty fund, whose stake in Time Warner
appreciated by more than $450 million Monday. Schoelzel was
speaking from home, where he had started the day under the weather.
</P>
<P>
   After being patched in to a conference call with Turner and
other executives involved in the deal, Schoelzel said, ``I'm
feeling very good now.'' Asked what was ailing him, he said,
``Nothing serious; nothing $500 million won't cure.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoelzel was not fazed by the $165 billion price being paid by
America Online, the largest holding in his fund. With the
combination of Time's media properties and America Online's
expertise at electronic distribution, he said, ``I think the
combined company will be the prototypical media-communications firm
of the next century, the firm that everybody else benchmarks
themselves against.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Fidelity Investments in Boston, Janus is one of the
biggest Time Warner shareholders. The value of the 90 million
shares spread across its funds rose by $2.27 billion Monday.
Fidelity also owns about 90 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest institutional shareholder of all is Liberty Media, a
cable company that owns about 8 percent of Time Warner's stock, a
stake now worth about $10.8 billion.

CHICKEN'S REAL, STUDY ISN'T, UNH SAYS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   No, the Colonel's secret fried-chicken recipe does not include
genetically modified organisms with no beaks, feathers or feet.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, the University of New Hampshire started getting
calls about a study supposedly done at UNH on Kentucky Fried
Chicken with some ``upsetting'' results.
</P>
<P>
   According to an e-mail bouncing around the Internet, Kentucky
Fried Chicken had started calling itself KFC because it no longer
used real chickens in its ``finger lickin' good'' products.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail claims KFC uses featherless, beakless and feetless
genetically altered organisms that are kept alive by tubes, so
different from real chickens that the company cannot legally call
them chickens. These organisms have bone structures so small, the
e-mail states, that KFC can use more meat and save on production
costs.
</P>
<P>
   But both the University of New Hampshire and KFC said it is an
Internet hoax. ``There isn't a study,'' said Kim Billings, a UNH
spokeswoman. ``We are in the middle of hosting the presidential
debates (last week) and we start getting these calls about KFC.''
Billings said she has even gotten a call from the legal office of
DuPont Corp. asking if there was such a study.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Cerny, UNH's senior information technology manager, had to
post information last Wednesday on the school's Web page refuting
the claim.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the ``chicken hoax'' web link off the main UNH home
page got about 10,500 hits, and continues to get about 15 to 18
hits per minute per day.
</P>
<P>
   Cerny said that other fast-food chains have dealt with their own
urban legends, such as claims of worm meat in McDonald's burgers,
and pregnant roaches in Taco Bell's tacos. Years ago, there was a
story that KFC's products were really made up of fried rat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The genetically engineered bit just brings the story up to
date,'' said Cerny.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is to say that no chicken research goes on at UNH.
Colette Janson-Sand, associate professor of nutrition at UNH, said
there is one person doing poultry research and the university does
breed some chickens for cancer-related research. Janson-Sand said
she has received hoax-prompted calls from England and a woman from
Georgia who was ``pretty hysterical because she went to KFC three
times a week.''
</P>
<P>
   KFC said it changed its name from Kentucky Fried Chicken in 1991
because the chain had begun to serve non-fried chicken dishes, such
as roasted chicken and pot pies.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tierney, spokesman for KFC, said he got his first call
on the story between Christmas and New Year's. KFC computer
specialists, he said, were able to trace ``the beakless,
feetless,'' hoax back to last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I picked myself off the floor from laughing so hard, I
assured the caller that we use the same suppliers that consumers
buy from and trust,'' Tierney said, for the 581 million KFC
chickens consumed worldwide each year.
</P>
<P>
   As for Colonel Harland Sanders himself, he was not
bio-engineered, but he did not come by his ``colonel'' in the
service of Uncle Sam. The Indiana native was annointed a Kentucky
Colonel in 1935 by Governor Ruby Laffoon in recognition of his
contribution to the state's cuisine.

BRAZIL'S CENTRAL BANK LIMITS EXPANSION BY FOREIGN BANKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ In a display of concern over the growing
influence of foreign banks, Brazil's central bank sought to
reassure the nation's banking industry Monday that it would limit
the expansion of overseas banks in Brazil, Latin America's biggest
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank did little more than restate its earlier
position, but that in itself was unusual, reflecting a growing
unease in Brazil over the influence of foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
   It said that foreign-owned retail banks with existing operations
in this country would not be permitted to open new branches or
acquire smaller Brazilian banks unless they purchased one of seven
state-owned banks scheduled for sale. The measure does not affect
foreign investment banks, which have already made significant
inroads in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The statement came after criticism arose of the government's
plan to allow foreign banks to bid for Banco do Estado de Sao Paulo
SA, or Banespa, a large yet troubled state bank with an extensive
branch network in this city, Brazil's financial center.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian banks are particularly worried about a foreign
acquisition of Banespa because of Banespa's size. But others,
including some banking industry analysts, say such concerns are
misguided.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's understandable why Brazilian banks are upset, but it's
still negative to limit banks' expansion,'' said Bruno Zaremba, a
banking analyst at Banco Pactual in Rio de Janeiro. ``That inhibits
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Three large Brazilian financial institutions _ Banco Bradesco
SA, Banco Itau SA and Uniao de Bancos Brasileiros SA _ are among
the most concerned about foreign encroachments. They have already
been forced to compete with foreign banks on an unprecedented level
since the government encouraged the liberalization of the banking
industry during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil expects to find buyers for at least six state banks this
year, including Banespa, which is scheduled to be sold in May, and
a seventh in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Yet besides Banespa, only one of those institutions, Banestado,
of the state of Parana, holds much allure for foreign banks,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   This means foreign institutions wanting to enter or expand in
Brazil may have no choice but to purchase one of the less desirable
state-run banks to be sold.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that the central bank has sought to
balance the expansion desires of foreign banks with the survival
concerns of domestic ones.
</P>
<P>
   When several Brazilian banks faced insolvency with the shift
from hyperinflation to relative price stabilization in the
mid-'90s, the central bank encouraged large foreign and Brazilian
banks to take over troubled counterparts by financing or brokering
such transactions.
</P>
<P>
   That policy is thought to have helped avoid a debilitating
banking crisis. But the result was the doubling of the effective
control of banks by foreigners, to about 20 percent in 1999, up
from 10 percent in 1996, according to Salomon Smith Barney. Other
analysts have calculated that foreign institutions control as much
as 30 percent of the country's banking assets.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with other Latin American nations this percentage is
not that high. In Chile, for instance, foreigners control more than
40 percent of the country's banks, while in Peru, the figure is
even higher, at 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank has attached conditions previously to the
expansion of foreign banks, and the result has helped to spread
banking services into more parts of the country. It encouraged
ABN-Amro Bank NV, of the Netherlands, for example, to acquire a
small state bank in Brazil's northeast so ABN-Amro could continue
with its much larger $3 billion takeover of a retail bank in the
country's developed south.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it remains to be seen how stringent the central bank will
be when faced with a large foreign bank that is intent on expanding
in Brazil, since the government prizes direct investment from
abroad and, at least so far, has shown willingness to increase
competition in the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   The real test ought to come with the privatization of Banespa,
which surged nearly 10 percent Monday in Sao Paulo stock trading
after the government reaffirmed plans to sell it May 16.
</P>
<P>
   Although several foreign banks, including Citigroups Citibank
unit, have shown interest in acquiring the Sao Paulo bank, most
analysts think the buyer will probably be one of Brazil's three
large banks not under control of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banespa is very big and difficult to manage,'' said Jose
Garcia-Cantera, an analyst who covers Latin American banks for
Salomon Smith Barney in New York. ``What's needed are deep
managerial capabilities and excellent knowledge of the local
market.''

POLITICIANS QUICK TO SEIZE BUDGET SURPLUS ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a presidential campaign defined by arguments about what to do
with a massive budget surplus, candidates in both parties are
looking to capitalize on word of an even bigger windfall than was
previously expected.
</P>
<P>
   Government projections due in the coming weeks are expected to
show the federal surplus could be up to $800 billion larger by 2010
than the $3 trillion figure now commonly accepted, which includes
$2 trillion in extra Social Security revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Such projections are speculative, of course, and could prove to
be off by hundreds of billions of dollars. But they have
nevertheless served as the point of reference for presidential
debates over tax cuts and spending plans.
</P>
<P>
   And the notion that an incoming president will have extra
billions of dollars at his disposal may give some candidates new
freedom to expand their proposals, and others a chance to fend off
criticism that they overspend the surplus, damage the economy and
leaving nothing in reserve for programs like Social Security and
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The new figures ``will intensify the food fight'' over the
surplus, said Robert Reischauer, a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution and a former director of the Congressional Budget
Office (CBO).
</P>
<P>
   The first estimates will be released later this month by the
CBO, with similar numbers to follow Feb. 7 from the White House
Office of Management and Budget.
</P>
<P>
   Although the official projections aren't due for weeks _ and
even as some economists warn against overstating their significance
_ they are already showing an impact on the campaign as the
candidates seek to spin complicated budget figures to their
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   During Saturday's Democratic forum in Des Moines, Iowa, former
New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley sought to neutralize one of Vice
President Al Gore's favorite charges _ that Bradley's sweeping
health care plan would ``blow the suplus'' and leave no money to
preserve Medicare _ by citing reports of the new estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can do both,'' Bradley said. ``The surplus over the
next decade is going to be another $800 billion. So we can do
both.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a defense could prove invaluable for Bradley as he tries to
fend off Gore's repeated attacks on the cost of his health care
plan. Bradley estimates the plan as costing around $650 billion
over 10 years. But Gore says the figure is closer to $1.2 trillion
_ greater than the current projected surplus of $1 trillion in
non-Social Security dollars _ and could lead to budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the Republican side, the campaign of Arizona
Senator John McCain says the rosier numbers are a factor behind a
decision to expand McCain's tax cut plan, which he will detail
Wednesday in Concord, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   In June, McCain outlined a tax cut of $500 billion over 10
years, a size criticized by some Republicans as too modest compared
with the proposal made by Texas Governor George W. Bush, who
offered a $483 billion cut over 5 years.
</P>
<P>
   In response, McCain has charged that Bush's tax cut would
squander the surplus and leave no funds for Social Security,
Medicare, or reducing the $5.8 trillion national debt.
</P>
<P>
   But the McCain campaign now says higher revenues allow for a
bigger tax cut. ``We will acknowledge the possibility of greater
surpluses,'' a McCain aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists, however, caution that the new budget cushion
could be far less than the $800 billion figure cited by Bradley.
And they note that any estimates must be considered in the context
of growing federal spending _ an argument echoed by Gore in
Saturday's debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who make up the numbers say the natural growth in
government services is going to take up almost all of that (extra
surplus) over the next 10 years,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Most estimates so far have assumed that Congress would abide by
strict spending limits it passed in 1997, but Congress has
repeatedly broken those caps by tens of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Reischauer said, surplus projections to date have
been too optimistic, leaving candidates on shaky ground as they
propose huge tax and spending plans for money that may never
materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, rather than providing a huge new cushion for candidates,
Reischauer said, the end result may be nothing more than an
affirmation of the $1 trillion figure currently relied on by most
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Previously it wasn't a good number, but now it is,''
Reischauer said. ``These development are going to save the
candidates from significant embarassment.''
</P>
<P>
   While the current $1 trillion figure describes only the portion
of the surplus that does not come from Social Security, candidates
of both parties say they won't borrow from extra Social Security
funds.
</P>
<P>
   The more optimistic figures will be based in part on new data
from the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis, and a
recent slowdown in the growth of the expensive Medicare program for
senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Economists caution that any long-term estimates of economic
growth are imprecise by nature, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all very speculative,'' said James Horney, a senior
fellow at the liberal-leaning Center for Budget and Policy
Priorities in Washington. ``This is a very inexact science.''
</P>
<P>
   Horney added that, despite the ever-brightening economic news,
dark economic clouds lie on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a serious budget problem in the years following all
this,'' Horney said. In the years shortly after the surplus peaks,
he said, baby boomers will begin retiring by the millions, putting
an immense financial strain on the Medicare and Social Security
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The CBO itself warned last month that such pressures ``will
probably drive the budget back into deficit and eventually lead to
serious fiscal problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be good if in the debates over the next year people
look more realistically at that long-term problem,'' Horney said.

BRADLEY CRITICIZES GORE AGAIN ON EDUCATION THINKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EXIRA, Iowa _ Days after a debate in which he described Vice
President Al Gore as trapped in the ``Washington Bunker,' Bill
Bradley seized on a new metaphor for his view that Gore tends to
think small thoughts about big problems.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of the day was education.
</P>
<P>
   The metaphor: A box.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he views education as if it were in a box, where there
are particular programs in a box that's called education,'' Bradley
told an audience at an elementary school here.
</P>
<P>
   The former New Jersey senator, as he wound his way with his
campaign entourage Monday through the hilly farmland of western
Iowa, also chastised Gore for proposing more new spending for the
Pentagon than for schools, and offered his alternative vision.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative, Bradley said, it to ``talk about education in
the fabric of our lives,'' an issue linked to others like health
care and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education is the very essence of life,'' Bradley added later
at in almost-spiritual speech to students at Atlantic High School.
``Education is the backbone of everything we do.''
</P>
<P>
   In an low-key, pine green bus, Bradley traveled through the
state that will host the Jan. 24 caucus that will be the first true
test of the 2000 Democratic presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley has surged in parts of the native Northeast --
such as New Hampshire, Massachusetts and New York -- he is more of
an underdog here. But since the Democratic primary race focused
anew on Iowa with a debate on Satuday, Gore has begun to cast
Bradley as out of his element and unfamiliar with this agrarian
state.
</P>
<P>
   That tactic continued Monday. When Bradley arrived at Atlantic
High School Monday afternoon, his campaign was greeted by ``Corn
Man,'' a Gore volunteer dressed as a yellow-and-green husk of corn.
The volunteer distributed handouts questioning Bradley's
understanding of farm policy, highlighting his Senate votes
opposing emergency flood relief for farmers, and recalling his
longtime opposition to ethanol subsidies when he was a US senator.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Bradley defended a 1993 vote cited by Gore during
Saturday's debate, saying the vote was on an amendment for millions
of dollars in spending for other programs, and not just the flood
relief Gore said it represented.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday Bradley shifted his focus on education, a theme that
has been somewhat over-shadowed by his emphasis on health care and
campaign finance reform. Recently, Bradley has been fending off
charges from the Gore campaign that he has not offered a coherent
and substantive education plan, sought yesday to underscore his
commitment to an issue that tops public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed an education plan costing $115 billion over 10
years. Bradley's is smaller, at $90 billion over that period. But
the Bradley campaign noted that Gore has proposed increasing
defense spending by $127 billion. Bradley supports no increase in
Pentagon funding, and has called for reductions in the nation's
nuclear arsenal, as well as elimination of expensive new weapons
systems like the F-22 fighter jet.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a recent estimate by Education Secretary Richard Riley
that as many as 250,000 American schoolteachers are unqualified,
Bradley reiterated education proposals that he sayd would add
60,000 new teachers a year, offer loan forgiveness to students who
commit to teaching for 4 years in high-need classrooms, and offer
scholarships of $7,500 to gifted students who commit to teach in
high-need subject matters. Bradley also said he would increase
federal funding for community colleges by 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For Bradley, the greatest challenge on this long day of
campaigning may have been holding the attention of dozens of Exira
Elementary School students, some as young as 5, who gathered in a
small gymnasium to hear him speak.

<P>
   Setting aside his characteristic reserve, Bradley led the
youngest of the children in a clapping game that left them laughing
with glee.
</P>
<P>
   During a question-and-answer period, the children expressed
fascination with the idea of running for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it fun running for president,'' asked one young girl,
bouncing in her seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Bradley answered. ``Most days.''

POLITICIANS QUICK TO SEIZE BUDGET SURPLUS ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a presidential campaign defined by arguments about what to do
with a massive budget surplus, candidates in both parties are
looking to capitalize on word of an even bigger windfall than was
previously expected.
</P>
<P>
   Government projections due in the coming weeks are expected to
show the federal surplus could be up to $800 billion larger by 2010
than the $3 trillion figure now commonly accepted, which includes
$2 trillion in extra Social Security revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Such projections are speculative, of course, and could prove to
be off by hundreds of billions of dollars. But they have
nevertheless served as the point of reference for presidential
debates over tax cuts and spending plans.
</P>
<P>
   And the notion that an incoming president will have extra
billions of dollars at his disposal may give some candidates new
freedom to expand their proposals, and others a chance to fend off
criticism that they overspend the surplus, damage the economy and
leaving nothing in reserve for programs like Social Security and
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The new figures ``will intensify the food fight'' over the
surplus, said Robert Reischauer, a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution and a former director of the Congressional Budget
Office (CBO).
</P>
<P>
   The first estimates will be released later this month by the
CBO, with similar numbers to follow Feb. 7 from the White House
Office of Management and Budget.
</P>
<P>
   Although the official projections aren't due for weeks _ and
even as some economists warn against overstating their significance
_ they are already showing an impact on the campaign as the
candidates seek to spin complicated budget figures to their
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   During Saturday's Democratic forum in Des Moines, Iowa, former
New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley sought to neutralize one of Vice
President Al Gore's favorite charges _ that Bradley's sweeping
health care plan would ``blow the suplus'' and leave no money to
preserve Medicare _ by citing reports of the new estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can do both,'' Bradley said. ``The surplus over the
next decade is going to be another $800 billion. So we can do
both.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a defense could prove invaluable for Bradley as he tries to
fend off Gore's repeated attacks on the cost of his health care
plan. Bradley estimates the plan as costing around $650 billion
over 10 years. But Gore says the figure is closer to $1.2 trillion
_ greater than the current projected surplus of $1 trillion in
non-Social Security dollars _ and could lead to budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the Republican side, the campaign of Arizona
Senator John McCain says the rosier numbers are a factor behind a
decision to expand McCain's tax cut plan, which he will detail
Wednesday in Concord, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   In June, McCain outlined a tax cut of $500 billion over 10
years, a size criticized by some Republicans as too modest compared
with the proposal made by Texas Governor George W. Bush, who
offered a $483 billion cut over 5 years.
</P>
<P>
   In response, McCain has charged that Bush's tax cut would
squander the surplus and leave no funds for Social Security,
Medicare, or reducing the $5.8 trillion national debt.
</P>
<P>
   But the McCain campaign now says higher revenues allow for a
bigger tax cut. ``We will acknowledge the possibility of greater
surpluses,'' a McCain aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists, however, caution that the new budget cushion
could be far less than the $800 billion figure cited by Bradley.
And they note that any estimates must be considered in the context
of growing federal spending _ an argument echoed by Gore in
Saturday's debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who make up the numbers say the natural growth in
government services is going to take up almost all of that (extra
surplus) over the next 10 years,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Most estimates so far have assumed that Congress would abide by
strict spending limits it passed in 1997, but Congress has
repeatedly broken those caps by tens of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Reischauer said, surplus projections to date have
been too optimistic, leaving candidates on shaky ground as they
propose huge tax and spending plans for money that may never
materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, rather than providing a huge new cushion for candidates,
Reischauer said, the end result may be nothing more than an
affirmation of the $1 trillion figure currently relied on by most
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Previously it wasn't a good number, but now it is,''
Reischauer said. ``These development are going to save the
candidates from significant embarassment.''
</P>
<P>
   While the current $1 trillion figure describes only the portion
of the surplus that does not come from Social Security, candidates
of both parties say they won't borrow from extra Social Security
funds.
</P>
<P>
   The more optimistic figures will be based in part on new data
from the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis, and a
recent slowdown in the growth of the expensive Medicare program for
senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Economists caution that any long-term estimates of economic
growth are imprecise by nature, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all very speculative,'' said James Horney, a senior
fellow at the liberal-leaning Center for Budget and Policy
Priorities in Washington. ``This is a very inexact science.''
</P>
<P>
   Horney added that, despite the ever-brightening economic news,
dark economic clouds lie on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a serious budget problem in the years following all
this,'' Horney said. In the years shortly after the surplus peaks,
he said, baby boomers will begin retiring by the millions, putting
an immense financial strain on the Medicare and Social Security
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The CBO itself warned last month that such pressures ``will
probably drive the budget back into deficit and eventually lead to
serious fiscal problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be good if in the debates over the next year people
look more realistically at that long-term problem,'' Horney said.

GORE SPEAKS OUT ON AIDS CRISIS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN AND JOE LAURIA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Speaking in unusually explicit terms for a
politician, Vice President Al Gore says the only way to combat AIDS
in sub-Saharan Africa is to change sexual behavior by
``stigmatizing promiscuity rather than the suffering from the
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is difficult for Americans to tell Africans how to live
their lives, Gore said, the sub-Saharan nations must embrace
condoms, sex education and abstinence. He said truckers must learn
to refrain from visiting prostitutes, and people must speak out
against the prevalence of rape and the sexual exploitation of young
girls by male teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are not successful in addressing this crisis, then the
horrendous consequences will haunt us throughout the 21st
century,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president stepped off the campaign trail and into the
spotlight of the United Nations Security Council Monday to announce
that the Clinton administration is seeking an additional $100
million from Congress to fund programs aimed at preventing the
spread of AIDS in Africa and Asia. That would bring the total US
commitment to fighting the deadly virus overseas to $325 million
annually.
</P>
<P>
   In Africa, AIDS is spread primarily through heterosexual
relations, and a growing number of observers believe that sexual
behavior is at the root of the epidemic there. At the United
Nations, Gore concentrated his remarks to the virus as an
international threat to world security. But in his interview with
the Globe, he discussed the behavior that must change in order to
beat back the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people will die of AIDS in the first decade of the 21st
century than all the soldiers killed in all the wars throughout the
20th century,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a security issue, it is a heartbreaking issue, it is an
issue that threatens every person in the world in one way or
another even if only indirectly, and it must be confronted,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was the first time that the Security Council, which
was established after World War II to prevent future wars, had ever
taken up a health pandemic. It was also the first time a sitting
vice president had presided over the international body.
</P>
<P>
   According to the United Nations, 22 million people in
sub-Saharan countries are infected with the AIDS virus. More than
12 million lives have already been lost and 11,000 new cases are
diagnosed a day. By some counts, there are 11 million orphans as a
result of AIDS. And in Zimbabwe, many funeral homes are open 24
hours a day to keep up with the demand.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston Globe series last October detailed the links between
sexual behavior in Africa and the spread of the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Eugene Rivers, a Boston minister and major player in
the effort to combat AIDS in Africa, was at the United Nations
Monday to meet with Gore and hear his address. He said $10 billion
is needed for more health clinics, more drug treatments and the
purchase of medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's an improvement, but it's inadequate,'' he said
of the administration's funding announcement. ``We need comparable
levels of financial support such as was given to Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the US dollars would go toward education and prevention
programs. The funds would also cover AIDS tests and blood screening
programs, and triple the amount spent on an inexpensive drug that
blocks the virus from being passed to infants during breast
feeding. Some funding would help pay for the care of the children
orphaned by AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In the Globe interview, Gore agreed with Rivers that the money
was not nearly enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see every nation make the kind of commitment the
US has made to help Africa,'' Gore said. ``And I'd like to see the
kind of transformation in the African societies suffering from this
disease that Reverend Gene Rivers and others have called for.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore repeatedly praised Uganda for the steps that nation has
taken in promoting the use of condoms, widespread sex education,
and the open discussion of how to prevent the disease's transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``AIDS is relatively difficult to transmit from one person to
another,'' Gore said. ``There has to be an exchange of bodily
fluids. Once that simple fact is understood clearly, then the only
other thing that is needed is widespread awareness and the constant
reinforcement of the public knowledge of what steps interrupt the
transmission.''
</P>
<P>
   That means, Gore said, talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means providing condoms, it means stigmatizing promiscuity
rather than the suffering from the disease,'' he said. ``It means
promoting responsible sexual activities and habits, it means
abstinence for those who can practice that approach, especially the
young who can be persuaded to postpone sexual activity until they
have the emotional and psychological maturity and stable
circumstances to start a family.''
</P>
<P>
   And the United States cannot go into African countries and just
tell people what to do, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in some ways difficult for Americans to tell Africans
what needs to be done here, because for years there has been not
only a stigma associated with the disease in Africa, but also a
resentment of anybody from a wealthy, developed nation trying to
give advice to poor, underdeveloped nations struggling with this
crisis,'' he said.

COMPETITORS TAKING A HASTY LOOK AT THEIR STRATEGIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ALEX BERENSON AND BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The combination of America Online and Time Warner creates a
colossus that will force competitors from Disney to AT&AMP;T to
Microsoft to reconsider their strategies.
</P>
<P>
   The deal leaves Disney, News Corp., Seagram, NBC, Viacom-CBS and
smaller old media companies with a stark choice. They can try to
carve a future alone on the Internet, a place that has so far been
inhospitable to old media companies. Or they can merge with new
media companies like Yahoo, putting their future in the hands of
businesses that hardly existed five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For AT&AMP;T, which will become the nation's largest cable company
when its takeover of MediaOne is completed, the deal creates a
major new competitor even as it gives AT&AMP;T a chance to end its
animosity with AOL. But as executives from Burbank to New York
struggle with the new calculus, the only certainty is that Time
Warner's decision to trade its shares for shares in America Online
has given a huge boost to believers in the value of new media
companies. Even a year ago, investors in old media companies would
have been reluctant to exchange their shares for those of companies
like America Online, which were perceived as inflated and ripe for
a plunge.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after three years of spectacular returns from America
Online and its kin, Internet stock has become the most valuable
currency around. Disney and CBS are generations old, and AT&AMP;T's
legacy stretches back even further. But despite having tens of
millions of customers and tens of billions of dollars in sales each
year, the old giants will have to adapt to the new rules, or risk
being left aside as the Internet becomes ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been one thing for companies to trade highly valued
paper back and forth, where actual counting was not required. It's
quite another for Internet assets to buy assets of this quality and
variety. That's quite a remarkable development,'' said Barry
Diller, the chairman of USA Networks.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in the major old media companies, including Disney,
Seagram and Viacom, rose more than 10 percent Monday, as investors
speculated that more combinations are coming.
</P>
<P>
   Painewebber analyst Chris Dixon said AOL Time Warner would have
advantages over its competitors in three crucial areas _ its direct
connections with subscribers, the depth of the content it can offer
its subscribers and viewers, and its ability to reach hundreds of
millions of people daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first element is connectivity, the second element is
content, and the third element is scale, and so if you're a
strategist at another company you have to look across your company
and say how do I measure up to Time Warner-AOL in those three
elements,'' Dixon said. ``If I look at Disney, I've got content,
I've got scale, and I don't necessarily have connectivity. So do I
go out and do a deal?''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wolzien, a media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein and Co.,
said he expected Disney or Viacom, which has announced plans to
merge with CBS, to combine soon with new media partners. The most
likely candidates are Microsoft and Yahoo. Along with America
Online, Microsoft and Yahoo run the three most popular Internet
sites, while Disney and the combined Viacom/CBS are the second-and
third-largest media companies.
</P>
<P>
   While Disney, which has its own Internet portal at go.com, and
the new Viacom may want to remain independent, Wolzien warned that
the two companies will be under intense pressure to deal with
Microsoft and Yahoo. ``Suddenly, after this deal today, there's not
a lot of maneuvering room,'' Wolzien said. ``There are not that
many players here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't do a deal, you are giving somebody else a chance
to get scale and build those relationships,'' he said. ``And so
you've now created another monster to compete with you, instead of
being that monster.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees. Jessica Reif Cohen, a media analyst with
Merrill Lynch, said the entertainment companies actually hold a
significant advantage in moving toward a digital future because of
the strength of their brands, from television networks to film
studios to specific television franchises like ``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a desperate need to make a deal,'' she said,
noting that the media companies like Disney and Viacom have plans
to grow their brands on the Internet, including Viacom's plans to
spin off its MTV brand into an independent public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, AT&AMP;T may be the company that faces the biggest immediate
impact from the merger. In the last two years, the phone giant has
spent more than $100 billion to turn itself into the largest cable
operator in the United States. It is spending billions of dollars
more to upgrade its cable systems, with the goal of offering a
basket of local, long distance, cable and high-speed Internet
service through its cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's plan has brought the company into conflict with AOL and
other Internet service providers, which claim AT&AMP;T should be forced
to offer ``open access'' to any Internet provider through its cable
lines, instead of forcing its customers to pay extra for providers
other than its partners. The question has sparked several lawsuits.
Now AT&AMP;T will have to decide whether it can continue to antagonize
AOL, which would become the nation's No. 2 cable company if it
bought Time Warner. AT&AMP;T badly needs access to Time Warner's cable
lines so that it can offer its local phone service in areas where
Time Warner is the cable operator. Making matters even more
complicated is the fact that AT&AMP;T will soon own a piece of Time
Warner through its MediaOne purchase.
</P>
<P>
   But Wolzien said he thought AT&AMP;T and AOL would reach agreement
because the two companies both have too much at stake to allow the
dispute to linger. He looks for a deal where AT&AMP;T will trade its
stake in Time Warner back to AOL in return for more cable assets,
the chance to provide local phone service through Time Warner
lines, and a settlement of the open-access dispute.

TAKE A TRIP WITH KCET's HED GOES HERE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking on a map at the stretch of highway between L.A. and Las
Vegas, most people think, ``pedal to the metal.'' Huell Howser,
longtime chronicler of So Cal culture through such public TV series
as ``California's Gold'' and ``Visiting With ... Huell Howser''
thinks: ``road trip.'' That means going where the road takes you,
seeing the sights and talking to the locals.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to funding from the Southern California Automobile
Association, Howser is going to be doing this on tape six times
this year for the four public television stations in the region
(including Los Angeles' KCET). The premiere episode, airing
tonight, sees Howser heading out the I-15 in Barstow, discovering
historic hotels, eateries and ghost towns along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think exploring our area used to happen a lot more in
Southern California,'' said Howser, sitting in his office at KCET
in Hollywood. ``People used to go out with their families for a
Sunday drive. The whole beauty of our part of the country is that
there are great places all around us, within a couple of hours, for
a day trip. We should slow down and smell the roses more.''
</P>
<P>
   After stopping at the California Welcome Center in Barstow to
inquire about notable sights, Howser dropped in on the historic El
Rancho Motel, the world's first Del Taco, the rebuilt Calico Ghost
Town and the Calico Early Man Archeological Site, among other
things. ``We had a few ideas ahead of time of things we wanted to
see, but, for the most part, it was totally unscripted,'' said
Howser.
</P>
<P>
   The next installment, in March, will see Howser exploring the
area around the Ventura County town of Fillmore. Further episodes,
Howser says, have yet to be determined. Howser and crew are looking
at the entire swath of the Golden State south of Fresno and north
of the Mexico Border for inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, we're really doing this by the seat of our pants,''
Howser said. ``We hope we can dispel people's notion that there's
nothing out there on some of these stretches of highway; get them
to slow down, get off the road and look around. We want to show
them that even something as supposedly desolate and uninviting as
the stretch of highway from Barstow to Vegas can be a rich
experience.'' &QL; 
____ &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The show: ``Road Trip With Huell Howser.'' &QL; 
When: 7:30 tonight. &QL;

 &HT;    Edwards' trial gets underway
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. _ The gambling corruption trial of Edwin
Edwards, the flamboyant four-term former Louisiana governor, and
six co-defendants got off to a slow start Monday in a federal
courthouse in the state capital.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 residents of nine parishes made up the pool of
prospective jurors and it will take up to a week for the defense
and prosecution teams to choose a jury. The prospective jurors are
anonymous, labeled with numbers, but they had to reveal certain
details about themselves. Among them are a lawyer, an educator, a
mechanic, a grandmother and a stripper.
</P>
<P>
   The stripper, prospective juror number 318 in a tight red
sweater, almost stole the show from Edwards, who at his past two
trials in the 1980s entertained the public with wisecracks before
and after each day's sessions. Edwards walked away a free man after
those trials _ which were not related to the current charges _ but
many observers think the federal government's case is much stronger
this time. The evidence includes more than 1,000 hours of secretly
recorded audio and videotapes of Edwards and the others charged.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, 72, his older son, Stephen, and five other
co-defendants face 34 charges stemming from seven alleged schemes
to extort money from riverboat casino operators in exchange for
favorable rulings from the state casino licensing board. The
schemes allegedly took place between 1991 and 1998, during and
after Edwards's last term as governor. They involve five existing
and proposed casinos around the state. Only 15 riverboat casinos
are allowed to operate in the state at one time.
</P>
<P>
   Among the defendants are state Sen. Greg Tarver, who ran
unopposed last fall to keep his seat and had to leave the trial for
an hour or so Monday to be sworn in. Also indicted is Ecotry
Fuller, a member of the state licensing board.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards was subdued outside the courthouse before the trial; his
wife, Candy, says he has been battling the flu. But he did say he
was not not anxious and is very confident he will be exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   ''I dislike spending my time and my money in this endeavor but
this is the system,'' he said. ''I respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial is expected to last three months.

 &HT;    This time, reading Bush's lips may be sure thing
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Given his father's experience with ironclad tax
pledges, Gov. George W. Bush seemed to tempt political fate in
Thursday night's presidential debate when he swore to cut taxes,
going even further than his dad's ``read my lips, no new taxes''
pledge.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush ended up breaking that pledge, a central theme of
his 1988 campaign, enraging conservatives and contributing to his
defeat in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But the younger Bush's ``tax cuts, so help me God'' oath may be
a smart _ even safe _ tactical move.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a little bit like promising that the sun will rise
tomorrow,'' said Robert Reischauer, of the Washington-based
Brookings Institution, a self-described nonpartisan think tank.
</P>
<P>
   The promise likely will be easy to fulfill because of projected
budget surpluses. It also could shore up Bush's conservative
credentials and inoculate him against lingering resentment over his
father's broken promise, some observers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unlikely that all of those surpluses will be used to
reduce debt or increase spending, so it's a pretty safe assertion
that there will be some tax cuts of some size,'' said Reischauer,
who headed the Congressional Budget Office from 1989-95.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has proposed a tax-cut plan of $483 billion over five
years, made his pledge during the opening moments of Thursday's
debate in New Hampshire, a traditional hotbed of anti-tax
sentiment. A reporter from the hard-line conservative Manchester
Union Leader asked Bush whether his anti-tax position was ``one of
convenience rather than conviction,'' and whether he might cancel
his proposed tax cuts or even raise taxes if the economy slows
down.
</P>
<P>
   Bush responded unequivocally.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a recession, it's important to cut the taxes to
make sure our economy grows,'' he said. ``It's also important to
cut the taxes when there's apparent times of plenty as an insurance
policy against an economic slowdown.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this no new taxes, so help me God?'' the reporter asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not only no new taxes _ this is tax cuts so help me
God,'' Bush replied.
</P>
<P>
   Bush reiterated his position Friday morning, arguing that he
promised to cut taxes when he unveiled his tax-cut plan last month.
</P>
<P>
   But encapsulating the pledge in an easy-to-remember catch phrase
raises the stakes. Earlier in the campaign, Bush appeared reluctant
to take such a tack. Last June, his aides said he wouldn't sign a
letter to a national taxpayer-rights group promising to oppose any
income tax increase. A few days later, after the governor was
attacked in the New Hampshire media, he signed the letter.
</P>
<P>
   An account of Thursday's debate posted on Bush's Web site
described his pledge as ``Reaganesque,'' and it may help Bush blunt
attacks from the right by GOP rival Steve Forbes, who launched a
new TV ad Friday questioning Bush's Texas tax record. Bush often
says that he signed the two biggest state tax cuts in Texas
history, which is true, but some argue that increases in other
taxes and fees erased much of the benefit for taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The promise also may help Bush against his closest rival,
Arizona Sen. John McCain, by allowing him to portray himself as a
more dedicated conservative on taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator McCain is the one who said that it's too excessive,
and that's the same thing Al Gore has said,'' Bush spokesman Scott
McClellan said of McCain's attacks on Bush's tax plan during
Thursday's debate.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Moore, of the conservative Cato Institute in Washington,
said, ``I was impressed with Bush in terms of his really coming out
aggressively as the anti-tax candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls taken during last year's debate over tax cuts showed that
most people prefer eliminating the national debt and saving Social
Security to large tax cuts. Bush says his cuts wouldn't preclude
either, a contention that got a boost Friday when analysts
predicted that federal budget surpluses for the next decade could
be up to $800 billion larger than last year's $3 trillion
estimate.Scott S. Greenberger writes for the Austin

TAKE A TRIP WITH KCET's HUELL HOWSER 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: FIXES bad hed. Embargoed until Wednesday, Jan. 12. In the
story, tonight is Wednesday. 
(Eds: Fact box below) By MARLA MATZER ROSE 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking on a map at the stretch of highway between L.A. and Las
Vegas, most people think, ``pedal to the metal.'' Huell Howser,
longtime chronicler of So Cal culture through such public TV series
as ``California's Gold'' and ``Visiting With ... Huell Howser''
thinks: ``road trip.'' That means going where the road takes you,
seeing the sights and talking to the locals.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to funding from the Southern California Automobile
Association, Howser is going to be doing this on tape six times
this year for the four public television stations in the region
(including Los Angeles' KCET). The premiere episode, airing
tonight, sees Howser heading out the I-15 in Barstow, discovering
historic hotels, eateries and ghost towns along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think exploring our area used to happen a lot more in
Southern California,'' said Howser, sitting in his office at KCET
in Hollywood. ``People used to go out with their families for a
Sunday drive. The whole beauty of our part of the country is that
there are great places all around us, within a couple of hours, for
a day trip. We should slow down and smell the roses more.''
</P>
<P>
   After stopping at the California Welcome Center in Barstow to
inquire about notable sights, Howser dropped in on the historic El
Rancho Motel, the world's first Del Taco, the rebuilt Calico Ghost
Town and the Calico Early Man Archeological Site, among other
things. ``We had a few ideas ahead of time of things we wanted to
see, but, for the most part, it was totally unscripted,'' said
Howser.
</P>
<P>
   The next installment, in March, will see Howser exploring the
area around the Ventura County town of Fillmore. Further episodes,
Howser says, have yet to be determined. Howser and crew are looking
at the entire swath of the Golden State south of Fresno and north
of the Mexico Border for inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, we're really doing this by the seat of our pants,''
Howser said. ``We hope we can dispel people's notion that there's
nothing out there on some of these stretches of highway; get them
to slow down, get off the road and look around. We want to show
them that even something as supposedly desolate and uninviting as
the stretch of highway from Barstow to Vegas can be a rich
experience.'' &QL; 
____ &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The show: ``Road Trip With Huell Howser.'' &QL; 
When: 7:30 tonight. &QL; 
Where:!off! KCET. &QL;

MCCAIN FIELDS CURVEBALL QUESTIONS WITH _ CURVEBALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLAND, Mich. _ The Straight Talk Express, Sen. John McCain's
campaign bus, rolled up to a Christian liberal arts college here to
deliver the Arizona Republican to yet another town meeting-style
forum, one of nearly 100 he has participated in since lauching his
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   Although the anti-abortion candidate gave some predictable
answers, not all of what he offered the religious-bent audience was
what they expected _ of him or anyone else running for president _
reinforcing his image as a free-thinking contrarian.
</P>
<P>
   One voter, inquiring about the ethics of selling fetal tissue
for research, made it clear he was against the practice.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain, with a long anti-abortion record, offered this
response: ``Fetal tissue research, correctly carried out, is
appropriate.'' However, the candidate did say the sale of tissue,
used for such things as finding a cure for Alzheimer's disease, is
``reprehensible.''
</P>
<P>
   After one question, which was more of a statement, about whether
McCain supports bonuses for social workers that remove children
from families, McCain reiterated his position on Elian Gonzalez,
the Cuban boy who fled to Miami with his mother. The boy survived
the journey, clinging for two days to an inner tube; his mother
drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Although Attorney General Janet Reno said the boy should be
returned to his father on his native island, McCain essentially
said living free in America outweighs the parent's right to get his
son back, a position that raised a few eyebrows in the crowded
auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``This young boy's mother sacrificed her life,'' McCain said.
``Let the father come to the United States, spend a couple days
here and then declare he wants to go back to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   The line, said forcefully, surprisingly won him some applause.
</P>
<P>
   Voters also dragged McCain into the issue of installing software
to screen pornography from school and library computers connected
to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   One questioner suggested that the software is fallable and could
screen out valuable websites, infringing on First Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   McCain brushed off the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Software is becoming more and more sophisticated,'' said
McCain, who claims his New Year's resolution is to know more about
what his own children are doing, especially on the Internet. The
Senator filed legislation last year to shield children from X-rated
sites.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the Pentagon's School of the Americas, which has
trained the likes of Manuel Noriega? Shouldn't it be closed for
teaching people how to kill and praising those who do? Philip Beal,
a local resident, wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I would not'' close the school, McCain said without
hesitation. ``For us to not want to instill principles of freedom
and democracy . . . is not something I would support.''
</P>
<P>
   Beal, 63, said he got what he wanted: An answer, and a straight
one at that, which is something he appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't pander,'' Beal conceded after the hourlong town
meeting. ``He answered according to his own convictions. I hope he
beats George Bush in the primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean Beal will vote for McCain? Probably not he said;
he's a democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The curve ball of the day was about whether Atlanta Braves
pitcher John Rocker should have a psychological test after making
denigrating remarks about minorities, children, New Yorkers,
immigrants and homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I don't know how closely you've followed this
campaign,'' McCain deadpanned, ``but they were alleging I was nuts.
I didn't think I needed it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the one question he dodged.

<P>
   Does this story sound familiar? A young man borrows money from
friends and family to start a company that he contends will
revolutionize the world and end information overload for the
majority of Americans. After some lean years, he becomes one of the
richest and most powerful men on the planet, and his company
dominates its field.
</P>
<P>
   No, this is not the saga of Bill Gates _ or even Steve Case. The
hero of this tale is Henry Luce, who with Briton Hadden founded
Time Inc. in the early 1920s. Since then, for better and sometimes
for worse, Time has been in the forefront of almost every
technological change in what is now called ``the media business,''
but back then was known as ``newspapering.''
</P>
<P>
   Luce's Time Inc. ``was tremendously important in shaping the way
much of the American news media came to cover news,'' said James
Baughman, a professor of journalism at the University of Wisconsin
in Madison.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s most newspapers were somewhat like the Internet:
vast compendiums of information, including shipping schedules,
stock prices, transcripts of political speeches, and reports of
freak accidents and fires. No one, Luce said, had the time (or the
patience) to sift through all the available information and figure
out what was important.
</P>
<P>
   So Time, the magazine, would do it. And thus, in 1923, was born
the first information ``portal,'' the America Online of its day.
The magazine's stories were often mere snippets, written in a
snappy style, with lots of interpretation and a focus on
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Business figures _ especially those who ran the great American
corporation _ became popular subjects; Fortune magazine began
appearing in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech cameras (they were portable, and did not need
reloading after every shot!) and new developments in printing led
to the introduction of Life in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   Time Inc. was even a pioneer in radio with ``The March of
Time,'' a sort of on-air newsreel that mostly served to advertise
the magazine, and which quickly became a real newsreel, shown in
movie theaters (it won a special Oscar in 1937.)
</P>
<P>
   By the 1940s the Time approach to news had become so accepted
that people almost forgot that it was once unknown. And Luce had
become so prominent (and well-to-do) that he felt comfortable
lecturing his fellow citizens about their global responsibilities
in ``The American Century,'' his influential essay published in
Time in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   As the 1950s rolled around, ``Time magazine sat on most of the
coffee tables in the country, it seemed,'' said Mitchell Stephens,
a professor of journalism at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   Time's stable of magazines, which by 1954 included Sports
Illustrated, ``were the media that seemed to unify the country,''
Stephens said, adding that the magazines were not universally
acclaimed. ``I had a teacher who said that Time was for people who
can't think, and Life was for people who can't read.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading, however, was not the issue in the 1960s, when broadcast
television began to dominate Americans' hearts and minds. Time Inc.
bought TV and radio stations, which contributed significantly to
the company's profits. But TV also competed with Life for its mass
audience and the advertisers who were anxious to reach millions. In
1972 the weekly Life magazine ended.
</P>
<P>
   Cable television, however, had practically been invented by
Time, which created Home Box Office to beam B-movies into homes in
Wilkes-Barre, Pa. In 1975 the service went national with the
broadcast of the Ali-Frazier fight (aka the Thrilla from Manila).
Three years later the company bought American Telcom and
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   By 1980 television profits surpassed those from magazine
publishing at Time Inc. And throughout the decade, Time became more
of a ``media conglomerate.'' After turning down the chance to buy
Ted Turner's Cable News Network in 1985, Time helped bail out
Turner Broadcasting in 1987, and ended up with a 20 percent stake
in that operation. In the mid-1990s, it bought the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   But by that time, Time had already merged with Warner, an
operator of funeral parlors and parking lots that in 1969 had
bought Warner Bros., the movie studio and cartoon empire. It also
owned, at least temporarily, a lot of other stuff, including the
video-game maker Atari, the Franklin Mint and the Pittsburgh
Pirates, according to the company's official in-house history.
</P>
<P>
   It took Time Warner almost a decade to work its way out from
under the mountain of debt it had used to buy Warner, and to make
peace with shareholders infuriated by that deal.
</P>
<P>
   As the corporation grew, its original mainspring, Time, became
less and less important, at least to the company's profits. It is
impossible to know what Luce, who died in 1967, would have made of
that, or of his brainchild's decision to merge with America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Luce did have misgivings about technological developments and
resented the fact that the newsreels reached a wider audience than
his magazine. ``Luce more than once said, `My heart is in print,'''
said Baughman, who wrote a book about Luce and is working on a
television documentary about him.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, perhaps the future of print is, indeed,
digital. ``It's these geeks who keep talking about content
providers,'' said Baughman, who now reads online magazines like
Salon and Slate. ``I keep telling my students, you're still going
to have to be able to write, you're still going to have to know
punctuation, regardless of the medium.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The last few months have been a boom time for UFO
enthusiasts in China.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the start of the year 2000, there were dozens of
sightings. Strange shining objects were observed scooting through
the sky by hundreds of people, from former airport workers to
college deans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warning Wuhan! Warning Dalian! Warning Xian! Jiangsu! Beijing!
Shanghai!'' exulted the Jiangsu UFO Research Society Web site.
``Frequent UFO visits have enveloped all of China.''
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed in part by the sightings, the ranks of the research
societies in major Chinese cities devoted to unidentified flying
objects have grown to more than 40,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   More important still, the normally conservative official news
media have been lavishing attention on UFO news, with documentaries
on the main government television station, CCTV-1, and credulous
newspaper articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of interest and acceptance is rising rapidly,'' said
Sun Shili, a retired Foreign Ministry official who is chairman of
the Beijing UFO Research Society. ``Because of the frequent
sightings recently in Beijing, Shanghai and other cities that have
had many witnesses, even the media _ which are very serious and
careful _ have been paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in many ways it would seem a most awkward time for
fleets of extraterrestrials to be buzzing China, what with the
government jailing leaders of the Falun Gong spiritual movement,
and a few other groups that favor traditional Qigong exercises as a
health measure, for ``superstitious'' and ``anti-scientific''
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, at least, the government has decided to tolerate the
UFO craze, even if it does not financially support it. Wildly
popular and politically unthreatening, UFO research is the kind of
unorthodox pursuit that is allowed in China today. Anyway,
government officials and citizens alike tend to view UFO research
as science _ or at least as possibly scientific.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study of UFOs is fundamentally different from other things
like Falun Gong and Qigong, which have come under criticism
lately,'' said Jin Fan, an engineer who heads the Dalian UFO
Research Society in Northeast China. ``This is a purely scientific
field, whereas Falun Gong deals with cults and superstition.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most of China's UFO enthusiasts are scientists and
engineers, not the sci-fi buffs or apocalyptic stargazers who are
the stereotype in the United States. Many of China's UFO research
societies require a college degree and published research for
membership. The Chinese Air Force attends important UFO meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our conditions for membership weren't so strict, we'd have
millions of members by now,'' said Sun, a cheerful intellectual in
a gray sweater and striped tie, who seems to embody the movement _
a bit offbeat, yes, but also scholarly, serious and strictly
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   In his cluttered Beijing study, he proudly displays both
photographs of himself interpreting for Chairman Mao and models of
the Nordic Alien and the Roswell alien, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Applauding the Chinese government's ``enlightened and practical
attitude,'' Sun said: ``In the U.S., scholars investigating this
are under pressure and have been derided. But in China, the
academic discussion is quite free, so in this area American
academics are quite jealous of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The cluster of dozens of sightings in the last four months has
given China's enthusiasts new grist for discussions. Most of the
sightings involved glowing, orange-yellow objects that were
reported to have lingered in the late- afternoon or night sky for
more than 15 minutes before disappearing in an instant.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where camcorders and cameras are now common
household equipment, many were captured on film, which found its
way into newspapers and onto television.
</P>
<P>
   Jin videotaped some suspected UFOs over Dalian on Dec. 25. ``I
believe what I saw was a UFO based on its pattern of movement, its
glow, its shape and its appearance,'' he said. ``It had substance
and dimensionality _ it was clearly an object.''
</P>
<P>
   Jin, an engineer, said that the turns and dips made by the
objects _ as well as their rapid acceleration _ could not have been
made by manmade planes or rockets, and the sighting was on a clear
day. Anyway, he added, he has been researching the subject long
enough to distinguish UFOs from ``atmospheric phenomena.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts have various theories about the rash of UFO sightings. A
recent article in the Journal of UFO Research, published by Gansu
Science and Technology Press, notes that sightings in China peak
each year around Oct. 1, China's National Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about it, it makes a lot of sense that visitors
from an extraterrestrial civilization would come now,'' said Jin.
``We're entering a new millennium, so any extraterrestrial
civilization that's been observing us would want to document the
state of our civilization at this particular moment, as sort of a
historical snapshot.''
</P>
<P>
   He attributed the high frequency of sightings in China to its
population density. Club officials say that more than half of
Chinese are interested in UFOs and believe they might exist.
</P>
<P>
   The Beijing UFO Research Society has 280 members, and 30 percent
are Communist Party cadres or managers. The yearly research
meetings of the national UFO society are covered by reporters from
all major news media.
</P>
<P>
   But this is an extraordinary reversal in a country where, 25
years ago, life was so focused on Communist politics that most
people could not imagine anything so ethereal as an unidentified
flying object, and expressing belief in them might have been a
ticket to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Sun said, he did not appreciate his one and only UFO
sighting _ a ``bright object in the sky'' _ in 1971, when he was
sent to the countryside as a young Communist Party cadre during
Mao's Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assumed it must be some sort of monitoring device, since
relations between China and the Soviet Union were very tense at the
time,'' he said, laughing. ``It was only years later when I got
more access to foreign materials that I realized what I'd
experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others credit China's two decades of liberalization and
market reforms for allowing UFO fever to flourish. ``As China has
opened to the outside world in the last 20 years, people's thinking
has also opened,'' said Jin.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some of the current UFO research in China centers on
investigating sightings, but much of it involves trying to create
new forms of propulsion that might explain how UFOs might work.
</P>
<P>
   Sun describes with great excitement a small balloonlike device
invented by one of his members that moves faster than other
objects. Although it exists now only as a small model, the society
is planning to test it first on water and then on land and in
space.
</P>
<P>
   The research societies also share information and reports on the
quirkier aspects of UFOs, like alien abductions. They are currently
looking into the case of a Beijing worker who said that in December
he was held on an alien spacecraft for two hours, where he was
studied as part of a medical experiment.
</P>
<P>
   But Chinese UFO societies prefer to maintain a sober exterior,
often downplaying controversial topics, which they prefer to
discuss in private.
</P>
<P>
   And so, the most recent issue of the Journal of UFO Research,
published last November, scoffed at the notions of a millennial
apocalypse _ even as it carried articles on ``interstellar
migration'' and the notion that the Egyptian pyramids were
instruments for communication with extraterrestrials.
</P>
<P>
   UFO enthusiasts say they will avoid the troubles that have
befallen Qigong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very careful and cautious to present things
scientifically and to filter out things that head in a
superstitious direction,'' said Sun, ``since there's a great deal
of fakery in the UFO field, as well as real occurrence.''

EDITORIAL: THE BIGGEST MEDIA MERGER YET 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Jan. 11:
</P>
<P>
   Everything about the $165-billion takeover of Time Warner by
America Online is big. AOL is the largest Internet company. Time
Warner is the largest media and entertainment company. Their
proposed marriage will be the largest corporate merger in history.
The implications of this merger are big too, for the way stocks are
valued, for the way information services reach consumers, and
perhaps for the way entertainment, politics and journalism evolve
in a 21st-century corporate environment.
</P>
<P>
   Some parts of the picture are clearer than others. The Internet
stock boom looks less ephemeral today. For the consumer the deal
poses no grave threat, because the companies operate in separate
businesses. With or without the merger, consumers will eventually
get a broad range of Internet services over high-speed cable wires.
They will now get these services more quickly and probably more
cheaply, and with a broader choice.
</P>
<P>
   That is one result of a potent delivery-content marriage like
this one. AOL serves 20 million Internet subscribers. Time Warner
serves 13 million cable subscribers and owns magazines, movie and
music studios and cable channels with powerful brand names. AOL
wants to expand its services to include Time Warner's news and
entertainment programs and to provide Internet service over Time
Warner's high-speed cable wires rather than slow-speed telephone
wires. Time Warner wants to tap AOL's Internet customers, a market
that advertisers crave but that Time Warner has been unable to
create on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Because the companies do not compete for the same customers, the
merger is not expected to encounter antitrust problems. Yet there
is a consumer threat that, to their credit, Steve Case, AOL's
chairman, and Gerald Levin, Time Warner's chairman, flagged at
Monday's news conference and promised to solve. The issue is known
as open access. By law, customers who tap into the Internet over
telephone wires are provided nondiscriminatory access to the
Internet service provider of their choice. But cable companies are
under no legal obligation to provide nondiscriminatory access,
posing the danger that they will control the content of the news
and information that flows into homes by controlling the Internet
service provider.
</P>
<P>
   Case has lobbied the federal government to require cable
companies to provide open access. But until now, Case was on the
outside of the cable world looking in. Now he will own the cable
wires himself, and he promised Monday to commit the new company to
open access. That is an important pledge that regulatory
authorities need to monitor closely.
</P>
<P>
   With open access, there is little economic reason to fear the
merger. But there remains a gnawing anxiety about the societal
impact of these huge media mergers. Continued consolidation among
companies the size of Disney and ABC, Time Warner and AOL, MCI and
Worldcom do not have to monopolize broadcasting, entertainment or
Internet service markets to pose a serious threat. The mere
creation of corporate behemoths is a danger in a country whose laws
permit companies to buy political influence. The remedy to this
political threat is not to scuttle mergers, but rather to fix
campaign contribution laws.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges that these big, multifaceted companies represent
for journalism are just now coming into focus. For decades
journalists, readers and viewers have been coming to grips with the
concentration of ownership in newspaper chains and networks. In
that environment, maintaining a wall between advertising and news
departments has worked well. But building walls among the multiple
compartments of these new information, entertainment and marketing
giants may not be so simple. Monday Case said he was teaching Levin
about ``Internet time'' and Levin was teaching him about
journalistic tradition. That is an interchange that will have to
take place not just in their company, but all across a media world
that is being reshaped more rapidly than anyone could have
predicted.

JUSTICES REJECT APPEAL OF HIV SUFFERERS AGAINST INSURANCE CMYANY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday rejected the appeal of
two ill men and allowed an insurance company to provide people with
HIV and AIDS substantially less medical coverage than it gives to
victims of other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The justices also refused, without comment, to let unions sue
tobacco companies in an effort to recover health-care costs
incurred from workers' smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In the insurer case, the justices declined to hear the case of
HIV sufferers who claim that Mutual of Omaha Insurance Co. violated
federal law by limiting to $100,000 the lifetime medical coverage
it will provide them. The company provides million-dollar coverage
to many people without the disabling, fatal diseases AIDS or its
precursor HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The court's refusal to hear the case sets no national precedent.
But the justices' denial of the appeal means that the 7th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals decision in favor of the insurance company
remains the law in the three states that court governs: Illinois,
Indiana and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The HIV sufferers had sued Mutual of Omaha, arguing that the
Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits insurance companies from
discriminating against them because they have the disease. The
insurer countered that it also limits coverage for drug-addiction
and alcoholism treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The policy-holders won in an Illinois federal court, which
concluded that Mutual of Omaha had illegally discriminated against
them because of their condition.
</P>
<P>
   But the 7th Circuit reversed, ruling that the federal law merely
prohibits insurance companies from denying disabled people access
to insurance. The anti-discrimination statute does not prevent
insurers from providing separate coverage for different illnesses,
the court said.
</P>
<P>
   The policy-holders, identified in court papers as John Doe and
Richard Smith, then lodged their unsuccessful appeal with the high
court.
</P>
<P>
   In the union case, labor groups in Pennsylvania, Oregon and New
York sued Big Tobacco under federal racketeering and anti-trust
laws in an effort to recover health-care costs sustained by their
medical plans. The 19 unions claimed tobacco companies defrauded
them by failing to disclose for many years what they knew about the
deadly health risks of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   But three federal appeals courts threw out the lawsuits. The
2nd, 3rd and 9th U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal each said that the
unions lacked legal standing to sue for the smoking-related
illnesses suffered by their members. The courts, however, said
union members may sue because they are injured parties.
</P>
<P>
   The unions' lawsuit is similar to one the Justice Department
filed against Big Tobacco last year.
</P>
<P>
   The court's refusal to hear the unions' appeal has no effect on
the federal agency's pending litigation.

COURT DELAYS BOY'S RETURN TO CUBA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Defying a ruling by immigration officials that a
6-year-old Cuban refugee be returned to his father in Cuba this
week, a judge has granted temporary custody to the boy's relatives
in Miami until a guardianship hearing can be held in March.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Rosa Rodriguez of Miami-Dade Circuit Court issued the
temporary order as part of her decision that her court had
jurisdiction over a custody petition filed last week by Florida
relatives of Elian Gonzalez, who was rescued from an inner tube
floating in the Atlantic Ocean on Thanksgiving Day. The petition
was filed by Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's paternal great-uncle, who
said the child faced ``serious and unnecessary emotional harm'' if
he was returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez set a court date of March 6 to present evidence in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always believed in the laws of this country,''
Gonzalez said after the ruling. ``We were always very positive that
a fair decision would be reached, and that's what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's petition came only days after the Immigration and
Naturalization Service ruled that Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, was the only person the agency recognized as representing
the child's best interests. The immigration service set a deadline
of Jan. 14 for the boy to be returned to his hometown of Cardenas,
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the immigration service said the agency had not
yet seen the judge's ruling and could not comment on how it would
affect the deadline. The agency and the Department of Justice are
also reviewing a legal response to a subpoena from Rep. Dan Burton,
R-Ind., that seeks to have Elian remain in this country until a
congressional hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration service had originally released Elian to the
care of his great uncle since he was rescued in November after his
mother and several other Cuban refugees died when their boat
capsized during a failed attempt to escape Cuba. Since then,
lawyers for the child have filed a request for political asylum, a
claim that could be bolstered if the great uncle succeeds in being
named his guardian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian can now experience due process, and it is a first step
in a process we have only just begun,'' said Eduardo Rasco, a
lawyer for Elian's Miami relatives. ``All we ask is that the court
hear both sides and then make a final decision.''
</P>
<P>
   While not addressing the specifics, Rodriguez said that Elian's
father would be served with copies of the court order and that he
would be asked to appear before her. She said that if he did not
attend the hearings, the decision could be ``adverse to his
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez has repeatedly insisted he would not travel
to the United States, saying that he was certain his rights as a
surviving biological parent would be upheld by any court.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ruling was greeted with exultation by Cuban exiles, who
had staged large public protests last week to prevent the boy's
return to Cuba. They had insisted that they only wanted a chance to
present in court their case for keeping the child in Miami, adding
that they feared he would be used as a political trophy by Cuban
President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very happy, very ecstatic as a community,'' said Jose
Basulto, the president of the Cuban exile group Brothers to the
Rescue and an advocate for Elian's Miami relatives. ``Even though
it is temporary, it leads us in the right direction and it leads us
to a court hearing. We will abide by the court's decision, whatever
it is, but we are not going to just sit back and let them ship
Elian to Cuba just so this country can appease Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   Family law experts were surprised by Monday's ruling, given how
the immigration service had seemed to have settled the question of
who spoke for the child. They also said that the Miami relatives
would be hard pressed to present a case that the boy should be
removed from his father, who was described by his neighbors in Cuba
as a devoted family man.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Pearlmutter, director of the Children and Youth Law
Clinic at the University of Miami, said that the Miami relatives
would have to prove that Elian's father abused, neglected or
abandoned him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that they are making a very tenuous claim that
returning Elian to Cuba where he would perhaps be deprived of
freedom and of material well being children have in this country is
sufficient basis to have the father declared unfit,'' Pearlmutter
said ``That doesn't, to me, satisfy even a prima facie case under
Florida law.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials were in meetings in the early evening and had no
immediate comment. But at a rally outside of the American Interests
Section in Havana, protesters expressed shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot imagine something like this happening in a country
where this a law,'' said Ydilsis Fernandez Mojica, who works for
the ministry of education. ``This is against humanity. What do
those people believe?''

For some reason, it's hard to believe in the Rams 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The St. Louis Rams should have nothing to prove to anybody. They
scored the third-most points in NFL history. They outscored their
opponents by 284 points, the second-highest differential in NFL
history.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams, once 250-to-1 longshots to make the Super Bowl, did
everything to earn being 6-5 Super Bowl favorites by Las Vegas
oddsmakers.
</P>
<P>
   So, please, excuse those of us who are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   But ...
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to get past the Rams' soft schedule and their lack of
playoff experience. Because of that, it is hard to believe the Rams
will advance beyond the divisional playoff round.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams did not make their schedule. They just played it.
</P>
<P>
   But ...
</P>
<P>
   Their opponents were an NFL-worst 93-163 (.363). Besides their
eight victories against NFC Worst teams, the Rams defeated
Baltimore, Cincinnati, Cleveland, the New York Giants and Chicago.
Not exactly Murderer's Row.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams played only four teams with winning records at the time
they played. Only one of those _ the Tennessee Titans _ finished
the season with a winning record. And the Titans defeated the Rams,
24-21, in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams also lost to the Detroit Lions, who finished 8-9 after
losing to the Washington Redskins in a wild-card playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams did not pick their opponents. They just beat them.
</P>
<P>
   But ...
</P>
<P>
   Yes, St. Louis led the NFL in yards (6,412) and points (526).
Consider, however, that it played only one defense that ranked in
the top 10 in total defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams rolled up 350 yards and 27 points in a season-opening
victory against the Baltimore Ravens, who finished second in total
defense.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis defense, which ended the season ranked sixth, had
only five games against offenses ranked in the top 10. Those teams
_ the 49ers, the Panthers and the Bears _ averaged 334.8 yards in
five games against the Rams, which is 41.2 yards per game more than
St. Louis' season defensive average.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams have home-field advantage. They are 8-0 in the Trans
World Dome this season, trailing for only 4 minutes, 29 seconds
there and outscoring their opponents by an average of 25 points.
</P>
<P>
   But ...
</P>
<P>
   Can the Rams defeat the Minnesota Vikings and either the Tampa
Bay Buccaneers or the Washington Redskins, and then the AFC's best
team in back-to-back-to-back games?
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis has only 12 players with playoff experience. The
Vikings reached the NFC Championship Game last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers and the Redskins don't have much playoff
experience either, but both have strengths to offset the Rams. The
Buccaneers are the NFL's third-ranked defense, and the Redskins
have the NFL's second-ranked offense.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a weird season, especially in the NFC where two 8-8
teams claimed wild-card berths. So why not the Rams?
</P>
<P>
   They were, after all, the NFL's best during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   But ...
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' 13-3 record left one lingering question: Just how good
are they?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our record speaks for itself,'' Rams defensive end Kevin
Carter said. ``We don't worry about what the critics say. All we
can really control and worry about is what we do on Sunday. When
they see us playing in the Super Bowl, then they'll really know.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Rams get to the Super Bowl, then, yes, they will have
convinced everyone that they are for real. Until then, it's really
hard to believe that St. Louis will win Super Bowl XXXIV. nn

NASDAQ CLIMBS SHARPLY IN SPILLOVER FROM MEDIA MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices posted sharp gains again Monday, spurred
in part by America Online's surprise $165 billion takeover of Time
Warner.
</P>
<P>
   The deal sparked demand for entertainment and Internet shares,
as investors piled into companies that might be merger candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which jumped 155.49 last Friday,
surpassed that one-day point record Monday, rising 167.05 points,
or 4.3 percent, to 4,049.67. With the gain, the index has regained
almost all of what it lost in the big sell-off last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the bond market begins to settle down, the stock market is
looking to see if the world has changed all that much, and it
really hasn't,'' said Peter Canelo, a U.S. investment strategist at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``It seems like it is going to be
another very strong year for earnings in the technology sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks helped to power the Dow Jones industrial
average to a new record. Led by Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Intel, the
Dow rose 49.64 points, or 0.43 percent, to 11,572.20. Walt Disney,
another Dow component that is the second-largest media and
entertainment company after Time Warner, rose 4], to 35{.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Time Warner, which jumped 25\, to 90, were the biggest
gainers on the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index. But America
Online, another S&AMP;P component, fell 2 3/16, to 71\.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P 500 index closed at 1,457.60, up 16.13 points, or 1.1
percent. And the Russell 2,000 index of small-cap stocks gained
13.58 points, or 2.78 percent, to 501.89.
</P>
<P>
   While technology shares had a good day, investors moved out of
sectors like financial services and pharmaceuticals, which
attracted interest last week.
</P>
<P>
   Still, stocks gaining in price outnumbered those that lost in
value on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq stock
market. Volume on both exchanges was heavy: on the Big Board, 1.06
billion shares changed hands. Volume on the Nasdaq stock market was
1.69 billion shares.
</P>
<P>
   The big price gains over the last two sessions have left some
traders and analysts a bit troubled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AOL/Time Warner announcement was a great catalyst, and
made people say this is the first of several deals to look forward
to,'' said Ned Collins, head trader at Daiwa Securities America.
``But a lot of us are concerned about the level of the market.
Because money is flowing in, stocks are probably going to be OK for
a period of time. The question is for how long.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The America Online announcement bolstered shares of
media-related and Internet-portal stocks like Yahoo. Yahoo, which
is expected to report its fourth-quarter results after the market
closes Tuesday, jumped 28 13/16, to 436 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom gained 4~, to 59. Seagram rose 5], to 54. CBS climbed 4
3/16, to 62 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard was the best-performing Dow stock Monday. The
stock rose 7 3/16, to 111 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   But IBM and Intel, two other technology giants, also registered
solid gains. IBM gained 4[, to 118 7/16. And Intel, which is
expected to report its fourth-quarter results later this week, was
up 3}, to 85}.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bad day, in general, for big drug and financial
services companies.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson fell 1 11/16, to 94 1/16; Merck lost 2 3/16,
to 72}; and Bristol-Myers Squibb shed }, to 67}.
</P>
<P>
   Among financial services companies, J.P. Morgan lost 2{, to 120
5/16. Chase Manhattan declined 1\, to 71{. And Bank of America fell
1 13/16, to 46~.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, PE Corp.'s Celera Genomics Group soared 52 9/16, to
239{, after the company said it had sequenced more than 90 percent
of the material in the human genome, the genetic blueprint for the
human body. Celera said its scientists were on track to complete
its sequencing of the human genome this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Aon was a big loser. The insurance broker fell 12|, to 30[,
after it said its fourth quarter profit would fall substantially
short of Wall Street forecasts because of charges stemming from a
pending legal settlement and slumping sales.

RANGERS GM UNAWARE OF SELE INJURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers general manager Doug Melvin said he
is surprised the Baltimore Orioles might have concerns about
pitcher Aaron Sele's health.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles were expected to announce last week they had signed
Sele to a four-year, $29 million contract. But the contract was
contingent on Sele passing a physical, and the Orioles saw enough
concern with the results to seek a second opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any reason why he should be hurt,'' Melvin said.
``We felt confident. I was a little surprised when I heard this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had offered Sele a four-year, $28 million deal and
held it open for almost two months before they signed free-agent
pitcher Kenny Rogers. Melvin said the Rangers would have had Sele
take a physical as well even though they saw no signs of him being
hurt at the end of last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do any of these deals, you have to have a physical,''
Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers also took a physical before his contract with the Rangers
was completed.
</P>
<P>
   Sele was 18-8 with a 4.79 earned-run average in 33 starts and
205 innings for the Rangers last year. He missed time in 1996
because of a strained rib cage muscle and missed most of 1995
because of shoulder tendinitis, but he has been injury-free the
past three years. nn

CHIEF JUDGE SEEKS TO ALTER STATE COURT SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ New York's chief judge said Monday that she would
appoint a special investigator to look into whether judges favor
lawyers with strong political party ties in making lucrative court
assignments throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Judge Judith Kaye said her decision was spurred by
disclosures made by two lawyers with strong ties to the Brooklyn
Democratic Party in New York City, who complained in a letter to
party leaders that after years of sharing in legal fees springing
from such assignments, they had been cut out.
</P>
<P>
   The letter shed some light on a practice that lawyers rarely
speak openly about but which is taken for granted in the state's
legal circles: Some judges who must run for election are sponsored
by their parties. Lawyers who are active in political parties are
routinely assigned cases to oversee by local judges. Most often the
lawyers are assigned receiverships, to manage failed businesses and
property that has been foreclosed on, work that can bring sizable
fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public confidence in the courts is put at risk when judicial
appointments are based on considerations other than merit,'' said
Judge Kaye, using what was, for her, unusually sharp language.
``Simply put, the public must have faith that the courts operate
free of favoritism and partiality.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Kaye, who presides over the Court of Appeals and oversees
the entire state court system, said the new investigator would be
appointed within 30 days and would have broad-ranging powers,
including the ability to subpoena records involving court
appointments of lawyers. Court administrators said it was only the
third time that a chief judge in New York state had named an
independent investigator to look into the affairs of the court.
</P>
<P>
   In her annual address to members of the judiciary, Judge Kaye
also called for reducing the backlog of misdemeanor cases clogging
the court system by hiring 23 new judges in New York City,
expanding drug and community courts throughout the state and
changing the law so that many misdemeanor cases would be resolved
by judges instead of through the lengthier jury trial process.
</P>
<P>
   The most far-reaching measure would give prosecutors and judges
the option of reducing the maximum sentence for some misdemeanor
cases to six months from one year, so that the cases would
automatically be heard by judges if they still went to trial. State
law provides that a defendant facing a year or more in prison must
be allowed to choose a jury trial, which can be much longer and
costlier than one heard by a judge.
</P>
<P>
   The change would require the approval of the Legislature and
Gov. George Pataki. Its fate is highly uncertain, given that the
governor, a Republican, has sought to increase penalties for
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's recommendation comes at a time when the court system
_ particularly in New York City _ is overwhelmed by large numbers
of misdemeanor cases ranging from disorderly conduct and
shoplifting to fare-beating on subways.
</P>
<P>
   The backlog has frequently forced prosecutors to offer
defendants lighter sentences in exchange for guilty pleas and their
agreement to waive the right to jury trials.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Kaye said her proposal would reduce the need for
plea-bargaining, expedite the disposition of minor offenses and
increase the court system's capacity to handle more serious cases.
She did not specify which offenses should have reduced sentences,
saying that this would be left to the discretion of prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where trials are appropriate, the situation is very
fundamentally changed,'' she said. ``It is not at all to speed up
the process. I am not recommending a McJustice.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge's aides also said the proposal would not result in
unduly lenient sentences, since few misdemeanor defendants draw
sentences longer than six months.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The chief judge also outlined a series of other judicial
proposals that included offering incentives to lawyers who work on
cases pro bono, or without pay, and using nearly $70 million in
state fees assessed on traffic and criminal violations to offset
raises for lawyers handling court-appointed cases. Many of these
measures would require new legislation or money authorized by state
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Spencer, a spokesman for the Court of Appeals, said the
judiciary budget for the next fiscal year requests an estimated $30
million in additional state and federal funding, $18 million of
which would increase the number of judges handling misdemeanors in
New York City from 75 to 98. The judiciary has asked for $8 million
to double the number of drug courts from 15 to 30, and $4 million
to expand the community courts.
</P>
<P>
   However, Spencer added, existing money would be used to pay for
the new special investigator and other measures dealing with
patronage in the court system, which will be implemented within the
next month. Chief Administrative Judge Jonathan Lippman will be
directing administrative judges around the state to monitor
appointments in their districts and an advisory panel will examine
the current rules governing these appointments.

CHICKEN'S REAL, STUDY ISN'T, UNH SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No, the Colonel's secret fried-chicken recipe does not include
genetically modified organisms with no beaks, feathers or feet.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, the University of New Hampshire started getting
calls about a study supposedly done at UNH on Kentucky Fried
Chicken with some ``upsetting'' results.
</P>
<P>
   According to an e-mail bouncing around the Internet, Kentucky
Fried Chicken had started calling itself KFC because it no longer
used real chickens in its ``finger lickin' good'' products.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail claims KFC uses featherless, beakless and feetless
genetically altered organisms that are kept alive by tubes, so
different from real chickens that the company cannot legally call
them chickens. These organisms have bone structures so small, the
e-mail states, that KFC can use more meat and save on production
costs.
</P>
<P>
   But both the University of New Hampshire and KFC said it is an
Internet hoax. ``There isn't a study,'' said Kim Billings, a UNH
spokeswoman. ``We are in the middle of hosting the presidential
debates (last week) and we start getting these calls about KFC.''
Billings said she has even gotten a call from the legal office of
DuPont Corp. asking if there was such a study.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Cerny, UNH's senior information technology manager, had to
post information last Wednesday on the school's Web page refuting
the claim.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the ``chicken hoax'' web link off the main UNH home
page got about 10,500 hits, and continues to get about 15 to 18
hits per minute per day.
</P>
<P>
   Cerny said that other fast-food chains have dealt with their own
urban legends, such as claims of worm meat in McDonald's burgers,
and pregnant roaches in Taco Bell's tacos. Years ago, there was a
story that KFC's products were really made up of fried rat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The genetically engineered bit just brings the story up to
date,'' said Cerny.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is to say that no chicken research goes on at UNH.
Colette Janson-Sand, associate professor of nutrition at UNH, said
there is one person doing poultry research and the university does
breed some chickens for cancer-related research. Janson-Sand said
she has received hoax-prompted calls from England and a woman from
Georgia who was ``pretty hysterical because she went to KFC three
times a week.''
</P>
<P>
   KFC said it changed its name from Kentucky Fried Chicken in 1991
because the chain had begun to serve non-fried chicken dishes, such
as roasted chicken and pot pies.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tierney, spokesman for KFC, said he got his first call
on the story between Christmas and New Year's. KFC computer
specialists, he said, were able to trace ``the beakless,
feetless,'' hoax back to last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I picked myself off the floor from laughing so hard, I
assured the caller that we use the same suppliers that consumers
buy from and trust,'' Tierney said, for the 581 million KFC
chickens consumed worldwide each year.
</P>
<P>
   As for Colonel Harland Sanders himself, he was not
bio-engineered, but he did not come by his ``colonel'' in the
service of Uncle Sam. The Indiana native was annointed a Kentucky
Colonel in 1935 by Governor Ruby Laffoon in recognition of his
contribution to the state's cuisine.

CNN, TIME MAGAZINE AMONG BUSINESSES AFFECTED BY MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI and BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The America Online-Time Warner merger was such a closely guarded
secret that even the journalists who work for Time Warner, from its
magazines likes Time, Fortune and Money, to its television channels
like CNN, had no inkling it was about to happen. But it became
clear as the news spread Monday that the deal would have a
potentially enormous impact on the company's individual units.
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate was seen for CNN, which would benefit from
the promotional strength offered by AOL's 20 million subscribers. A
huge impact, if not immediate, is also expected for Time Warner's
music division, which will become the first major record company to
be so closely affiliated with an Internet company with an ability
to deliver music online.
</P>
<P>
   One executive, who was involved in the deal but insisted on
anonymity, foresaw CNN becoming the key anchor of AOL's news area.
``The news area may be renamed CNN. Or I could envision a new area
that has the look and feel of CNN on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the clear goals for AOL has been to become more and
more important globally,'' said one senior executive who was
involved in the merger deal. ``And there is no more global brand
than CNN. The reality is that CNN will be part of a super charge
forward internationally by AOL.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the deal is completed, CNN is likely to be prominently
cross-promoted to Internet users by AOL, and CNN would
cross-promote AOL's services during its programs.
</P>
<P>
   AOL has an existing deal with CBS to be its broadcast news
partner. The executive involved in the merger agreement said, ``The
CBS deal is for a finite period of time.'' He added quickly, ``AOL
won't be making any efforts to push partners out. That would
obviously bring some interest on the anti-trust side. But the
agreement with CBS is for the USA only. AOL could do a CNN
international connection.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive said that news stories _ rather than appearing on
CNN first, then in a reformatted version online later _ could be
delivered to several news platforms simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   But executives at CNN emphasized that the chief executives at
both AOL and Time Warner had given complete assurances that CNN's
journalistic mission would not be compromised.
</P>
<P>
   The Warner Music Group, which has been in a free fall recently,
could also be transformed by the promotional and digital
distribution opportunities of AOL.
</P>
<P>
   It is that digital technology _ the ability of consumers to
easily and quickly download music directly off the internet _ that
prompted Robert W. Pittman, the president and chief operating
officer of AOL, to predict Monday that the new company will be
``doing for the next decade what the CD did for the 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin said that because ``the music business is built on
exhibition,'' the merger with AOL would allow Warner Bros.
unprecedented promotional access to the millions of AOL daily
viewers. He also pointed out the benefit of finding musical talent
through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third, it's not an accident that music lends itself to
electronic commerce as a packaged good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Nathanson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co.,
said that the new alignment catapults Time-Warner and its ailing
music division onto a different plane and may change the
recorded-music industry at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL was happy to sell their audience eyeballs to other
companies trying to sell their own music,'' he said. ``But they
were not trying to advance the industry in terms of consumer
technology and now they have that obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No other of the four major record companies will have this
marketing and promotional clout, the ability to show 20 million
people the new Warner Bros. musical act every morning on AOL,'' he
said. ``It's impressive and it's hard to build that kind of traffic
overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   The music division posted third-quarter earnings in October 1999
of $76 million before interest, taxes and amortization, down from
$99 million in the third quarter the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of film, the transaction should give Time-Warner's film
studio, Warner Brothers, a vast new medium for distributing its
movies and television programs. Indeed, the merger is expected to
spur Warner Brothers' rival studios to move more aggressively onto
the Internet. Some analysts say there could be a spate of deals
between studios and Internet companies similar to those that have
already occurred in which filmmaking operations have been combined
with cable and television distribution, as exemplified by Viacom's
recent purchase of CBS. Hollywood in general has been somewhat wary
of the Internet, which is unfamiliar to Hollywood and is seen as
contributing to piracy of its programs and threatening its hold on
creating and distributing entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that upstart AOL has now swallowed the world's largest
media company is likely to contribute to a feeling of insecurity
among entertainment moguls, who are seeing their wealth surpassed
and their seats at the best Hollywood restaurants usurped by the
new media titans _ young e-commerce entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   But Warner Brothers has been more aggressive than most studios
in trying to exploit the Internet. In November it launched
Entertaindom, a Web site showing its Looney Tunes cartoons as well
as a variety of programs made just for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For Time Inc., Time-Warner's magazine division, the changes will
most likely manifest themselves first in the arena of electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Time Inc.'s revenues for 1998 were $4.5 billion to Time-Warner's
$26.8 billion. Time Inc. will become a relatively smaller entity in
the new company.
</P>
<P>
   Time-Warner has tried to exploit the content of Time Inc.
magazines _ Time, People, Sports Illustrated and Fortune are among
the company's titles _ in the electronic universe. Its ardent but
foiled foray into the Internet, the Pathfinder portal, was shut
down last year, and since then it has been reconfiguring its
Internet presence under new management.
</P>
<P>
   Generally recognized as the highest-grossing magazine publisher
in the world, Time Inc. publishes 31 magazines that in 1998
accounted for 21 percent of the total advertising revenues
generated by U.S. consumer magazines. Combined advertising and
subscription revenue for People, Time and Sports Illustrated _
three of the top five highest-grossing magazines in the United
States _ tally up to almost $2.5 billion for 1998. The only
specific provision made for Time Inc. magazines in the announced
deal pertained to In Style magazine, Time Inc.'s frothy celebrity
fashion monthly, which America Online will begin to incorporate
into its Internet service, expanding on the content already
supplied to AOL by People, Teen People and Entertainment Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Nelson, In Style's managing editor, said that the
magazine had been planning to introduce In Style.com in 2000, a
content and electronic commerce site that will offer clothing and
other goods for purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will clearly make it a more secure strategy,'' she said.

AOL, TIME WARNER IN LARGEST CORPORATE MERGER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   America Online kicked off the 2000s with a blockbuster deal
Monday, announcing plans to acquire media giant Time Warner Inc.
for $178 billion in what would be the largest corporate marriage in
history.
</P>
<P>
   The pact joins the leading Internet service provider, with more
than 22 million subscribers, with the nation's largest media
company, which owns CNN and a vast movie, cable television,
magazine and entertainment empire.
</P>
<P>
   The combined AOL Time Warner Inc. is positioned to create huge
new markets in selling movies and music over the Internet, pumping
customized news to e-mail subscribers, and cross-promoting a
cornucopia of entertainment and Net offerings. It will likely
accelerate the conversion of Time Warner cable franchises for
high-speed Net access.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatizing how the ``new economy'' is rapidly eclipsing the
old, AOL is effectively acting as the acquirer in the stock deal.
</P>
<P>
   AOL shareholders will own 55 percent of the combined company,
even though Time Warner represents more than 80 percent of its cash
flow. Barely 15 years old, AOL will take control of a corporate
giant whose roots date to the 1923 founding of Time Magazine and
the famed Warner Brothers film and cartoon studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger will launch the next Internet revolution,'' said
AOL chairman Steve Case, who will become chairman of the new AOL
Time Warner Inc. ``The possibilities are truly endless.'' Time
Warner chairman Gerald M. Levin will become the chief executive
officer of the new company.
</P>
<P>
   Also seemingly endless are the potential impacts on other
companies, including media conglomerates like Disney-ABC and
CBS-Viacom and big Internet portals and service providers like
Lycos, Yahoo, Microsoft's MSN and Mindspring. Some may feel pushed
into considering their own marriages to compete with the AOL Time
Warner juggernaut. Disney, Lycos and Yahoo shares all jumped Monday
on deal speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure to merge ``content'' and Internet delivery would also
affect organizations ranging from regional telephone companies to
AT&AMP;T, which is buying MediaOne Group this spring to become the
nation's largest cable TV and modem provider but has done little to
add programming and information sources.
</P>
<P>
   AOL and Time Warner will merge their shares in a deal that
values Time Warner stock at about $110 a share, or 71 percent over
its Friday closing price of $64.75. At the 4 p.m. close, Time
Warner stock was up 25 5/16 to 90 1/16, while AOL slipped 1 7/8 to
71.
</P>
<P>
   Current AOL shareholders will get one share of AOL Time Warner
for each AOL share, while Time Warner owners will get 1.5 shares
per Time Warner share. Those ratios are not subject to any
``collar'' or readjustment if either company's stock veers sharply
from current levels.
</P>
<P>
   Counting assumed debt of $10 billion, the deal was valued at
$178 billion overall. The new stock will trade under the AOL ticker
symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Many industry analysts have long called AOL and Time Warner
ideal partners, and Case said he first approached Levin about doing
a deal in October. Notably, no news of the merger leaked out before
a Dow Jones Newswire report in the early hours of Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   AOL chief operating officer Robert Pittman said, ``This is the
perfect one plus one equals three opportunity. We are the missing
piece of each other's puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Turner, Time Warner's vice chairman, who will keep that post
in the combined company, said he voted his roughly 100 million Time
Warner shares in favor of the merger Sunday night. ``I did it with
as much or more excitement and enthusiasm as the night I first made
love 42 years ago,'' the flamboyant Turner said at a New York press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, the Time Warner chief executive who will hold the same
post in the new company, acknowledged questions about why his
company, bringing 6 times the operating revenues of AOL, winds up
with less than half the ownership of the company.
</P>
<P>
   However, Levin said, ``The market capitalizations in the
Internet space I accept, because I think something profound is
taking place in this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``While some people may have some difficulties with those
valuations, to me it's quite simple,'' Levin said. ``It's a belief
that the present value of the future cash flow is so significant
that that's how you justify it. I believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin added that combining Time Warner's power to generate and
broadcast news and entertainment with the new delivery channel of
the Internet through AOL makes the combined company worth much
more. ``You can build so many things on top of it with a tremendous
margin,'' Levin said. ``I saw the power of that combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Kreisky, the Lexington head of the media practice with
consultants Mercer Management Consulting, said, ``It's a marriage
that was destined to happen. It's an industry defining moment.
Their merger eliminates the division between old media and new
media, for good. AOL is the child that Time Warner always wanted to
have.''
</P>
<P>
   The value of the AOL-Time Warner deal easily eclipsed the
previous record-setting $150 billion hostile bid by Vodafone
Airtouch PLC, the world's largest wireless telephone company, for
German telecom giant Mannesmann. The previous biggest US deal was
the $122 billion proposed takeover of Sprint by MCI WorldCom, which
is facing antitrust concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer size of the combination raised alarms among some
antitrust analysts and critics of the relentless trend toward
consolidation of ownership of media properties. Others voiced fears
that it marked a capitulation of the Internet's role as a
counterweight to traditional media giants.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust regulators with the Justice Department and Federal
Trade Commission had not even worked out which agency, if either,
would review the deal and had no immediate comment on whether the
deal raises monopoly concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Case and Levin, however, voiced confidence it would pass muster.
``No single line of business really dominates its category, so we
really don't think there will be any antitrust issues,'' Case said.
</P>
<P>
   Levin added that ``it's my view that this is kind of a clean
break with the past and represents something totally new, and
therefore I don't see a regulatory problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts generally praised the combination as a bold, smart
strategic move, while voicing some concerns the combined company
could be unwieldy to manage.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Gens, senior vice president of Internet research with
International Data Corp. in Framingham, who predicted an AOL-Time
Warner merger in his prognostications for 1999, said, ``On paper,
it makes a lot of sense,'' but added, ``There's a lot of room for
making big mistakes in this deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What could destroy AOL as it buys Time Warner is that it gets
too tangled up in the old media side of the business and loses its
focus on the Internet. Is this going to take AOL to the next level,
or is it going to drag it into the abyss?''
</P>
<P>
   Gens said the Time Warner takeover is further evidence of what
he calls ``the death of the dot-com. These large Internet pure-play
companies, as they try to take it to the next level, the path is
going to have to be expanding their real world presence outside of
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   For media conglomerates, Gens said, ``You need to own or be
owned by an Internet player. You need to get some Internet DNA into
your genes,'' said Gens. Some companies have tried _ Time Warner
through Excite AtHome and Disney through buying Infoseek and
turning it into the Go! Network _ with spotty success.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Bernoff, an analyst with Forrester Research Inc., said,
``This is definitely the sign of a trend to come. The distinction
between Internet and old media is getting obliterated.''
</P>
<P>
   One question is how to handle the sheer number of powerful,
ambitious executives at the top of the company's organization
chart.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Parsons, the Time Warner president, and AOL president
Pittman will become co-chief operating officers of the new company,
and they will serve with AOL vice chairman Kenneth J. Novack and
Time Warner Digital Media CEO Richard Bressler on a four-person
``integration committee'' reporting to Levin and Case. ``I think we
are all committed to working together,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   Case acknowledged that in combining the companies, ``The most
significant risk is really a people risk'' and did not reject
concerns about friction between the organizations. ``There are a
lot of cooks on stage, but there's a big meal to serve here.''

`OLD' VS. `NEW' IN TIME WARNER TAKEOVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're calling the America Online Inc.-Time Warner Inc. deal a
merger, but it's really a takeover.
</P>
<P>
   The new firm will be called AOL Time Warner, not the other way
around. And AOL shareholders will get most of the bounty _ 55
percent of the new company, compared to 45 percent for Time Warner
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the little pipsqueak of a company that's buying the big
behemoth,'' said telecommunications industry analyst Jeffrey Kagan.
``But that's how it's happening these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by the immense value of its stock, AOL has carried out
the first ``new media'' takeover of an ``old media'' company. And
there may be more such deals in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The idea to combine powerful brands in traditional media with a
hot, young on-line company isn't exactly new. Up to now, many
assumed that the big, established old media companies would be the
buyers rather than the bought. That's what nearly happened last
year when Waltham-based Lycos Inc. tried to merge with some of the
television and retailing assets of USA Networks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, Lycos CEO Bob Davis said that a link with USA
Networks would have given his Internet company a solid foothold in
the world of traditional media. For this, he was willing to create
a new company in which Lycos shareholders would have gotten at most
a 35 percent stake. In essence, the old media people would have
ended up owning the new media company.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal enraged many Lycos investors. At the time, Lycos
shares were soaring above $130, while USA Networks shares were
hovering in the mid-30s. Defenders of the deal stressed that USA
Networks was bringing a variety of assets, like the Home Shopping
Network, which had solid cash flow and a large base of customers.
But shareholders were convinced that Lycos was selling itself too
cheaply, given the run-up in Internet stock values.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, such objections killed the Lycos deal. Charles Conn,
CEO of Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch Inc., one of the USA Networks
companies, thinks the AOL-Time Warner merger shows that Lycos and
USA Networks were on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about vindication, but I do think it shows the
power and credibility of bringing together new media companies and
traditional media companies,'' Conn said.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, it's the new media company that's calling the
tune.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had asked me a year ago would this merger happen, I
would have said I don't think so,'' said Bruce Leichtman, director
of media and entertainment strategies for the Boston-based Yankee
Group. ``To see AOL as the big fish gobbling the little fish is
almost impossible to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL may be the most successful Internet company, but it's small
fry compared to Time Warner. AOL has just over 12,000 employees,
compared to Time Warner's 67,500. In the quarter ended September
1999, AOL had $1.5 billion in revenues; Time Warner raked in $6.7
billion.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Time Warner's vast array of physical assets,
from printing presses to television studios. Time Warner CEO Gerald
Levin said Monday that his company's CNN cable news service alone
reaches up to a billion people worldwide. There's also the
company's other TV networks, like TNT, TBN, and the WB Network; its
recorded music business; its Warner Bros. movie and TV production
business; and a stable of magazines including Time, People,
Fortune, and Sports Illustrated. By comparison, AOL offers 22
million subscribers to its AOL and CompuServe Internet services,
and about 50 million monthly visits to AOL's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, all this was outweighed by AOL's extraordinary
market capitalization, which stood at $165 billion when the market
opened Monday morning. By comparison, Time Warner began the day
valued at $71 billion. For all its assets and worldwide reach, Time
Warner was still at the mercy of a stock market that has made AOL a
far more valuable company than Time Warner. Investors have made a
huge bet that AOL and other top Internet companies will acquire
hundreds of millions of subscribers worldwide in the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, AOL badly needs Time Warner's old-media assets,
especially its cable television business, which is accessible to 21
million homes nationwide. AOL faces a severe threat to its
business, as AT&AMP;T Corp. and other cable firms start deploying
high-speed Internet connections to homes.
</P>
<P>
   The cable firms have cut their own deals with Internet providers
and frozen out AOL, whose customers would have to pay extra to use
AOL on cable systems. That could lead to massive defections from
AOL's customer base. AOL has been fighting in courtrooms across the
country in an effort to force cable firms to grant it ``open
access'' to their cable Internet services. The Time Warner deal
assures that AOL won't be frozen out of many American homes.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Time Warner badly needs an Internet strategy. The
company was one of the first old media companies to foresee the
significance of the World Wide Web. In 1994, the company launched
Pathfinder, a major Web site that was to feature on-line content
from a variety of Time Warner media properties. But Pathfinder
never caught on, leaving one of the world's major media companies
with almost no significant Internet presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't deliver service over the Internet,'' said
industry analyst Kagan, ``you're dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the news of the AOL Time Warner deal sent shares of Lycos
and Web leader Yahoo Inc. soaring as investors considered the
prospect that other Internet companies would begin making big
investments in traditional media firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's official,'' said Yankee Group analyst Melissa Bane. ``The
Internet company, at least in this deal, has been seen as the media
leader of the future.''

YEARLONG ACTIVITIES A TRIBUTE TO OIL GUSHER THAT CHANGED THE WORLD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Optional ending included) 
 
By RICHARD STEWART 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAUMONT, Texas _ The world forever changed 99 years ago when a
geyser of oil erupted on a low hill near Beaumont called
Spindletop.
</P>
<P>
   Far more than one of the state's biggest oil booms was started
by the 150-foot plume of green-black crude that flowed untamed for
nine days. The petroleum age was born and Texas was transformed
from an agricultural state to a petroleum and manufacturing
powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   A yearlong celebration of that great event kicked off Monday as
members of the state's Spindletop 2001 Commission unveiled plans
for dozens of events ranging from a country music concert to a
recreation of the 1901 gusher.
</P>
<P>
   Texas had oil production long before the first Spindletop
gusher. There had been wells drilled near Lufkin and Nacogdoches,
and Corsicana had experienced an oil boom, but nobody in the United
States had ever seen anything like the original Spindletop well.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get one gusher and everyone thinks it's a freak,'' said
JoAnn Stiles, associate professor of history at Lamar University in
Beaumont. ``Then you get five more gushers all in a row, and we had
that many by April. And so much oil was being produced that it
outdid the rest of the world. Hell, you have to figure out what to
do with all of this oil.''
</P>
<P>
   The main market for petroleum in 1901 was as lube oil and
kerosene for lanterns. But the Spindletop oil wasn't all that good
for illumination, Stiles said. What it was good for was fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Soon railroads, the main transports of the day, were converting
from coal to oil. When the fledgling auto industry began to turn
into a giant there was a great demand for gasoline _ which was
first an unwanted by-product that was dumped in the Gulf of Mexico
or burned to get rid of it.
</P>
<P>
   When word of the gusher got out, special trains began heading to
Beaumont from Houston, Dallas and New Orleans. Speculators would
make multimillion-dollar deals on the sidewalks, and boomers would
take turns sleeping on pool tables.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 companies were formed in Beaumont within a year.
Most are long forgotten, but some evolved into giants like Texaco,
Gulf, Mobil, Sun Oil and Exxon. Many of those companies would make
their headquarters in Houston as other oil discoveries followed up
and down the Gulf Coast and throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   The prestigious Oil and Gas Journal started as a way for Eastern
investors to keep tabs on what was happening in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although it was not apparent at the time, petroleum was
destined to provide the energy throughout the 20th century _ a
century where economics, politics and wars have been shaped by
oil,'' said D. Ryan Smith, executive director of the Texas Energy
Museum in Beaumont and a Spindletop 2001 commissioner. ``Spindletop
was the catalyst that ushered in this new world based on oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Beaumont Mayor Evelyn Lord is chairman of the statewide
commission. ``How remarkable that all this took place in our
backyard,'' she said. ``The Spindletop celebration is a unique
opportunity for the people of this region to come together to
reflect and observe our shared heritage. Besides, we are going to
have a heck of a good time as well.''
</P>
<P>
   That first well was financed by Eastern money and the Spindletop
centennial was started off Monday morning when Beaumont Mayor David
Moore and commission member J. Lanier Yeates returned the favor by
ringing the opening bell on the floor of the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Other events include a film festival next month at Lamar
University, which is adjacent to the old oil field.
</P>
<P>
   On March 31, Beaumont's home-grown country singer Tracy Byrd
will head a concert on the grounds of Gladys City, a recreation of
the boom town that grew up around the oil field. Byrd promises to
debut an original song commemorating Spindletop.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd also will preside over a bass fishing tournament and a golf
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Beaumont's annual July 4 celebration will take on a Spindletop
theme when the Symphony of Southeast Texas performs ``Spindletop
Fanfare,'' composed by former symphony conductor Joseph Carlucci.
</P>
<P>
   In October veterans of the Melody Maids, a Beaumont-based music
troupe that performed all over the country in the 1940s and '50s
will present an updated version of the ``Song Saga'' that they
performed in honor of the 50th anniversary of Spindletop.
</P>
<P>
   A world catfish cookoff championship and a parade will be
sponsored by area labor groups in September.
</P>
<P>
   Beaumont will recreate it's Boom Days celebration in November,
with arts and crafts, food and period costumes at Gladys City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were wondering what to call the big day,'' Lord said of
Jan. 10, 2001, ``so finally we just decided to call it The Big
Day.''
</P>
<P>
   By that day, she said, there will be a road to the original
Spindletop well site _ providing of course that historians,
geologists and land experts can decide exactly where it was. Long
lost to history due to the enormous amount of drilling that went on
in the area, nobody knows exactly where the first gusher was. Most
locals just say, ``it was somewhere over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for a parking area, an overview of what now is a low
marshy area, and a permanent marker at the site, Lord said.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Day will start off, unlike 100 years earlier, with a
prayer breakfast. Then, just after 10 a.m. the original gusher will
be re-enacted.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL; 
``No, we're not going to use oil,'' Lord said. Although oil at one
time got to be cheaper than water in Beaumont, environmental and
fiscal concerns dictate that the recreated gusher will spew water.
``We decided not to color it,'' Lord said, ``in case the wind
shifted and everybody got their clothes ruined.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1901 nobody worried much about ruined clothes.

COMMENTARY: A MOMMY TRACK DERAILS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let us pause to consider the travails of Jane Swift, the
lieutenant governor of Massachusetts, who has gotten into very hot
water for using her Statehouse aides as sitters for her baby
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Swift made news last year by running for office while she
was in an advanced state of pregnancy _ baby Elizabeth, now 14
months, was born two weeks before the election. There was a bit of
carping from social conservatives who felt she should have dropped
out and stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   I felt that in a perfect world, every expectant mother
interested in a political career would be allowed to serve a term
or two as lieutenant governor. A lieutenant governor, after all,
can call in sick when the baby sitter fails to arrive, and the
government will keep humming right along. In fact in most states, a
lieutenant governor can disappear for months on end without anyone
taking any notice whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, reality turned out to be somewhat more complicated.
Even though her husband quit work to stay home with the baby, Ms.
Swift portrays herself as the most harried of working mothers, who
needed her staff to run errands like picking up the dry cleaning in
order to ``hold it all together'' and whose child had to be brought
to the office in order to have time for bonding. ``If I have to
work 12- or 15-hour days, I am not going to allow the media or
anyone else ... to prevent me from spending time with my
daughter,'' she said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   This is terribly depressing. If a lieutenant governor with a
partner who stays at home can't manage one baby without help from
the office staff, what hope is there for the rest of the world?
</P>
<P>
   Balancing child care and work is absolutely never easy, even
when the husbands readily accept equal responsibility. (I have a
stark recollection of asking the male half of a two-career couple
why he was looking so beleaguered and hearing him say, ``My wife's
on assignment in Albania, and the hamster's missing.'') And the
strain on the middle class is nothing compared with what single
mothers with low-income jobs are feeling.
</P>
<P>
   But among professional women, it has always been particularly
tough to mix small children and elective office. That may be
because politics is still very much a guy business, or because
politicians already have a full load of demanding dependents in the
form of constituents. But one thing we know for sure is that there
are few women at the top of the political ladder because most of
them don't put their foot on the first rung until after their
children are grown.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason alone, I'd be inclined to cut Ms. Swift some
slack. But she really does make it tough.
</P>
<P>
   The lieutenant governor, it turns out, has been a sort of ethics
spokeswoman for the current Republican administration in Boston. It
was Ms. Swift who announced the axing of a top state official last
summer for misusing state resources. (It was a great story,
involving a half-naked woman and a pleasure boat. I wish I had time
to tell you the details.) Having taken on that portfolio, you'd
think she would have been hyper-sensitive to the importance of
keeping her aides away from the dry cleaners or the Pampers.
</P>
<P>
   When she got caught, Ms. Swift contended that the aides who
baby-sat Elizabeth were doing it as a labor of love. ``I would be
stunned if there was anyone who was feeling pressure to spend time
with her and care for her,'' Ms. Swift told The Boston Globe last
week. ``She's adorable and engaging, and she's learned to blow
kisses.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows that any employee, no matter how child-phobic,
is going to claim to love the boss's baby. Have you ever gone to
house parties given by powerful people? Their underlings play up to
the pets, for heaven's sake.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, my state, New York, hadn't had a woman
legislator give birth since the 1970s, when an upstate
Assemblywoman had a baby, then promptly quit. Now Cathy Nolan, a
Democrat, drives more than 1,000 miles some weeks in order to get
home to Queens at night and see her young adopted son. Donna
Ferrara, a Republican, keeps her 8-month-old daughter in her office
in Albany, and pays a nanny $15 an hour to watch her. When little
Kathleen was born last year, Ms. Ferrara missed 11 days of the
legislative session, and as a result a local newspaper listed her
as No. 2 in its hall of shame for absentee legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody said it would be easy.

BITS AND PIECES FROM THE TV CRITICS' TOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHH LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Just as the stretch limos return to Pasadena
every six months so TV stars can preen for the press, certain
stories keep popping up at these clambakes like reruns on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   The guaranteed-to-surface issue this time is the race question,
a holdover from July, when networks took pains to assure us they
weren't racist, even though their shows had very few _ and, in many
cases, absolutely no _ people of color in lead roles.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, NBC said it had reached an agreement with the NAACP
to establish ``goals and timetables'' to improve opportunities for
minorities at the network. On Sunday, NBC West Coast President
Scott Sassa said one of the initiatives will be an ``intensive,
high-level'' sensitivity seminar on Feb. 10 at NBC offices in
Burbank, targeting producers and studio heads. Another component is
a plan to add one minority writer or story editor to each
second-year show per season _ a total of three to five positions a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writers are the center of the universe in television,'' Sassa
said, ``and getting people to become show runners requires you get
them on shows that are successful. We think this is a very
significant step to make that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned. The other networks will be following suit, more or
less, as the week goes on.
</P>
<P>
   _And now for something completely different. Robert Halmi Sr.,
whose name pops up at all of these press tours because his company
has become the most prolific producer of network miniseries,
appeared again Sunday, this time with four stars of ``The 10th
Kingdom,'' a sprawling, 10-hour fantasy extravaganza starring John
Larroquette, Kimberly Williams, Camryn Manheim and dozens more.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there were fairy tales they cherished as children,
Williams said she was partial to ``The Wizard of Oz'' and ``Alice
in Wonderland.'' Manheim, who plays Snow White in the miniseries,
loved ``Where the Wild Things Are'' and any story that featured a
``misfit or outcast'' with whom she could identify.
</P>
<P>
   And Larroquette, deadpan as ever, said, ``I always loved `Hansel
and Gretel' because I've many times wanted to cook my children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The 10th Kingdom'' is scheduled to premiere in late February
on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   _Perhaps PBS will resurrect those ``Save Water: Shower With a
Friend'' bumper stickers from the early days of the environmental
movement, now that the ``Nova'' miniseries ``Secrets of Lost
Empires'' has figured out how to build a Roman bath.
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Fikret Yegul, one of the world's leading experts on
ancient baths _ honest! _ says he may have unwittingly discovered
why the Romans liked bathing together so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout the process of designing and building and filming,
we were constantly engaging in discussions and disputes, sometimes
getting rather heated.'' But once they fired up the furnaces and
enjoyed their first ablution, Yegul says, ``All our disputes
absolutely evaporated.'' Rubber ducky, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   ``Roman Bath'' is scheduled to air Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
   _Former President Gerald Ford, a consultant on PBS's ``The
American President'' series airing in April, says he and Betty have
seen one or two episodes of NBC's ``The West Wing.'' His take:
``It's interesting to see how television portrays what they think
happens in the West Wing.''

2 1/2-YEAR-OLD SOFTWARE FIRM SOLD FOR $554M 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DataSage Inc., a 2 1/2 year-old company that makes software to
track shoppers' buying patterns to help companies build sales, is
being sold for nearly $554 million in an all-stock deal announced
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer is Vignette Corp. of Austin, Texas, one of several
companies jockeying for position to provide the behind-the-scenes
systems that both traditional stores and on-line retailers can use
to custom-tailor their marketing.
</P>
<P>
   DataSage's customers run the gamut, from Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,
for which it developed an inventory management system, to
Amazon.com, which uses the software to remember what books its
customers have bought and then recommend new titles to them.
</P>
<P>
   Vignette said it chose DataSage, based in Reading, Mass.,
because of the company's diverse experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have experience in both the off-line, transactional world
as well as the on-line Web world,'' said Bill Daniel, a Vignette
senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, who put up $33 million over the past two years to
back DataSage founder David Blundin, the all-stock deal was a
bonanza made posssible by the speed at which Internet-related
stocks have been bid up. Vignette, which went public last February,
has seen its own market worth grow eightfold since, to $9.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan McCallum, a partner with OneLiberty Ventures, a Boston
venture capital firm that put $4 million into DataQuest, said that
investment now is worth more than $80 million. At Advanced
Technology Ventures in Waltham, Mass., partner Michael Frank said
his company's $8 million has multiplied to more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Steven B. Frankel, an analyst with Adams Harkness &AMP; Hill of
Boston, said Vignette's offer of 3.16 million shares of its own
stock _ worth $553.6 million when the deal was signed on Friday _
may be the most ever paid for an e-commerce software developer.
</P>
<P>
   Those shares are now worth just over $600 million, based on
Monday's closing prices. Vignette stock closed at 189 7/8, up 14
11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Compiling and using data about customer habits to develop
marketing programs is known as ``data mining.'' It is one of the
fastest-growing sectors in electronic commerce. Others in the field
are Art Technology Group Inc. of Boston, Open Market Inc. of
Waltham, Net.genesis Inc. of Cambridge, and Blue Martini Software
of San Mateo, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   For clients that range from Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. and Stop &AMP; Shop
Supermarkets to e-commerce companies like Drugstore.com and
CyberianOutpost.com, DataSage has dug deeper than most, Daniel
said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, DataSage software can be used to trail someone who
buys airline tickets to Aspen, Colo., to her next shopping stop _ a
sporting-goods Web site, for instance _ where she would
automaticaly be shown a selection of ski outfits in colors that
match those of the sportwear she recently bought at a cooperating
department store.
</P>
<P>
   Vignette Monday chartered an airliner to fly all 115 DataSage
employees from Boston to Austin for the day. But the Texas company
said it will keep DataSage in place in Reading, and that Blundin
and David Ellenberger, president and chief operating officer, will
remain in Massachusetts, too.

COMMENTARY: DEAR HAFEZ ... 
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the Israeli-Syrian talks at Shepherdstown, W.Va.,
adjourned, President Clinton will surely be writing President Hafez
Assad of Syria. Here's what I hope he'll say:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Hafez, I enjoyed my time with your foreign minister,
Farouk al-Sharaa, at Shepherdstown. He really lightened up after a
couple of days. He even loosened his tie once. And get this: One
evening, while reaching for the salt at dinner, Farouk accidentally
shook Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's hand! Ehud wouldn't let
go till we got the White House photographer in there. Farouk begged
me not to, but I'm sending you the pix. Maybe it'll inspire you.
One night after dinner Farouk got really wild and started telling
us Assad jokes. He is some prankster. If only the Israelis could
see his warm side ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway, Hafez, while the mood behind closed doors was good,
the substance lagged. I'm still not sure you guys really get it.
Hafez, have you ever seen the movie `While You Were Sleeping'?
'Cause while you've been sleeping the Cold War ended and the world
changed. I hate to say this, but your economy can barely make a
light bulb, and your Soviet backers are gone. You're in a rather
weak position. Now, there are two things you can do when you're
weak: Compensate for weakness with sweetness, or compensate for
weakness with craziness. Let me explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anwar Sadat also had a weak hand when he initiated the Camp
David peace, but he compensated for it by building leverage within
Israel. He reached out to the Israeli people in such a sincere,
compelling way that he made them his own lobby within Israel. It
worked well for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other strategy is the North Koreans'. They too are very
weak, but the North Koreans compensate for their weakness by acting
like lunatics. They regularly hint that they would use their nukes
to start a war on the Korean Peninsula that could incinerate 30,000
U.S. troops. And we believe them. So we pay them to keep their
nukes in the basement, they get to keep their regime as it is, and
they shake us down for just enough potatoes so their people won't
starve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your problem, Hafez, is that you're neither weak and sweet nor
weak and crazy. You're weak and mean. Bad combo, Hafez. You're
neither enticing enough for the Israelis to want to give in to your
demands, nor are you lunatic enough for them to believe that you'd
ever launch your chemically tipped Scud missiles at Israel _
because Israel would retaliate by obliterating your regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``You seem to believe that your mere negotiating with Israel is
a concession, and now Israel must reciprocate by agreeing to your
every demand. Not only do the Israelis not consider your
negotiating any big concession, but they insist you agree to all
their demands. Moreover, they want you to do it with a smile. They
want you to look as if you're enjoying it. Because there's going to
be a referendum in Israel on any deal with Syria. The Israeli
public will vote up or down. You have to win them over. Barak will
need your help. And right now _ forget about the Israeli hawks _
most Israeli doves don't trust you. Did you see what the Israeli
novelist and peacenik Amos Oz said last week? ``The Syrians think
they can get the Golan and send us a receipt by fax.`` Not a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``And while we're talking price, don't think I'm in this for
free, either. Sure, I want the legacy thing, but I'm not just some
caterer for peace. If I'm going to persuade Congress to fork over
$15 billion to pay for this deal, there has to be real strategic
gain for the U.S. Syria will have to make a clean break from Iran,
and openly work with us to isolate Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize, now, Hafez, that you're not Sadat. You're Kim Jong
Il of North Korea. Sadat wanted peace with Israel, because he
wanted to change Egypt internally and externally. You want peace
with Israel to get just enough goodies out of the West to sustain
your regime, so you won't have to change much internally. Like the
North Koreans, you want to keep Syria's door closed, but you're
willing to open the window a crack so we can pass the goodies in
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadat offered sweet weakness, which won Israel over. You offer
mean, calculating weakness _ which is neither sugary enough to
entice the Israelis nor crazy enough to intimidate them. I suggest
you use this timeout to consider a new strategy. Best wishes,
Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   (Coming soon: Assad's reply!)

 &HT;    Boy headed back to Cuba and dad
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The U.S. government has decided a 6-year-old Cuban boy
should be returned to his father, who lives in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, Elian Gonzalez, was found Thanksgiving Day clinging to
an inner tube in the water off the Florida coast. His mother,
stepfather and eight other people had drowned while trying flee
from Cuba to Florida by boat. Many Cubans risk their lives to make
the 90-mile crossing between the United States and Cuba because
they believe their lives would be better in America. Cuba has a
Communist government.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's father, who remained in Cuba, wanted the boy returned to
his home country. His great aunt and uncle wanted him to stay in
America because they said that is what his mother wanted.
</P>
<P>
   PRIMARY DEBATES HEAT UP
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best shows on TV in January will be the presidential
debates.
</P>
<P>
   The debates are part of the presidential campaign, which begins
in earnest next month. That's when the first presidential primary
will be held. A primary is when voters choose someone to represent
their party as its presidential candidate. The first primary is
Feb. 1 in New Hampshire. Other states' primaries will follow
through the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Debates are held to help voters decide which candidate they like
best. Also, debates are often funny, as candidates crack jokes or
say silly things by accident.
</P>
<P>
   After the primaries, the parties will pick their candidates, one
of whom will be elected our next president in November.
</P>
<P>
   KINDERGARTNER IS TOP PLAYER
</P>
<P>
   A 5-year-old boy from Missouri has become a national chess
champ. Alan Tsoi, whose first-place trophy is almost as tall as he
is, beat out 44 kindergartners from several states in the National
Scholastic K-12 Grade Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little easy,'' he wrote about the tourney. ``I won
all 6 games.''
</P>
<P>
   He learned the game by watching his older brother, Peter. Peter,
now 8, wanted to learn chess, so his parents bought him a chess
CD-ROM. Peter practiced chess on the computer for months, while
Alan sat beside him.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knew what Alan had learned until the day he challenged
his mother to a game. He beat her. He was 3.

 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ America Online, the company that brought the Internet
to the masses, has agreed to buy the largest traditional media
company, Time Warner, for $165 billion in what would be the biggest
merger in history and the best evidence yet that old and new media
are converging.
</P>
<P>
   By agreeing to give up its independence in return for an ample
premium on its stock price, Time Warner is acknowledging that the
Internet is central to its music, publishing and television
businesses and that its own efforts to create online operations
have been lackluster. Under the direction of its chairman and chief
executive, Stephen M. Case, America Online, despite the occasional
stumble, has surged far ahead of all of its online competitors,
largely on the strength of its marketing skill and ability to make
technology easy to use for the average person.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, in turn, would gain access to Time Warner's
entertainment and information empire. And of more immediate
importance would be that the company _ whose 22 million paying
subscribers now use modems and telephone lines to go online _ would
get access to Time Warner's cable television systems. Those cable
systems, which now serve 13 million subscribers, would enable
America Online to start offering much higher-speed Internet and
interactive television services. Until this deal, no major cable
company would carry America Online's services.
</P>
<P>
   The new offerings might include Internet versions of Time
Warner's media properties, like CNN news and Home Box Office
movies, combined with a range of features more sophisticated than
the Web sites, chat rooms and e-mail services that are now America
Online staples. The earliest impact might come in music, where
America Online is already developing technology for a digital
jukebox that could store and play songs from Warner Music and other
labels.
</P>
<P>
   And for consumers generally, whether they now or ever subscribe
to America Online or Time Warner services, Monday's announcement
may very likely portend other mergers and alliances that could
hasten the development of and availability of high-capacity
information and entertainment networks.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's deal, which was negotiated with such secrecy that it
took the industry by surprise, also brought a new realization about
the extraordinary stock-market values that America Online and other
Internet companies have reached in the last 18 months. Although
analysts have long predicted that the stars among the Internet
upstarts would wind up part of larger media empires, Monday's deal
indicates that it could be the Internet companies that do the
buying and the old media that sell out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dot-com guys have sort of won,'' said David B. Readerman,
an analyst with Thomas Weisel Partners, a San Francisco brokerage
firm. ``AOL was able to serve up its stock and buy Time Warner,
walking a way with incredible media assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Another winner is Case, who is to become the chairman of the new
company, which would be called AOL Time Warner. Time Warner's
current chairman and chief executive, Gerald Levin, would serve
under Case as the new company's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   With a market value of $350 billion, based on Monday closing
stock prices, the combined corporation would be the fourth-most
valuable company in the country, after Microsoft, General Electric
and Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Besides requiring the approval of both companies' shareholders,
the combination will face the usual review by antitrust regulators
as well as a complex web of local reviews as cable television
franchises are transferred into AOL's name. It will also require
review by federal antitrust regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has not yet decided whether to refer
the matter to the Justice Department, which has examined America
Online's past acquisitions, or to the Federal Trade Commission,
which approved the merger between Time Inc. and Warner
Communications 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although some consumer groups and members of Congress called for
careful scrutiny of the merger, the companies said they do not
expect any problems, because their businesses do not overlap and
neither company dominates its respective markets. They said they
hoped to close the deal by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The shy and aloof Case was already a billionaire, but not the
instant sort created by some of the newer Internet companies _ many
of which, unlike America Online, have never achieved a profit. He
worked for 15 years, through obscurity and ridicule, to achieve his
vision that chatting on a computer screen would become as important
a communications medium as the telephone or television.
</P>
<P>
   It was Case who proposed the combination last October to Levin,
winning an initial hearing by offering him the chief executive's
title in the combined company. After much haggling over the
financial terms, the deal was cemented at a five-hour meeting at
Case's house in northern Virginia last Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   As measured by its revenue in the last 12 months, Time Warner is
already the largest of the conventional media companies. If the
merger is completed, the new company would be an even more powerful
player in a wide range of industries. AT&AMP;T which is in the process
of becoming the largest owner of cable television systems, would
face a more formidable America Online, which had been trying to
gain access to AT&AMP;T's cable systems. And Microsoft would be
contending with an even bigger rival as computer software continues
to evolve into Internet-based services _ a field in which America
Online has excelled.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in light of Monday's announcement, analysts and
executives were quick to predict that more media and technology
companies would run to the altar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of old and new media companies will happen far
faster because of this,'' said George Bell, the president of
Excite(AT)Home, the company controlled by AT&AMP;T that offers high
speed Internet services over cable systems. ``Fundamentally, Time
Warner has something AOL doesn't have: Great media brands built up
over decades. The time isn't there for Internet companies to build
that content. Time just won't hold still.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By the same reasoning, other media companies might see the
virtue in finding a partner with Internet competence _ as did Time
Warner, whose decision to sell out is a tacit admission that the
biggest and most talented publishers and studio executives have
been at a loss to figure out how to apply their talents to new
media.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner was an early player in Interactive television,
through the Full Service Network, an expensive prototype it
introduced in Orlando, Fla. And its Pathfinder service, one of the
pioneering sites on the World Wide Web, never was able to turn the
company's substantial brands like Time and Sports Illustrated into
a major force.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the other media companies have done any better online.
Only Disney, with its Go Network, is among the 10 top Internet
services.

MORE MONEY FOR LOST BAGS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The minimum amount airlines must pay passengers whose luggage is
irretrievably lost on a domestic flight will rise this week to
$2,500 from its longtime level of $1,250. The Department of
Transportation will review the new minimum in July every other year
and raise the level in increments of $100 if the rate of inflation
requires it.
</P>
<P>
   This modification of a lower limit in effect since 1984 was a
long process that began in 1993 with a Ralph Nader group petition
asking for a rise to $1,850. Things moved glacially until June of
last year, when the Air Transport Association, an industry group
that embraces the major United States scheduled airlines,
petitioned the Department of Transportation to double the amount. A
rising tide of consumer complaints, coupled with stirrings in
Congress, provided a context.
</P>
<P>
   But the airlines could have increased the payment level
independently and, in fact, American Airlines, Midwest Express and
Delta had already gone to $2,500. American changed Dec. 15 while it
was awaiting the federal announcement, Delta acted on Jan. 5. All
airlines publicized pledges to consumers at the end of last year as
a response to steps in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The change in reimbursement, which goes into effect Tuesday, one
month after the rule was published in the Federal Register, does
not affect the compensation for luggage lost on an international
flight, which remains at about $9 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, airlines are not responsible for carry-on luggage
left behind; the harvest of unidentified eyeglasses, Grisham novels
and gloves is reported to be huge. If, on the other hand, travelers
are told they may not carry something on, and it is taken for
checking, it is then covered.
</P>
<P>
   The precise amount of checked luggage lost by airlines is
unknown. The Department of Transportation collects major United
States airlines' figures on complaints of ``mishandled'' luggage _
lost, damaged, delayed or pilfered. The numbers are pretty big.
</P>
<P>
   For 1998, it listed 2.48 million complaints for 10 major
airlines, with United Airlines leading at 595,000 complaints. The
year's total for the major airlines worked out to 5.24 complaints
for each 1,000 passengers; United's rate was the highest at 7.3.
</P>
<P>
   But these are only complaints _ bags that failed to get to the
carousel on time or were lost, stolen, broken or ripped. Most
missing bags catch up with their owners in three days or vice
versa, but the number of such reunions is never subtracted from the
complaint total: if you learn your bag went to San Diego while you
went to San Antonio, as happened to me once, that blip goes into
the annual total even though the bags materialize in the San
Antonio hotel room the same night.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Transport Association, according to its spokesman David
A. Fuscus, put numbers through the computer in January 1998 and
concluded that 99.5 percent of all checked bags reached their
destinations at the same time as their owners. Of the remaining
half a percent, Fuscus said, 80 percent get where they are going
within 24 hours, 99 percent within five days, and 1 percent _ of
the half a percent _ are irretrievably lost or stolen. The
association estimated that 0.003 percent of checked bags were
pilfered.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan K. Owens, owner of the company that buys the luggage that
airlines are ultimately unable to identify, says the new bar-code
airline tags have improved baggage-handling. However, this has not
meant a decline in his supply, he said, because the number of
passengers is still on the rise, keeping the tonnage that flows
into his huge store, Unclaimed Baggage in Scottsboro, Ala., pretty
steady.
</P>
<P>
   Owens has annual contracts with all the airlines to buy their
unreturnables, including abandoned carry-ons and material forgotten
in airline clubs. He will not say what this amounts to. When his
business was young, I stood on the Scottsboro pavement and watched
agape as a tractor trailer backed up to a warehouse and dumped out
a full load of suitcases lashed closed with yellow warning tape.
</P>
<P>
   Owens now calibrates business in marketing style. He lists each
object from a suitcase, and the case itself _ if fit to be sold _
as an item. ``We get 3,000 unique items into our store daily,'' he
said. Allowing no days off, that would be almost 1.1 million lost
things _ pairs of shoes, travel alarms, blankies, earrings and
earmuffs _ a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I pay the airlines is minor,'' Owens said, ``compared
with what they have to pay the passengers.'' He said the
irreducible detritus of the unsalable _ that is, the mangled
suitcases _ was turned over to the government for use in tests of
airport security devices. And yes, contraband in lost suitcases
also goes to the government.
</P>
<P>
   The company has a Web site, www.unclaimedbaggage.com, where
things are sometimes sold. However, these are individual objects
from bags _ laundered, dry-cleaned or whatever _ not suitcases full
of contents, so it is not possible to find one's lost bag by the
time it has arrived at Owens' place, after four months or so of
processing and waiting.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows how to keep belongings out of Owens' one-block
store: put a label with a name, the destination address, even an
itinerary, inside the suitcase. Tags on handles can be torn off by
machines or humans. Inside identification always seems like one
more thing to do when departure looms, but it can make the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Never pack anything that cannot be replaced. I once saw an
all-gold charm bracelet in Owens' store where each charm must have
had a deep meaning for the owner, and she must have been crushed to
lose it. But there it was, for sale to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   It is better not to take such things at all. If anything must be
checked that has value beyond the $2,500 _ wedding outfits come to
mind _ the airline will sell insurance for the added value. Ask
your travel agent or the airline, but get to the counter early for
this.
</P>
<P>
   When a claim is made for lost luggage, the traveler will have to
make a list of what was in the bag. It helps the airline identify a
tagless bag, but in any case it will not pay $2,500 if all that was
lost was $200 in T-shirts. If new clothing, cross-training shoes, a
new camera or gifts are packed in a new suitcase, receipts are
going to make a difference at the time the claim is paid.
Frequently, people forget how expensive the suitcase itself is, so
that receipt is worth saving.
</P>
<P>
   If a bag turns up missing, as the oxymoron goes, proceed
immediately to the customer service window near the baggage
carousel. You will need the airline claim check stapled into the
ticket jacket and other information, most particularly your hotel
addresses and phone numbers for the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Do not rush off and try to lodge a claim by phone. The number is
usually busy, and you will not be able to look at the chart of
luggage types. If there is no word of your bag in three days, it is
highly unlikely that it will be found.
</P>
<P>
   If you are unable to go to dinner the first night because your
good clothes were in the suitcase and you are wearing sweats, the
airline may pay a modest bill for clothes. Get a commitment on this
first, if possible. If the bag is eventually declared unfindable,
this amount may be deducted from your claim.
</P>
<P>
   Will the rise in the payment minimum reduce the anxious struggle
for bin space for carry-ons? Doubtful. But a number of airlines are
trying, in various ways.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, American Airlines joined United, Delta and Southwest
in installing sizing devices on the luggage X-ray machines, to keep
out oversized carry-on bags. That means four airlines are
forcefully limiting the size of what goes into the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   American's template accepts a regular suitcase 15 inches wide
and 9 inches thick, with a little curve at the center top for a
bulgy pocket; a garment bag may be 24 inches wide but only 5 thick.
Each of these airlines is using a sizer only on concourses that it
controls, or shares with another size-sensitive airline. American
started with 10 airports, all major.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood is that a long trip will involve at least one
pass through a template. If you are buying luggage at a sale, keep
that nine-inch aperture in mind.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways has taken another route to reducing carry-ons.
In February 1999, it set weight limits for carry-ons: one bag of no
more than 13 pounds in economy class. The limit in first class was
put at two pieces totaling no more than 40 pounds. On Jan. 3, the
line raised its business-class limit to two bags totaling 40
pounds, too, from the earlier limit of 20 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The airline weighs and measures the bags at check-in, so that
duty-free items picked up thereafter are not included. However,
Honor Verrier, a spokeswoman, said that the duty-free purchase
would still have to fit in the bin or under a seat, or it, too,
would be taken for checking. At that point, the bag is covered by
the international agreement of about $9 a pound, which would not
really account for the bottles of single-malt that one might bring
home to a good friend.

EXTORTION SCHEME A NIGHTMARE FOR WEB RETAILERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY AND ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Internet retailers sought to assure the public Monday of the
security of on-line shopping, as federal authorities investigated
an alleged incident of cyber-terrorism in which a hacker may have
gained access to about 300,000 customer credit-card files belonging
to a Web firm.
</P>
<P>
   In a bizarre twist on the typical credit-card scam, the alleged
hacker _ who goes by ``Maxus'' _ began publishing credit-card
information over the Internet Dec. 25 after executives at CD
Universe in Wallingford, Conn., declined to respond to a note
demanding a $100,000 ransom, according to officials at CD Universe,
an on-line seller of music and videos.
</P>
<P>
   The case, first reported Sunday on the Internet, is unusual in
its scope and extortionist nature and has the potential to unnerve
consumers and add a chilling effect on the torrid pace at which
buyers have raced on to the Internet to purchase everything from
shoes to shingles, retail experts say.
</P>
<P>
   While some downplayed the significance of the incident, it could
prove a public-relations nightmare for the e-commerce industry.
</P>
<P>
   Given that privacy and security are hot-button issues for
consumers, many of whom just seem to have gotten comfortable with
the idea of on-line shopping, the travails of CD Universe have the
potential to become ``an industry-wide problem,'' said Yobie
Benjamin, chief e-commerce strategist for accounting firm Ernst &AMP;
Young.
</P>
<P>
   While credit-card fraud is hardly new, the Internet adds other
dimensions to the crime that give consumers more pause, said Win
Treese, vice president of technology at Open Market Inc., an
e-commerce software vendor in Burlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet now offers ways to attack organizations from a
distance in a way we didn't have before, and computer technology
allows people to stage those attacks on a larger scale,'' Treese
said. ``As the Internet has grown, so has the number of attacks.
We're likely to see more and more such attempts.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though a consumer whose credit-card number has been stolen
over the Internet may be liable for $50 or less, the thought that
private financial information can be floating around in cyberspace
is scary.
</P>
<P>
   The security breach experienced at CD Universe could be ``the
kiss of death'' for any individual retail Web site, added Alan
Alper, an analyst with Gomez Advisors of Lincoln, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Brewer, head of investor relations for eUniverse, which
owns CD Universe, said the incident ``hasn't been good for
business,'' but declined to disclose the impact on the company's
sales, saying the company was focused on protecting its existing
customers. He would not provide further details, saying the matter
was in the hands of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   While e-commerce experts sought to sort out the significance of
the incident, one on-line consumer said he was taken aback by the
news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy cow!'' said Bruce D. Weinberg, a professor at Boston
University's Graduate School of Management. Since September, he has
forsaken brick-and-mortar stores to buy everything on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty optimistic about e-commerce in general, but this
gives me pause,'' he said. ``The key to this whole thing working is
trust, and this is a big breach of trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Trust may be a key point. As retail Web sites seek to become
profitable, they hope to learn more about their customers to serve
them better. But a few incidents of fraud could make consumers
reluctant to share information with a retail Web site even if they
continue to shop on line.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to preserve that trust, popular retail Web sites sought
to reassure the public that in their haste to exploit the Internet
bonanza, they hadn't skimped on security measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since day one, we've had elaborate security measures in place
to prevent unauthorized access to credit-card information,'' said
spokesman Bill Curry of Amazon.com, one of the Web's best-known
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   The news that some credit-card information might be exposed to
public view on the Internet comes at a bad time. The e-commerce
industry spent several years trying to overcome the fears of
mainstream consumers who balked at making on-line purchases because
of concerns about credit-card security.
</P>
<P>
   After much persuasion, consumers seemingly had grown comfortable
about on-line security. During the recent holidays, they made
purchases that could total $12 billion, up from about $3 billion in
holiday purchases in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But CD Univers's security breach has reawakened old fears. The
tale of intrigue, first reported by internetnews.com Sunday and
detailed in Monday's New York Times, sketched a scenario of a
mysterious hacker, possibly a teenager from Russia, who threatened
CD Universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found a security hole. Pay me and I fix it,'' the hacker
allegedly said, according to a sample page taken off a rogue Web
site published by the hacker. The Web site, which supposedly
invited visitors to download ``a real credit card directly from the
biggest on-line shop database,'' has since been dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   Some retail experts say consumer reticence will be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long haul, we're looking at little to no impact,'' said
Charles Rutstein, senior analyst at Forrester Research in
Cambridge, Mass. ``The convenience of shopping on line far
outweighs these security hiccups, especially when the consumer's
maximum liability is $50.''
</P>
<P>
   Most experts say customers who immediately inform the
credit-card company of a potentially fraudulent purchase have
little or no liability. Visa USA, for example, said in such cases
its card holders have ``zero liability.''
</P>
<P>
   The liability limit, however, does not apply to debit cards,
cautioned Weld Pond, a computer security expert at Lopht Heavy
Industries, a Boston company that recently launched (at)Stake Inc.,
a company that specializes in on-line security.
</P>
<P>
   ``People shouldn't use their debit cards; they should use only
credit cards on the Net,'' Pond said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday some e-commerce analysts suggested there is a gold rush
mentality among Web retailers to get up and running as quickly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   According to conventional wisdom, there's only a narrow window
of opportunity for a retailer to strike it rich on the Web; miss
that window, and a Web site is likely to fail or be gobbled up by a
larger rival.
</P>
<P>
   In its haste to get off to a fast start, a Web site,
particularly a small one, might take short cuts on security, some
analysts suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Given the potential for a publicity nightmare, most of the
larger and more reputable merchants have taken pains to secure
their retail Web sites, said Alper of Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no site, no matter how established, is impenetrable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only solution is constant vigilance,'' said Benjamin of
Ernst &AMP; Young. ``You just can't throw up a firewall and say, `I've
taken care of the problem.' ''
</P>
<P>
   CD Universe, which has been in business since 1996, used a
well-known payment security software sold by CyberCash Inc., a
large publicly traded company that serves numerous on-line
merchants. Officials at CyberCash could not be reached Monday for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing as 100-percent security,'' Benjamin
added. ``It's still buyer beware.''

CELEBRATING JULES VERNE  
 COSTA RICA FOR FAMILIES  
 B&AMP;B'S IN NEW ORLEANS

<P>
   Q. I understand that Nantes, France, will commemorate the
millennium with events linked to Jules Verne. Can you provide any
information? _ Stephen Dohemy, Miami Beach
</P>
<P>
   A. Jules Verne, the author of ``20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,''
was born in Nantes, a seafaring city in Brittany, in 1828 and grew
up in a house overlooking the harbor. He left at 19 and lived most
of his adult years in Paris and Amiens, but remained close to the
people of Nantes and their nautical culture.
</P>
<P>
   For its 2000 celebration, which begins May 12 and continues
through January 2001, Nantes has planned many of its events around
Verne and the extraordinary adventures in his novels. Precise dates
and times of some events _ including a boat race on the Loire River
in May, and a concert in June _ have not been set, but the Nantes
Tourist Office expects to have a calendar ready later this winter,
at which time it will update its Web site, www.nantes-tourisme.com
(in French only). The telephone number is (33-2) 40.20.60.00, fax
(33-2) 40.89.11.99.
</P>
<P>
   Several local museums have completed their exhibition schedules
for that time period. They include the following.
</P>
<P>
   The Musee du Chateau des Ducs de Bretagne, in the former chateau
of Brittany's rulers, will present an interactive exhibition that
focuses on three Verne works _ ``20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,''
``A Journey to the Center of the Earth'' and ``From the Earth to
the Moon.'' Touching on everything from mineralogy to deep-sea
life, the exhibition will include recreations of scenes from these
novels.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, at 4, Place Marc-Elder, is open Wednesday to Sunday
from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission is $3.15, figured at 6.36 francs
to the dollar. Information: (33-2) 40.41.56.56.
</P>
<P>
   The Musee des Beaux Arts de Nantes, 10, rue Georges-Clemenceau,
will assemble ``Machine Vision,'' art works from the past century
that reflect on the creation of alternative universes. The museum
is open Monday to Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Friday until 9
p.m.), and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission is $3.15.
Information: (33-2) 40.41.65.65.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller museums are also preparing exhibitions. The Musee Jules
Verne, 3, rue de l'Hermitage, will show a series of Verne
manuscripts and letters. Admission is $1.60. Information (33-2)
40.69.72.52. And the Natural History Museum, 12, rue Voltaire, will
examine biological models used in science fiction through displays
on ocean life; admission $3.15; (33-2) 40.99.26.20).  &QL;

   Q. My sister and I want to take our children, ages 8 to 10, to
Costa Rica. Do you know of an educational tour designed for
families? _ Emilia Fitzker, Chicago
</P>
<P>
   A. Travel companies are well aware that Costa Rica, with its
tropical forests, volcanoes and abundant wildlife, is a great
family destination, so you should have no trouble finding such a
tour. Among them are the following:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Abercrombie &AMP; Kent's 10-day Family Tour of Costa Rica departs on
Mar. 17, Aug. 4 and Dec. 22. The tour includes visits to the Arenal
Volcano (with a hike along the Lava Trail), the Butterfly Garden in
Monteverde and the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve, home to more
than 1,500 species of plants, hundreds of birds, 500 species of
butterflies and the rare golden toad.
</P>
<P>
   At Manuel Antonio Beach, the group pauses for three days at
Tulemar Bungalows. The cost is $2,980 for adults, based on double
occupancy, $2,380 for children. Air fare is extra. Information:
(800) 323-7308, fax (630) 954-3324.
</P>
<P>
   American Museum of Natural History Discovery Tours, based in New
York, also has a 10-day itinerary, departing Aug. 18, that includes
San Jose; the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve, where you can visit
the Monteverde Conservation League's Children's Eternal Forest (a
42,500-acre rain forest that has been preserved through
fund-raising by children around the world); two nights at La
Ensenada Lodge on the Gulf of Nicoya; the Carara Biological Reserve
(home to scarlet macaws and American crocodiles); and Poas Volcano
National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Activities include horseback riding, swimming, snorkeling and
hiking. The price for adults, double occupancy, is $3,290; $2,890
for children sharing with another child, $2,590 for a child sharing
with an adult and $2,390 for a child in a triple. Air fare is not
included. Information: (800) 462-8687, fax (212) 769-5755.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Audubon Society's itinerary, from June 30 to
July 9, is similar to the Discovery Tour. It goes to the Monteverde
Cloud Forest Reserve, the Carara Biological Reserve, the Poas
Volcano National Park and La Ensenada Lodge. The price is $2,870
for adults based on double occupancy. Prices vary for children,
starting at $1,850 if sharing with three or four others. For
children ages 12 to 17, the price starts at $2,370. Air fare is not
included. Information: (800) 289-9504.

   Q. I'm looking for atmospheric lodgings in New Orleans for $150
or under. Is there an organization that acts as a clearinghouse for
historic bed-and-breakfasts? _ Robin M. Barre, Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   A. One of the closest things to it is a reservations service
called Bed-and-Breakfast Inc., which represents about 20
establishments _ all in historic buildings _ throughout New
Orleans. Among those listed on its Web site,
www.historiclodging.com, is The Chimes in the Uptown District, a
19th-century house with five antique-filled guest rooms opening
onto a central courtyard. Rooms have private baths. Doubles range
from $103 to $126.
</P>
<P>
   Other listings include The 1851 Inn on the Avenue on St. Charles
Avenue, also with lots of architectural flair. Its five rooms with
private baths cost $110 to $145, double occupancy. Chartres
Marigny, in an 1830s townhouse on the corner of Esplanade and
Chartres on the eastern edge of the French Quarter, has four guest
rooms, each with private bath. Rates range from $87 to $162 for a
double. Some places will only accept reservations through an
agency, such as Bed-and-Breakfast Inc., (800) 729-4640.
</P>
<P>
   Other sources you might try are Bed and Breakfast Access, a
reservation service whose site, www.bnbaccess.com, lists several
accommodations in the French Quarter vicinity. Its number is (888)
766-6707. For a listing of all types of lodging, call the New
Orleans Metropolitan Convention and Visitors Bureau at (800)
672-6124.

EXERCISING OPTION, GM WILL TAKE FULL OWNERSHIP OF SAAB 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ General Motors Corp. said Monday it would buy the half
of Saab Automobile AB that it does not already own.
</P>
<P>
   By purchasing the portion owned by the investment company
Investor AB, GM will be exercising a buy option it has held since
the summer of 1996. GM and Investor have shared ownership of the
Swedish automaker since 1990, and the latest deal is expected to
close by the end of January, when the option is scheduled to
expire.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms were not disclosed. GM paid $500 million for
half of Saab a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brand attracts a very different consumer than we normally
see in General Motors showrooms,'' said G. Richard Wagoner Jr.,
GM's president. ``We want to keep that brand very distinctive and
very unique.''
</P>
<P>
   GM's unit production costs could come down as a result of the
deal. ``This is a huge opportunity to do common platforms between
GM and Opel and get a lot of cost out,'' said Harry J. Pearce, GM's
vice chairman. GM is considering broadening Saab's product lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, GM executives said Monday that the American company
was considering building vehicles in Japan in partnership with one
of its current Asian partners _ Honda, Suzuki, Isuzu or Fuji.
``There is an opportunity to produce vehicles in Japan with one of
our alliance partners,'' said Pearce.
</P>
<P>
   Wagoner said, ``we think it makes a lot of sense.'' He also put
to rest rumors that GM might try to buy Honda. Asked whether his
company was considering such a move, Wagoner gave a firm ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   He left open the possibility that GM might buy other automakers.
``If somebody comes up and says they want to sell their company, we
would look at it,'' said Wagoner. GM has been negotiating with
Daewoo for nearly two years, and recently put forth a bid that was
rebuffed. Daewoo has opened the bidding to others.
</P>
<P>
   The Saab deal came as auto executives gathered here for the
North American International Auto Show. Both GM and Ford announced
they would add new names to their stables of auto brands.
</P>
<P>
   GM, which bought the Hummer brand name from AM General, said it
would expand the number of versions of the boxy, extra-wide sport
utility vehicles originally built for military use. Ever since the
gun mounts were exchanged for cup holders, Hummers have found
civilian buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``GM plans to uphold a tradition based on aggressiveness and
toughness while strategically growing the brand,'' said Ronald L.
Zarrella, executive vice president and president of GM North
America.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ford said Monday it will build a new brand called the
Think Group, dedicated to environmentally responsible products. The
product line will range from electric scooters to electric cars
like the current Think City car, now sold in Norway. The two-seater
will be sold across Scandinavia later this year, and will be sold
in the United States ``within the next two years,'' said Jac
Nasser, Ford Motor's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's Think unit will be responsible for developing and
commercializing Ford's efforts to develop vehicles powered by fuel
cells.

AOL-TIME WARNER MERGER IS ULTIMATE VALIDATION OF THE INTERNET

<TEXT>
<P>
   The America Online-Time Warner merger represents not only the
triumph of the Internet as the irresistible force in business, but
a vision of the Internet as a mass-marketed, middle-of-the-road
medium for Main Street Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Though top executives of both companies presented the deal as a
``merger of equals,'' it was in fact a victory for Stephen Case,
the billionaire who built America Online from a fledgling dial-up
service in the mid-'80s to an Internet powerhouse able to acquire
the world's largest media company.
</P>
<P>
   ``America Online is clearly dominant,'' said David Readerman,
managing director of Thomas Weisel Partners, an investment firm in
San Francisco. ``The nerds have won. This deal really validates the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more so, it would appear to validate AOL, whose strategy
was to market the freewheeling, global, often chaotic Internet as
the suburbs of its online service. Techies long derided America
Online as a lowbrow medium. They called it ``training wheels for
the Internet,'' suggesting it was not the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   But Case, who once developed new pizza offerings for Pizza Hut,
always held his ground. He insisted the online business was less
about technology than about consumer marketing. His vision has
proved to be on target so far, making America Online by far the
biggest online service, with 20 million subscribers. Just where the
combined AOL-Time Warner is headed is difficult to predict, but the
emphasis is certain to be the same _ stressing a mass-market
consumer service that Main Street Americans find attractive, and
hiding the nerdy technology.
</P>
<P>
   The measure of America Online's rapid rise and its current
stature was evident on Wall Street Monday. A few years ago, it was
thought that America Online might indeed merge with a media
company. Disney or Time Warner, it was said, might buy America
Online, which was then seen as a promising upstart. But Monday it
was the shares of Time Warner, one of the world's leading media
companies, with its storied legacy going back to Henry Luce, that
leaped in celebration, like some neglected waif rescued by a
wealthy benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept that something profound is happening in the Internet
space _ I believe that,'' said Gerald Levin, chairman of Time
Warner. ``The new media stock-market valuations are real, not in
every case, of course. But what AOL has done is get first position
in this new world. Its valuation is real, and I am attesting to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the America Online-Time Warner deal is more than a striking
testimonial to the Internet as mainstream media. The proposed
merger is also a big gamble for both companies, as well as an
admission by both that they need each other.
</P>
<P>
   America Online's weakness is the lack of access to high-speed
Internet services over television cables, which rivals AT&AMP;T and
Microsoft have. Once in place, these high-speed, or broadband,
networks _ provided over upgraded cable or phone lines _ open the
door to the digital distribution of new services for interactive
entertainment, information and electronic commerce, via everything
from desktop computers to hand-held devices to television sets.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner, with its vast cable networks serving more than 13
million subscribers, gives America Online assured access to the
high-speed networks required for these new mass-market Internet
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest threat to AOL over the next three years was
getting locked out of broadband,'' said David B. Yoffie, a
professor at the Harvard business school. ``And this deal certainly
helps solve that problem.''

   London Fancy: Boutique Victorian
</P>
<P>
   A boutique hotel in the Little Venice area of London provides a
pleasant alternative to large chains. The Colonnade Town House,
near the elegant mansions that line Regents Canal, is close to the
Underground and not far from Paddington Station. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hotel, which recently reopened after being refurbished, has
43 rooms on four floors, some with four-poster beds and balconies.
Its Victorian-style furnishings include antiques and luxurious
curtains and wall-papers in dark greens and reds with accents of
gold and cream.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Guests register not in a formal lobby but at a traditional
writing desk just inside the front door, and ``do not disturb''
signs have been replaced by stuffed cats that are placed outside
the doors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The basement breakfast room is distinctly non-Victorian, with
bold wood floors and bright red, blue and mustard yellow chairs. A
restaurant that will serve lunch and dinner is scheduled to open in
late spring, but for now a limited 24-hour room service menu is
available. &QL;
</P>

   Vail Adds 520 Acres For Skiers and Boarders
</P>
<P>
   If you've always envied the daredevils who ski the trees but had
too much fear _ or sense _ to try it yourself, Vail has a lift
ticket for you. The Colorado ski behemoth has stretched farther
into the Rockies with the opening this month of the 520-acre Blue
Sky Basin. The new area has ``groomed glades'' on the north-facing
slopes of two bowls, designed to give intermediate and advanced
skiers and snowboarders a chance to glide among groves of fir.
Powder hounds will find ungroomed terrain as well. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The area is part of a planned 885-acre expansion that stirred
controversy among environmentalists, whose concerns included the
potential disruption of lynx habitat. Arson fires, still under
investigation, damaged several buildings and chairlifts in 1998,
including two buildings housing slopeside restaurants. The
structures have been rebuilt and the restaurants _ Two Elk and
Buffalo's _ are open this season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three new high-speed quad lifts serve Blue Sky Basin, which also
has a warming hut. The area is named for the Ute Indians, known as
the Blue Sky People, who settled in the area in the 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   To heighten the aura of remote back country, bridges, lift
buildings and other facilities feature materials _ rusted
corrugated tin roofs, rock and worn wood _ and styles that
approximate an old mining settlement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With Blue Sky Basin, Vail encompasses 5,160 acres. For more

   A Minnesota Museum Moves to the Riverbank &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Looming dinosaur skeletons, 3-D laser shows and a model of a
human blood vessel are all on permanent display at the Science
Museum of Minnesota. The 93-year-old museum, which reopened last
month at its new location on the banks of the Mississippi in St.
Paul, is home to the first convertible dome Omnitheater in the
United States _ which can show movies on either a flat screen or a
domed one _ and nearly two million artifacts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the Mississippi Gallery, visitors wind past waterfalls, walk
through sewer pipes, observe working navigation locks and
``command'' a real Mississippi River towboat from the ship's
pilothouse. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Human Body Gallery includes a cardiovascular zone that
teaches how the heart, lungs and blood work together. A 100-foot
transparent tube that runs throughout the gallery allows visitors
to hear and feel the pulse of circulating blood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Dinosaurs and Fossils Gallery houses skeletons of an
82-foot-long diplodocus, one of the largest creatures to roam the
earth, a 14-foot-long xiphactinus (a fierce, fanged fish that lived
70 million years ago in a vast sea that stretched across what is
today North America) and a triceratops. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The museum is set amid 10 acres of parkland, and an atrium with
glass walls three stories high offers panoramic views of the
Mississippi. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The museum, at 120 West Kellogg Boulevard in St. Paul, is open
daily. Prices range from $5 to $12.50, depending on what visitors
want to see. Call (651) 221-9444 or visit www.smm.org.

   Taking Public Transit? These Maps Will Help &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Detailed maps of public transit systems are often hard to come
by until you reach a destination. For those who want to know where
a subway will take them, there is a new series of city public
transit maps packed with information.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The guides cost $5 each and include a list of a city's 50 most
popular places, as well as walking maps of their surroundings.
Information about a transit system's hours of operation, telephone
numbers and how to get tickets is also included. Fares, subject to
change, are usually not listed.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The big maps are the schematics used by the cities themselves.
The series began with the Oahu bus system 20 years ago. In the last
couple of years, the publisher, a West Coast writer named Michael
Brein, has added London and Paris, and he now offers Barcelona,
Berlin, Madrid, Munich, Prague and Sydney as well. Amsterdam,
Washington and Vienna will be added to Brein's Travel Guides this
spring. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a Visa or MasterCard, the maps can be ordered from (800)
875-8083, identification number 0026. They can also be ordered by
mail from Michael Brein Inc., 298 Winslow Way West, Bainbridge
Island, Wash. 98110. The postage is $1 for a single map, or $3.20
for more than one.

   Daumier Goes to Washington &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first retrospective in the United States of the varied works
of Honore Daumier, known for his political and social satire and
his biting caricatures, will be on view at the Phillips Collection
in Washington from Feb. 19 to May 14. So scathing were his
caricatures that in 1832 Daumier was sentenced to six months in
jail for his portrayal of King Louis-Philippe as ``Gargantua
Swallowing Bags of Gold Extorted From the People.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The show consists of 75 paintings, 57 drawings and watercolors,
39 sculptures and 74 lithographs. It was organized by the Phillips,
the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa and the Reunion des Musees
Nationaux in Paris. (The show has already been seen in Ottawa and
Paris.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Phillips, at 1600 21st Street NW, (202) 387-2151, is open 10
a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday to Saturday (until 8:30 P.M. on Thursdays)
and noon to 7 p.m. Sunday. It is closed Monday. Admission to the
Daumier show is $10, $7 for students and those over 62, and free
for those 18 and under.

EXTORTION SCHEME A NIGHTMARE FOR WEB RETAILERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY AND ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Internet retailers sought to assure the public Monday of the
security of on-line shopping, as federal authorities investigated
an alleged incident of cyber-terrorism in which a hacker may have
gained access to about 300,000 customer credit-card files belonging
to a Web firm.
</P>
<P>
   In a bizarre twist on the typical credit-card scam, the alleged
hacker _ who goes by ``Maxus'' _ began publishing credit-card
information over the Internet Dec. 25 after executives at CD
Universe in Wallingford, Conn., declined to respond to a note
demanding a $100,000 ransom, according to officials at CD Universe,
an on-line seller of music and videos.
</P>
<P>
   The case, first reported Sunday on the Internet, is unusual in
its scope and extortionist nature and has the potential to unnerve
consumers and add a chilling effect on the torrid pace at which
buyers have raced on to the Internet to purchase everything from
shoes to shingles, retail experts say.
</P>
<P>
   While some downplayed the significance of the incident, it could
prove a public-relations nightmare for the e-commerce industry.
</P>
<P>
   Given that privacy and security are hot-button issues for
consumers, many of whom just seem to have gotten comfortable with
the idea of on-line shopping, the travails of CD Universe have the
potential to become ``an industry-wide problem,'' said Yobie
Benjamin, chief e-commerce strategist for accounting firm Ernst &AMP;
Young.
</P>
<P>
   While credit-card fraud is hardly new, the Internet adds other
dimensions to the crime that give consumers more pause, said Win
Treese, vice president of technology at Open Market Inc., an
e-commerce software vendor in Burlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet now offers ways to attack organizations from a
distance in a way we didn't have before, and computer technology
allows people to stage those attacks on a larger scale,'' Treese
said. ``As the Internet has grown, so has the number of attacks.
We're likely to see more and more such attempts.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though a consumer whose credit-card number has been stolen
over the Internet may be liable for $50 or less, the thought that
private financial information can be floating around in cyberspace
is scary.
</P>
<P>
   The security breach experienced at CD Universe could be ``the
kiss of death'' for any individual retail Web site, added Alan
Alper, an analyst with Gomez Advisors of Lincoln, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Brewer, head of investor relations for eUniverse, which
owns CD Universe, said the incident ``hasn't been good for
business,'' but declined to disclose the impact on the company's
sales, saying the company was focused on protecting its existing
customers. He would not provide further details, saying the matter
was in the hands of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   While e-commerce experts sought to sort out the significance of
the incident, one on-line consumer said he was taken aback by the
news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy cow!'' said Bruce D. Weinberg, a professor at Boston
University's Graduate School of Management. Since September, he has
forsaken brick-and-mortar stores to buy everything on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty optimistic about e-commerce in general, but this
gives me pause,'' he said. ``The key to this whole thing working is
trust, and this is a big breach of trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Trust may be a key point. As retail Web sites seek to become
profitable, they hope to learn more about their customers to serve
them better. But a few incidents of fraud could make consumers
reluctant to share information with a retail Web site even if they
continue to shop on line.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to preserve that trust, popular retail Web sites sought
to reassure the public that in their haste to exploit the Internet
bonanza, they hadn't skimped on security measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since day one, we've had elaborate security measures in place
to prevent unauthorized access to credit-card information,'' said
spokesman Bill Curry of Amazon.com, one of the Web's best-known
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   The news that some credit-card information might be exposed to
public view on the Internet comes at a bad time. The e-commerce
industry spent several years trying to overcome the fears of
mainstream consumers who balked at making on-line purchases because
of concerns about credit-card security.
</P>
<P>
   After much persuasion, consumers seemingly had grown comfortable
about on-line security. During the recent holidays, they made
purchases that could total $12 billion, up from about $3 billion in
holiday purchases in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But CD Univers's security breach has reawakened old fears. The
tale of intrigue, first reported by internetnews.com Sunday and
detailed in Monday's New York Times, sketched a scenario of a
mysterious hacker, possibly a teenager from Russia, who threatened
CD Universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found a security hole. Pay me and I fix it,'' the hacker
allegedly said, according to a sample page taken off a rogue Web
site published by the hacker. The Web site, which supposedly
invited visitors to download ``a real credit card directly from the
biggest on-line shop database,'' has since been dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   Some retail experts say consumer reticence will be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long haul, we're looking at little to no impact,'' said
Charles Rutstein, senior analyst at Forrester Research in
Cambridge, Mass. ``The convenience of shopping on line far
outweighs these security hiccups, especially when the consumer's
maximum liability is $50.''
</P>
<P>
   Most experts say customers who immediately inform the
credit-card company of a potentially fraudulent purchase have
little or no liability. Visa USA, for example, said in such cases
its card holders have ``zero liability.''
</P>
<P>
   The liability limit, however, does not apply to debit cards,
cautioned Weld Pond, a computer security expert at Lopht Heavy
Industries, a Boston company that recently launched (at)Stake Inc.,
a company that specializes in on-line security.
</P>
<P>
   ``People shouldn't use their debit cards; they should use only
credit cards on the Net,'' Pond said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday some e-commerce analysts suggested there is a gold rush
mentality among Web retailers to get up and running as quickly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   According to conventional wisdom, there's only a narrow window
of opportunity for a retailer to strike it rich on the Web; miss
that window, and a Web site is likely to fail or be gobbled up by a
larger rival.
</P>
<P>
   In its haste to get off to a fast start, a Web site,
particularly a small one, might take short cuts on security, some
analysts suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Given the potential for a publicity nightmare, most of the
larger and more reputable merchants have taken pains to secure
their retail Web sites, said Alper of Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no site, no matter how established, is impenetrable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only solution is constant vigilance,'' said Benjamin of
Ernst &AMP; Young. ``You just can't throw up a firewall and say, `I've
taken care of the problem.' ''
</P>
<P>
   CD Universe, which has been in business since 1996, used a
well-known payment security software sold by CyberCash Inc., a
large publicly traded company that serves numerous on-line
merchants. Officials at CyberCash could not be reached Monday for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing as 100-percent security,'' Benjamin
added. ``It's still buyer beware.''

SOUTH CAROLINA GOP LIMITS BLACK VOTES, GROUP SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The South Carolina Republican Party deliberately
closed polling places in black areas during the last two
presidential primaries, and should be prevented by the federal
government from doing so in next month's primary, according to a
complaint filed with the Justice Department by a group of South
Carolina voters.
</P>
<P>
   But state party officials say they are merely closing polls
where they do not have enough Republican voters or workers to staff
the voting booths.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint was filed last week by A. Lee Parks, an Atlanta
lawyer best known for a series of anti-affirmative action lawsuits,
on behalf of J. Todd Rutherford, a black Democratic state
representative from Columbia, S.C., and seven voters both black and
white. It charges that the state party violated the Voting Rights
Act by keeping open the usual polling places in white areas, while
closing or consolidating polling places in black areas.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in rural Williamsburg County, which is 60 percent
black, polling places in only five of 32 precincts were open,
according to the complaint. In black districts of larger cities,
like Columbia and Greenville, voters were not told that they were
expected to travel to another precinct to vote, said Rutherford,
but all polling places in white precincts were open.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina is apparently the only state in the country where
political parties pay for and administer their primaries without
supervision or oversight by the state elections board. The parties
even tabulate their own votes, and the state does not keep track of
who votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party is preventing many black citizens from
having equal access to this primary election process based on the
stereotypical notion that black voters are not `Republican'
voters,'' the complaint says.
</P>
<P>
   The state party has not yet published its list of polling places
for the Feb. 19 primary, but J. Sam Daniels, the party's executive
director, said many more places would be open than in 1996,
particularly in larger cities. But Daniels said that of the 1,787
precincts around the state where primary plans have been made,
polling places would be open in only 1,011 of them, or 56 percent.
There are about 1,900 precincts in the state.
</P>
<P>
   He denied that race played any role in determining which
precincts would have their usual polling places open. The decision
is often made based on whether a county party can supply manpower
to keep a polling place open, he said, which can be difficult in
traditionally Democratic areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1996, only 876 people voted in the Republican Party in all
of Williamsburg County,'' Daniels said. ``We have to work with the
election commission in each county, and in Democrat-controlled
counties, we don't have as many people. But we try and open up as
many polling places as we possibly can, because we want to have as
many voters as we possibly can.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not know how many polls would be open in
Williamsburg County.
</P>
<P>
   Christine DeBartolo, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department in
Washington, said the department was aware of the concerns that have
been expressed about the Republican primary in South Carolina, but
could not comment on their substance. Under the Voting Rights Act,
the department can sue to void the results of an election if it
decides that voting was conducted in a discriminatory way.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina Democrats asserted that the phrase
``Democrat-controlled counties'' was really a euphemism for mostly
black counties, which are the historical bastions of support for
the party in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a history of saying they want more African-American
involvement in their party, but then they close polling places
during the primary,'' said Richard A. Harpootlian, the state
Democratic chairman. ``It's consistent with the Confederate flag
mentality of the South Carolina Republican party, and I think it's
outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats like Harpootlian and Rutherford were clearly more
interested in scoring points against the Republicans than in having
more blacks vote in the Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   But the story is different with the lawyer who filed the suit,
A. Lee Parks of Atlanta, who has a long history of successfully
fighting race-based admissions programs at state universities, as
well as racially gerrymandered election districts. Lee said he
helped work on the complaint because he believed that the party was
mistakenly making it more difficult for blacks to vote as
Republicans, including those who might want to vote for Alan Keyes,
a black Republican presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you open the polling places that the white voters know how
to get to, but not the black voters, it's the epitome of
racializing the political process,'' said Parks, who said he was
not affiliated with either political party. ``It would be a grave
danger to our political system to have parties exclusively
identified with one race or the other. It just perpetuates myths
and stereotypes about the races.''
</P>
<P>
   It also violates the Voting Rights Act, the complaint charges.
The law applies to portions of 16 states, including all of South
Carolina, with a history of discrimination in voting. Among other
provisions, the law requires that no class of people should have
``less opportunity than other members of the electorate to
participate in the political process.''
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina Republican primary, the first vote after the
often erratic contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, is a crucial
milepost on the road to the party's presidential nomination, the
best early glimpse of support from the party's conservative core.
No Republican nominee since 1980 has failed to win the state's
primary, and this year, both of the leading candidates, George W.
Bush and John McCain, have spent a great deal of time campaigning
there.
</P>
<P>
   The primary is open to all registered voters, not just
Republicans, and crossover voting by Democrats is likely to play a
significant role in determining the winner this year. Because the
Democratic primary, coming nearly three weeks later on March 9, has
a less significant role, many Democrats and independent voters may
decide to join in the Feb. 19 voting.

SPEAKER SEES STATE BAILOUT OF HARVARD HMO AS A `LAST RESORT' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX AND STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Calling Harvard Pilgrim Health Care's financial
distress a crisis, House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran says the use of
state tax funds should be ``a last resort'' to keep the region's
largest HMO from failing. But he did not rule out, in an interview,
a state role in saving the sinking health plan.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran said Monday it is ``very, very premature to talk about
a state bailout of any of the HMOs.'' But he signaled the
Legislature's readiness to grapple with the Harvard Pilgrim
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a state guarantee of revenue bonds to lower the
interest rate that Harvard Pilgrim might otherwise have to pay is
``one of dozens of creative options and solutions that might be
considered,'' Finneran said.
</P>
<P>
   Such a bond guarantee might go beyond a bond deal that was
canceled last week when Harvard Pilgrim told state officials the
extent of its losses. The aborted bond issue would not have been
backed by the state's financial guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran said a legislated bond guarantee ``might not be
inappropriate if there were other ways that Harvard Pilgrim and
other vendors can't achieve a turnaround without state means.''
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent reference to Governor Paul Cellucci, who last
week suggested that the state's windfall financial settlement from
its lawsuit against tobacco companies might be tapped to bail out
Harvard Pilgrim, Finneran said, ``I have to hesitate when people
cavalierly say, `Let the state do it. They have the tobacco money.'
We have to have some regard for the precedent that would create.''
</P>
<P>
   The House speaker's remarks reflected a general mood of what he
called ``sober urgency'' on Beacon Hill Monday as the implications
of Harvard Pilgrim's fiscal emergency began to sink in.
</P>
<P>
   The health maintenance organization, the largest health plan in
the region with more than a million members, was put in state
receivership a week ago after health plan executives discovered an
additional $58.5 million in 1999 liabilities. That brought last
year's losses to a staggering $177 million, leading to cancellation
of the bond issue planned to bring in cash needed to pay off old
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran proposed Monday that he, Governor Cellucci, and Senate
President Thomas F. Birmingham lead a commission to address the
difficulties that all the state's HMOs are facing. The commission
would also include HMO chiefs, hospital executives, and leading
physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to do is step back and take a somber, rational
assessment of the situation,'' Finneran said. ``A group of this
stature would command almost instantaneous credibility and
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Finneran presented his idea at a regular weekly meeting of the
House and Senate leaders with the governor and lieutenant governor
and their top fiscal staffs. Cellucci is on vacation in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker said he was motivated to propose the commission
partly because of what he said has been the ``piling on and
exploitation of the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the absence of a credible group of leaders anything can
surface in the vacuum,'' Finneran said. ``It's very easy to create
a panic. The dominoes that can fall will be hard dominoes to
restore.''
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham told reporters he plans to meet with Harvard Pilgrim
chief executive Charles Baker, state Insurance Commissioner Linda
Ruthardt, Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly, hospital officials,
and others.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, state Human Services Secretary William D. O'Leary
said he is launching an ambitious ``diagnosis'' of what ails the
state's health care system, at Cellucci's request.
</P>
<P>
   A major focus of O'Leary's effort, he said, will be whether the
state needs new, more effective regulation of HMOs and the health
care industry in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the answers are overregulation or no
regulation,'' O'Leary said in an interview. ``We need to be able to
make sure that a number of interconnected health systems are able
to work with each other. To some extent that means regulation.
That's not something we would shy away from.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruthardt, the HMO's court-appointed receiver, said she does not
know how long it will take to plumb the true depth of the health
plan's financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their systems were hiding liabilities from them,'' Ruthardt
said at a news conference, the first of a planned series of daily
briefings on the issue. ``That's serious. If you don't know how
much your products cost, you don't know how to price them.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, at the same news conference, emphasized that after the
flurry of events of the past week, ``it's now business as usual.
Harvard Pilgrim is paying its bills.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials also conceded at the briefing that they would not
have a clear understanding of the health plan's day-to-day finances
until late Monday with the first daily ``cash report.'' The report
will give an accounting of how much money the health plan took in
and how much it paid out Monday.
</P>
<P>
   More light will be shed on Harvard Pilgrim's finances Tuesday in
an official accounting of what Harvard owes its 10 largest
creditors, Ruthardt said. But that report is likely to give only a
crude estimate of Harvard Pilgrim's debts, officials said, largely
because the health plan's financial records are so unreliable that
in some cases Harvard Pilgrim has been forced to rely on what
hospitals say they are owed, insurance division officials said
after the briefing.
</P>
<P>
   The true extent of Harvard Pilgrim's debts won't be known until
accountants from KPMG Peat Marwick, hired by the insurance
division, finish a detailed analysis of Harvard Pilgrim's records
going back at least to 1997, Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that evaluation is complete, it will present us with the
ability to evaluate options,'' Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   State Auditor Joseph DeNucci sent a letter to Ruthardt Monday to
``offer my immediate assistance'' in auditing Harvard Pilgrim's
finances. The letter was a response to a request by Secretary of
State William F. Galvin Monday that DeNucci's office supervise the
private accounting firms retained by Ruthardt and Harvard Pilgrim.
Galvin said the private firms shouldn't be trusted to provide
accurate, timely figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand and appreciate the secretary's concerns,''
Reilly said. ``But we are very comfortable that KPMG Peat Marwick
will be able to do the job that is expected of them.''

PROPOSED MERGER RENEWS CONCERNS ABOUT CONTROL OVER MEDIA OUTLETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those inclined to chew over the future of journalism and the
freedom of information, it was feast time on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The merger of Time Warner, the biggest of the old media
companies, with AOL, the biggest of the new, renewed the concern
that news outlets are losing their independence. And it fanned the
newer concerns that the Internet, the garden in which a thousand
sources of information would bloom, had itself become prey to the
corporate consolidations. The worry is not that there are fewer
media outlets _ the opposite is true _ but that few people have
ultimate control over them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional autonomy of journalism that existed arguably
from the 1940s and 1950s to the 1980s has come under sustained
attack,'' said Robert A. McChesney, a professor of communications
at the University of Illinois. ``It is a business thing, he added.
``It's rarely ideological. Good journalism is bad business and bad
journalism is, regrettably, at times good business.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the
Senate Judiciary committee, released a statement which said, in
part: ``The great promise of the Internet has been to allow people
a wide range of information sources and choices. What we should do
is to make sure that all that information does not become funneled
and controlled by just two or three sources.`
</P>
<P>
   The criticism, when raised about the merger announced on Monday,
were speculative, based on the increasing links and controls that
led McChesney to assert, in his book ``Rich Media, Poor
Democracy,'' that just nine major companies controlled much of the
information and the delivery systems around the world: Time Warner,
Disney, Sony, General Electric (NBC's parent), AT&AMP;T, News Corp,
Seagram (its media holdings are concentrated in music and film),
Viacom (CBS' parent) and Bertelsmann.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Monday, McChesney argued that the new merger
shows ``the Internet is being brought pretty fully into the circle
of commercial corporate media.'' He added: ``The Internet is going
to have a billion websites from every possible point of view, but
it is not going to spawn a new generation of commercially viable
media companies. The few that are left are destined to be bought.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who see the future of the information revolution as a
Manichean struggle between corporate Goliaths and valiant,
unencumbered Davids, McChesney and Leahy are sounding alarms that
must be heard. But others see the latest merger as just one more
incremental step in a process that poses no immediate threat.
</P>
<P>
   Richard A. Epstein, a law professor at the University of Chicago
who has studied antitrust issues, said smaller voices can still be
heard in the media universe. ``I'm not so sure I'm pleased about
this,'' he said, ``but, my God _ you don't have to be big to be
pesky in this business. If someone puts out a story in a small
paper that gets attention, it gets migrated.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, he said, allows ``minnow to swim in there with the
whales. ``You can have entries at the fringes, and pretty soon
someone else can become Goliath. And may it be me,'' he added.
While he is mildly concerned about the concentration of media
ownership, he said is more concerned about ``the boring commonality
of the opinions'' of journalists in general.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists at Time Inc. interviewed on Monday were perhaps less
concerned with their independence than their new corporate status _
or the value of retirement accounts, filled with Time Warner stock
that appreciated 40 percent on the news of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   One top Time Inc. editor with more than 20 years at the company,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said ``There's been a
considerable reinvestment in the editorial product.''
</P>
<P>
   The editor also pointed out that in the past couple of weeks,
Time Inc. journalists have done stories that caused problems for
Time Warner management _ particularly the Sports Illustrated
interview with John Rocker, a relief pitcher for the Atlanta
Braves. His denunciation of New York City and various of its
inhabitants has him in trouble with organized baseball. Times
Warner owns the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone could argue that good corporate citizens would never
have run that article,'' the editor remarked. ``So I haven't seen
an example of corporate ownership coloring the way we do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have pointed to the recent Time magazine cover on
the Pokemon phenomenon _ and the release of a Warner Brothers
movie, ``Pokemon: The First Movie'' _ as an example of journalism
as corporate boosterism. But Walter Isaacson, Time's managing
editor, has responded that the movie provided a good excuse to
write about something that every parent of elementary
schoolchildren is all too familiar with.
</P>
<P>
   And having corporate connections did the journalists of Time
Warner little good with this singular news event. Norman
Pearlstine, the editor in chief of Time Incorporated, found out
that his parent company, Time Warner, was about to merge with
America Online, at about 7 p.m. Sunday night, long after Time and
Fortune, the magazines that would care most about the events, had
gone to press.
</P>
<P>
   But since he was not a member of the board of directors, like
most of his predecessors in the job, there was no need to include
him _ and he did not have to decide whether to honor his corporate
commitments and conceal the news from his journalists, or honor his
commitment to the news at the risk of divulging corporate secrets.
</P>
<P>
   That is the bittersweet reality of journalism for the heirs of
Henry Luce's magazines, who are lower on the corporate totem pole
than ever before, thanks to the third major corporate marriage for
Time Inc. employees in the past decade.

AOL CHAIRMAN IS USED TO ADAPTING TO CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Hawaii)   (With AOL-TIME-WARNER)  
(lb) 
 By AMY HARMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps the only thing stranger than America Online's chairman,
Stephen M. Case, announcing plans to assume the helm of the world's
largest media conglomerate on Monday was the fact that he wore a
suit and tie to do it.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Case, 41, heads an Internet company perpetually
thought to be doomed and is known for clinging to his casual
costume of denim shirts and khakis on even the most formal
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   But if his attire changes with his company's acquisition of Time
Warner, it should come as no surprise. Since the days of 300-baud
modems, Case has survived the Internet's accelerated evolution with
a series of transformations. His deal with Time Warner is only the
most recent.
</P>
<P>
   It is a character trait that did not go unnoticed by Time
Warner's chairman, Gerald Levin, who had shed his own tie before
Monday's news conference announcing the deal and who took a certain
relish in welcoming the ``suits from Virginia,'' where America
Online is based.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Steve proposed that I be CEO in that very first phone
call, it caught my attention, because it said something about who
he is,'' Levin said Monday of Case's approach. ``Here is someone
who has built an extremely successful company, still early in his
career, and he was saying `I'm going to give my baby to you as the
CEO because I think that is what's best for both companies.'''
</P>
<P>
   The decision underscored the combination of idealism and
pragmatism that has served Case well through several episodes of
turmoil. Seemingly shy and reserved, Case conceived of a grand
vision for America Online over a decade ago and refused to abandon
it, despite competition that seemed insurmountable and detractors
unwilling to be appeased.
</P>
<P>
   James Kimsey, the company's co-founder and former chairman, said
Case was weaned on crisis. In America Online's earliest years, the
company was constantly running out of money. Trying to find new
partners to carry it through was part of Case's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve was well schooled in the harrowing ways of high tech and
particularly in an emerging medium,'' Kimsey said. ``We had very
few resources so we were forced to figure out how to get other
people to carry our water.''
</P>
<P>
   Case, who was raised in Hawaii and received a bachelor's degree
in political science from Williams College, spent his first
postcollege years working in marketing for giants like PepsiCo and
Procter &AMP; Gamble _ he helped invent the slogan ``Towelette? You
bet!'' and then watched the P&AMP;G product fail.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1983, when he hooked up his Kaypro computer to an early
version of an online service, he began to envision an interactive
world where people all over the country could gather. At a company
then known as Quantum Computer Services, he and Kimsey pursued that
vision.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem was that IBM and Sears had a similar idea.
Their venture, Prodigy, was an online service started a year before
America Online and had parents with deep pockets, so it was easy
for industry watchers to see that the fledgling America Online
would lose that battle. But Prodigy, which was slower to introduce
Internet access and e-mail, stumbled as Case's company gathered
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   With the birth of the World Wide Web, industry pundits again
predicted the end for proprietary services like America Online. But
partly in response to the Web's popularity, the service switched to
flat-rate pricing in 1996 and attracted more interest than it could
handle. Its lack of preparation resulted in one of the worst
moments in the company's history, as millions of customers were
shut out with busy signals.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind. Case quickly expanded capacity and announced a
series of executive appointments aimed at getting back in his
customers' good graces. With his frequently posted letters to
subscribers, Case fostered an image of the company as friendly and
open to criticism.
</P>
<P>
   In its first incarnation, America Online billed itself as an
online community. With the new executive team _ including Robert
Pittman, who had built the MTV brand _ in place, the company began
to advertise itself as a vehicle for convenience. Now it is looking
to expand its revenues from e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Once disdained by techies as poorly designed training wheels for
the real Internet, America Online last year acquired Netscape
Communications, a Silicon Valley darling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both grew up with a belief that change is good and should
be embraced rather than feared,'' said Daniel H. Case III, Case's
older brother, who is chief executive of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
``Growing up in Hawaii, you had to wonder: What's the boundary?
When we went to college our father told us, `It's all a long way
away, why not go to the East Coast?' So if you're trying to invent
a new industry, why not be the leader?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Case's willingness to adapt to the changing environment does
not come without its casualties. He has pushed aside executives,
including Ted Leonsis, a former president who was once slated to
run the company's media ventures, when he decided on a change of
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In inviting Levin to be chief executive, Case displayed a shrewd
negotiating tactic, but perhaps at the expense of some America
Online executives who have run the company's day-to-day operations.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Case says, he wants to evolve once more as chairman of Time
Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decade ago, AOL had less than 100,000 members and the World
Wide Web hadn't been invented,'' he said. ``Now I'm a billionaire
and on the cover of all these magazines, but I hope my personal
legacy is not about making money. It may sound corny, but I want to
focus on the things I care about. I want to change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Case will be able to exercise as much control over his
own company's evolution in the wake of a combination remains to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``With America Online, you always got the feeling that they
wanted you to like them,'' wrote one subscriber on an America
Online bulletin board on Monday. He added, ``I have never felt such
vibes from Time Warner.''

MERGER OF ALL MERGERS STARTED WITH A SIMPLE PHONE CALL 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Steve Case, the chief executive of America Online, called
Gerald Levin, chief executive of Time Warner last October to
suggest a merger, it was not clear that they would have much to
talk about.
</P>
<P>
   America Online was a prickly suitor, having already rebuffed
overtures from AT&AMP;T. And while Case had spent two years on the
prowl for a major league partner in the mainstream
telecommunications and media world, he was unwilling to get
together with just any admirer of his high-flying Internet concern.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, for his part, was not seeking to sell Time Warner. But he
knew that his cable, entertainment, and news company had failed to
conquer the Web, while Case had managed to build AOL from a company
many were prepared to bury just two years ago into the master of
the online universe. And Levin had something that many executives
Case met did not: a recent track record of embracing even the most
headstrong entrepreneurs. After all, Levin had already made a deal
with Ted Turner, the flamboyant and unpredictable founder of Cable
News Network.
</P>
<P>
   It took a few months, but from that start AOL and Time Warner
were on course to attempt not just the biggest corporate merger in
history, but to create perhaps the first true entity with a hand in
all aspects of the converging entertainment and technology
industries.
</P>
<P>
   At issue for weeks was how much control Levin would have in a
combined concern. A deal with America Online would give Time Warner
access to more than 20 million new subscribers, potential buyers of
the company's music, video and media products. But his company's
$97 billion market value was dwarfed by that of America Online's,
which last week hit $164 billion and whose shareholders are
destined to emerge with about 55 percent of the new company.
</P>
<P>
   Case, too, had his own concerns. He wanted to be sure that, even
though he was willing to hand over the day-to-day task of running
the company to Levin, he could still exert a powerful influence
over its new direction as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Such arrangements rarely work. When Time Warner merged with the
Turner Broadcasting System in 1995, analysts predicted that the
abrasive and strong-willed Turner _ despite ceding control of the
company he had built _ would inevitably clash with Levin. But
instead, Levin, who has his own reputation as a hard-nosed
aggressive manager, stayed in charge and managed to pacify Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``What gives outside observers confidence is that Gerry Levin
has proved he can work with someone who is as entrepreneurial and
as impatient as Ted Turner,'' said Michael J. Wolf, a senior
partner in the entertainment and Internet practice at Booz, Allen &AMP;
Hamilton. ``In a lot of ways the impatience and speed at America
Online will translate well at Time Warner.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal _ which still faces a number of hurdles, including the
possibility that another media or technology giant might make a bid
for Time Warner _ finally came together last Thursday after a
five-hour dinner at Case's home near America Online's headquarters
in northern Virginia just outside Washington. Case and Levin and
two other executives then toasted a possible combination over an
expensive red wine from Case's private cellar and called their
advisers later that night to begin working out the details.
</P>
<P>
   But such a deal might never have happened if not for Case's
dogged determination. He had several long phone conversations with
Levin, in effect, wooing him with his vision of the wired future.
Bob Pittman, America Online's president, who had been a top
executive at Time Warner, called on old friends. And Kenneth
Novack, AOL's vice chairman and a close confidant of Case, took on
the role of dealmaker, working through the nuts and bolts to make
it happen.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they met for dinner, Levin and Richard J. Bressler,
chairman of Time Warner's Digital Media division, were ready to
settle the critical outstanding issues with Case and Novack. They
arrived at about 6:30 p.m., Novack said. By dessert, they had
agreed on the size of the minority stake _ 45 percent _ that Time
Warner shareholders would get in a combined company. Levin and Case
also agreed that both companies would have equal representation on
the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Case and Levin first got to know each other in Paris in
September, when they co-chaired a convocation of media and
technology executives known as the Global Business Dialogue on
E:Commerce. They grew increasingly comfortable with each other over
several meetings a week later in Shanghai at the Fortune Global
Forum.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Levin was concerned about what to do about
the difference between AOL's outsized value in the stock market
compared with Time Warner's more modest valuation but much greater
revenues and cash flow. ``Both sides had to confront the valuation
disparity between media companies and Internet companies,'' said
Jeffrey Sine, a media investment banker at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, which is a long-time adviser to Time Warner. Levin
initially wanted Time Warner shareholders to end up owning a 50
percent share of the combined company, while Case made clear that
AOL's greater worth in the eyes of investors justified giving a
majority stake to its shareholders. Still, the two companies agreed
to keep talking despite the impasse over price.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's Novack, who lives in Boston, said he and Bressler first
met last November, where they mapped out many of the advantages of
a combination on a white board in Bressler's office at Time Warner
in New York. They met again on December 13 with investment bankers
in tow. There Novack said he and America Online's adviser from
Salomon Smith Barney ``gave our thoughts about how to structure a
deal and asked for their thinking on how it could be win/win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bressler listened, as did his adviser from Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter. They once again made the case that Time Warner shareholders
deserved half of the company. They also demanded some sort of price
protection if America Online's stock price dropped sharply. When
the four executives left, said Novack, ``it was not clear we were
anywhere closer to a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Levin was not ready to walk away. ``The more time we all
spent together, the more excited we got about the prospects,''
Bressler said. What it came down to, Bressler said, is that Levin
``needed to make a judgment. He began to realize that owning 45
percent of a merged America Online and Time Warner was more
important than owning 100 percent of Time Warner.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Two days before Christmas, in Novack's office in Boston, the
executives from Time Warner said then they would be willing to give
up their demand for price protection. They also moved closer to
Case's position, but insisted that their shareholders should own at
least a 45 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Once Case and Levin had agreed in principle to a deal, their
advisers really jumped into action. Over the weekend an army of
executives from AOL and bankers from Salomon Smith Barney showed up
at Simpson Thacher &AMP; Bartlett, AOL's law firm, setting up computers
in conference rooms to handle the mountains of data necessary to
analyze the combination.
</P>
<P>
   At Cravath Swaine &AMP; Moore, Time Warner's law firm, one lawyer
had to return from a vacation in Antigua to hammer out the last
details. Even Mary Meeker, Morgan Stanley's celebrated Internet
analyst, was roused for an early Saturday morning meeting, one
executive said, at the New York apartment of Joseph Perella, head
of Morgan's investment banking, where she was first told about the
deal in preparation for a presentation to Time Warner's board the
next day. It was such short notice that she rode her bicycle across
Central Park, showing up in a green track suit.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, both boards met on their own _ and after hours of
discussion _ agreed to the deal. And in an uncharacteristic
gesture, Levin called Case in America Online's board room late
Sunday night to welcome him into the club.
</P>
<P>
   And in the larger sense AOL and Time Warner are creating a club,
new and still unformed, whose membership is up for grabs. The deal
that brought together Time Inc. and Warner Communications ``is 10
years old,'' said Bressler in an interview Monday. ``America Online
is 14 years old.'' He then laughed. ``I guess that means they are
the old timers here.''

   Philip Morris Cos. is expected to announce Tuesday that it has
developed technology that might reduce the number of fires started
by cigarettes, a move that comes more than a decade after lawmakers
and fire safety experts said the tobacco industry could make such
products.
</P>

   The company plans to test market the new paper in Merit
cigarettes, one of its least-popular brands, and, if it proves
successful, could expand its use to Marlboro, the nation's leading
cigarette.

   Cigarette makers have long faced calls to reduce the propensity
of cigarettes to start fires, because about 25 percent of fatal
residential fires start when a smoker falls asleep in bed or a
lighted cigarette is dropped on a couch or chair. In 1997 about 900
people, including 140 children, were killed in such fires,
according to the most recent figures from the federal Consumer
Product Safety Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, Philip Morris officials said the new
technology involved placing thin layers of extra paper at points
along a cigarette. The rings of paper reduce the amount of oxygen
entering the cigarette, slowing down the rate at which it burns and
the heat it generates, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paper rings act like speed bumps'' to slow down a burning
cigarette, said John Nelson, the company's senior vice president
for operations.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said initial tests had shown that cigarettes
using the new paper did not taste different, burn differently when
puffed or present any added health risks.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Monday, several lawmakers, regulators and
fire-safety experts said that although they welcomed the
development, it was long overdue. They said Philip Morris' own
documents showed that the company had conducted extensive research
in the mid-1980s to develop a so-called fire-safe cigarette, even
producing samples that it said were ``acceptable to consumers.''
The company dropped the project, however, saying it was not
commercially feasible.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, Philip Morris and other cigarette makers have
battled efforts to legally require that cigarettes be made less
likely to cause fires. They also challenged efforts by government
scientists in the late 1980s to begin a system to measure the fire
propensity of different brands and argued that flammable upholstery
fabrics were the real problem with residential fires.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew McGuire, the executive director of the Trauma Foundation,
a group in San Francisco that has long advocated for fire-safe
cigarettes, said the move by Philip Morris had to be weighed
against all the lives that had been lost over the last decade in
cigarette-related fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find this all disingenuous, to say the least,'' McGuire
said. ``It is nice that they have done it. It is tragic that all
those had to die in the meantime.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joseph Moakley, D-Mass., said that since 1979, when a house
fire killed a family in his district, he had been trying to get
legislation passed to improve the fire safety of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always believed that a company that makes this torch should
be responsible for its final destiny,'' Moakley said.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Lilly, Philip Morris' vice president for technology, said
that around 1988, company researchers developed the idea for the
banded paper used in the new cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Lilly said, the company has been working to
determine whether the idea was feasible in large-scale production.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette paper is produced on presses that generate enough
paper in one minute to make 310,000 cigarettes. And the process of
applying thin, evenly spaced lines of added material across
cigarette paper as those presses are running is extremely complex,
Lilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris officials said the propensity of the new
cigarettes to start fires varied with the fabric tested. However,
in one test developed by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology, cigarettes using the new paper ignited a thick cotton
canvas four times in 96 tries, Lilly said. In contrast, a standard
cigarette ignited the cotton material in 70 of 96 trials.
</P>
<P>
   One hurdle for the technology is that the new paper will at
times cause the cigarette to extinguish.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris officials said they had met last week with
officials of the Consumer Product Safety Commission to discuss the
new technology and had received a positive reception.
</P>
<P>
   The commission participated in two large studies of fire-safe
cigarettes in the last two decades, including a 1987 review that
found that such products were technically and economically
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   About five cigarette brands already meet fire-safety criteria
established by government researchers. Most are filtered,
small-diameter cigarettes, like Philip Morris' Virginia Slims
brand, which already burn more slowly and generate less heat than
standard cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Brown, the commission's chairwoman, said Philip Morris
executives had visited the agency last week. She said they spoke
only generally about their decision to test-market the new
technology and did not share technical data.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if the cigarette made by Philip Morris will
really work,'' Ms. Brown said. ``These claims need to be
independently evaluated to determine whether the cigarette does
what the company says it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said they planned to start test marketing
Merit cigarettes using the new paper in cities including Denver,
Buffalo, N.Y., and Hartford, Conn. They declined to say when the
paper would be used in all Merit cigarettes or expanded to other
company brands.

 UNDATED: that problem.''   
<TEXT>
<P>
   But that solution, by joining its fate with Time Warner, could
come at a high cost for America Online. The online leader has been
a favorite on Wall Street because it is seen as a fast-growing
Internet company. Now, however, it is melding its business with a
slower-growing, though far larger, media company whose properties
range from Time magazine to CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a prayer that the combined company can grow at
anything like AOL's historical rates of growth,'' Yoffie said.
</P>
<P>
   Case of America Online said that he expected the far higher
valuations given to Internet companies than to media companies to
decline. But he held that view, he explained, not because he
thought investors had bid up Internet shares to outlandish heights,
but more because traditional media would be revived if they got
their Internet strategies right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional media assets have a vibrant future if they can be
catapulted into the Internet Age,'' Case said.
</P>
<P>
   By linking with Time Warner, Case is also betting that there
will be an advantage to owning those media brands, not just
distributing them through the America Online service. As the
Internet expands beyond the personal computer as the main way to
get online _ with people increasingly tapping into the Internet by
phones, television and handheld devices _ Case says consumers will
want an easy-to-use service that works on all those machines.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, in short, wants to be a one-stop service for the
Internet of the future. ``We don't want AOL to be a place people go
through to get someplace else,'' Case said. ``We want to be able to
create an integrated consumer space. That's why, ultimately, the
ownership of media brands will be important.''
</P>
<P>
   For Time Warner, the deal with America Online is seen as a fast
track to the Internet _ ``the digital transformation of Time
Warner,'' in Levin's terms. Time Warner had tried to make that
transformation on its own, and struggled badly at times. A World
Wide Web site, called Pathfinder, that offered the online versions
of most Time Warner magazines, for example, was abandoned after
years and millions of dollars in losses. Each publication,
including Time, Fortune, People, Sports Illustrated and
Entertainment Weekly, has its own site now.
</P>
<P>
   And Road Runner, the company's high-speed Internet service, has
more than 320,000 customers. But it has not grown as rapidly as
Time Warner had hoped and it is certainly not the online brand that
America Online is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Warner sees all its media properties going to the
Internet, movies, television, print and music, which is already
well on its way,'' said Harold Vogel, who heads a New York media
investment firm and is an adjunct professor of media economics at
Columbia University's business school. ``And the company has been
frustrated in not being able to exploit its cable and media assets
more effectively in the Internet arena.''
</P>
<P>
   The people behind the merger _ perhaps even more than the
strategy _ will determine whether the combination works. At the New
York press conference Monday, there was no shortage of smiles and
back-slapping and much warm talk of the ``shared vision'' of the
top executives of America Online and Time Warner. Levin went out of
his way to look informal, wearing a sport coat and no tie, while
Case, renowned for his khakis (once appearing in a Gap ad) and
rarely donning a coat, went out of his way to look formal, wearing
a suit.
</P>
<P>
   But the blunt-spoken Ted Turner, who is Time Warner's largest
shareholder with 100 million shares, acknowledged a key issue in
all larger mergers. Turner said the two executives' teams were
filled with ``strong personalities'' and that meant there was
``potential for some friction,'' though he said he did not expect
personality clashes to slow down the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders were even more skeptical. ``Sorting out these
businesses is going to be a task of monumental proportions,'' said
Yoffie, the Harvard professor.
</P>
<P>
   That chore, apparently, will fall mostly on the shoulders of
Levin, who will be chief executive of the combined company, and who
is a more seasoned manager than Case. ``I'll focus on the things
I'm best at _ strategy, technology, policy and running the board,''
Case said. ``Gerry will run the company.''

 NEW YORK: Internet services.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Notably, the deal raises the thorny question of how providers of
high speed internet access over cable systems should be regulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this merger the beginning of the end of the Internet as an
effective counterweight to traditional media outlets, or is this
just another step on the road to making the Internet a more useful
and usable source of information?'' asked Sen. Mike DeWine of Ohio,
the chairman of the antitrust subcommittee and Sen. Herb Kohl, its
ranking Democratic member, in a joint statement promising hearings
into the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The big cable operators, including AT&AMP;T and Time Warner have
long wanted to be the exclusive Internet providers on the systems
they own. But America Online has been calling for ``open access'' _
the ability to offer a high-speed service over any cable system
just as it offers its current service through the wires of any
telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's announcement, Time Warner pledged to support open
access to its cable systems by any Internet provider. In practice,
neither of the merger partners would have much business incentive
to deal exclusively only with each other. Were America Online to
restrict itself only to Time Warner's 13-million-subscriber cable
systems, it would be missing the opportunity to serve the tens of
millions of other people already on the Internet who might be
willing to sign up for a new, high-speed AOL.
</P>
<P>
   And Time Warner would be limiting the reach of its information
and entertainment products by disseminating its material only
through AOL Time Warner. Even now, for instance Time Warner's CNN
cable channel is distributed not simply to the company's own cable
subscribers but to cable systems around the world with an estimated
reach of 1 billion people.
</P>
<P>
   The man who started CNN two decades ago, was Ted Turner, Time
Warner's vice chairman and its largest shareholder. At Monday's
news conference, Turner explained his support for the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I cast my vote for 100 million shares, I did it with as
much excitement as I felt the first time I made love some 42 years
ago,'' Turner said. ``I voted for it because we will have a
stronger company that will create value. It's not so easy to go out
and recreate AOL. No one has been able to do it so far.''

   AOL DEAL FOR TIME WARNER SPURS STOCKS TO BIG GAINS
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices posted sharp gains, spurred in part by America
Online's $165 billion takeover of Time Warner. The deal touched off
demand for entertainment and Internet shares as investors piled
into companies that might be merger candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index recorded its biggest one-day point
gain, rising 167.05 points, or 4.3 percent, to 4,049.67. Led by
Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Intel, the Dow rose 49.64 points, to
11,572.20. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 16.13 points,
or 1.12 percent, to 1,457.60.

against earnings in the quarter ended March 31.
</P>
<P>
   ALCOA POSTS 53 PERCENT INCREASE IN PROFIT
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa, the world's biggest aluminum maker, said that its
fourth-quarter profit jumped 53 percent, driven by higher prices

   AETNA STREAMLINES GLOBAL UNITS
</P>
<P>
   Aetna said that it would combine its global operations into two
main units serving its health and financial businesses as it tries

</P>
<P>
   GM TO BUY REMAINING 50 PERCENT OF SAAB
</P>
<P>
   General Motors said that it would buy the half of Saab that it
does not already own for an undisclosed amount. The move could

BELICHICK HEARING SET FOR THURSDAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Belichick will have his day before National Football League
commissioner Paul Tagliabue Thursday at league headquarters in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue has set aside Thursday and Friday for Belichick and
his agent, Neil Cornrich, to make their case why Belichick should
be released from his contract with the Jets and allowed to go to
New England as head coach and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets and Belichick submitted their sides of the story over
the weekend, and Tagliabue studied the brief.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the new Jets owner is expected to be announced Tuesday in
New York. John Hess, son of the late Leon Hess, is expected to
appear before the league's Finance Committee and reveal whether the
team has been purchased by Charles Dolan of New York, who also owns
the Rangers, Knicks, and Madison Square Garden, or Woody Johnson of
Johnson &AMP; Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The Goldman Sachs investment firm in New York brokered the deal,
expected to bring more than $600 million to the Hess estate.
</P>
<P>
   After the new owner is selected, and the league's Finance
Committee signs off on the deal, that owner is expected to speak
with Bill Parcells, the former coach who is now director of
football operations, about picking a new coach.
</P>
<P>
   The guessing is that Parcells would prefer to promote linebacker
coach Al Groh to the head job, but that will be up to the next
owner.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has told friends that he does not want to coach again
and would prefer to stay in place as director of football
operations for another year, to help the new owner make the
transition.

MCCAIN TO PROPOSE PRIVATE ACCOUNTS IN SOCIAL SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain of Arizona on Tuesday will present
his first comprehensive plan for apportioning the spoils of the
nation's current prosperity, calling for a middle-class tax cut and
a program to shore up Social Security through the establishment of
individual investment accounts, his advisers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, the leading challenger to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, will set
out his proposals in a speech in New Hampshire at a time when his
campaign is trying to shift attention away from questions about
whether he pressured regulators on behalf of campaign contributors.
</P>
<P>
   The plan's centerpiece is an expansion of the 15 percent income
tax bracket, the lowest, to cover higher income levels. It would
also double the child credit, to $1,000, reduce the so-called
marriage penalty paid by many two-income couples, create new tax
incentives for savings and cut inheritance taxes on
multimillion-dollar estates.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is McCain's effort to draw a distinction with Bush over
how best to use the projected federal budget surplus, one of the
central issues in the campaign in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has focused on a big tax cut, valued by his campaign at
$483 billion over five years. McCain's tax cut is half the size of
Bush's, $240 billion over five years, and McCain would use much
more of the surplus in an effort to assure Social Security's
long-term solvency through the most sweeping overhaul in the
retirement system's 65-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Bush, McCain also specifically allocates money to help
Medicare, which like Social Security faces a financial shortfall as
the population ages, and for reducing the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very much in favor of tax cuts for middle-income and
lower-income Americans,'' McCain said during the Republican debate
in Michigan Monday night. ``I believe we must save Social Security,
we must pay down the debt, we have to make an investment in
Medicare. For us to put all of the surplus into tax cuts, I think
is not a conservative effort.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has discussed the outlines of his economic program
extensively, and his tax plan largely tracks a proposal he made
last summer. But he intends to lay out a number of new details on
Tuesday, his aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are a proposal to pay for much of his tax cut by
closing $150 billion worth of specific corporate tax loopholes over
the next five years, a plan sure to draw fire from the affected
industries, and his call for workers to have the option of
investing at least 20 percent of their Social Security payroll
taxes in private accounts, an approach bitterly opposed by liberal
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also seems certain to draw McCain deeper into a debate
with Bush over whose plan does more to help lower- and
middle-income people, a subject on which they have been trading
accusations for the last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have laid out a plan that is going to cut the rates on
everybody in America, a plan that is conservative and a plan that
is compassionate,'' Bush said during Monday night's debate.
</P>
<P>
   Independent analysts said McCain's proposal appeared to be
somewhat less tilted to the wealthiest taxpayers than Bush's plan.
But they said it also appeared to be slightly less beneficial to
people in the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers, those with incomes
under $40,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Robert S. McIntyre, the director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a
research organization that is often critical of Republican tax
proposals, said a preliminary analysis of McCain's plan showed that
it would give 34.9 percent of the tax cuts to people in the top 5
percent of income, $130,000 and above. Bush's plan would give 52.6
percent of its benefits to the same group.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's plan, McIntyre said, would give 6.7 percent of its
benefits to people in the bottom 60 percent of the income spectrum,
less than $39,000, compared with 11 percent under Bush's plan.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's advisers said his plan would benefit a family of four
with income of $40,000 more than Bush's plan. But Bush's campaign
was renewing its attack even before McCain formally unveiled his
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that people will pay more in taxes under a
McCain administration than under a Bush administration, no matter
how you cut it,'' said Ari Fleischer, Bush's spokesman. As for
McCain's assertion that his plan does more for lower- and
middle-income people, ``It's hard to see how the McCain plan
accomplishes that goal,'' Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   Under McCain's plan, the ceiling for the 15 percent bracket
would rise to $70,000 from $43,050 for couples filing jointly and
to $35,000 from $25,750 for single people.
</P>
<P>
   Its primary benefits would therefore go to people currently in
the 28 percent tax bracket _ couples with income between $43,050
and $104,050 and single people with income between $25,750 and
$62,450 _ although it would also help people in higher income
brackets.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain plan would limit the benefits of its proposed new tax
incentives for savings to lower- and middle-income people by
restricting it to taxpayers in the 15 percent bracket.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Social Security that could prove to be the most
politically sensitive component of McCain's plan. Like McCain, Bush
generally favors establishing private investment accounts within
the retirement system, and would use all of the estimated $2
trillion Social Security surplus over the next decade to help do
so.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush would allocate less of the non-Social Security surplus
to overhauling the retirement system than McCain.
</P>
<P>
   And the Republican approach is sure to face withering criticism
from most Democrats, who say that Social Security should remain an
ironclad commitment on the part of the government to retirees, and
should not subject individuals to the risks of investing in the
financial markets.

OPPOSITION FIGHTS PRESIDENT'S PLAN TO ADOPT U.S. DOLLAR FOR ECUADOR
  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador _ A decision by President Jamil Mahuad to try to
solve an economic crisis by adopting the U.S. dollar as the new
currency led to stepped-up calls Monday from opposition groups for
his ouster.
</P>
<P>
   The groups contended that the decision would lead to ``massive
impoverishment,'' and they threatened nationwide ``mobilizations
and paralyzations'' until he stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad made his announcement in a televised speech late Sunday
night, just two days after the managing director of the Central
Bank had said that the government had no intention of ``introducing
rushed, crazy measures.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad also said he had asked his entire 15-member cabinet to
resign, to give him maneuverability and warned opponents, ``We will
maintain order and discipline in this country,'' no matter the
cost.
</P>
<P>
   In the speech, Mahuad presented his proposal, which the board of
the Central Bank has to vote on, as a bold initiative that will
pull this Andean nation of 12 million people out of its worst
economic crisis since the Great Depression. ``Ecuador does not need
timid measures, but to go to the core of the problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize that I have been slow to act,'' Mahuad said by way
of apology for a dismal 1999, in which the economy contracted more
than 7 percent, inflation soared to more than 60 percent, and the
country defaulted on foreign debt. ``But I have my foot on the
accelerator now.''
</P>
<P>
   The move is intended, his administration said, to bring
stability to an economy that has been the victim of rampant
speculation against its currency, which lost 67 percent of its
value against the dollar last year.
</P>
<P>
   Most independent analysts, however, interpreted the
dollarization measure as a last-ditch effort to blunt the
resignation clamor. Mahuad, a Harvard-educated centrist, declared a
state of national emergency last week, for the fourth time since
taking office in August 1998. But a coalition of student, labor,
Indian and political groups said they would defy his ban on
protests and begin a general strike this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an act of desperation in the face of a crisis that is
spinning out of control, an attempt to remain in power despite the
loss of public support,'' Alberto Acosta, a prominent economic
analyst and political commentator, said. ``It is the unconditional
surrender of a country that recognizes its own inability to conduct
a monetary policy on its own.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad's decision to abandon the currency, the sucre, in favor
of the dollar won the support of banks and many business groups.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 18 months into his five-year term, though, the rest of
his support has all but vanished, as a result of the economic
crisis. In a recent poll, 8 percent of those who responded
expressed satisfaction with his performance, and 53 percent said he
should resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government, the Parliament, the courts, they have all got
to go,'' Antonio Vargas, leader of the most powerful Indian group,
said Monday at a news conference that denounced the dollar plan.
``Our decision is to pursue this to the final consequences, that
all of them go and the Ecuadorean people save themselves'' through
a new unity government.
</P>
<P>
   Even the always powerful military, which has supported Mahuad in
past crises, has offered only lukewarm support. On Saturday, the
Armed Forces issued a statement that, though it rejected joining
opposition groups in a patriotic junta and called for respect for
constitutional order, pointedly did not mention the president by
name.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton telephoned Mahuad on Friday to express his
support, and Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and officials of
the International Monetary Fund have also had encouraging words.
But that was before Mahuad decided to adopt the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Treasury Department, which has sole authority to print
dollars and monitors the use of the currency abroad, has not
encouraged Ecuador to use dollars as its currency, though it has at
least publicly not opposed the move.
</P>
<P>
   Economists are divided about whether such a step makes sense for
a country in crisis. Some say abandoning a weak currency in favor
of the dollar could shore up confidence. Others warn that quick
monetary fixes are no substitute for overhauling the weak banking
system and improving fiscal policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are closely watching developments in Ecuador,'' a senior
Treasury official said. ``Strong underlying economic policies,
including policies to ensure sound banking sector and public
finances, will be essential for Ecuador to achieve economic and
financial confidence.''

 &HT;    Candidates debate, agree and shake hands in latest meetingBy Ken
Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. _ Monday night's installment of the GOP
presidential debate road show centered on taxes, with frontrunner
George W. Bush and top foe Sen. John McCain differing over how to
spend the spoils of a booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says McCain's plan does not spend enough on tax cuts.
McCain believes Bush's plan dips too deeply into projected
surpluses and does not leave enough for protecting Social Security
and paying down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   But the two agreed to stay away from negative ads, with McCain
walking over to shake Bush's hand on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The debate at Calvin College was the third in five days,
following events in New Hampshire and South Carolina last week and
leading up to a Saturday forum in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their differences, Bush and McCain remained cordial to
each other. Bush, on the other hand, was occasionally caustic with
Steve Forbes, who is running ads accusing Bush of breaking a
no-new-taxes pledge while serving as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 90-minute debate, Bush remained animated, firing
vitriol at Forbes and lobbing an occasional one-liner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consider the source,'' Bush, who has an MBA from Harvard, said
when asked to respond to comments from a professor at his alma
mater.
</P>
<P>
   The tax talk began early when moderator Tim Russert of NBC asked
Bush to respond to the Forbes ad that notes Bush's 1995 tax package
included sales and business tax hikes to help pay for property tax
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, I laid out a plan that cut a billion dollars of
property taxes,'' Bush said. ``I am a tax-cutting person. I know
how to get it done. I have laid out a plan that is going to cut the
rates on everybody in America, a plan that is conservative and a
plan that is compassionate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes said voters should not trust Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pledges should not be lightly made and a pledge is a promise
and a promise made should be a promise kept,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, trying to poke holes in Bush's current tax plan, said
his version is ``basically comparable'' to the frontrunner's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure we need to give two-thirds of that tax cut to the
wealthiest 10 percent of Americans,'' McCain said, referring to
some assessments of the Bush plan. ``There is a fundamental
difference here. I believe we must save Social Security. We must
pay down the debt. We have to make an investment in Medicare. For
us to put all the surplus into tax cuts I think is not a
conservative effort. I think it is a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said efforts to leave money in Washington will prove
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's risky is to leave a lot of unspent money in Washington
because guess what's going to happen? It's going to be spent on
bigger government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain said it's the role of the president to use the veto
power make sure that doesn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   McCain plans to flesh out his tax plan today in South Carolina.
It will include a five-year, $240-billion package that will create
savings accounts for middle-income people and curtail corporate tax
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has complained that Bush's plan, a five-year, $483
billion package, is too ambitious, also will call for setting aside
$700 billion in projected surpluses to use for Social Security.

BRADLEY'S OFFER OF HIS SENATE PAPERS HITS A SNAG 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCETON, N.J. _ On Sunday, Bill Bradley said he would prove he
had never intervened on behalf of contributors by letting reporters
see all his papers from his 18 years in the Senate. Monday, that
did not seem so easy.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from his Democratic presidential campaign said Monday
that Bradley would file a request through the Freedom of
Information Act to get just some of those papers.
</P>
<P>
   In Des Moines, Iowa, on Sunday, Bradley said it had been his
policy in the Senate never to plead the case of constituents before
federal regulators, and he said he would have ``no problem'' with
reporters sifting through his Senate papers, which he had given to
his alma mater, Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
   But a Princeton spokesman said Monday that Bradley had deposited
the papers with the university on condition that they not be open
to the public. Bradley campaign workers at first responded by
saying the papers would have to be screened to remove personal
names and information, and then, a few hours later, they said they
would instead file the Freedom of Information request with federal
agencies for any correspondence Bradley had with them as a senator.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's offer followed a similar move by Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, the Republican presidential candidate who is dealing with
questions about letters he wrote to the Federal Communications
Commission about a case that affected an important campaign donor.
McCain has released hundreds of his letters to regulators and asked
federal agencies to release his correspondence with them.
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Ludecke, a spokeswoman for Bradley, said the campaign
would not grant blanket access to correspondence involving
corporations before federal regulators because the papers might
include private information about individuals.

VITESSE REVENUES INCREASE

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Chip maker Vitesse Semiconductor Corp. reported
earnings in line with analyst expectations Monday, allaying fears
of a revenue slide because of troubles at major customer Lucent
Technologies Inc.
</P>
<P>
   After the market closed Monday, Vitesse reported earnings of
$23.6million, or 14cents per share, for the first quarter ending
Dec. 31. This compares with earnings of $14.6million, or 9cents, in
the 1999 first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues were $89.2million, an increase of 47percent from
$60.7million in the like period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   During the trading day, investors appeared confident Vitesse
would release a favorable earnings report. The company's stock was
up 3.5625 to close at 49.5625, an increase of 7.74percent.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive Officer Lou Tomasetta said each of Vitesse's
communication product lines sold well in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   An analyst said that the results were expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty pleased with the report. They basically hit my
numbers almost to the penny,'' said Greg McClenon, an analyst with
Preferred Capital Markets in San Francisco. ``I wasn't expecting
them to really beat the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Problems at Lucent had less of an impact than expected. A change
in the way Lucent orders Vitesse's products and earnings troubles
at the Internet communications equipment maker prompted the
concern.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Vitesse's chips go into Lucent's finished products,
McClenon said.
</P>
<P>
   McClenon said he intends to reiterate his ``buy'' rating for
Vitesse stock, although he suspects some other investors will shy
away because the company failed to beat analyst estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised to see some pressure on the stock in
the short term,'' he said. ``There were people that were expecting
a blowout.''
</P>
<P>
   In after-hours trading, Vitesse stock was down slightly, he
said. But he remains confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important for a company that gets up to this size to
be able to crank out 11percent sequential growth, and they're still
pulling it off,'' McClenon said. ``Every quarter their gross
margins are expanding.''

IT'S McCAIN'S TURN TO UNVEIL TAX PLAN 
 
By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican presidential candidate John McCain will
unveil a five-year, $240 billion tax-cutting package Tuesday aimed
squarely at the middle class, a plan he insists would cost less
than half as much as the proposal put forth by rival George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   And while McCain's proposal may be less generous in tax cuts to
the wealthy than the proposal outlined by Bush, tax analysts say,
it is also more stingy toward the poor.
</P>
<P>
   With the New Hampshire primary just three weeks off, McCain is
hoping to woo Republican and independent voters with a tax plan
targeted at workers earning between $40,000 and $70,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview aired Sunday, McCain, a senator from
Arizona, said he favored tax cuts targeted toward ``lower and
middle-income Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 60 percent of U.S. families earn less than McCain's
targeted group, tax analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Because poorer Americans pay little or no federal income taxes,
McCain's plan really ``is targeted toward lower- and middle-income
income taxpayers,'' said Clint Stretch, director of tax policy at
the accounting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the McCain proposal ``leaves
too much money in Washington for the politicians to spend on bigger
government. It's the difference between the Washington mind-set and
the Texas approach.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's plan would broaden the lowest, 15 percent tax bracket,
the rate now assessed on the first $25,750 of income for single
filers and $43,050 for married couples. Under his proposal, a
single taxpayer would have to earn $35,000 and joint filers $70,000
before bumping up into the next tax bracket.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers in that same category, under McCain's plan, also would
be eligible to set up new, IRA-style accounts known as ``Family
Security Accounts.'' Families would be able to defer taxes on their
savings, while having the flexibility to withdraw their funds after
a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor, meanwhile, who outlined his five-year, $483
billion tax package last month, has proposed compressing the five
existing tax brackets to four and lowering the initial tax rate to
10 percent on the first $6,000 of a single's income and $12,000 for
couples.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Foster, executive director of the Washington-based Tax
Foundation and an economist who helped draft the Bush tax proposal,
said the plan was designed to help those workers on the threshold
of poverty avoid losing tax credits and bumping into a higher tax
bracket.
</P>
<P>
   McCain would help alleviate the so-called ``marriage penalty,''
the provision in the tax code which forces some dual-income couples
to pay more in federal income taxes than they would if they were
single, by increasing the standard deduction for joint filers from
$7,200 to $8,600 a year.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal not only would alleviate the marriage penalty but
would also help single-income families that currently enjoy the
``marriage bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush would resurrect a cheaper fix used during the Reagan
administration, which exempts up to $3,000 of a second
wage-earner's salary.
</P>
<P>
   Smarting from Bush criticisms that his tax proposals didn't go
far enough to help the working poor, McCain _ whose tax plan was
still in flux as late as this weekend _ borrowed a page from the
Bush plan.
</P>
<P>
   McCain now supports a proposal to double the $500-per-child tax
credit to $1,000. But unlike Bush, McCain would not raise the
income ceiling to allow more families to take this credit.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also would eliminate income taxes for military personnel
serving overseas, and exempt the first $200 in dividend income _
$400 for married couples _ from income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, McCain's tax proposal's would offer an average $92
worth of tax relief to families earning less than $39,300, noted
Bob McIntyre with the left-leaning Citizens for Tax Justice.
</P>
<P>
   In all, less than 7 percent of the tax benefits would accrue to
the bottom 60 percent of the income ladder, McIntyre said. More
than half the tax relief would go to those whose incomes are among
the top 10 percent in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush plan offers an average $249 per year for families in
the lower 60 percent, giving them about 11 percent of the tax
relief, McIntyre said. But those taxpayers earning more than
$300,000 a year would enjoy more than a third of the tax relief
under the Bush plan, with the typical family in this category
saving more than $50,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there are people dancing in the streets over either
of (these plans) but they're not most people,'' McIntyre said.
</P>
<P>
   Stretch, of Deloitte &AMP; Touche, noted that it is difficult to
provide tax relief to poorer Americans when the plan is based on
the federal income tax system. ``If you want to cut taxes on the
poor, then you get rid of beer taxes, cigarette taxes and wage
taxes (such as Social Security). That's what poor people pay.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush plans to fund his tax proposal using the projected
budget surplus, McCain hopes to find about $150 million for his
plan by closing corporate tax loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those targeted loopholes, however, are immensely popular
on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, for instance, hopes to save money by eliminating the
federal subsidy for ethanol, a fuel additive made from corn.
</P>
<P>
   While critics say this subsidy largely benefits one company _
food processor Archer Daniels Midland Co. _ the ethanol program is
popular in farming states _ including Iowa, where McCain has
forgone campaigning _ and has the support of both Republican and
Democratic leaders in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's got a big megaphone,'' a McCain aide said.
``When the American people realize their money's being wasted on a
program that has no environmental benefit and is basically
enriching one corporation at the expense of the education of our
country, we think we can win that fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, McCain said he would use no more than 23 percent of the
project surplus to fund his tax-cutting plan. He would reserve 62
percent of the surplus to help shore up Social Security, 10 percent
for Medicare and another 5 percent for debt reduction.

   &UR; AOL-TIME WARNER MERGER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times plans three pages of stories, photos and
graphics on the merger of AOL and Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-TIME-WARNER (New York) _ Ledeall: America Online, the
company that made the Internet accessible to the general public,
has agreed to buy the largest traditional media company, Time
Warner, for $165 billion in what would be the biggest merger in
history and the best evidence yet that the new media and the mass
media may finally be converging. By Saul Hansell.
</P>
<P>
   With graphics and photos, NYT17, 18 and 19 from the press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-TIME-STRATEGY (Undated) _ Looking at the strategy behind
marrying a traditional media conglomerate with an online service
provider: The America Online-Time Warner merger represents the
triumph of the Internet as the irresistible force in business, not
just a fleeting enthusiasm on Wall Street and the obsession of the
nation's technology elite. The top executives of the two companies
presented the deal as a ``merger of equals'' on Monday. But it is
the shareholders of America Online Inc., that will own 55 percent
of the combined enterprise, though Time Warner will account for 80
percent of the revenues. Even the surviving stock symbol will be
AOL. By Steve Lohr.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-TIME-NEXT (Undated) _ What media-Internet deals may come in
the wake of the AOL Time Warner deal: The announcement Monday of
the combination between America Online and Time Warner creates a
company without peer in the media and entertainment industry, a
colossus that will force competitors from Disney to AT&AMP;T to
Microsoft to reconsider their strategies as the Internet and
traditional media converge. The deal leaves Disney, Fox, and the
remaining giants of old media with a stark choice. They can try to
carve a future alone on the Internet, a place that has so far been
inhospitable to old media companies. Or they can merge with new
media companies like Yahoo, putting their future in the hands of
businesses that hardly existed five years ago. By Alex Berenson.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-TIME-IMPACT (Undated) _ A look at how the deal affects Time
Warner's television, magazine, movie and music businesses. By Bill
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-TIME-DEAL (Undated) _ How the deal came to be. By Laura
Holson and Alex Kuczynski.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-TIME-CULTURE (Undated) _ Looking at the two corporate
cultures. And what happens to journalism? By Felicity Barringer.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-TIME-CASE (Undated) _ A profile of Steve Case of AOL:
Perhaps the only thing stranger than Steve Case, the chairman of an
Internet company perpetually thought to be doomed, assuming the
helm of the world's largest media conglomerate was that he wore a
suit to the press conference on Monday where he announced the
audacious merger plan. Case, 37, is known for clinging to his
casual costume of denim shirts and khakis even on the most formal
occasions, but if that changes when the merger of America Online
and Time Warner is completed, it may come as no surprise. Since
before the World Wide Web was invented, Case has survived the
quicksand of the Internet industry with a series of chameleon like
changes of which his deal with Time Warner is only the most recent.
By Amy Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-TIME-LEVIN (Undated) _ A profile of Gerald Levin of Time
Warner: In the pantheon of prominent media executives, Gerald M.
Levin has long had a reputation as a shrewd gambler with a
scholarly mien: bookish, cerebral, self-effacing and yet tough.
True to form, on Monday the new chief executive of the hybrid of
Time Warner and America Online showed up without a tie for a New
York news conference to announce the planned merger, issuing a
formal greeting to what he called ``the suits from Virginia'' _ the
more formally-dressed executives from America Online's headquarters
in Dulles, Va. By Doreen Carvajal.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-TIME-AD-COLUMN (Undated) _ The view of the deal from Madison
Avenue: The $165 billion acquisition of Time Warner by America
Online could well be a transformative transaction, say senior
managers at leading agencies, remaking the advertising, marketing
and media landscapes as few deals have done. By Stuart Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-TIME-EUROPE (Frankfurt, Germany) _ Looking at how the deal
affects AOL's ambitions in Europe: The Internet may well be
borderless, but it remains remarkably American. Here in Europe,
America Online Inc.'s prospective merger with Time Warner Inc. is
likely to accentuate that phenomenon and to increase the pressure
among rivals for new alliances and mergers. America Online and
Bertelsmann AG of Germany are equal partners in AOL Europe, which
operates local-language networks across the continent. But the most
striking feature about the Internet in Europe is its fragmentation
along national boundaries. Traditional telephone companies are
often the biggest Internet providers in each individual country,
but few have extended their reach across Europe. By Edmund L.
Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-TIME-WINNERS (Undated) _ Ted Turner is knocking on the door
of the $10 billion club. Turner, the cable-TV pioneer who is vice
chairman of Time Warner, has more to gain than anybody from a sale
of the company to America Online. He is the biggest individual
shareholder of Time Warner, owning about 97 million shares, or
about 6.5 percent of the company. While the long-term effect of the
deal on AOL shareholders is uncertain so far, it will be a sure
winner for Time Warner investors, many of whom are employees of the
company's magazines and cable channels. By Patrick McGeehan.
</P>
<P>
   AOL-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ When Time Inc. acquired Warner
Communications 10 years ago, it took 7 years for shareholders in
the combined company to see any meaningful gains in their stock.
Will shareholders in AOL Time Warner, who choose to hold onto their
shares in this latest combination, show better returns than that?
This being the Internet age, most analysts believe that not only
will the benefits to shareholders in the combined company be
immediate, the deal will also justify higher valuations in the
already manic Internet arena. By Gretchen Morgenson.

   Plus a stand-alone graphic on the history of Time, from Henry
Luce to Steve Case.

MICROSOFT AND CALDERA SETTLE SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SARA ROBINSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Caldera Inc. and Microsoft Corp. announced
Monday that they had settled a suit that had accused Microsoft of
anticompetitive practices.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the settlement, Microsoft will pay Caldera an
undisclosed sum.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said it would record a one-time charge of about 3
cents a share against earnings in the quarter ended March 31. That
would total at least $154 million based on the number of
outstanding shares, and the actual figure is likely to be
considerably higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a rather nice settlement,'' said G. Gervaise Davis III,
a founding partner of Davis &AMP; Schroeder, an intellectual-property
law firm in Monterey, Calif. ``The fact that they settled it for
that kind of money indicates that Microsoft felt it had a serious
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The case was scheduled to go to trial on Feb. 1. Caldera, based
in Orem, Utah, contended that Microsoft intentionally made Windows
incompatible with DR DOS, a competitor to MS-DOS, the underlying
system for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased with the settlement or we wouldn't have done
it,'' said Bryan Sparks, the chief executive of Caldera.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Cullinan, a spokesman for Microsoft, said the company was
satisfied with the settlement. ``We are focused on what we see as a
dynamic and highly competitive marketplace,'' he said. ``We are
pleased to put this issue in our rearview mirror and focus on the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Caldera was started in 1994, backed by Ray Noorda, the former
chief executive of Novell. DR DOS, which stands for Digital
Research Disc Operating System, was originally developed by Digital
Research Inc., which later merged with Novell. Caldera bought DR
DOS together with the legal rights from Novell in 1996. A year and
a half ago, Caldera spun off two companies: Caldera Systems Inc.,
which develops Linux software for servers, and Lineo Inc., which
develops Linux software for Internet appliances and other devices.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the lawsuit against Microsoft has been settled, Sparks
said, Caldera Inc., now just a holding company, will probably cease
to exist.

FRANCE CLEANS UP AFTER UNCOMMON STORMS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ France is not a country normally associated with
lumberjacks, but French woodcutters are hard at work these days.
Millions of trees were felled by back-to-back hurricanes that
struck France on Dec. 26 and 28, and the cleanup is still going
on. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some places affected by the storms are closed, and many are
damaged, but that shouldn't spoil many visits. All the major
boulevards and bridges are clear; museums that were not shut down
for other reasons, like remodeling, are open _ as is the Eiffel
Tower, which now sparkles brilliantly at night because the flashers
added for the year 2000 celebration are still in place. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants, art galleries, big department stores and small
boutiques are operating as usual. The great churches, including
Notre-Dame, Chartres and Mont-St.-Michel, as well as the chateaus
of the Loire are open _ although some rooms and towers are closed
because of broken windows, damaged roofs or the risk of falling
stones. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some large parks and cemeteries are still closed, as are dozens
of small public squares, but they are opening as quickly as they
can be cleaned up. Progress depends on the weather and the
availability of clearing crews. In some areas the army is helping
out because parks departments and private tree-cutting crews are
overwhelmed. Roofing companies are also swamped by demand; many old
copper and zinc roofs were torn off by the storms, and there is
water damage inside many buildings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The biggest effect on tourism was probably that the bateaux
mouches _ the long boats plying the Seine that are Paris'
equivalent of the Circle Line _ were inoperative until Jan. 7,
because the river was too high for them to pass under all the
bridges. This wasn't strictly related to the Christmas storms; it
happens whenever the Seine gets swollen from heavy rainfall. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Pere Lachaise Cemetery in eastern Paris is closed. Not
everyone who goes there wants to pause at the grave of Jim
Morrison, the lead singer of the Doors who died in 1971 of a drug
overdose.
</P>
<P>
   Inside are also the graves of Honore de Balzac, Oscar Wilde,
Edith Piaf, Frederic Chopin, Eugene Delacroix, Sarah Bernhardt,
Marcel Proust, Abelard and Heloise and the 147 victims who were
summarily executed against a wall in the cemetery's northeast
corner to end the revolt of the Paris Commune of 1871.
</P>
<P>
   The cemetery, according to a worker there, will be closed until
the condition of all the trees can be assessed. Earlier this month
the city's parks and gardens departments said a reopening was
tentatively set for this weekend. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Versailles, the 17th-century palace of Louis XIV, more than
10,000 trees in the park were downed, many of them more than 100
years old. The park is still closed, but the chateau is open, with
the exception of the Hall of Battles, which has some broken
windows.
</P>
<P>
   The hall, the largest in Versailles, was a late creation, put
together in 1836 from the prince's apartments and filled with 33
grand paintings depicting French victories from Tolbiac in 496 to
Wagram in 1809. The Trianon, another chateau in the woods at
Versailles, was scheduled to reopen Saturday. Officials hope to
replace the fallen trees, although there is so far no money for it
in the national budget. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some confusion surrounds the Ste.-Chapelle, one of the Gothic
marvels of Paris, a small chapel dating from 1248 on the Ile de la
Cite near Notre-Dame. One of its stained glass windows depicting
Genesis was slightly damaged, and some stones fell from its roof
pinnacles, but it is open again. The same cannot be said for a
different Ste.-Chapelle, the holy chapel of the chateau of
Vincennes in the Bois de Vincennes park on Paris' eastern edge,
which was catastrophically damaged. Five of its six 19th-century
windows were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the 16th-century window, which represents the apocalypse _
in one of the ironies of history _ was preserved,'' Pierre
Chatauret, the chateau's curator, told Le Figaro, the daily
newspaper. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some of Paris' prettiest small parks, like Parc Monceau and
Buttes-Chaumont, are still closed, along with Montsouris, Bagatelle
and Bercy. The most famous parks _ the Tuileries in front of the
Louvre, the Champs du Mars below the Eiffel Tower and the
Luxembourg Gardens on the Left Bank _ are open, though all have
lost dozens of trees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of the 326 small squares, more than 220 have reopened and the
rest should follow by the end of this month. &QL;

CLINTON TO SEEK BROADER HEALTH COVERAGE FOR CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Fla., Ohio, Pa., Texas, Ill., Mich., N.J.)  (Exclusive) 
(lb)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Enrollment in a new health insurance program for
children doubled last year, to nearly 2 million, and President
Clinton will propose a $2.7 billion initiative to sign up more
children, White House officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Enrollment is still far short of the 5 million children Clinton
set as a goal when he signed the legislation creating the program
in August 1997. But the program got off to a slow start, and the
Census Bureau says the number of children without health insurance
has increased since Clinton signed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the last year for which official numbers are available,
11 million children under the age of 18 were uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the program has political implications for Vice
President Al Gore. In his campaign for the Democratic presidential
nomination, Gore has proposed expanding the program to guarantee
access to affordable health insurance for all children by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Finance Committee,
said the report of nearly 2 million children in the new program was
``wonderful news.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Salo, a health policy expert at the National Governors'
Association, said: ``This shows that the governors have been right
all along. You can't create a program from scratch and carry it out
in six months. It took a couple of years. We always knew that if
you gave us the money and a little flexibility, we could cover the
kids and provide them with better health care.''
</P>
<P>
   The program provides health insurance to children whose families
earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford
private health insurance. In searching for children eligible for
the new program, state officials said, they have found many
uninsured children who qualify for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Congress may be cool to President Clinton's proposal for new
spending to locate and enroll uninsured children. Republicans say
many states have not made full use of the money Congress provided
in 1997, when it appropriated nearly $40 billion for the program in
the years 1998 to 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers provided $4.2 billion a year for 1998 and 1999, but
states spent $121 million in the first year and slightly less than
$1 billion in the second year, so they have substantial sums on
hand. Many states have not used up their 1998 allotments, federal
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   New York state accounted for more than one-fourth of all
enrollment in the new program, with 521,300 children signed up by
the end of September. California, with 222,350 children enrolled,
had the next-largest number, followed by Florida with 154,600, Ohio
with 83,690 and Pennsylvania with 81,760.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the report shows that enrollment was relatively
modest in some large states. Texas had 50,880 children enrolled as
of Sept. 30, while Illinois had 42,700 and Michigan had 26,700, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Equally significant, the White House said, many states are
liberalizing eligibility criteria so more children can qualify for
health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, before creation of the program, four states _
Minnesota, Vermont, Washington and Tennessee _ offered health
insurance to all children in families with incomes up to twice the
poverty level. Now, 30 states offer coverage up to that level.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   New Jersey has one of the nation's most generous programs,
offering coverage to children in families with incomes up to 3.5
times the official poverty level, the report said. (For a family of
four, the poverty level is now $16,700.) New Jersey enrolled 75,650
children through Sept. 30. Connecticut reported enrolling more than
9,900 children.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's new initiative includes these legislative proposals:
</P>
<P>
   _ States could examine family income data used in the school
lunch program to find children who might qualify for subsidized
health insurance. In a recent study, the Urban Institute said that
75 percent of all low-income uninsured children lived in families
that participated in the school lunch program.
</P>
<P>
   _ States could immediately provide health insurance to
potentially eligible children at schools, child care centers and
homeless shelters. Low-income children would be presumed eligible.
</P>
<P>
   _ States would have to simplify Medicaid application forms. Many
states have already simplified requirements for the new children's
program, by allowing people to apply by mail or by skipping the
evaluation of family assets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Medicaid and the new program would be routinely opened to 19-
and 20-year-olds. Many states now limit coverage in that age
bracket.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us Inc., struggling to rouse its sleepy business, has
hired the top executive at FAO Schwarz to become its new president
and chief executive, the company plans to announce Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of John Eyler, FAO's chairman and chief
executive, comes at a critical time for Toys ``R'' Us. The company,
which has been operating without a permanent chief executive since
August, had a dismal Christmas despite Pokemon madness. It expects
to miss earnings forecasts for the full year at a time when the
strong economy has propelled sales at other big chains.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the company is looking to Eyler, 52, to lure children and
their parents back to its warehouse-like stores. A longtime retail
executive with strong merchandising skills and experience running a
respected rival chain, he seems to be the perfect fit.
</P>
<P>
   But FAO and Toys ``R'' Us are about as different as diamonds and
cubic zirconia. Unabashedly upscale, FAO is known for its exclusive
items and premium-priced playthings. Toys ``R'' Us is more
associated with coupon clipping and endless aisles of board games
and Barbies. The companies also differ by sheer size. The much
larger Toys ``R'' Us has revenue of $11.2 billion and operates
about 1,160 toy stores compared with FAO's revenue of about $200
million and 42 outlets.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed in his new position, Eyler will need to borrow FAO's
entrepreneurial culture and knack for running stores that push fun
as much as Furby. He must do so within a cost structure that
enables the chain to compete with Wal-Mart and its rock-bottom
pricing. Tweaking its operating strategy is a task that has worn
out many a Toys ``R'' Us executive.
</P>
<P>
   Eyler replaces Robert C. Nakasone, who was in the job just a
year and a half when he resigned abruptly in August under pressure
from the board. His departure came just months after the company's
president and chief operating officer stepped down just one year
into that job and its president for merchandising and marketing
left with no explanation. Also last year, the executive who had
been tapped to run Toys ``R'' Us' fledgling Internet unit, abruptly
backed out of that job.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Goldstein, Toys ``R'' Us' chairman, who has been
operating as interim chief executive, said Monday that he was
confident that the company finally had the right leader in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was very attractive about John is he has been a CEO at
several companies, so he has been a CEO in a variety of different
environments and so that was important,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Paramus, N.J., also wanted an executive
with a strong grasp of electronic commerce to help improve its
inconsistent Web site operation. The company's stumble with
e-commerce was vividly illustrated when the company announced three
days before Christmas that it could not handle the volume of orders
and would be unable to deliver all the holiday gifts on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many people we interviewed this was really a
shortcoming,'' Goldstein said. At FAO, though, Eyler, had
successfully run a catalog business and had four years of
e-commerce experience.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us first approached Eyler in 1992, but he was
uninterested because the company already had a well-oiled
management machine in co-founder Charles Lazarus, Goldstein and
Nakasone.
</P>
<P>
   Eyler ``was also our leading candidate two years ago to become
president and he turned us down,'' Goldstein said. ``It took the
offer of being CEO to get John to come here.''
</P>
<P>
   Eyler will join Toys ``R'' Us' board and executive committee. He
will replace Goldstein, 58, as chairman in a year.
</P>
<P>
   At FAO, which Eyler joined in 1992 as chief executive, he is
credited with updating the the chain's tired stores and shedding
unprofitable ones, creating a playland atmosphere with store
displays and superior customer service and increasing the amount of
exclusive items the chain sells to 70 percent from 30 percent. Not
that there were not bumps on his watch.
</P>
<P>
   FAO, a division of Vendex NV of Amsterdam, Netherlands, has seen
its profits dwindle in recent years and has had several quarters of
operating losses. The declines were attributed to a lack of popular
products in some years and some licensing deals that did not result
in the hit toys the company had expected. Eyler said, though, that
in 1999 the company's results had generally improved while its
revenue had increased briskly.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining FAO, Eyler for three years was chief executive of
Hartmarx's specialty men's clothing stores in Chicago. Before that,
he for six years was chairman and chief executive of Mainstreet, a
family apparel division of Federated Department Stores. He had also
been with May Department stores for 12 years in various management
capacities from 1979 until 1983.
</P>
<P>
   At Toys ``R'' Us, Eyler said his first priorities would be to
bring a sense of focus to the chain. ``To me, looking at a company
like Toys, the first order of business is to agree on strategy and
tightly focus on a very finite number of priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Eyler intends to further refine Toys ``R'' Us' new
store format, called C-3, which it is currently rolling out,
distinguish the stores' merchandise mix to set the chain apart from
the deep discounters and improve customer service. He also will try
to beef up the company's internet business, which operates
toysrus.com.
</P>
<P>
   It will take all of the tricks in his toy chest to ease Toys
``R'' Us' growing pains. The company had a surprisingly weak
holiday, reporting flat sales of $4.4 billion for the period and a
2 percent decline in sales at U.S. stores open at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the company said earlier this month that,
excluding a larger-than-anticipated 20 cents to 25 cents loss
associated with its internet business, it expects to earn $1.10 a
share for the fiscal year ended Jan. 29, instead of the almost
$1.40 a share analysts had forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us blames problems with its Web site, shortages of
popular products like Game Boys and the Amazing Amy doll and tough
competition.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the chain has been clobbered by Wal-Mart, which
overtook its position as the top toy seller in 1998 by snatching
customers with the lure of one-stop shopping and cheap prices. Toys
``R'' Us had also been hurt by a much smaller foe, the internet toy
seller Etoys, which realized early the value of getting in on the
dot.com game as consumers grew more comfortable with shopping
online.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, fed up with its missteps, have dumped Toys ``R'' Us
stock. Shares closed Monday at $12.625, down roughly half from its
52-week high of $25.75 in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they blew it again during the holiday season
with essentially much of the old management team, notably with the
former ceo at the helm is not new news,'' said Ursula Moran, an
analyst with Sanford Bernstein. ``It is confirmation that the
company has got some big problems they have obviously not fixed.

Undated: not fixed.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even so, some analysts said, Toys ``R'' Us has made some
progress in improving its business. ``They have the new C-3 format,
and those stores did outperform the traditional stores during the
holiday,'' said Sally Wallick, an analyst with Legg Mason Wood
Walker. ``They did make progress on that front.
</P>
<P>
   Also, they had a very strong third quarter going into the fourth
quarter. They had good momentum, and that obviously did not carry
through to holiday. That was disappointing, but it was encouraging
to see them be able to drive their sales and business earlier in
the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the publicity about its e-commerce problems over the
holiday season, Toys ``R'' Us still shipped $39 million in goods
sold over the internet during the holiday and became one of the top
five e-commerce sites for the five weeks ended Dec. 26, 1999
according to Media Metrix.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as it seeks to transform itself into a leading ``brick and
click'' retailer, Eyler said progress will not happen overnight but
will be noticeable in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many strengths, and this is not a business in
distress,'' Eyler said. ``It is a business with very sound
economics and a very powerful brand, and what we need to do is
focus on the priorities that will help the performance of the
business to become more positive.''
</P>
<P>
   If not, Eyler may find himself the latest Toys ``R'' Us
executive without a seat in the company's long-running game of
corporate musical chairs.

NO DECISION ON 2 BIDS FOR JETS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The executors of the Leon Hess estate met Monday but
did not choose between Charles F. Dolan and Robert Wood Johnson IV
to be the Jets' new owner, two persons involved in the sale said.
</P>
<P>
   The five executors were briefed by Goldman Sachs, the estate's
investment banker, about Dolan's and Johnson's nearly identical
offers _ $615 million to $625 million _ but decided to defer their
selection until the meeting of the National Football League's
eight-member finance committee at 10 a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of a decision, the estate put in place the
mechanics to make a decision Tuesday that would, presumably, be
followed by the committee's deliberation and vote. John Hess,
chairman of Amerada Hess and an executor of his father's estate,
will attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that Hess knows whom he will choose but has
decided not to let it be known until Tuesday. He could also listen
to the committee's debate to see which bidder looks better able to
gain approval. Dolan, the chairman of Cablevision, controls
television and sports assets, like Madison Square Garden, whose
influence concerns some owners. Johnson's business interests offer
no such concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In a more improbable situation, Hess could recommend both bids
and let the committee choose.

SPORTS COLUMN: HOW COULD PARCELLS NOT HAVE KNOWN? 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ About a week has passed since the Jets were sacked by
the Bills _ Parcells and Belichick. Many questions remain, but if I
were about to spend more than $600 million to inherit this mess,
here is the first question that I would want answered:
</P>
<P>
   How could Bill Parcells not have known?
</P>
<P>
   How could he not know that the man he had handpicked to succeed
him was 10 feet deep in career crisis?
</P>
<P>
   I love the conspiracy theory _ that the two Bills contrived this
scheme for their mutual benefit _ but I can't buy it. One look at
Belichick last Tuesday, sweating to the point where it looked as if
he might melt, told us the former defensive coordinator was being
rushed out of the pocket by his own raging emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Again: in Parcells' dual capacity as head coach and director of
all Jets' human activity, wasn't it his job to know? Shouldn't he
have sat down with Belichick and made sure they were on the same
page before Parcells decided to turn it?
</P>
<P>
   You get the impression that Parcells orchestrated this entire
plan of succession and only bothered to consult The Guy in the
Glass, aka himself. It may have been poetic justice that the whole
thing backfired, embarrassing the Jets and putting Parcells in the
position of having to scramble now to keep his staff from blowing
apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a very strong obligation to the organization and will
not abandon it,'' Parcells said in a telephone news conference last
week. ``This is on my watch.''
</P>
<P>
   You bet it is, and only the belief in Parcells as a great coach,
a savior in headphones, has spared him the abuse he would have
taken for such clumsy work if he were, say, Steve Phillips or Dave
Checketts.
</P>
<P>
   Complete control. No one to answer to. Parcells made all this
his precondition and modus operandi when he bolted New England with
a year left on his contract to come resurrect Leon Hess' Jets. Yet
when Belichick took the handoff from Parcells last week and
promptly punted himself out of the picture, there was poor Steve
Gutman, a functionary held over from the Hess days, having to wipe
the egg off the organization's face.
</P>
<P>
   Where was Parcells? How could he not have known?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the answer is not difficult to figure out. Parcells is
a coach, and football coaches by nature are generals, not company
psychologists. But that is part of being a smart chief
administrator. The job requirements include knowing the people who
work for you, communicating with them, not just ordering them
around like a bunch of toy soldiers on the basement carpet.
</P>
<P>
   A coach's need for control, for more power, grows out of success
and the distortions of self that often accompany it. Although
conventional team efforts _ working with a general manager with the
Giants and New England _ took Parcells to three Super Bowls and two
championships, he looked into the mirror three years ago and told
himself he could do anything, or at least the stressful, demanding
jobs of two men.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, while announcing his resignation, he unwittingly
admitted why he couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is so much more transient now,'' he said. ``Years
ago, you had your guys. You developed them. You took 'em right
through. Now it's more accelerated. You try to build the same thing
on a yearly basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the ``all-consuming'' chores of coaching, Parcells
estimated that 20 percent of the roster turns over every season.
There is a college draft to direct, a salary cap to decipher. There
are so many potential eventualities, like the quarterback going
down 20 minutes into the season.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know if the Jets would have been better prepared for
Vinny Testaverde's injury had there been a general manager to
intercede. We know Parcells wasn't. We know that when coaches in
football and basketball have parlayed titles at one franchise into
control of another, the success ratio, based on the championship
expectations they bring on themselves, is not very good.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells or Pat Riley. Jimmy Johnson or Rick Pitino. They have
all built up tremendous amounts of public collateral. On the
coaching lines, they get the benefit of the doubt, and rightly so.
In the front office, they should be held accountable, just as is
anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   If I'm the new owner of the Jets, I want to know how this
happened. Then I want to know if Parcells will take a few extra
million to be the coach, and only the coach, for one more year. And
then I immediately start to look for someone else to run my
organization, for someone who sees much more than what's in the
glass.

WAL-MART TO OPEN 12 NEW SUPERMARKETS IN EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Wal-Mart Stores Inc. took another step in its European
expansion Monday by announcing plans to open 12 stores in the Asda
chain of British supermarkets, which it bought six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in recent weeks that Wal-Mart had rattled
the European retailing industry.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, shook its
rivals in Germany, Metro AG and Karstadt AG, with discounts of as
much as 20 percent on hundreds of items.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart has been seeking to bring its U.S.-style discounts and
service culture to Europe, where retailers have enjoyed
significantly higher profit margins, in part because of the lack of
brash competitors willing to start price wars.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, since Wal-Mart acquired Asda for 6.7 billion pounds or
about $10.5 billion in June, an all-out pricing war has ensued
among supermarkets in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Asda has pledged to cut its prices by 5 percent to 10 percent,
trying to bring the cost of most goods in line with prices in the
United States. Asda said it planned to lower prices on more than
10,000 items by next year.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart also hoped to use its buying power and influence to
obtain lower prices from suppliers that it could pass along to
consumers and use to undercut the competition.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its expansion in Britain, Asda was expected to add
more than 6,000 employees to its staff of 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Asda's announcement was not a surprise and did
little to explain its plans.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said the timing of the announcement was curious
but suggested it was politically motivated because of an
investigation by Britain's Competition Committee into price fixing
by the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way for Asda to get the politicians to go away by
offering all of these jobs,'' said David McCarthy, an analyst at
Salomon Smith Barney in London.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy also said the timing was meant to ``rain on everyone
else's parade'' because most of Asda's rivals were expected to
announce their sales results within the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   As Asda takes on Tesco, Britain's largest supermarket chain, by
trying to compete on price, analysts said it still faced an uphill
battle because it needed scale to succeed. While Asda planned to
open several superstores that mimicked the size of large
supermarkets usually found in the suburbs, it also intended to open
smaller stores within the city, where real estate prices were
considerably higher.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts questioned whether opening the smaller stores
would allow the retailer to create the savings and efficiencies it
needed to offer discounted products.
</P>
<P>
   Asda is currently the third-largest supermarket chain in
Britain, with 16 percent of the market.

GEORGE A. ATHANSON, 72, HARTFORD'S FORMER FLAMBOYANT MAYOR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Ill., Conn., Greece)   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   George A. Athanson, the flamboyant mayor of Hartford, Conn., who
modeled himself after Fiorello La Guardia and served longer than
any Hartford mayor since 1812, died of a heart attack at his
Hartford home Sunday night, his wife said. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Athanson, a Democrat who was mayor for five terms from 1971 to
1981, was known for his mischievous, nonconformist nature and lust
for publicity, usually to help improve Hartford's image and
interests as well as his own. He dressed as the Red Baron to ride a
biplane, rode a horse dressed as a knight in shining armor, and
donned boxing gloves and fought a round for charity. He once rowed
across the Connecticut River wearing a tricorn hat and clutching a
state flag to protest a General Assembly decision to give a bigger
share of the river to the suburb of East Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   He was a mayor of fierce opinions. For example, he kept the
shades drawn in his office to protest the Alexander Calder metal
stegosaurus in the plaza outside, on the ground that he, being of
Greek descent, preferred classical sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   His power was circumscribed by Hartford's form of government, in
which the city manager and city council had at least equal powers.
</P>
<P>
   He often sought a larger stage. For example, when President
Nixon announced that he was going to China, he offered to accompany
him. He said that as a professor of international relations at the
University of Hartford, he could be quite useful. The White House
did not reply.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1981 interview with The Hartford Courant, he said his
spirited approach was calculated to help people identify with his
government. ``I try to humanize the mayor's office,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later mayors explicitly disavowed his extravagant style.
Athanson's successor, Thirman L. Milner, rejected ``media shows''
in the weeks after his election. The current mayor, Michael Peters,
said in 1993, ``I like a good laugh, but I take the issues of this
city very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Athanson was born in Hartford and raised in the city's South
End. He spent his early childhood in Greece as his father studied
to be a Greek Orthodox priest. As a high school student, he was
voted ``most likely to succeed.'' He graduated from Amherst College
and the University of Chicago Law, serving in the Marines between
college and law school. He later received a master's degree in
international relations from the University of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving office, he lost a race for Hartford probate judge
in 1984. He practiced law, winning a highly publicized case that
gave the parents of a 7-year-old Chinese girl the right to seek
traditional Chinese treatment for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. He
was twice disciplined by the state bar association for overcharging
clients.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife Zoe and son Arthur, both of Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   He kept up his colorful public commentary long after leaving
office, with his own program on Hartford Public Access Television,
``By George, It's Athanson.'' A typical comment: ``Clinton is an
ignoramus, the Democratic Party is ignorant and the Republicans _
they're, forget it, lost in the woods somewhere.''

 Reno Proposes Ways to Curb Crime on the Net  &HT;     By Todd Wallack 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Senior law enforcement officials meeting yesterday in Palo Alto
cheered U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno's call to step up their
efforts to thwart cybercrime.
<P>
   In a keynote speech at the conference, organized by the National
Association of Attorneys General, Reno said federal, state and
local cops must pool their efforts to fight ``the dark side of the
Internet,'' including hackers and virus writers. Net criminals have
no trouble crossing local, state or national boundaries. Their
victims, and the evidence they leave behind, transcend borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``When committed via the Internet, (someone) can transform a
local scam into a crime that circles the globe,'' Reno told about
200 top cops, including nearly two dozen state attorneys general.
``The cyber-criminal should get the clear message that there is no
safe place to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   As a prime example, she pointed to the theft of about 300,000
credit card numbers from CD Universe, a Connecticut online music
company. The thief, believed to be in Russia or Eastern Europe,
allegedly threatened to release the account information over the
Internet if he or she was not paid $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   When the ransom was not paid, about 25,000 of the numbers were
posted on an Internet site that was shut down over the weekend. CD
Universe confirmed the theft yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   To fight such crimes, Reno proposed:
</P>
<P>
   _Creating a round-the-clock national network of experts from
every state, called LawNet, to monitor cybercrime and swap tips.
The United States and seven other major nations already operate an
international network on Internet crime.
</P>
<P>
   _Starting several regional high-tech forensics labs to analyze
seized computers for evidence. Reno cited a regional task force in
Southern California as a model.
</P>
<P>
   _Sign an interstate agreement to honor out-of-state subpoenas
and court orders to help track down cyber-criminals. California has
already passed a law to do just that, Reno said, but she wants
other states to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Several state law enforcement officials have already agreed to
meet in Washington in March to work out the details of Reno's plan.
``We're ready to take up the challenge,'' Washington Attorney
General Christine Gregoire told Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Reno did not say how much money the federal government would put
behind the effort, although on Friday, President Clinton promised
to boost spending on cyber-security by 17 percent to $2 billion.
Much of the money would be used to train cybersleuths to track down
electronic intruders.
</P>
<P>
   California Attorney General Bill Lockyer backed Reno's plan.
Although he couldn't think of a cybercrime case his office has been
involved in, Lockyer said he is trying to train staffers so they
can help local police departments tackle the growing number of
Net-related cases.
</P>
<P>
   In his annual state budget proposal, released yesterday, Gov.
Gray Davis proposed spending $793,000 to hire seven state employees
to help local task forces fight cybercrime. ``This is the first
time the state's role has been defined,'' Lockyer said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to fighting cyber-criminals, the law enforcement
officials meeting at Stanford University yesterday said they should
do more to protect consumers against legal invasions of privacy
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies are collecting detailed information about what
users do online, then selling the information to other marketers
without permission. In most cases, this is legal.
</P>
<P>
   But Gregoire, the Washington state attorney general, said she
will push for legislation in her state that would prohibit
companies from selling sensitive customer information, such as
credit card numbers, without the customer's permission.
</P>
<P>
   Companies would be able to sell less-sensitive information, such
as what CDs a customer buys, without permission, unless the
customer objects. Companies would have to remind customers at least
once a year that they can opt to have their information kept
confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer also said he was concerned about the issue but didn't
offer any specific remedies yesterday.

 Oh Brother _ AOL Deal Upstages Chase H&AMP;Q  &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Dan Case was upstaged by his younger brother Steve today, as the
opening of the Chase H&AMP;Q Life Sciences conference was overshadowed
by America Online's $184 billion offer to buy Time Warner.
<P>
   Dan Case heads Chase H&AMP;Q, which is hosting several thousand
biotechnology executives, venture capitalists and money managers at
a four-day conference in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   His younger brother, AOL Chairman Steve Case, masterminded the
Time Warner merger, which Dan Case jokingly referred to during a
luncheon address as ``that little deal in Virginia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have to remember to thank them for the timing on that,''
Case told reporters yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   It would have taken something as extraordinary as the largest
deal in financial history to overshadow the bullish mood that has
overtaken biotech investors as the Chase H&AMP;Q conference opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been coming here for 10 years and I've never seen it like
this,'' said Kurt von Emster, who manages the Franklin
Biotechnology Discovery Fund.
</P>
<P>
   During an overflow luncheon, von Emster said he had run into
fellow money managers who all told tell &LR; the same story: They have
so much cash pouring into their funds that it's getting hard to
find bargains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you hold your nose and buy Amgen at $70 when you were
getting it at $50 a few months ago?'' he said. ``The answer is,
yes, you have to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chase H&AMP;Q conference gives executives from 250 companies 30
minutes to make their pitch to a hall full of investors.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech industry observers date the current run to October, when
financial markets began to get excited about genomics, a branch of
biotech that seeks aims  &LR; to discover the genes that control both
disease and normal bodily functions.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, one of the leading companies in this field, PE
Corp.'s Celera Group, threw fat on the genomics fire by announcing
that it had mapped more than 90 percent of the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   Celera's shares shot up 28 percent on the news, gaining $53.19
to close at $240.13, and prompted a run in the shares of other
genomics firms like Hyseq Inc. of Sunnyvale _ which gained 26
percent, as its stock rose $7.25 to close at $35.75.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors think genomics companies may be vastly overvalued
given that it could take a decade before the gene maps lead to new
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the stock is way ahead of itself,'' hedge fund manager
Laurence Blumberg said in reference to Celera.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond genomics, the other trend at this year's conference was
e-health _ the use of the Internet to link doctors, hospitals,
pharmacies, HMOs and drug discovery firms with each other and, in
many cases, directly to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   During a morning briefing, Chase H&AMP;Q analyst James Streator said
53 of the companies making presentations at the conference had some
e-health connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's making a whole new market space,'' said Jennifer Van
Brunt, editor of Signals Magazine, an online biotech publication in
San Francisco.

 Concentric Selling to Nextlink  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Nextlink Communications Inc. of McLean, Va., said yesterday that it
would buy San Jose's Concentric Network Corp. to add Internet
services to the telecommunications products it sells small and
medium-size businesses.
<P>
   Nextlink will acquire Concentric for about $2.9 billion in
stock, or $45 per Concentric share, pending regulatory approval.
The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will be able to offer Concentric's Web
hosting, e-commerce and high-speed digital subscriber line (DSL)
services along with Nextlink's local and long-distance telephone
access.
</P>
<P>
   The combination creates ``a very effective portfolio'' for small
businesses, said Peter DeCaprio, an analyst with Thomas Weisel
Partners. ``Those two services go hand in hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The move represents the further consolidation of the
telecommunications industry as providers attempt to ``bundle'' a
complete array of services onto one bill. Both Concentric and
Nextlink are among the leading players in their respective
industries serving small and medium-size businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Adding more data flow to its fiber-optic network will help
Nextlink become profitable, DeCaprio added. ``This is a volume
business,'' he said. ``The bigger the network gets, the more volume
you need. For Nextlink, (Concentric's Web business represents) more
network traffic that they can layer onto their existing backbone.''
</P>
<P>
   Concentric will continue to sell Internet services under its
existing name and remain based in San Jose. Concentric chief
executive Henry Nothhaft will keep his title and will also become
vice chairman of Nextlink, which remains headquartered in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Cross-selling of telephone and Internet services will begin this
year, Nextlink chief executive Dan Akerson said in a teleconference
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Concentric is the country's No.1 provider of business-grade DSL,
which allows up to eight computers in one office to hook up to
high-speed Internet access. The company has 20 percent of the
highly fragmented market, spokeswoman Jenna Dee said.
</P>
<P>
   Concentric is the second-largest provider of ``shared hosting,''
which allows small businesses to share a server. Colorado's Vario
is the leader in that area.
</P>
<P>
   Nextlink , which was founded by cellular telephone pioneer Craig
McCaw, ranks in the top third of Competitive Local Exchange
Carriers _ upstart telephone providers that compete against
regional Bell operating companies, DeCaprio said.
</P>
<P>
   While management of both companies yesterday hailed the
synergies of the combination, there is at least one potential
obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   Concentric has pushed back its goal of breaking even from a
cash-flow perspective more than once. ``Only time will tell if
Nextlink can solve some of Concentric's operating problems,''
DeCaprio said.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Nextlink trades for between $69.23 and $90.91, each
outstanding share of Concentric stock will be exchanged for the
equivalent of $45 of Nextlink stock. If Nextlink shares fall below
the lower limit, Concentric investors will receive 0.65 Nextlink
shares for each Concentric share; if higher than the ceiling,
stockholders will get 0.495 Nextlink share for each Concentric
share.
</P>
<P>
   Nextlink shares declined $1.44, to $77.06, while Concentric
shares jumped $9.63, to $39.63, yesterday.

 _ SF CHRON   How to Split Capital-Gains Tax on a Joint Account 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: I have a joint brokerage account with a friend. The primary name
on the account is my friend's. This year, we sold some stock at a
capital gain. How do we split the capital-gains tax?
<P>
   &QL; 
A: You split it in proportion to how much of the assets you and
your friend each contributed to the account, says Internal Revenue
Service spokesman Jesse Weller.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if 40 percent of the assets in the account
represent your contribution, then 40 percent of the capital gain
from the stock sale should be reported on Schedule D of your
federal tax form. Your friend would report 60 percent of the gain.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring your share of the account could require some research.
You have to review not only how much money each of you put into the
account, but also how much you may have withdrawn. You might have
to sort through old brokerage statements and peruse your
checking-account records.
</P>
<P>
   At tax time, your broker will send a statement to the Internal
Revenue Service, reporting the sale. Most likely it will report
this only in your friend's name, because his is the primary name on
the account, Weller says.
</P>
<P>
   When your friend fills out Schedule D, he should attach a
statement affirming that he is not responsible for the full tax
liability. He should state the percentage for which he is liable,
and identify the other responsible party _ yourself. He should
include not only your name, but your address and Social Security
number.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR; sh  &LR; Stein Roe Funds
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've noticed that the listings for the Stein Roe mutual funds
have disappeared from the newspaper. Did the company go out of
business, or was it taken over, or what?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Stein Roe funds are still in business and still listed in
the newspaper _ but you won't find them under ``S'' anymore. Since
the start of December they have been listed under ``L'' _ for
``Liberty _ Stein Roe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty Funds group, parent of the Stein Roe funds and
various others _ including Colonial, Crabbe Huson and Newport _
decided to consolidate them all under the Liberty name.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty explains that this is ``designed to make it easier for
shareholders and investment professionals to find their funds in
the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
First Investment
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am thinking about making my first investment in the market.
I read the personal-finance magazines and see advertisements for
mutual funds with 45 percent annual rates of return. I also get
several mailings a month from credit-card companies offering to let
me write checks against a line of credit at interest rates ranging
from 4.9 percent to 7.9 percent annually. Why can't I borrow this
low-interest money to invest in a mutual fund paying 45 percent? It
seems too good to be true.
</P>
<P>
   A: Assuming that the credit-card companies don't prohibit use of
the money for stock-market investing, you might be able to come out
ahead by borrowing from Peter to buy Paul's mutual-fund shares.
</P>
<P>
   But take a look at the fine print in the credit-card agreement.
I suspect that these are teaser rates. After a few months, the
credit-card companies might boost the interest to something in the
double digits.
</P>
<P>
   My main problem with your plan is that you seem to think that 45
percent annual returns are sustainable. There are mutual funds that
did that well or better last year, but there is no guarantee that
they will do that again this year _ or ever. The average annual
return from the stock market over many decades is about 11 percent,
including reinvestment of dividends. You can't count on doing much
better than that over the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   As a novice investor in my 20s, I enjoyed a 50 percent gain in
my stock-market assets one year. Extrapolating from that freakishly
strong performance, I calculated that I would amass enough money to
retire by age 35.
</P>
<P>
   If you can bear it, look closely at the photograph that
accompanies this column, and guess whether I have passed age 35.

 Internet funds enjoy explosive growth but some major groups
are  staying away   
 By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
About the only thing growing faster than the Internet these days is
the number of mutual funds that specialize in Internet stocks.
<P>
   As recently as three years ago, there were only four Internet
funds, with total assets of a few million dollars. Today, there are
close to 50 such funds, with combined assets exceeding $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for this proliferation is no mystery. In a red-hot
stock market, Internet stocks have been among the hottest.
</P>
<P>
   On average, they have almost doubled in price in just the past
five months. Inflamed by this performance, investors have been
throwing money by the barrelful into Internet funds, and new funds
have sprung up to meet the demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have one segment of the market that gets very
successful, you will see a proliferation of funds targeted toward
that,'' observes Kurt Brouwer of Brouwer &AMP; Janachowski in Tiburon.
``Wall Street is good at feeding a frenzy.''
</P>
<P>
   Like any mutual fund, Internet funds provide low-budget
shareholders the advantage of diversification.
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly important with Internet stocks, because
nobody can say with confidence which companies will emerge intact
from today's hurly-burly and successfully exploit the Internet's
huge potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to make sense of the Internet is as a lottery
game,'' remarks Edward Yardeni, chief economist with Deutsche Bank
Securities. ``It has a huge payoff, but you've got to buy lots of
tickets to increase your chances of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a diversified portfolio of Internet stocks carries a big
risk. These stocks have been bid up so far so fast that there is a
very real possibility that the whole sector might collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders got a scary taste of that during the precipitous
decline in the Nasdaq market in the middle of last week. Internet
stocks were among those hammered hardest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bubble's breaking certainly is a risk,'' says Russ Kinnel,
an equity analyst with Morningstar Inc. ``The most dangerous time
to buy a fund or a sector is after it's gone up sharply.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest and most famous mutual-fund sponsors have
refused to create Internet funds _ so far. For example, you won't
find them among the offerings of the two industry leaders, Fidelity
and Vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   These companies explain that Internet funds attract a lot of
short-term traders and that this would be too disruptive. Fund
managers need to calculate how much money they will have available
to invest the next day, or week, or month, and short-term
shareholders make that too difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any plans to offer an Internet-only fund,'' says
Vincent Loporchio, a Fidelity spokesman. ``This is a relatively
small universe of stocks, many of which have little or no earnings,
and it can be quite volatile.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard spokesman John Demming says his company doesn't want to
create funds that are ``volatile and tend to attract investors who
are not long term.''
</P>
<P>
   By default, most Internet funds are being started by smaller,
lesser-known fund groups for whom the addition of one highly
successful fund could make a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the Internet fund managers didn't previously have a
lot of fund-management experience,'' notes Kinnel.
</P>
<P>
   Kinetics Asset Management, which previously had only two funds,
recently announced that it is starting four more _ all Internet
funds. Its present offerings include one of the earliest Internet
funds _ named the Internet Fund, appropriately enough _ and the
Medical Fund, which specializes in biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   The new funds will focus on various sub-specialties:
large-capitalization companies with ``Internet potential'';
companies that provide hardware and software for the Internet;
venture-capital companies that finance Internet startups; and
foreign Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take a very positive view of the new economy,'' says Steven
R. Samson, president and chief executive of Kinetics. ``The
Internet is not going to go away. There will be winners, there will
be losers, and people look to organizations like ours because they
realize they can't do the analysis themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment is echoed by Alexander Cheung, manager of the
14-month-old Monument Internet Fund _ one of only three funds in
the Monument group. (The others focus on medical science and
telecommunications.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is still in the buildup stage,'' he observes.
``Throughout the world, there are only 200 million users out of 6
billion people, and half of the users are in the United States.
There will be tremendous growth in the next few years outside this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the major investment firms are shunning Internet funds.
Both Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch have recently dipped their
toes in the water.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs, in a joint venture with E-Trade Group of Palo
Alto, launched the Internet Tollkeeper Fund last October. Issued at
$10 per share, the shares were selling last week at around $18.
</P>
<P>
   The Tollkeeper Fund takes a relatively conservative approach to
Internet investing. It steers away from so-called e-commerce
companies _ those that sell (or hope to sell) consumer goods on the
Internet. These companies often have no earnings and their
prospects can be difficult or impossible to evaluate properly.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it buys stocks in companies that serve the Internet,
and therefore might profit from its overall growth _ for example,
those that provide access to the Web, content for Web sites and
equipment to operate and maintain the sites.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch has also created a diversified investment vehicle
for people interested in Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an open-end mutual fund, but rather a holding company
_ called Internet HOLDRs Trust _ that trades as a stock on the
American Stock Exchange under the symbol HHH.
</P>
<P>
   It is similar in form and concept to the Nasdaq-100 Trust, which
tracks the performance of the Nasdaq 100 index, or the S&AMP;P 500
Depositary Receipt, which tracks the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index.
</P>
<P>
   Internet HOLDRs holds a fixed portfolio of 20 Internet blue
chips _ if, in fact, there is such a thing. It includes such
familiar names as Amazon.com, America Online and Yahoo. Since it
went public in September, its price has soared from $100 to $177
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The list was chosen to reflect the general Internet
industry,'' says Stephen Bodurtha, senior director of Merrill's
Customized Investments Group.
</P>
<P>
   Internet HOLDRs offers some clear advantages over mutual funds.
Because it is passively managed, the management costs are
exceedingly low _ less than 0.02 percent of assets per year,
compared with an average of more than 1 percent for actively
managed mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   You also can day trade the stock _ moving in and out during a
single day at current market prices _ which is something you cannot
do with a mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, HOLDRs can be traded only in round lots _
multiples of 100 shares _ which makes it off limits to
less-pecunious investors. You can buy or sell 100 or 200 shares at
a time, for example, but not 1, 99 or 101.
</P>
<P>
   So, at current prices, you have to be able to put up at least
$16,000 to buy a minimum stake in the trust. For many people, that
would be too much money to concentrate in something as risky as the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   If that's your predicament, you can buy shares in Internet
mutual funds, which typically accept initial investments as small
as $1,000.

MILTON E. KRENTS, 88, PRODUCER OF `ETERNAL LIGHT' RELIGIOUS
SERIES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Fla.)   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Milton E. Krents, a broadcast executive who was best
known as producer, for the Jewish Theological Seminary of America,
of the religious drama and discussion series ``The Eternal Light''
on NBC radio and television, died on Saturday at New York Hospital
in Manhattan. He was 88 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Krents received a Lifetime Achievement award in 1989 from the
National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for his role in
producing ``The Eternal Light'' from its inception in 1944 until
1989. The other honors he has received include a Media Arts award
and medal in 1991 from the National Foundation for Jewish Culture.
</P>
<P>
   Krents was also the director of radio and television at the
American Jewish Committee. He founded the Committee's William E.
Wiener Oral History Library, now part of the New York Public
Library.
</P>
<P>
   By early 1979 ``The Eternal Light'' was broadcasting's oldest
continuous drama series. George Gent wrote in The New York Times in
1963 that ``The Eternal Light,'' which pioneered religious dramas
on radio, had remained ``faithful to its original concept of
providing literate and dramatic programs while avoiding sermonizing
and sectarianism.'' The dramas ranged from biblical tales to the
lives of contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   In those days the radio program had a weekly audience of four
million and received 4,000 letters a week. It was carried on 100
stations nationwide. The series also provided eight dramas for
showing on NBC-TV during November and December and two television
specials for the Passover and High Holy Days.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, the programs also came to include other fare,
like interviews and discussions on ethics involving Protestant and
Catholic clergy members as well as Jewish ones.
</P>
<P>
   Krents was born and grew up in Springfield, Mass., and earned a
bachelor's degree in 1935 from New York University.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Irma; a son, Lawrence B., of Amelia
Island, Fla.; a daughter, Elisabeth Zuckerwise, of Manhattan; two
brothers, Mac, of Washington, D.C., and David, of Hollywood, Fla.;
and eight grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Krents' other son, Harold, was blind from birth, but became a
lawyer and an advocate for the disabled. His life was dramatized in
the Broadway play ``Butterflies Are Free,'' which was made into a
film starring Goldie Hawn. He died in 1986.

IN NEW YORK, GORE OUTLINES VIEW ON GAYS IN THE MILITARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Vice President Al Gore spent Monday in New York City
trying to nail down the support of three crucial voter groups,
meeting privately with black, gay and Jewish leaders after a
high-profile meeting at the United Nations where he hoped to
burnish his foreign policy credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Gore began the day still digging out from a statement last week
that he would require appointees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff to
support a policy of allowing gays to serve openly in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Gore backed away from the position, saying he would
not apply a ``litmus test.'' But the Republican National Committee
had already produced a commercial questioning his patriotism and
saying that the policy would bar Gens. Colin Powell and Norman
Schwarzkopf from serving on the Joint Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   On NBC's ``Today Show,'' Gore found himself explaining again,
suggesting he would apply a test of whether an appointee would
follow orders. He said he would not demand that an appointee
believe in allowing gays to serve openly, but he would ask for a
commitment that he or she enforce that policy.
</P>
<P>
   Describing a hypothetical interview with a potential appointee,
Gore said that a person would not be disqualified if he or she was
uncomfortable with the policy. But he said that after asking the
person to explain the reservations, he would ``then ask, `Give me
the reassurance that of course you're going to do your best to
implement it.' And of course that goes without saying, because
officers do that in our military.''
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, the question of gays in the military had not
been a major issue in the Democratic campaign. Both former Sen.
Bill Bradley and Gore have stated that they want to abolish the
current ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy, which allows gays to
serve provided they do not disclose their sexual orientation or
engage in homosexual conduct. But with the gay vote important in
both the New York and California primaries, Gore seemed determined
to assert his bona fides on the matter in a debate last week in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   It became clear Monday why he might think this was necessary.
Matt Foreman, executive director of the Empire State Pride Agenda,
the state's largest gay lobbying group, said that gays had become
more sophisticated about using their political clout to make
demands on candidates seeking their support. Gays account for 9
percent of the Democratic primary vote in New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have to offer is an endorsement and rallying the
troops, and we want something in return for that and you always
want something more,'' Foreman said. ``There's nothing more we can
ask from either of them on `Don't ask, Don't tell,' and the
Republican right is already manipulating it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second commercial by the Republican National Committee is
to begin appearing Wednesday in the early voting states of Iowa and
New Hampshire, and in South Carolina, home to many military
retirees.
</P>
<P>
   After asserting that Gore wants a litmus test and that neither
Schwarzkopf of Powell would pass it, the advertisement tells voters
to ``Call Al Gore. Tell him the only litmus test ought to be
patriotism.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee is buying only $4,000 worth of network air time
for the commercial, an indication that it is designed as much to
get the attention of the news media as it is to sway voters.
``We've gotten more media attention than we ever expected already
on this issue, and it doesn't mean we don't put the ad up later,''
Cliff May, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee.
``We'll revisit this almost daily.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the commercial's contention was correct _ that Powell
and Schwarzkopf could not pass Gore's test _ Chris Lehane, the vice
president's press secretary, told reporters Monday: ``It's a
hypothetical. I don't know their views well enough to know whether
they would carry out the orders of the commander in chief on this
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``My assumption is that any Joint Chief of Staff would
carry out the orders of the commander in chief.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans quickly lit into Lehane's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Al Gore doesn't know the policy positions of people like
Colin Powell and Norman Schwarzkopf, he clearly doesn't have the
experience to be president,'' May said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also addressed another ongoing controversy: a statement by
his campaign manager, Donna Brazile, that Republicans were using
black celebrities like Powell to reach blacks but that they did not
really care about them. Gore and Ms. Brazile called Powell after he
sent a note saying he was offended by the comment.
</P>
<P>
   Gore refused to say last week whether he had apologized to
Powell. But on the ``Today Show,'' Gore said, ``That was the spirit
of the call. That word wasn't used. But I regretted the way he
heard Donna's comments.''

OTHER CANDIDATES TAKE AIM AT BUSH IN REPUBLICAN DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. _ Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain
sparred tensely in a Republican debate here Monday night over what
kind and what size of tax cut the country can afford, with McCain
ridiculing Bush's stated fear that Washington would gorge itself on
the growing surplus if the money was not returned to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't understand the role of the president of the United
States,'' McCain told Bush, turning to face him. ``The president of
the United States will veto bills _ will veto bills _ that spend
too much.''
</P>
<P>
   In a voice that seemed to chide and belittle Bush, McCain added,
``That's what being president of the United States is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it was one of the few times that McCain of Arizona, the
principal challenger to Bush for the Republican presidential
nomination, sharply criticized the front-runner, other rivals took
additional swipes at Bush, the Texas governor, on a variety of
fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes attacked Bush for a broken pledge, made in his 1994
campaign for governor, not to raise sales taxes in Texas. Gary
Bauer repeatedly and emphatically pressed Bush to defend his desire
to promote freer trade with China, given its history of human
rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   And Forbes, setting his sights on Bush for a second time,
challenged him to make three pledges about what he would do if he
became the Republican nominee and, beyond that, the American
president.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes wanted Bush to promise that he would select a running
mate who opposed legal abortion, appoint Supreme Court justices
with that same position and keep that position intact and
undiminished in the party platform.
</P>
<P>
   Bush declined, but without ever using that word, in one of
several answers that sought to evade conflict or specificity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to pick a vice president who can be the president,''
Bush said. ``I'll pick judges who strictly interpret the
Constitution.'' He added that he would ``work to keep the
Republican Party pro-life.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes responded: ``It's a typical hedge. Where's the pledge,
not a hedge?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said, ``I don't know how I can be more clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush frequently tried to defuse the attacks on him with humor,
getting off a number of good jokes that drew robust laughter from
the audience at Calvin College, where the debate was held. For
example, he thanked Forbes for a question that assumed that Bush
would be the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   With time ticking rapidly away before the Iowa caucuses on Jan.
24 touch off a rapid-fire series of state contests that could well
yield a nominee by early March, Bush's rivals were in part looking
to inflict some last-minute damage.
</P>
<P>
   But they also seemed, at times, to be trying to lock him into
conservative positions before he proceeded to a general election
contest. Bush would not let that happen, carefully avoiding any
commitment or statement that might come back to haunt him.
</P>
<P>
   The contest between Bush and McCain has heated up considerably
over recent days, as McCain prepared an alternative tax-cut
proposal that he planned to unveil on Tuesday, but once the two
moved past taxes Monday night, they exhibited remarkable amity.
</P>
<P>
   Twice Bush answered a question by praising, and agreeing with,
the response McCain had just given. And at one point, they clasped
hands and held them aloft in a gesture of agreement not to run any
negative advertisements about each other.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, however, who has already run a television commercial
about Bush that Bush's campaign deems negative, defended the right
to use such advertisements to draw distinctions between candidates'
positions and records.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the evening opened with a discussion by Forbes and Bush
about that television commercial, which describes a pledge from
1994 that bears Bush's signature and promises that he will not
raise sales taxes as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers have not denied the document's authenticity, nor
did Bush. Bush indeed raised the sales tax in Texas, but he
explained Monday night that the overall changes in the tax codes in
Texas in his years as governor amounted to a $3 billion cut, not an
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said to him, ``A pledge should not be used as a trinket
to win the election. I think that's what makes American people
cynical about politics _ pledges are made and then quickly
forgotten after the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush quickly replied, ``One thing that makes the American people
cynical is negative advertising on TV. I am a tax-cutting person,''
said Bush, whose proposal for a $483 billion tax cut over five
years has become the centerpiece of his campaign in New Hampshire,
which holds its primary on Feb. 1. ``I know how to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of the first third of the 90-minute debate, which
featured all six of the Republican candidates for their party's
nomination, it was all taxes all the time, regardless of what the
question was, to the point where it became a running joke.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was asked whether, in saying that rich people did not
deserve the kind of tax cut that Bush had recommended for them, he
was practicing class warfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never engaged in class warfare,'' he answered. ``I am
very much in favor of tax cuts for middle-income and lower-income
Americans. I'm deeply concerned about a kind of class warfare
that's going on right now. It's unfortunate. There's a growing gap
between the haves and have-nots in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also framed his tax cut as a way to help lower-income
people enter the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   There was an even sharper exchange between Bush and Bauer on the
subject of American trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had said that he did not support trade with Cuba because of
the repressive, Communist government of its leader, Fidel Castro.
Bauer countered that Chinese officials were equally repressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor, you just made the case for withdrawing
most-favored-nation status for China,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush shot back, ``I did not.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said, ``Everything you just said about Cuba applies to
China.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, insisted there was a ``huge difference between
trading with an entrepreneurial class, like that which is growing
in China, and allowing a Fidel Castro government to skim capital
monies off the top of capital investment.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate, broadcast nationally on MSNBC, was the third time in
just five days that the suddenly debate-mad Republicans had shared
a stage. The dense cluster of encounters reflected the intensifying
pace of the campaign for the nomination, with the first state
contest, the Iowa caucuses, just two weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   But this was the first Republican debate in Michigan, which
holds its primary, a potentially pivotal one, on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain has strong showings in New Hampshire on Feb. 1 and
South Carolina on Feb. 19, Michigan could be the make-or-break
battleground in his underdog challenge to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers intend the state to be one of their firewalls
against any surge by McCain. The Bush campaign is extraordinarily
well organized here, and Gov. John Engler of Michigan is one of
Bush's staunchest supporters and closest political allies.

BUSH DEFENDS TAX RECORD, PLAN IN GOP DEBATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. _ George W. Bush, in the sixth debate of all
six Republican presidential candidates, defended Monday both his
tax-cutting record as Texas governor and his proposal to slash
federal taxes by $483 billion if elected to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Magazine publisher Steve Forbes, who has been trying to use the
tax issue to jump-start his struggling campaign, accused Bush of
violating a 1994 campaign pledge as governor and making people
``cynical'' about politics. Forbes stood by a TV commercial, which
he started running last week in New Hampshire, that accuses Bush of
a ``record of broken promises'' on taxes, including a pledge to
oppose any increase in state sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pledge should not be used as a trinket to win the
election,'' Forbes said. ``The ad is accurate. I think that's what
makes American people cynical about politics _ pledges are made and
then quickly forgotten after the election.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one thing that makes the American people cynical is
negative advertising on TV. That's one thing that causes people to
turn away from politics,'' Bush retorted.
</P>
<P>
   Defending his tax record, Bush said he helped convince the Texas
Legislature to enact almost $3 billion in tax cuts in 1997 and
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a tax-cutting person. I know how to get it done,'' Bush
said. And his proposed $483 billion cut in federal tax over five
years, he added, will offer tax relief for Americans at all income
levels.
</P>
<P>
   In Forbes' ad, Mary Williams, a tax watchdog from Houston,
complains that Bush broke a 1994 pledge to her group to oppose an
increase in state sales taxes. The ad doesn't say, however, that
higher sales taxes and a new business tax proposed by Bush in 1997
were part of a larger tax tradeoff that would have cut school
property taxes by about $3 billion and resulted in an overall net
reduction in state and local taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature rejected Bush's proposal and, in its place,
simply raised the homestead exemption on school property taxes to
save many, but not all, Texas homeowners as much as $140 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain, who is giving Bush a strong race for
the Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary and has recently exchanged several
barbs with Bush over taxes, was more restrained Monday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain denied that he was playing a ``class warfare'' game,
pitting rich against poor, when he criticized Bush's proposed
federal tax cuts as too heavily favoring wealthier Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``There's a growing gap between the haves and the
have-nots in America.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain on Tuesday plans to unveil a $240 billion tax cut plan,
less than half of the size of Bush's, which McCain has contended
would be too costly. Analysts say that McCain's plan targets
middle-income taxpayers, while Bush's benefits the wealthy and
low-income Americans.
</P>
<P>
   McCain vowed not to use negative campaigning against Bush and
toward the end of the debate from Grand Rapids' Calvin College _
the third meeting of Republican candidates in the past five days _
reinforced that vow by stepping over to Bush and shaking the Texas
governor's hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll run positive ads. And I'm darn sure not going to do to
candidates what this man (Forbes) did to Bob Dole in 1996,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' negative ads in a losing Republican race against Dole in
1996 weakened the presumed nominee and are believed to have
contributed to Dole's eventual loss to President Clinton in the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will continue to tell the truth,'' said Forbes, who trails
both Bush and McCain by wide margins in most polls. ``People
deserve it. They deserve an honest and open and vigorous debate.
And if a man breaks a pledge, the voters ought to know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Texas has executed dozens of convicted murderers
during his administration, one college student asked Bush, who has
publicly expressed his deep Christian beliefs, what Jesus would say
about the death penalty.

   ``I don't believe we've ever executed an innocent person in my
state. I support the death penalty because I believe it saves
lives,'' the governor said. Pressed to answer what Jesus would say,
Bush said: ``I'm a lowly sinner. I'm not going to put words in
Jesus' mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   During a debate in Iowa last month, Bush identified Jesus as the
``philosopher'' who has had the greatest influence on his life.
</P>
<P>
   Republican candidate Gary Bauer attacked Bush for supporting
more trade with China. When Bush said there was a ``huge
difference'' between trading with Chinese entrepreneurs and trading
with Fidel Castro's totalitarian regime in Cuba _ which Bush
opposes _ Bauer retorted, ``Tell that to the people rotting in
prisons in China.''

UNDERDOG GARY BAUER FRAMES CONSERVATIVE MESSAGE IN DIRECT STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   MANCHESTER, Iowa _ Should Gary Bauer
interrupt your buffet lunch, as he's prone to do in his wishful
White House bid, he is certain to tell you a few things right off.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Hi, I'm Gary Bauer. I'm running for president. I'm
conservative; I'm pro-life; I'm pro-family.''
</P>
<P>
   Should you smile and nod at his mantra, he will feel encouraged
to stay a bit. He'll remind you that he worked eight years for
Ronald Reagan. Bauer will argue to you, essentially, that he is a
second coming of the Great Communicator _ an unashamed conservative
who couldn't care less how the media characterize his views.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the only Reagan Republican in the race,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Much as Reagan spoke of an evil empire seated in Moscow, Bauer
talks of a dangerous and immoral force marshaling in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   And if he is allowed to linger a minute or two more, Bauer will
work into the conversation that he's running against ``the son of a
former president (Texas Gov. George W. Bush), the son of an admiral
(Sen. John McCain of Arizona) and the son of a tycoon (magazine
publisher Steve Forbes).''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm,'' he will add pointedly, ``the son of a janitor.''
</P>
<P>
   So goes the Bauer campaign, marked mostly by his embrace of
underdog status and bluntly conservative talk.
</P>
<P>
   He sees the nation in moral free fall, exemplified most
pointedly by its allowance of more than a million abortions a year.
Were he president, Bauer says, no one would reach the federal bench
before establishing anti-abortion credentials with him. He figures
three justices will leave the U.S. Supreme Court in the next
administration, and he plans to use their replacements to outlaw
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   School prayer, in Bauer's view, would go a long way toward
setting America right. He wants the Ten Commandments _ ``It would
be virtually impossible to find someone to argue with the main
tenets of it'' _ posted in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was OK for those kids at Columbine High School to go in
every day and give a Nazi salute,'' he says, ``but a teacher can't
say, `I just want you to know God loves you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Even in campaign-intensive Iowa, few people know who this
diminutive, slightly bug-eyed, well-spoken man is.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-three-year-old Gary Lee Bauer has been talking
hard-charging conservative politics through most of his adult life.
Even in the Reagan White House, he was at times an irritant for the
way he pushed for the president to speak boldly on issues like
abortion and relations with foreign rivals.
</P>
<P>
   After holding minor jobs in the Republican National Committee
and a direct-mail firm, he started the Reagan years as senior
policy analyst. He moved on to deputy undersecretary of education
and ended the administration as a chief domestic policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Since then he has headed the Family Research Council, a group
with strong ties to the Colorado-based evangelical group Focus on
the Family, which is led by James Dobson. Dobson and Bauer, in
fact, penned a book together laying out how they believe America's
secular society is robbing its children of moral direction.
</P>
<P>
   When he says he is ``pro-family,'' Bauer says, it's ``shorthand
for people that you embrace a certain set of values.'' Bauer says
he thinks voters understand that shorthand to mean lower taxes,
support of school vouchers and educational tax credits, and
opposition to gay marriage, which he characterized as in ``some
ways worse than terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real conflict going on over the culture, and
traditional values are under attack,'' Bauer said in an interview.
``I don't think my party has been serious. It's a betrayal of the
voters to not address these things.''
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Bauer thinks Bush bears anti-moderate tendencies
by not pledging to pick an anti-abortion vice president. (Bauer
hints regularly that he would pick emphatic abortion opponent Alan
Keyes, his companion at the bottom of Republican presidential
polls.) McCain, he said, has been inconsistent in opposing
abortion. And Forbes, he suggests, embraced this issue in this
election cycle only after his single-theme campaigning on the flat
tax bombed in the 1996 caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Bauer boasts his own flat-tax proposal _ a single
16-percent rate regardless of income _ but touts it as better than
Forbes' because it protects the deductions for existing mortgage
payments and charitable contributions. He does not say how he would
restore the money lost to the federal budget by cutting taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Like Reagan, he is unbending in his call for America to shield
itself with an anti-missile defense system. He would deploy
existing systems right away. ``They're not perfect,'' he says,
``but they're better than nothing.'' Then he would feed money into
a plan for a space-based defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer tells audiences that China already is pointing missiles at
Taiwan and ``if you believe some reports, California.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese, in fact, consume much of his campaign's attention.
Bauer pledges to strip the country of its most-favored-nation trade
status, and restore it only after proof that the country has
improved its human-rights practices.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Bauer said, ``China plays us for suckers'' _ flooding
America with cheap slave-labor products while either keeping out
U.S.-made goods or accepting intellectual property and promptly
bootlegging it.
</P>
<P>
   His reluctance to equivocate, refreshing compared with the
evasive caution of candidates with gaudier poll numbers, can lead
him to Reaganlike overstatement. (``You see so many stories where a
guy is sentenced to 125 years in prison and six months later he's
out for good behavior.'')
</P>
<P>
   His abrupt ways, he tells potential voters, are not just some
political novelty. They are key to the Republicans' victory in
November. A mild attack will not unseat the party in power in such
good economic times, he said. But he would use the debates to press
concerns about morality, issues like opposition to late-term
abortion and gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore will be squirming on that stage if I get ahold of
him,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   And when about two dozen persons gathered in the West Union
Public Library run out of questions, Bauer poses one to himself:
``Hey, can I win?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he replies, because he talks with a conviction not heard
from his party's front-runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The polls don't tell you who, on a cold winter's night, is
going to get out to a caucus,'' he says. ``What matters is who can
get people's hearts beating fast enough.''
</P>

<P>
   Does this story sound familiar? A young man borrows money from
friends and family to start a company that he contends will
revolutionize the world and end information overload for the
majority of Americans. After some lean years, he becomes one of the
richest and most powerful men on the planet, and his company
dominates its field.
</P>
<P>
   No, this is not the saga of Bill Gates _ or even Steve Case. The
hero of this tale is Henry Luce, who with Briton Hadden founded
Time Inc. in the early 1920s. Since then, for better and sometimes
for worse, Time has been in the forefront of almost every
technological change in what is now called ``the media business,''
but back then was known as ``newspapering.''
</P>
<P>
   Luce's Time Inc. ``was tremendously important in shaping the way
much of the American news media came to cover news,'' said James
Baughman, a professor of journalism at the University of Wisconsin
in Madison.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s most newspapers were somewhat like the Internet:
vast compendiums of information, including shipping schedules,
stock prices, transcripts of political speeches, and reports of
freak accidents and fires. No one, Luce said, had the time (or the
patience) to sift through all the available information and figure
out what was important.
</P>
<P>
   So Time, the magazine, would do it. And thus, in 1923, was born
the first information ``portal,'' the America Online of its day.
The magazine's stories were often mere snippets, written in a
snappy style, with lots of interpretation and a focus on
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Business figures _ especially those who ran the great American
corporation _ became popular subjects; Fortune magazine began
appearing in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech cameras (they were portable, and did not need
reloading after every shot!) and new developments in printing led
to the introduction of Life in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   Time Inc. was even a pioneer in radio with ``The March of
Time,'' a sort of on-air newsreel that mostly served to advertise
the magazine, and which quickly became a real newsreel, shown in
movie theaters (it won a special Oscar in 1937.)
</P>
<P>
   By the 1940s the Time approach to news had become so accepted
that people almost forgot that it was once unknown. And Luce had
become so prominent (and well-to-do) that he felt comfortable
lecturing his fellow citizens about their global responsibilities
in ``The American Century,'' his influential essay published in
Time in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   As the 1950s rolled around, ``Time magazine sat on most of the
coffee tables in the country, it seemed,'' said Mitchell Stephens,
a professor of journalism at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   Time's stable of magazines, which by 1954 included Sports
Illustrated, ``were the media that seemed to unify the country,''
Stephens said, adding that the magazines were not universally
acclaimed. ``I had a teacher who said that Time was for people who
can't think, and Life was for people who can't read.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading, however, was not the issue in the 1960s, when broadcast
television began to dominate Americans' hearts and minds. Time Inc.
bought TV and radio stations, which contributed significantly to
the company's profits. But TV also competed with Life for its mass
audience and the advertisers who were anxious to reach millions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Life, a weekly magazine, was closed. Life's demise has
not been the only failure at Time. A science magazine, Discover,
was started in 1980 but was later sold at a loss. The company also
made an ill-fated venture into newspapers when it bought The
Washington Star, which closed in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Cable television, however, had practically been invented by
Time, which created Home Box Office to beam B-movies into homes in
Wilkes-Barre, Pa. In 1975 the service went national with the
broadcast of the Ali-Frazier fight (aka the Thrilla from Manila).
Three years later the company bought American Telcom and
Communications, another large cable operator.
</P>
<P>
   By 1980 television profits surpassed those from magazine
publishing at Time Inc. And throughout the decade, Time became more
of a media conglomerate. After turning down the chance to buy half
of Cable News Network from Ted Turner in 1985, Time helped bail out
Turner Broadcasting in 1987, and ended up with 20 percent of that
operation. In the mid-1990s it bought the rest of the company.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Time had already merged with Warner, an operator
of funeral parlors and parking lots that in 1969 had bought Warner
Bros., the movie studio and cartoon empire. It also owned, at least
temporarily, a lot of other stuff, including the video-game maker
Atari, the Franklin Mint and the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   It took Time Warner almost a decade to work its way out from
under the mountain of debt it had used to buy Warner, and to make
peace with shareholders infuriated by that deal.
</P>
<P>
   As the corporation grew, its original mainspring, Time, became
less and less important, at least to the company's profits. It is
impossible to know what Luce, who died in 1967, would have made of
that, or of his brainchild's decision to merge with America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Luce did have misgivings about technological developments and
resented the fact that the newsreels reached a wider audience than
his magazine. ``Luce more than once said, `My heart is in print,'''
said Baughman, who wrote a book about Luce and is working on a
television documentary about him.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, perhaps the future of print is, indeed,
digital. ``It's these geeks who keep talking about content
providers,'' said Baughman, who now reads online magazines like
Salon and Slate. ``I keep telling my students, you're still going
to have to be able to write, you're still going to have to know
punctuation, regardless of the medium.''

EXPERTS PURSUE THIEF WHO PUT CREDIT CARD DATA ON INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Computer security experts are trying to
track and are warily watching for the next move of a wily computer
extortionist who last month demanded $100,000 from an Internet
music retailer and then, when his threat was rejected, began
posting stolen credit card numbers on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In e-mail messages sent to reporters over the weekend, the
extortionist said he intended to re-establish a clandestine Web
site that for two weeks had been dispensing credit cards he said
were stolen from CD Universe, an Internet music retailer based in
Wallingford, Conn. The messages were from a person who said he was
based in Russia and who identified himself as Maxus, Maxim and
Pi2000.
</P>
<P>
   A number of security experts said that, depending on the
extortionist's skill, tracking him through the Internet could
present a formidable challenge. One researcher who has been trying
to track him, said that despite the extortionist's identifying
himself as a Russian, his e-mail program indicated that he was in a
country one time zone to the west of Russia, probably in Eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But e-mail messages sent to reporters over the weekend came from
the computer server of a small design company in Paris, suggesting
that the extortionist was using a number of masking techniques to
hide his true Internet location.
</P>
<P>
   In December, rather than paying the extortion demand, CD
Universe contacted the FBI and attempted to maintain an e-mail
conversation with the credit card thief in an effort to trace his
location.
</P>
<P>
   The illegal credit card site was secretly established on the
computers of an Internet service in Kirkland, Wash., on Christmas
Day. The site enabled World Wide Web computer users to view and
copy stolen credit card numbers that the thief said were stolen
from CD Universe. More than 25,000 card numbers were downloaded
from the site before it was shut down.
</P>
<P>
   The computer security expert who received the first tip from the
extortionist said Monday that he expected the credit card
information to show up at new Internet locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will probably find another location to dispense the stolen
information,'' said Elias Levy, chief technology officer for
SecurityFocus.com, a San Francisco-based computer security firm.
``We'll also probably see information about the new site being
passed around within the computer underground.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack comes as the Clinton administration has been pushing
to expand dramatically the ability of law enforcement to respond
both to computer crime and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the administration introduced a proposal to increase
spending by $280 million to build networks of surveillance systems
to protect government computers and train a new corps of high-tech
cyber-warriors to fight a new kind of electronic warfare.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at Stanford University Monday before the National
Association of Attorneys General, Attorney General Janet Reno
proposed a national crime fighting network, to be called Lawnet,
aimed at linking law enforcement officials and sharing information,
intelligence and equipment in an effort to match what she described
as the ``dark side'' of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reno also stressed new initiatives by the Clinton
administration for international cooperation to fight crime taking
place over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole concept of the globalization of crime is making this
work difficult,'' she said. ``The cybercriminals should get the
message that there is no safe place to hide just because they are
halfway around the world.''

BULLS STARTING TO REBUILD AMID DYNASTY'S RUINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Toni Kukoc returned to the lineup and the Chicago Bulls
surprisingly won three games in a row last week, even Tim Floyd had
to laugh at the characterization in the local news media. In
newspapers and on television, his team's modest winning streak was
referred to as the Bulls' ``first three-peat since 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to chuckle over those things and accept it for
right now,'' Floyd, the Bulls' coach, said. ``We all knew it was
going to be a difficult rebuild. Did I know it was going to be like
this? Well, we've been banged up a lot. And when you have no idea
what the makeup of your team is going to be from night to night, it
makes it a little harder.''
</P>
<P>
   The polite receptionist at the United Center still answers the
telephone, ``The six-time champion Chicago Bulls, may I help you?''
And including Kukoc, five of the current players actually
contributed to a Bulls National Basketball Association title. But
after journeymen like B.J. Armstrong or Will Perdue, after the
half-dozen banners hanging beneath the arena's catwalk and a few
other After Michael vestiges, there is nothing left from those
halcyon days.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls, who face the Knicks Tuesday night at Madison Square
Garden, may have even ruined their best shot at becoming a national
story again last week. For the moment, those three victories ended
the comparisons between this bad pro basketball team and the worst
of all time, the 9-73 Philadelphia 76ers, who set the record for
losses in a season in 1973. At 5-26, and with a healthy Kukoc, the
Bulls now have a good chance to avoid replacing the Sixers in the
record book.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way things were going, I almost got to write about the
greatest team and the worst team of all time in a span of five
years,'' said Sam Smith, The Chicago Tribune's NBA columnist.
``That would have been impressive. It's a little disappointing now.
I thought they were really going to continue to make history.''
</P>
<P>
   Their recent success aside, these Bulls are in bad shape
offensively. They activated Kukoc from the injury list on Jan. 5
after he had missed 24 games because of back spasms. But Randy
Brown's surgically repaired knee buckled against Boston over the
weekend, and now he is a question mark. Hersey Hawkins has missed
the last 13 games with a tear in his calf muscle and Fred Hoiberg,
their other notable shooter, has missed the last eight games
because of a right quadriceps strain.
</P>
<P>
   Not including Kukoc, who has played only seven games, the Bulls
have been led in scoring and minutes played by two rookies, both
New York products _ the overall No. 1 draft pick Elton Brand from
Duke and the former St. John's star Ron Artest. Brand is averaging
16.9 points and 9.7 rebounds a game, and Artest 11.8 points and 4.7
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, the team has continued to sell out the United
Center. Dating to Nov. 20, 1987, at the old Chicago Stadium, the
Bulls have sold out 582 straight home games. Pockets of empty seats
can be seen on many nights, but there were few when the former Bull
Scottie Pippen returned for the first time as a player early last
week.
</P>
<P>
   In grand fashion, the club played a long video tribute before
casting a spotlight on the floor as Pippen was introduced before
the rest of the Portland Trail Blazers. Asked if Michael Jordan
would attend the game, the still-bitter Pippen said: ``Why would he
want to see the Bulls play? It gives you a laugh to see how
management destroyed something that was good for the city.''
</P>
<P>
   The owner, Jerry Reinsdorf, and the general manager, Jerry
Krause, are still occasionally lambasted for breaking up a dynasty
and starting over so startlingly. But as Krause said last week by
telephone from Chicago: ``We knew when Michael decided not to play
that we would have to tear it up. We weren't going to sign Dennis
Rodman and we weren't going to sign Scottie to a long-term deal.
The fans know what we're doing. They've been patient. Some people
in your profession? I can't say the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   John Gabriel, the Orlando Magic general manager, who lost
Shaquille O'Neal to the Lakers three years ago, said: ``With all
due respect, it's tough when your marquee player just disappears.
There is nothing in return. That can set you back terribly. For the
Bulls, reloading was not an option. They had to rebuild.''
</P>
<P>
   After one more trying season, the Bulls will be in line for
another high draft choice. They are also about $24 million under
the salary cap, with Kukoc as their only name free agent. At the
least, they will have about $18 million with which to attract two
top-flight players in the off-season _ more than any other team.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Duncan, Grant Hill, Tracy McGrady and Ron Mercer are all
players Chicago covets. But will they come if there is no
indication that the franchise can win consistently? When asked
recently whether the Raptors' McGrady would consider signing with
Chicago, Toronto Coach Butch Carter said: ``Chicago? No. Why?
Because Tracy hates to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd, who was handpicked by Krause to replace Phil Jackson,
said: ``We know we're committed to spending the money, so that in
itself means we're going to get appreciably better. We've never
heard anything detrimental directly from the guys we're interested
in. Also, guys like Michael and Scottie talk about the past a lot.
They all say they want to be remembered as Bulls. That can't
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourned as it is, the end of Chicago's indomitable run was not
all bad. Though the organization is at the bottom of the NBA
standings and fans of the Windy City long for another championship
run in any sport these days, finding a parking space at the team's
practice facility in Deerfield, Ill., is no longer a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as quality of life goes, it's actually improved for a
lot of people around the team,'' Smith said. ``I mean, when's the
last time you called Chicago and got the coach on the phone?''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hallam, the Bulls' senior director for media services, a
team employee since 1977, said: ``It was an incredible run, and I
don't think anyone would ever trade it for anything. But when the
circus left town, life did return to normal for a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand, the rookie, may have summed up the transition best. When
asked about Pippen's return last week, he said: ``I can't really
relate to him being on the Bulls. I'm on the Bulls now. It just
seems like we've moved on to a different stage.''

   UNITED NATIONS _ Vice President Al Gore, presiding over an
unusual Security Council session called to debate the AIDS crisis
in Africa, said Monday that the United States would add $150
million to next year's budget to help combat that and other
infectious diseases in the poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   Gore appeared during a primary campaign in which his opponent
for the Democratic presidential nomination, Bill Bradley, has
consistently backed more cooperation with the United Nations. The
occasion kicked off a month of a focus on Africa in the council
organized by Richard C. Holbrooke, the U.S. representative to the
United Nations and the council president for January.
</P>
<P>
   The pledge of more money is still subject to approval by
Congress. But it made less news here than Gore's presence itself
and the recognition by the council that the AIDS epidemic in Africa
had reached the level of an international security issue, because
it could decimate the economic, political and military
establishments in many countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is being more effective than war in destabilizing
countries,'' the president of the World Bank, James D. Wolfensohn,
said. ``We're rolling back some of the gains that have been made in
Africa over the past 40 years. We gained, under African leadership,
more than 20 years in life expectancy. In many countries, this will
be lost by the year 2010.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Piot, executive director of UNAIDS, a consortium of U.N.
agencies that has been providing assistance to a range of programs
in Africa for several years, told the council that he estimated
that his program needed $1 billion to $3 billion a year to fight
AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa alone.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS in Africa, several speakers noted, now kills more people
than wars _ and more wars are being fought there than on any other
continent. Furthermore, soldiers and international peacekeepers are
in the forefront of those spreading the human immunodeficiency
virus, which causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Across one society after another, the effects are devastating, a
lineup of international experts testified.
</P>
<P>
   Around the world, more than 33 million people have AIDS or the
virus that causes it. At least 70 percent are African.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just imagine that in Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe 25
percent of the people between 15 and 19 years of age are HIV
positive,'' Wolfensohn said. ``Just imagine that in Zambia and
Zimbabwe there is more chance of a child born today dying of AIDS
than of living free of AIDS. A third of teen-age girls in many of
the countries are subject to the scourge of AIDS. We're losing
teachers faster than we can replace them. We're losing judges,
lawyers, government officials, persons in the military.''
</P>
<P>
   In the face of the crisis, a number of African leaders have
refused to discuss the problem openly. The administrator of the
U.N. Development Program, Mark Malloch Brown, said Monday: ``In too
many places, individual ostracism, and hence denial, still prevail,
confounding good tracking and management of the disease. Change
must begin by confronting the region's troubled inheritance:
extensive migrant labor, social norms and gender inequality making
it hard for women and girls to deny men sex, leading to HIV
incidence rates among girls three or four times higher than boys,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that, ``The first battle to be
won in the war against AIDS is the battle to smash the wall of
silence and stigma surrounding it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who also spoke about the need to ``destigmatize'' AIDS,
said that the next Clinton administration budget would also include
money for the Pentagon to share its expertise on controlling AIDS
in the military with African nations.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda's minister of health, Dr. Crispus Kiyonga, told the
council Monday that one of the programs that has made his country
the continent's leader in the fight against AIDS is in the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Uganda has also established anti-AIDS campaigns in
educational institutions and 4,000 private organizations and is
using songs, billboards and radio and television to spread
information about the disease. By 1995, Kiyonga said, surveys found
that many more people were using condoms and reducing the number of
their sexual partners, often ``sticking to one.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Not all Security Council members approved of Monday's unusual
debate, in which more than two dozen diplomats spoke. China and
Russia refused to take part. Both have fought to keep social issues
out of the Council, fearing the introduction of human rights cases,
diplomats say. Holbrooke said that the Russians and Chinese agreed
to the debate only on the promise that it would not set a
precedent.
</P>
<P>
   For many at the United Nations it was the ``old Al Gore'' who
spoke Monday _ an American they remember as once deeply involved in
international issues. As a senator in 1992, he led a congressional
delegation to the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In 1994,
he went to Cairo, Egypt, for an international conference on
population and development.
</P>
<P>
   But during the second Clinton administration, as the White House
and State Department have become increasingly skittish about
involvement in international organizations in the face of
Republican hostility in Congress, Gore _ like Hillary Rodham
Clinton _ has been seen much less frequently at public U.N. events.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats said that Gore was the first U.S. vice president
to preside over the Security Council. But he was not the first vice
president of the United States to address the council. Vice
President George Bush spoke for the United States in July 1988 when
Iran attempted to win a condemnation of the United States after a
U.S. warship shot down an Iranian passenger plane over the Persian
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   That year was also a presidential election year, and Bush was
the likely Republican candidate. His advisers later acknowledged
that Bush, who had been the U.S. representative at the United
Nations in the early 1970s, was encouraged to go to the council to
demonstrate his presidential qualities in an international arena.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Jeffrey Laurenti, executive director of policy studies
at the U.N. Association of the United States, an independent
support and research group, contended that the same thinking may
have applied to Gore's appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was sold to the Gore office as a political stop, a
campaign stop that outshines what he might do on a bus in New
Hampshire or Iowa,'' said Laurenti, who has worked on Democratic
campaigns in New Jersey. ``It was sold not as an important step for
international policy but as a way to showcase the vice president as
an international leader.'' Gore's speech, Laurenti said, had
something to appeal to a gay audience, to blacks and to women.
</P>
<P>
   But Holbrooke, asked by reporters if Gore's appearance, lasting
less than an hour, had more to do with politics than Africa, called
the question ``a truly outrageous accusation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``He said that all his domestic advisers opposed this,''
Holbrooke said. ``He's in this building five or six hours today.
None of what he's doing here today has any direct impact on the
present phase of the primary season, which is intense, and being
conducted in two states which are far away from here _ and this is
not an issue. He and Senator Bradley agree on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan saw the political possibilities, however. In the only
light moment of the daylong debate on a grim subject, he expressed
gratitude to Gore for introducing him effusively. ``Thank you, Mr.
Vice President, or perhaps I should say Mr. President,'' Annan
said, leaving a long pause before adding ``of the Security
Council.'' By council standards, it brought down the house.

AOL CHAIRMAN IS USED TO ADAPTING TO CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Hawaii)   (Eds: Inserts new graf that begins ``Case, who frequently ....'') 
 (With AOL-TIME-WARNER) 
(lb) 
 By AMY HARMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps the only thing stranger than America Online's chairman,
Stephen M. Case, announcing plans to assume the helm of the world's
largest media conglomerate on Monday was the fact that he wore a
suit and tie to do it.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Case, 41, heads an Internet company perpetually
thought to be doomed and is known for clinging to his casual
costume of denim shirts and khakis on even the most formal
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   But if his attire changes with his company's acquisition of Time
Warner, it should come as no surprise. Since the days of 300-baud
modems, Case has survived the Internet's accelerated evolution with
a series of transformations. His deal with Time Warner is only the
most recent.
</P>
<P>
   It is a character trait that did not go unnoticed by Time
Warner's chairman, Gerald Levin, who had shed his own tie before
Monday's news conference announcing the deal and who took a certain
relish in welcoming the ``suits from Virginia,'' where America
Online is based.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Steve proposed that I be CEO in that very first phone
call, it caught my attention, because it said something about who
he is,'' Levin said Monday of Case's approach. ``Here is someone
who has built an extremely successful company, still early in his
career, and he was saying `I'm going to give my baby to you as the
CEO because I think that is what's best for both companies.'''
</P>
<P>
   The decision underscored the combination of idealism and
pragmatism that has served Case well through several episodes of
turmoil. Seemingly shy and reserved, Case conceived of a grand
vision for America Online over a decade ago and refused to abandon
it, despite competition that seemed insurmountable and detractors
unwilling to be appeased.
</P>
<P>
   James Kimsey, the company's co-founder and former chairman, said
Case was weaned on crisis. In America Online's earliest years, the
company was constantly running out of money. Trying to find new
partners to carry it through was part of Case's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve was well schooled in the harrowing ways of high tech and
particularly in an emerging medium,'' Kimsey said. ``We had very
few resources so we were forced to figure out how to get other
people to carry our water.''
</P>
<P>
   Case, who was raised in Hawaii and received a bachelor's degree
in political science from Williams College, spent his first
postcollege years working in marketing for giants like PepsiCo and
Procter &AMP; Gamble _ he helped invent the slogan ``Towelette? You
bet!'' and then watched the P&AMP;G product fail.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1983, when he hooked up his Kaypro computer to an early
version of an online service, he began to envision an interactive
world where people all over the country could gather. At a company
then known as Quantum Computer Services, he and Kimsey pursued that
vision.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem was that IBM and Sears had a similar idea.
Their venture, Prodigy, was an online service started a year before
America Online and had parents with deep pockets, so it was easy
for industry watchers to see that the fledgling America Online
would lose that battle. But Prodigy, which was slower to introduce
Internet access and e-mail, stumbled as Case's company gathered
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Case, who frequently pops jelly beans during interviews, has
three children from his first marriage. He was remarried in 1998 to
Jean Villanueva, America Online's former communications chief, who
has since left the company.
</P>
<P>
   With the birth of the World Wide Web, industry pundits again
predicted the end for proprietary services like America Online. But
partly in response to the Web's popularity, the service switched to
flat-rate pricing in 1996 and attracted more interest than it could
handle. Its lack of preparation resulted in one of the worst
moments in the company's history, as millions of customers were
shut out with busy signals.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind. Case quickly expanded capacity and announced a
series of executive appointments aimed at getting back in his
customers' good graces. With his frequently posted letters to
subscribers, Case fostered an image of the company as friendly and
open to criticism.
</P>
<P>
   In its first incarnation, America Online billed itself as an
online community. With the new executive team _ including Robert
Pittman, who had built the MTV brand _ in place, the company began
to advertise itself as a vehicle for convenience. Now it is looking
to expand its revenues from e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Once disdained by techies as poorly designed training wheels for
the real Internet, America Online last year acquired Netscape
Communications, a Silicon Valley darling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both grew up with a belief that change is good and should
be embraced rather than feared,'' said Daniel H. Case III, Case's
older brother, who is chief executive of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
``Growing up in Hawaii, you had to wonder: What's the boundary?
When we went to college our father told us, `It's all a long way
away, why not go to the East Coast?' So if you're trying to invent
a new industry, why not be the leader?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Case's willingness to adapt to the changing environment does
not come without its casualties. He has pushed aside executives,
including Ted Leonsis, a former president who was once slated to
run the company's media ventures, when he decided on a change of
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In inviting Levin to be chief executive, Case displayed a shrewd
negotiating tactic, but perhaps at the expense of some America
Online executives who have run the company's day-to-day operations.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Case says, he wants to evolve once more as chairman of Time
Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decade ago, AOL had less than 100,000 members and the World
Wide Web hadn't been invented,'' he said. ``Now I'm a billionaire
and on the cover of all these magazines, but I hope my personal
legacy is not about making money. It may sound corny, but I want to
focus on the things I care about. I want to change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Case will be able to exercise as much control over his
own company's evolution in the wake of a combination remains to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``With America Online, you always got the feeling that they
wanted you to like them,'' wrote one subscriber on an America
Online bulletin board on Monday. He added, ``I have never felt such
vibes from Time Warner.''

CLINTON TO OFFER AID IN COLOMBIA DRUG WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton plans to announce on Tuesday a
$1.28 billion emergency aid program for Colombia to help that
country fight the growing narcotics trade and to prop up its
democracy over the next two years, a senior administration official
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president believes there is a strong national interest in
helping Colombia deal with the narcotics threat,'' the official
said. ``It is clearly a situation where emergency money is
warranted, given the determination of the drug traffickers to
undermine the government in Bogota.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the money would be aimed at fighting drugs, it would
also help a government that is battling one of the longest
guerrilla wars in Latin America, one that has become intertwined
with the narcotics trade and has left tens of thousands dead over
40 years.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is an accelerated version of legislation that
congressional Republicans introduced in the fall to provide more
than $1.2 billion to Colombia over three years to stem what they
described as a ``crisis situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest part of the administration package would be spent on
military hardware to upgrade Colombian forces in their fight
against narcotics traders, many of whom are aligned with
antigovernment rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The administration proposal would also finance strengthening the
justice system and give money to people displaced by the civil war
at a time when Colombia's economy is in its worst shape in in
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest single item is $400 million to buy 30 Blackhawk
helicopters, which are equipped with weapons but are mostly used
for ferrying troops and equipment, said a Pentagon official.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money, including funds to buy military equipment,
would be under the direction of the State Department, not the
Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Even though 10 percent of the money would go to the Pentagon,
there was concern that a program of such size could inexorably lead
to a broader U.S.military commitment to the war and the potential
for U.S.soldiers to be drawn into combat against the insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must question whether or not this aid package is another
thinly veiled counterinsurgency program, one that will deepen the
U.S. involvement in this dirty war,'' said Carlos Salinas of
Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   Although officials at the Office of Management and Budget
refined the proposal late into the evening, the new financing would
pay for three general programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon would receive $144 million to help train two
additional antinarcotics battalions. They would begin operations in
southern Colombia and improve the tracking of narcotics dealers
with new radios and other equipment, as well as improving
ground-based radar, an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   The larger amount would buy helicopters to help stop the
narcotics trade.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been grappling with Colombian policy
since last year, when congressional Republicans made their proposal
and President Andres Pastrana outlined a $7.5 billion strategy to
solve his nation's crisis in an address to the U.N. General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan answers many of the requests in Pastrana's ``Plan
Colombia'' and is meant to illustrate that Clinton has made
Colombia a foreign policy priority in his last year in office.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's budget, Colombia receives $300 million, making it
the third largest recipient of aid, behind Israel and Egypt. With
the money already allotted to Colombia, the entire two-year package
would total $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   One big proponent of the additional aid is Gen. Barry McCaffrey,
director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. In a visit
to Colombia last summer, he said that Colombia was in ``an
emergency situation.'' McCaffrey argued that the distinction
between rebels and drug traffickers had grown irrelevant and that
the poorly equipped and inadequately trained armed forces needed
immediate help.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress cut off military assistance to much of the
Colombian army two years ago to protest its record of human rights
abuses. Under a law sponsored by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the
U.S. Embassy in Bogota now reviews all members of the antidrug
battalion who are being trained by U.S. Special Forces units, to
ensure that the Colombians are not human rights abusers.
</P>
<P>
   That instruction includes intelligence, communications,
reconnaissance, river operations and mortars, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Bogota is very pleased with the proposal, said a senior
Colombian official, who added that his government had been working
with Congress and the White House to draw up a package that
Republicans and Democrats would approve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drug production,'' the official said, ``feeds all the violence
in Colombia, creates the economic problems, hurts the people and
creates problems of human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana has failed in his attempts to negotiate a cease-fire
with the rebels or to reduce cocaine production, which thrives
despite a nearly 50 percent increase in U.S. drug-eradication
efforts in 1998.

CRIMINAL INQUIRY IS SOUGHT IN TOBACCO LOBBYING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York state lobbying commission recommended Monday that a
prosecutor consider opening an inquiry into whether a lobbyist for
Philip Morris Cos. had committed a crime by concealing her spending
on gifts for state lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The commission handed down record civil penalties in November
against both Philip Morris and its chief lobbyist in Albany, Sharon
Portnoy, after Ms. Portnoy admitted drastically underreporting her
spending on lobbying in Albany. The company was fined $75,000, and
Ms. Portnoy was fined $15,000 and barred from lobbying the state
government for three years.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the commission sent the case to the Albany County
district attorney, Sol Greenberg, for possible prosecution. Ms.
Portnoy, who is now on leave from the company, could be charged
with perjury, a felony, and filing false documents, a misdemeanor.
Greenberg said Monday that he had not decided what to do with the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also released a transcript of a deposition that
Ms. Portnoy gave in the case that provides an unusual glimpse into
how lobbyists operate in the capital. Ms. Portnoy, who often
treated lawmakers to expensive meals, described how she manipulated
the records of her expenses so she would not have to list the names
of the lawmakers in her disclosure reports.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists are required to disclose the names of recipients of
gifts worth $75 or more. In her internal records, Ms. Portnoy often
listed the names of people as having been at meals when they were
not, and this practice lowered the cost of the meals per person to
under $75.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a commission official why she had falsified her
records, Ms. Portnoy suggested in the deposition that lawmakers
believed that the public would frown on their accepting meals from
lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt compelled not to put the legislator in the position of
having their name listed on the lobbying report,'' she said. She
later added, ``I was uncomfortable every time I had to do it, but I
didn't see any other way out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately the names were revealed when Ms. Portnoy's internal
records were included in mounds of documents submitted by Philip
Morris in litigation over the health costs of smoking. They showed
that from 1993 through 1996, at least 115 current and former
lawmakers in the 211-member New York state Legislature had accepted
gifts from Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Roberts, a spokeswoman for Philip Morris, declined to
comment Monday on the commission's decision to refer the case to
the Albany County district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's decision brought a rebuke from the state
attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, who said the commission was
protecting Philip Morris by declining to seek a broad criminal
investigation into whether other executives might have been
involved when Ms. Portnoy filed false records.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer was also angered that the commission had not referred
the case to him, and his aides have questioned whether Greenberg
would pursue the matter, because his office does not concentrate on
such white-collar crimes.
</P>
<P>
   David Grandeau, executive director of the Temporary State
Commission on Lobbying, said the commission had fulfilled its legal
obligations. ``If anyone took the time and trouble to read her
deposition, they would see that she has full responsibility for the
violations,'' he said.

SPORTS COLUMN: POSTSEASON SUCCESS IS A STATE OF MIND 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys, like all the playoff losers, could find a
play here or there _ a dropped pass that broke momentum, a poor
tackle attempt, an interception, a fumble or a penalty _ that
helped boot them from the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   In most of the first-round playoff games, however, both sides
insisted that the issue was not talent. The playing field remains
relatively equal, they assure us.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look across our locker room,'' Dallas cornerback Deion
Sanders said, ``I see a lot of good players, Pro Bowl players. So,
I say, yes, very much so, we are underachievers.''
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith called the Cowboys ``sometimes brilliant'' and
often ``mediocre.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit, Seattle and Buffalo, all kicked from the playoffs,
might agree about their performances. So, too, would a handful of
the 19 teams that narrowly missed the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every week, that is going to be one team's battle cry,''
Vikings receiver Cris Carter said. `` `We're good but we just
didn't show it.''' .
</P>
<P>
   Leroy Hoard, a Vikings running back, added: ``Every game is one
of opportunities. Who cashed in and who didn't. That is what it
usually boils down to. And the reasons for that are very complex.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys receiver Raghib Ismail tried making it simple. He was
asked what the difference is between the Vikings, marching on in
the playoffs, and the Cowboys, who are finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like to me,'' Ismail said, ``that they believe.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a blunt and brief response from Ismail, but it was
luminous. The eight remaining playoff teams show a reservoir of
confidence, exhibit attitude and, apparently most important,
believe.
</P>
<P>
   Believe in their schemes. Believe in their teammates and
coaches, in their own abilities. And, utmost, that they will win.
</P>
<P>
   Miami exhibited that kind of courage in Seattle. Jacksonville
must believe because it has the best record (14-2) in pro football.
Washington is developing inner strength. Indianapolis has been
consistent. With the rookie Shaun King at quarterback, Tampa Bay
exudes confidence.
</P>
<P>
   So does its coach, Tony Dungy.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Tampa Bay lost its starting quarterback, Trent
Dilfer, to injury and replaced him with King, Dungy said he ``just
had a belief, a special feeling about this team and the way this
season is going to play out. This really could be our year.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it before King went 4-1 as the starter and helped lead
the Buccaneers to a division crown. Dungy and his team still firmly
believe in their chances to win it all. It makes them more
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Three playoff teams, however, display extraordinary confidence:
Tennessee, St. Louis and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee went 8-8 in each of the three previous seasons. Now it
is 14-3 and is riding that miracle finish against Buffalo on
Saturday. The Titans' last-second victory, created by a magical
lateral on a kickoff return that was turned into a touchdown, gives
them a feeling of destiny. When Tennessee plays at Indianapolis on
Sunday, the Colts must match the Titans' overwhelming confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have something like that happen and not believe that
more is in store,'' Tennessee running back Eddie George said. ``We
plan on riding it a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis led the league in points scored (526). That is an
especially important achievement in the National Football League
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think back to our Super Bowl teams,'' Dallas cornerback
Kevin Smith said, ``maybe some of the things that happened to us
this season happened before. We dropped a pass here and there. We
missed a tackle. We'd lose momentum. But I think the difference was
we would still score 30 points a game. So, some of the other stuff
didn't matter. Scoring points puts pressure on a team. When you
don't, and you're struggling, every mistake sticks out.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis plays aggressive, attacking offensive football. It
gains quick starts. The Rams' confidence increases at home, where
they are unbeaten and where the artificial surface and good weather
ensured by their dome complements their speed. The Rams' offense
believes it can score 30 points against any defense.
</P>
<P>
   But Minnesota is beginning to show similar characteristics. It
is 9-2 in its last 11 games. It is the only playoff team with a
four-game wining streak. It plays at St. Louis on Sunday in a
matchup of the two most powerful, balanced and confident teams left
in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were struggling early in the year, that was
accompanied by bad luck,'' Vikings Coach Dennis Green said.
``Catches we should make, we dropped. Kicks we should make, we
missed. But then we got in a groove and evolved and found out some
of the things we do best and made changes. We went to a fullback in
the backfield. We stopped playing so much zone defense and went to
more man coverage. Our players liked that. They believed in those
styles. They hit the field now with confidence and swagger.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff George, the Vikings' quarterback, said: ``Guys believe in
each other no matter what the score is. We believe in ourselves so
much that we feel we can strike at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota talks that talk; it is beginning to show the attitude
of a confident team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are a lot different than they were last year,'' Vikings
offensive tackle Todd Steussie said. ``We have a lot of poise as a
team. Things change during the game and we have the ability to
change with it. St. Louis is going to be a great opportunity. They
were probably sitting on their couch watching us. They have to be
wondering because we are playing well right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams shaking? Probably not. There is no fear among the final
eight.
</P>
<P>
   Only a real and tangible belief that victory _ and Super Bowl
XXXIV _ is attainable and near.
</P>

JOHNSON GROOMING WANNSTEDT AS NEXT COACH OF DOLPHINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ After Coach Jimmy Johnson of the Miami Dolphins
ended his news conference Monday, he headed to his office to change
into jogging attire. It was close to 1 p.m., barely seven hours
after the Dolphins had returned from Sunday's playoff victory over
the Seahawks in Seattle. Waiting for him were his assistant coach,
Dave Wannstedt, and the trainer, Kevin O'Neill. Off they went for
an hour, jogging, walking some, but mostly talking football.
</P>
<P>
   For Johnson and Wannstedt, this almost daily routine is where
the Herschel Walker megatrade with Minnesota was hatched that
helped catapult the Dallas Cowboys into becoming a Super Bowl
regular in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Monday it was where they
exchanged more thoughts on how to approach Saturday's American
Football Conference division game against the Jacksonville Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Johnson and Wannstedt agreed that a simplified
offense, combined with an aggressive defense, was the right
approach to nullify the Seahawks' crowd noise advantage at the
Kingdome. It could not have worked better. The offense was patient,
rushing the ball 37 times for 108 yards and committing no turnovers
in a 20-17 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad thing is,'' Wannstedt said with a wry smile, ``the
game plan we used against Seattle was probably a game plan that we
talked about in 1979 at Oklahoma State when we were getting ready
to play Missouri. When you think of a Jimmy Johnson team, you think
of running the ball, throwing it when you want to, playing great
defense and making some plays in the kicking game. And that's what
we did.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Dolphins, as he has been for much of their nearly
25-year relationship, Wannstedt is Johnson's best friend in
football, his trusted confidant. This season, his first here under
Johnson, he is almost a clone of the head coach. Almost everything
Johnson does, Wannstedt does, too. And in Johnson's absence, he is
the man. Moreover, should Johnson resign at season's end, Wannstedt
is the likely successor, particularly if Johnson becomes general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Their feeling for each other runs much deeper than another once
celebrated coaching tandem, the Jets' Bill Parcells and Bill
Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave gives me ideas,'' Johnson said Monday. ``A lot of times
he'll bring up something, like, is this how you want to do it? Or,
remember in Dallas you did it this way? He sits in the offensive
meetings, the defensive meetings and the special teams meetings. I
do as well, but he does more of it. He ensures everybody's on the
same page.''
</P>
<P>
   Wannstedt's other role is to keep Johnson from the despair that
seems to overwhelm him when the Dolphins aren't going well, as was
the case after they slid from 8-2 to 9-7. In fact, it took the
hiring of Wannstedt to bring Johnson out of his one-day retirement
after last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'll be the devil's advocate,'' Wannstedt said,
``especially if he thinks people are discouraged because we lost a
couple of games in a row. It's my job to let him know that things
could be a lot worse, that we can still achieve our goals. He needs
to hear it like we all do. Because of our relationship, he'll
listen. So sometimes I'm kind of a neutralizer.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Wannstedt is being groomed by Johnson as the next
Dolphins coach. From his first day on the job, Johnson has allowed
him to participate in every facet of the organization, including
salary cap meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know each other so well that there's never a concern on my
part that I'm going to say something that he might not believe in
or that might step on his toes,'' Wannstedt said. ``Because of our
friendship off the field, it's a really workable situation. Could
it work for two guys who didn't know each other? No. I think it
would take two other people a couple of years' trial period before
they knew each other's strengths and weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Wannstedt spent six seasons as head coach of the Chicago Bears,
going 41-57, including 1-1 in the playoffs, before being fired. He
said he turned down ``four or five other coaching opportunities''
to join Miami, where he thinks the organization is in place to
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   He is following a blueprint similar to that of Mike Shanahan.
Fired as head coach at Oakland, Shanahan was effective as an
assistant at San Francisco before becoming a successful head coach
at Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing that got me trapped in Chicago was that we
went through three personnel directors in six years and six
different starting quarterbacks in six years,'' Wannstedt said.
``You have to have stability at the quarterback position, because
that guy's going to make more decisions and have more impact on the
game than anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not have control of the draft or trades in Chicago but
realizes now that people do not particularly care why he lost.
``All you're judged by is wins and losses,'' he said. ``So if you
don't have control of those things, you better make sure you have
good people around you. I think my time will come again, and I'll
be ready when it does.'' &QL;

POLICE UNDERMINE CREDIBILITY WHEN SEIZED DRUG MONEY IS KEPT, REPORT
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN DILLION  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   JEFFERSON CITY _ Police in Missouri are
ignoring a state law that in most cases requires drug money they
seize to be sent to public education, according to a report that
will be submitted to the General Assembly today.
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Monday a joint committee that has studied the problem for
several months adopted the report, which said police were damaging
their own credibility as well as possibly depriving schools _ and
taxpayers _ of money.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which recommends several changes in the law, follows
one in October by State Auditor Claire McCaskill. She found that
flaws and gray areas allowed law enforcement agencies to circumvent
state statutes when they seized drug money.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state constitution and state law, drug money that
police seized would normally go to public education.
</P>
<P>
   Police must report the seized money to county prosecutors, and
the money is to be handled by state courts, which in most cases
would send it on for schools. Under some circumstances a judge may
transfer the money to a federal law enforcement agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Star reported last January that in many cases
involving millions of dollars police simply gave seized money to
federal agencies, which kept part and returned the rest, usually 80
percent, to police.
</P>
<P>
   Following The Star's stories, several reform bills were proposed
in the legislature, which appointed the joint committee to study
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Harry Wiggins, a Kansas City Democrat and co-chairman of
the committee, said Monday that he would introduce a bill Thursday
based on the recommendations in the report.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Kreider, a Nixa Democrat and committee co-chairman,
said he would introduce a similar bill in the House next Tuesday.
Some police officials have said their departments need the seized
money to continue enforcing drug laws.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the committee was sympathetic to both law
enforcement's and education's need for the money, but money was not
the focus of the report.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's ``overriding concern is the apparent neglect of
the state constitutional mandate,'' the report said. ``The failure
to follow this clear directive has created an environment in which
the credibility of law enforcement is questioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moreover, in bypassing the required judicial approval to
transfer the property to the federal system, it is possible that
schools in the state, and ultimately taxpayers, are being deprived
of the proceeds from some of these forfeitures.''
</P>
<P>
   The report recommends that the legislature:
</P>
<P>
   - Define when police seize drug money or property.
</P>
<P>
   - Enact strict reporting requirements for both police and
prosecuting attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   - Put in place a penalty when police do not follow the law. The
committee said the type of penalty was still to be debated.
</P>
<P>
   - Require a state circuit judge to review how any drug money
seized by state or local law enforcement is disposed of, even if a
federal agency initiated the case. ``This provision would require
that Missouri retain jurisdiction over any property seized in the
state, and that federal agents obtain judicial review in a Missouri
court before the property could be transferred to federal
authorities,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the committee accepted the report unanimously, Wiggins
and Kreider acknowledged that the report would probably be met with
controversy because some lawmakers were likely to back law
enforcement's desire to keep the money.
</P>
<P>
   The committee agreed that one of the most critical
recommendations was defining when a seizure took place.
</P>
<P>
   Police have argued that they are not violating state law,
because when they find drug money they are not actually seizing it
_ they are only detaining it until a federal law enforcement
officer can officially seize it and take it into custody.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts have scoffed at that explanation, and the report,
too, was critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``At its worst, such behavior has been characterized as a
`game,' &UR; '' according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommends a seizure be defined as the point when a
law enforcement officer ``discovers and exercises any control'''
over property believed to have been used in a crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will keep (law enforcement) from this Mickey Mouse sort of
thing,'' said Sen. Larry Rohrbach, a California, Mo., Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Another important step would be the reporting requirement,
lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommends police and prosecutors submit detailed
reports of the money that is seized and forfeited to the state
auditor. Each year the auditor would issue a report to the General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Although some reporting already is required by state law, it has
been spotty at best. Some law enforcement agencies refused to give
the state auditor seizure records last year.
</P>
<P>
   No penalty was included for not filing a report, but the
committee amended the report to include the need for either a civil
or a criminal penalty, to be decided upon later. Currently there is
no penalty when police do not follow state law.
</P>
<P>
   ``A law is no better than your ability to enforce it,'' Kreider
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two other bills addressing the problem have been filed by
legislators who are not on the committee. One bill, which also
defines a seizure, has been introduced by Sen. Wayne Goode, a St.
Louis Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   A bill filed by Rep. Craig Hosmer, a Springfield, Mo., Democrat,
would split the proceeds of drug money between schools and law
enforcement. The same bill was introduced last year but failed.

JUDGE UPHOLDS STRICT JAIL CONDITIONS FOR SUSPECT IN BIN LADEN
CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge in Manhattan ruled Monday that the
highly restrictive jail conditions placed on one of the defendants
in the investigation of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile charged in
the embassy bombings in Africa in 1998, were not a violation of the
inmate's rights.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Judge Leonard B. Sand of U.S. District Court
urged jail authorities to allow the defendant, Wadih el-Hage, more
time on the telephone with his family, provide him with a plastic
chair to sit on and reduce the number of times he must endure strip
searches.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came after el-Hage's lawyers filed a broad attack on
the conditions under which el-Hage, like other defendants in the
case, has been held since his arrest in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He was placed in solitary confinement, banned from communicating
with all outsiders, except for an occasional phone call to his
family and meetings with his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Although prosecutors have not charged el-Hage with a direct role
in the August 1998 embassy bombings, which killed more than 200
people and injured thousands, they have accused him of conspiring
with bin Laden in a global conspiracy to kill Americans abroad.
</P>
<P>
   They say he was a close aide to bin Laden, and carried coded
messages between him and other conspirators.
</P>
<P>
   El-Hage's lawyers, Sam A. Schmidt and Joshua L. Dratel, said
after court that they would appeal the judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   They contended that the government had failed to show that
el-Hage was a danger to the public or to national security.
</P>
<P>
   In court, a federal prosecutor, Patrick J. Fitzgerald, argued
that the authorities believed el-Hage remains extremely dangerous,
in part because as a defendant, he is aware of the extent of the
government's evidence against him and against other fugitives who
remain at large.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald also suggested that the government might have more
evidence tying el-Hage to the embassy attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Citing legal papers that remain under seal, Fitzgerald said
el-Hage traveled from Afghanistan to Kenya in 1997, bringing ``a
new policy'' of militarization to bin Laden's cell of operatives
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear that after this policy was brought back,''
Fitzgerald said, ``the Kenyan cell did militarize, and the results
were the bombings of 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   In seeking a relaxation of the jail conditions, el-Hage's
lawyers had submitted a report of a Harvard Medical School
psychiatrist who specializes in the effects of solitary
confinement.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor, Stuart Grassian, had concluded that el-Hage's
imprisonment was so psychologically damaging that he might not be
able to assist meaningfully in his own defense.
</P>
<P>
   Sand continued to express concerns Monday about the jail
conditions, particularly because of their duration.
</P>
<P>
   But he made clear that he had been convinced that curtailing
el-Hage's freedoms to communicate and move around were justified.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he would continue to monitor the situation.
</P>
<P>
   El-Hage was recently given a cellmate, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim,
another of the defendants in the case. But el-Hage's lawyers
suggested that their client was still unhappy because his cell had
become too crowded.

MRS. CLINTON ASSAILS GIULIANI ON SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ Seizing on the battle over finding a new
schools chancellor for New York City, Hillary Rodham Clinton
denounced Monday what she described as the instability of the
schools system and suggested that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's
struggles with school leaders had undermined public education.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is distressing to see that we're now on our third
chancellor, when what a major school system needs is continuity and
commitment and somebody who can bring people to the table to make
the reforms that are necessary,'' Mrs. Clinton said at a news
conference here in Westchester, her new home county.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's comments highlighted what her aides said she
would like to be a major issue in her expected campaign for the
Senate against Giuliani. Mrs. Clinton said she conceptually
supported direct mayoral control over municipal school systems, a
position that Giuliani has long espoused for New York, but she
expressed reservations about whether that could work with Giuliani
in charge. She asserted that any hopes of changing school
governance in New York had been obstructed by political fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you get the reforms that are necessary through a
confrontational, finger-pointing style,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``I
think you have to make hard decisions, but you have to move people
toward some common goals and people have to believe what the
leaders are talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's campaign manager, Bruce J. Teitelbaum, dismissed Mrs.
Clinton's attacks, noting that Giuliani had long urged the state
legislature to abolish the board of education and give him direct
control over the school system.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Mrs. Clinton said she supported full
domestic partnership benefits for same-sex couples, but that she
opposed gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marriage has a historic, religious and moral context that goes
back to the beginning of time,'' she said. ``And I think a marriage
has always been between a man and a woman.''

HEARING COULD SETTLE BELICHICK DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Trying for a quick resolution to the contract dispute
between the New York Jets and Bill Belichick, their head coach for
less than 24 hours before resigning last week, the National
Football League invited both sides Monday to a hearing on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   So the events that have roiled the team the past week could be
settled quickly: the team's new head coach could be appointed soon
after the Jets' ownership is decided Tuesday, and in turn those
moves could spur a settlement of the Belichick dispute.
</P>
<P>
   An indication of the immediacy of the situation is that the Jets
responded over the weekend to Belichick's contention to the league
that the contract he signed to succeed Bill Parcells as head coach
is invalid and that he is free to coach for any team. Belichick's
lawyer, Neil Cornrich of Cleveland, immediately countered that
response, paving the way for Thursday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The league, which invited Cornrich and the Jets' president,
Steve Gutman, to the meeting, will hold another hearing Friday if
no decision has been made on the contract or if no deal is struck
between the sides.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the New England Patriots will not attend the
meeting, although they have said they want to interview Belichick
for the dual role of coach and general manager. The hearing is only
to decide the validity of Belichick's contract with the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick has three years left on the six-year contract, which
the Jets say was updated as recently as 10 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   If Commissioner Paul Tagliabue rules, as he has previously, that
the Jets' contract is valid, then the Jets and Patriots are certain
to try to make a deal that will allow Belichick to join New
England. That would most likely call for New England to send draft
choices to the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick quit last Tuesday, one day after the Jets had
announced that he would succeed Parcells. In a teary farewell to
the troops in announcing his retirement, the 58-year-old Parcells
said he had coached his last game, that he could not summon the
365-days-a-year energy the position demanded and that he would
concentrate on being the team's director of football operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are believed to be contemplating demanding the same
number of draft picks they yielded to land Parcells from the New
England coaching job three years ago. That package consisted of
third- and fourth-round picks in 1997, a second-round pick in 1998
and a first-round pick in this past draft. This year the Jets
choose 18th in the draft, while New England picks 16th.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots will contend that Belichick's resume is not as
impressive as Parcells', which includes three Super Bowl
appearances. Belichick was 36-44 in five seasons as head coach of
the Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   For now, speculation will continue on whether Parcells will
return to coach. Most people on the Jets _ few will speak on the
record _ believe the only way the team can remain intact is for
Parcells to return or for his most experienced assistant, Al Groh,
to become the head coach. Groh was his defensive coordinator for
four years at New England and has been the Jets' linebacker coach
during the three-year Parcells reign.
</P>
<P>
   But several members of the Jets' family expressed concern Monday
about the possible breakup of the coaching staff if this did not
happen. Romeo Crennel, the longtime defensive line coach, will
interview for the Browns' coordinator's job. And Mo Carthon, the
Jets' running backs coach, is looking into the Browns' offensive
coordinator post.

   &QL; 
``NAT KING COLE'' &QL; 
By Daniel Mark Epstein (FSG, $27) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `The kid was wearing a light green gabardine suit that draped
his long, slender frame so loosely it looked like the first
high-note blast of a trumpet might blow his coat off.'' Nat Cole
was 16 then, shy but bold enough to know how good he was. It's this
image of the young Cole in 1935, about to go up against Earl Hines
in the ``Battle of Rhythm'' in Chicago's Savoy Ballroom that begins
Epstein's biography. Cole died of cancer when he was 45, yet his
story is rich enough for several lives. There were his formative
years in Chicago as what Epstein calls ``a kitten on the keys.''
There were his marriages and infidelities, bad business decisions,
and troubles with the IRS. There was the racial tension that
buffeted his career (in 1956, he was attacked onstage by White
assailants during a performance in Birmingham, Ala.). And there
were Cole's affability and pragmatism, which helped him skirt
racial politics, court a White audience, and make an amazing
crossover from jazz to popular (and frequently schlocky) music.
Epstein creates an engaging portrait of this romantic figure in
American music. &QL;

<P>
   ``IN THE GLOAMING'' &QL; 
By Alice Elliott Dark (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $23) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In ``Triage,'' a mother and her adult daughter pursue an uneasy
truce as they jockey for position in each other's lives. In ``The
Tower,'' an aging bachelor falls for a young woman whose background
hints at a very unpleasant surprise. In ``Dreadful Language,'' a
woman moves through youthful rebellion to true love and on to
sorrow and resignation. But the big draw in this story collection
is the title piece, which was published in ``The New Yorker'' in
1994, made into a HBO film starring Glenn Close, and chosen by John
Updike for ``The Best American Short Stories of the Century.'' ``In
the Gloaming'' is a story about conversations _ they take place
always at twilight, the time called ``the gloaming'' _ between a
woman and her 33-year-old son, who is dying of AIDS. With austere
precision, Dark charts the mother's heart as she comes to know both
her son and herself and as she begins to understand that these
daily talks are her dying child's way of returning her love to her.
It's a wonderful story _ moving, understated and as true as the
emotional secrets it unveils.

   ``100 BEST ALBUM COVERS: THE STORIES BEHIND THE SLEEVES'' &QL; 
By Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell (DK, $19.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``At 4 a.m. every morning for a week, three adults and two
children were sprayed silver and gold from head to toe and driven
from the hotel to the location to await a glorious sunrise that
never happened,'' write Thorgerson and Powell. It rained, it was
cold, it was boring, and after the makeup ran out, they had to use
car paint, which they removed with turpentine. In the end, the
adult models were dumped (they used just the naked children, a
brother and sister who had already appeared nude in a Japanese
version of ``Alice in Wonderland'') and the sunrise was faked, but
the album cover for Led Zeppelin's ``Houses of the Holy'' is
memorable enough to appear here, a full 26 years later. Also
included are the stories behind the covers for Santana's
``Abraxas,'' the Grateful Dead's ``Aoxomoxoa,'' Big Brother &AMP; the
Holding Company's ``Cheap Thrills'' and John Lennon and Yoko Ono's
``Two Virgins'' and many more.

   &QL; 
``FLU'' &QL; 
By Gina Kolata (FSG, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The flu of 1918 came in two waves. The first showed up in the
spring, bringing its victims chills and fevers but rarely lasting
more than three days. It was, Kolata writes, ``banal, and easily
forgotten.'' In September, however, it came back with a vengeance,
and this time it was a killer that altered countless lives.
Children were orphaned, families were destroyed. Thousands of
people die horribly. More than 25 percent of the United States
population became ill, and between 20 million and 100 million
people died worldwide. If a similar plague were to strike today, it
would kill more people in a single year than heart disease,
cancers, strokes, pulmonary disease, AIDS and Alzheimer's disease
combined. But is this possible? Are authorities prepared to fight
the outbreak of another virus with such mysterious and deadly
power? Kolata, a science writer for the ``New York Times,'' looks
at the history of the 1918 flu and at the lessons it offers for
averting a similar disaster today. It's fascinating but sobering
reading _ if you feel a chill coming on, save it for another day.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. _ The United States said Monday that it
would reconvene the Israeli-Syrian peace talks on Jan. 19 to avoid
losing the momentum built up in the eight days of talks that ended
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the United States, which is acting as mediator
in the talks, reflected an upbeat sense that some progress was
made, and the fear that a longer recess would let opponents of a
peace accord in both countries undermine the progress.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving here, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and
Farouk al-Sharaa, the Syrian foreign minister, agreed to return to
the next round. It is unclear whether the talks will resume at
Shepherdstown or somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that to preserve whatever's happened, they couldn't go
home for long,'' one American official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered to oppose
the return of the Golan Heights to Syria, the linchpin of any peace
deal.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators' return next week will coincide with a visit to
Washington by Yasser Arafat, the leader of the Palestinian
Authority, and it seems likely that he will meet together with
Barak and Clinton. Israel and the Palestinians are moving toward a
September deadline for a final peace treaty of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, did his best
Monday to put a positive spin on what clearly was a frustrating
week as President Clinton came here five times to coax the two
sides along. The major accomplishment of the week was the
acceptance by both sides of an American-drafted ``working paper''
defining the issues that remain to be resolved but laid out no new
proposals for resolving the most difficult issues. American
officials said such proposals would be counterproductive if offered
too early.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin insisted that the diplomatic talk here ``lays the
groundwork to bridge the important gaps that remain.''
</P>
<P>
   The outstanding disputes include a new border between the two
countries _ including access to water in the Sea of Galilee and
other sources _ and the form of a normalized diplomatic and
economic relationship between two nations that have been in a state
of war for half a century.
</P>
<P>
   It was a measure of the slow progress that a committee of
Syrian, Israeli, and American officials created to discuss the
border issues met only once in eight days here, and then only for
an hour and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian officials emerged complaining that the Israelis have been
vague and noncommittal. Israeli negotiators said they had to be
vague because they had not made any progress on the security
questions _ the quid pro quo for the return of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   The issues of borders and water access have been a source of
constant contention in the talks that Clinton and Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright held alternatively with the Israelis and
Syrians.
</P>
<P>
   Israel wants a border that would at least roughly align with the
1923 demarcation of Palestine, people familiar with the
negotiations said. But Syria has long wanted to return to the
border that existed before the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. The choice
will determine whether Syria has access to the Sea of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the week, Syria argued that the borders had to be
settled before any security issues could be discussed, and Israel
argued that it could not sell any return of the Golan to its people
until security arrangements were resolved.
</P>
<P>
   One official familiar with the talks said al-Sharaa was more
amenable in discussions with Clinton, but would ``vent'' when alone
with Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who was dining with and then cajoling Barak and
al-Sharaa here until nearly 1 a.m. Monday, said later in the day:
``We are on a track in which the Israelis, the Syrians, I hope soon
the Lebanese, and already the Palestinians, have committed
themselves to work through these very difficult, longstanding
issues over the course of the next two months _ the longstanding
commitment between the Palestinians and the Israelis to resolve
their business by next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``So this will be a time of great tension,'' he added, ``where
all people will have to search for wisdom and understanding, where
there will be great reluctance to open the closed fist and walk out
into a new era.''
</P>
<P>
   While both sides and a number of Mideast analysts were arguing
whether the week amounted to success, failure or something in
between, the fact is that this round of talks ended just about
where American diplomats predicted it would when they began on Jan.
3.
</P>
<P>
   The first round of talks was chiefly about posturing for
constituencies back in Israel and Syria, where every rumor about
whether Barak and al-Sharaa had shaken hands was treated as
front-page news.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said Monday that they hadn't actually shaken hands, but
they had joked together in the gymnasium of the Clarion Hotel and
conference center here. Observing a Syrian negotiator running on a
treadmill, Barak reportedly told al-Sharaa that, like the talks,
she was ``headed in the right direction but not getting anywhere.''
One of the leaders _ it is not clear who _ then apparently spoke of
how her run was ``the beginning of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear where the next round of negotiations will take
place. It may return here to Shepherdstown, where the negotiators
were locked away at the Clarion for a week. But the town's largest
institution, Shepherd College, will be back in session, and it is
unclear whether the talks can take place without disrupting the
school.
</P>
<P>
   Barak promised during his campaign last year that any peace
treaty with Syria would be put to a national referendum. It is far
too early to tell whether that referendum would pass, because Barak
cannot present to the Israeli public a security agreement _
involving Syrian troop pullbacks and enhanced defense cooperation
from the United States _ before one is negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   But the tens of thousands who demonstrated in Tel Aviv on Monday
against any return of the Golan are evidence of the size of the
political challenge ahead for Barak's government. And it explains
why the pace of the talks here was so slow: The prime minister
could ill afford appearing too eager to give back the land that
Israel has long said is the critical buffer zone for its security.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrians do not have the problems of a referendum, but a
political and economic challenge that is no less daunting. While
Syrian President Hafez Assad sees a chance to regain by negotiation
a territory he cannot hope to regain by force, Syria clearly fears
that too much integration with Israel and the West could undercut
his iron control over the country _ and his hopes that his son will
succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   If economics controlled the outcome, there is little question a
deal would come together.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's gross domestic product in 1998 amounted to $15 billion.
That is a less than a sixth of the size of Israel's economy, and
Israel has 6 million people to Syria's 15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, the value of Syria's economy is about one-25th
of the value of the merger agreement announced Monday between
America Online and Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   All that suggests that Assad, by focusing on power and border
conflicts, has missed out on developing a vibrant economy. That
puts a new pressure on the Syrians: Foreign investors, among them
Americans, Europeans and perhaps Israelis, will only come to Syria
after a cold peace, at least, is in place.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The America Online-Time Warner merger represents not only the
triumph of the Internet as the irresistible force in business, but
a vision of the Internet as a mass-marketed, middle-of-the-road
medium for Main Street Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Though top executives of both companies presented the deal as a
``merger of equals,'' it was in fact a victory for Stephen Case,
the 41-year-old billionaire who built America Online from a
fledgling dial-up service in the mid-'80s to an Internet powerhouse
able to acquire the world's largest media company.
</P>
<P>
   ``America Online is clearly dominant,'' said David Readerman,
managing director of Thomas Weisel Partners, an investment firm in
San Francisco. ``The nerds have won. This deal really validates the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more so, it would appear to validate AOL, which had long
been derided by techies as a lowbrow medium. They called it
``training wheels for the Internet,'' suggesting it was not the
real thing.
</P>
<P>
   But Case, who once developed new pizza offerings for Pizza Hut,
always held his ground. He insisted the online business was less
about technology than about consumer marketing. His vision has
proved to be on target so far, making America Online by far the
biggest online service, with 20 million subscribers. Just where the
combined AOL-Time Warner is headed is difficult to predict, but the
emphasis is certain to be the same _ stressing a mass-market
consumer service that Main Street Americans find attractive, and
hiding the nerdy technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about technology, it's about making this a mass
medium and becoming part of the everyday habits of ordinary
consumers,'' Case said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The measure of America Online's rapid rise and its current
stature was evident on Wall Street Monday. A few years ago, it was
thought that America Online might indeed merge with a media
company. Disney or Time Warner, it was said, might buy America
Online, which was then seen as a promising upstart. But Monday it
was the shares of Time Warner, one of the world's leading media
companies, with its storied legacy going back to Henry Luce, that
leaped in celebration, like some neglected waif rescued by a
wealthy benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept that something profound is happening in the Internet
space _ I believe that,'' said Gerald Levin, chairman of Time
Warner. ``The new media stock-market valuations are real, not in
every case, of course. But what AOL has done is get first position
in this new world. Its valuation is real, and I am attesting to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the America Online-Time Warner deal is more than a striking
testimonial to the Internet as mainstream media. The proposed
merger is also a big gamble for both companies, as well as an
admission by both that they need each other.
</P>
<P>
   America Online's weakness is the lack of access to high-speed
Internet services over television cables, which rivals AT&AMP;T and
Microsoft have. Once in place, these high-speed, or broadband,
networks _ provided over upgraded cable or phone lines _ open the
door to the digital distribution of new services for interactive
entertainment, information and electronic commerce, via everything
from desktop computers to hand-held devices to television sets.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner, with its vast cable networks serving more than 13
million subscribers, gives America Online assured access to the
high-speed networks required for these new mass-market Internet
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest threat to AOL over the next three years was
getting locked out of broadband,'' said David B. Yoffie, a
professor at the Harvard Business School. ``And this deal certainly
helps solve that problem.''

 UNDATED: that problem.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But that solution, by joining its fate with Time Warner, could
come at a high cost for America Online. The online leader has been
a favorite on Wall Street because it is seen as a fast-growing
Internet company. Now, however, it is melding its business with a
slower-growing, though far larger, media company whose properties
range from Time magazine to CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a prayer that the combined company can grow at
anything like AOL's historical rates of growth,'' Yoffie said.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting that concern, America Online's stock price slipped a
bit Monday, closing down $2.1875 to $71.25 a share, while Time
Warner's shares jumped $25.25, to $90.
</P>
<P>
   Case of America Online said that he expected the far higher
valuations given to Internet companies than to media companies to
decline. But he held that view, he explained, not because he
thought investors had bid up Internet shares to outlandish heights,
but more because traditional media would be revived if they got
their Internet strategies right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional media assets have a vibrant future if they can be
catapulted into the Internet Age,'' Case said.
</P>
<P>
   By linking with Time Warner, Case is also betting that there
will be an advantage to owning those media brands, not just
distributing them through the America Online service. As the
Internet expands beyond the personal computer as the main way to
get online _ with people increasingly tapping into the Internet by
phones, television and handheld devices _ Case says consumers will
want an easy-to-use service that works on all those machines.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, in short, wants to be a one-stop service for the
Internet of the future. ``We don't want AOL to be a place people go
through to get someplace else,'' Case said. ``We want to be able to
create an integrated consumer space. That's why, ultimately, the
ownership of media brands will be important.''
</P>
<P>
   For Time Warner, the deal with America Online is seen as a fast
track to the Internet _ ``the digital transformation of Time
Warner,'' in Levin's terms. Time Warner had tried to make that
transformation on its own, and struggled badly at times. A World
Wide Web site, called Pathfinder, that offered the online versions
of most Time Warner magazines, for example, was abandoned after
years and millions of dollars in losses. Each publication,
including Time, Fortune, People, Sports Illustrated and
Entertainment Weekly, has its own site now.
</P>
<P>
   And Road Runner, the company's high-speed Internet service, has
more than 320,000 customers. But it has not grown as rapidly as
Time Warner had hoped and it is certainly not the online brand that
America Online is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Warner sees all its media properties going to the
Internet, movies, television, print and music, which is already
well on its way,'' said Harold Vogel, who heads a New York media
investment firm and is an adjunct professor of media economics at
Columbia University's business school. ``And the company has been
frustrated in not being able to exploit its cable and media assets
more effectively in the Internet arena.''
</P>
<P>
   The people behind the merger _ perhaps even more than the
strategy _ will determine whether the combination works. At the New
York press conference Monday, there was no shortage of smiles and
back-slapping and much warm talk of the ``shared vision'' of the
top executives of America Online and Time Warner. Levin went out of
his way to look informal, wearing a sport coat and no tie, while
Case, renowned for his khakis (once appearing in a Gap ad) and
rarely donning a coat, went out of his way to look formal, wearing
a suit.
</P>
<P>
   But the blunt-spoken Ted Turner, who is Time Warner's largest
shareholder with 100 million shares, acknowledged a key issue in
all larger mergers. Turner said the two executives' teams were
filled with ``strong personalities'' and that meant there was
``potential for some friction,'' though he said he did not expect
personality clashes to slow down the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders were even more skeptical. ``Sorting out these
businesses is going to be a task of monumental proportions,'' said
Yoffie, the Harvard professor.
</P>
<P>
   That chore, apparently, will fall mostly on the shoulders of
Levin, who will be chief executive of the combined company, and who
is a more seasoned manager than Case. ``I'll focus on the things
I'm best at _ strategy, technology, policy and running the board,''
Case said. ``Gerry will run the company.''

   In the first official visit of an Iranian official to Britain

   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. _ At first, the six Republican presidential
candidates seemed intent on debating a subject they had been
arguing over for days: tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But 15 minutes into Monday night's debate, several candidates
conceded they were broadly in agreement on the topic. And suddenly,
what had been expected to be a lengthy, detailed debate over
taxation splintered into a lively exchange on foreign policy and
free trade _ two topics that had been overshadowed by religion,
taxes, and morality in the five previous GOP debates.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the primary debates began, Governor
George W. Bush of Texas took a strong stand on the economic
isolation of Cuba. Condemning advocates of trade with Cuba as
``wrong-headed,'' Bush said he did not believe there was any point
in encouraging capitalism in Cuba. Such a policy, he said, would
only be ``used by the Fidel Castro government to pump itself up.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain of Arizona flashed his foreign policy
background following a question about the December hijacking of an
India Airways jetliner. After saying he ``never'' negotiate with
hijackers as president of the United States, McCain waded into the
intricacies of Indian-Pakistani relations that had made the
hijacking so perilous.
</P>
<P>
   All six candidates were asked their opinions of an
administration plan to help fight AIDS in Africa with $150 million
in assistance. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah said he agreed with the
plan, and Bush, McCain, and Steve Forbes said they favored helping,
but only with guarantees that the money would actually go to the
people in need, not to corrupt governments.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third Republican debate in five days, this time set
at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Mich., where the Feb. 22 primary
will be the third presidential campaign test in the nation and the
first in the Midwest. Michigan _ the eighth-largest state and home
to a stubbornly independent constituency _ could prove critical if
McCain thrives in the three previous contests, in Iowa, New
Hampshire, and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike New Hampshire, where McCain is running even with or ahead
of Bush in the polls, Michigan is considered a Bush stronghold.
Governor John Engler, a Republican, has endorsed the Texas
governor, as have US Senator Spencer Abraham and five of the
state's congressmen.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush considered the state enough of a wild card to consent
to participate in Monday night's debate, which he had initially
planned to skip. And Peter Secchia, a Michigan native who served
four years in President Bush's administration and is supporting his
son, admitted, ``Anybody who expects it to be a runaway race is
going to be surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute debate wandered around an array of familiar
questions, from on-line pornography to gays in the military to
whether states should be allowed to tax the Internet. Alan Keyes
repeated his vow to abolish the federal income tax. Gary Bauer
earned the debate's first round of applause with a rousing repeat
of his campaign platform: restoring conservative values to the GOP,
including outlawing abortion and condemning homosexual
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   At other times, the candidates faced questions out of the news
headlines _ their thoughts on Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban
boy at the center of an international custody dispute, for example.
Bush, former owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team, was at one
point asked to address the case of John Rocker, the Atlanta Braves
pitcher ordered by Major League Baseball to undergo psychological
counseling after he made offensive remarks about minorities and
gays. Bush responded by criticizing a culture of athletes ``who
aren't responsible for their behavior.'' Minutes later, in a
populist nod, Bush challenged a statement by Harvard Law School
Professor Paul Weiler that there was no free speech in the private
sector. ``Consider the source,'' said Bush, a Harvard Business
School graduate.
</P>
<P>
   The debate began, however, with taxes. McCain, who is scheduled
to announce a $240 billion tax cut plan Tuesday in Concord, N.H.,
said he is in favor of reductions for middle- and low-income
Americans, and using the budget surplus to shore up Social Security
and pay down the $5.6 trillion national debt. His plan would
encourage savings, and would put more people in a lower tax bracket
with a lower tax rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure we need to give two-thirds of that tax cut . . .
to the wealthiest people in America,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said he thinks ``everybody should get a tax cut.''
Earlier in the day, Bush, upon hearing McCain's intention to
release a new tax plan, stole a line from the TV quiz show ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' with a sarcastic quip: ``Senator, is
this your final tax plan?''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, asked about whether he supported software to filter
pornography from the Internet, said he supported the idea despite
concerns of free speech advocates that it could violate the First
Amendment. But he quickly changed the subject to the only one that
seemed important in the early minutes of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't one of us here who is isn't going to try to reduce
taxes,'' Hatch snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, also asked about pornography, said ``You know I have
strong feelings about taxes . . . I actually think the question
you're asking, at the end of the day, may be more important.'' He
said the country should ``find its voice on things like this . . .
or it won't matter how much we cut taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes came under fire when it came to taxes _ for his negative
advertisements in New Hampshire accusing Bush of betraying a ``no
new taxes'' pledge as Texas governor. McCain, when asked if he
would do the same, left the podium to shake Bush's hand and
promised not to go negative himself.
</P>
<P>
   Also, earlier in the day, McCain accepted an invitation from
Boston's WCVB-TV to participate in a series of debates among only
the front-runners leading up to the New Hampshire primary on Feb.
1. None of the other invitees _ Bush, Vice President Al Gore, and
former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley _ immediately agreed to the
challenge.

JUDGE GRANTS TEMPORARY GUARDIANSHIP OF CUBAN BOY TO RELATIVE IN
U.S. 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The fight to keep 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez in the
United States gained support Monday when a Florida judge granted
temporary guardianship to a great-uncle, setting the stage for a
showdown with the Justice Department over the Cuban boy's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Miami-Dade County Circuit Judge Rosa Rodriguez issued the order
so she can hear arguments filed by Elian's Miami relatives, who
want to prevent the boy from returning to Cuba. The order also
requires that Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to come from
Cuba and attend the evidentiary hearing set for March 6.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez issued a terse warning to Gonzalez, saying his failure
to appear or respond to the court order ``may result in a decision
adverse to his interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling that granted temporary guardianship to the boy's
great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, threw into question whether Elian
will be returned to Cuba and be reunited with his father as early
as Friday, the date set by Immigration and Naturalization Service
Commissioner Doris Meissner.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner announced the decision last week after INS officials
spoke with the boy's father in Cuba and determined he was the boy's
legal guardian.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department and INS attorneys said Monday they were
reviewing the court order and are expected to announce this week if
the deadline stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a response. We're just starting to review the
case,'' said Carole Floorman, Justice Department spokeswoman. ``At
this point we have not altered the deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   One question is whether the Florida state court has jurisdiction
in an immigration issue that has already been decided.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Bergeron, INS spokesman, said federal agencies and state
courts have distinct and separate jurisdictions, but added that INS
attorneys have not determined if the agency's federal jurisdiction
supersedes Monday's court order.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, Cuban community leaders in Miami basked in
the court decision, saying it was a victory in their efforts to
save the boy from what they called a dismal future in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is a great day for justice, a great day for the cause of
freedom not only for the exile community but for all Cubans in Cuba
who want the same freedoms that Fidel Castro has taken away from
them,'' said Jorge Mas Santos, head of the anti-Castro Cuban
American National Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I think the court has made a decision that this
community has wanted from day one _ Elian's right to due process.
Today we have that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that in Havana, thousands of
protesters demanding Elian's return fell silent Monday upon hearing
the announcement that the judge had ordered the boy to stay in the
United States until at least March.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan Perez, head of student group tied to the government,
called the ruling ``illegal and arbitrary.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the news was being announced in Miami late Monday
afternoon, thousands were already crowding around the U.S.
Interests Section on Havana's main coastal highway for the
pro-Elian rally announced in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the idea is absurd,'' Cuban protester Leonil Feliu
told the AP of the judge's ruling. ``What they are doing is
prolonging the process. They know at the end of the day that they
have to bring him to Cuba, all they are doing is lengthening the
inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no reaction from the Cuban government, which has
repeatedly urged citizens to stage mass protests pressing for
Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, the boy's father, said his ex-wife did not get his
permission to take Elian out of Cuba. With the backing of the Cuban
government, Gonzalez has demanded that his son be returned.
</P>
<P>
   In filing the petition, the boy's attorneys alleged that if
Elian is returned to Cuba he faces the threat of mistreatment or
abuse ``as well as harm to his physical and mental health and
emotional well-being.``
</P>
<P>
   Spencer Eig, one of the attorneys for the boy, said the court
order allows him to begin seeking political asylum for Elian. INS
officials, at the request of the boy's father, withdrew two
applications for asylum because they were filed on behalf of the
boy and his great-uncle, and neither had authority because one was
a minor and the other was not his legal guardian.
</P>
<P>
   After the court ruling, the boy's great-uncle emerged from the
courthouse pumping his fists in the air, saying he was pleased with
the judge's decision to grant him temporary custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always believed in the laws of this country,''
Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of the boy stirred deep emotions in Miami's Cuban
community from the moment he was rescued off the coast of Florida
clinging to an inner tube on Thanksgiving Day. The boy, his mother
and stepfather were among a group of Cubans aboard an ill-fated
boat bound for the United States. His mother and 10 others drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans in Miami view their efforts to keep the boy in the United
States as fulfilling his mother's wishes for a better life for her
son.
</P>
<P>
   After Meissner's announcement, the Cuban community staged a
series of protests resulting in clashes with police in riot gear in
the streets in and near Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   The protests stopped after attorneys for the boy filed a
petition Friday asking Rodriguez to grant Elian's great uncle
temporary emergency guardianship. Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., also
issued a subpoena for Elian to appear before the House Government
Reform Committee on Feb. 10 to testify on the INS decision.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, in an appearance Sunday on ABC-TV's ``This Week,'' said
he issued the subpoena to give lawyers time to argue Elian's case
in court and that he had not necessarily intended to have the boy
appear before the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Bergern, the INS spokesman, said Monday the agency was still
studying the subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't made a determination on what effect that has on our
decision,'' Bergeron said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Sanchez of the Cuban community's Democracy Movement in
Miami said Elian's father will receive a welcomed reception if he
comes to Miami and has nothing to fear.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``What we cannot understand is how a loving
father, a father who said he loves his son so much he's not even
wanting to come over here to get his son. What father, on the face
of the earth, wouldn't go anywhere in the world to get his son.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore questioned earlier Monday whether the INS
had the expertise to decide Elian's fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see the dispute adjudicated in our courts, where
traditionally questions like what is best for this child are
decided,'' Gore said in an interview on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show.
``This child's mother died in an effort to get her child's
freedom.''

GOVERNOR CALLS FOR A TIGHT KANSAS BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN L. PETTERSON and JOHN A. DVORAK  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   TOPEKA, Kan. _ Faced with a dwindling
supply of tax dollars, Gov. Bill Graves on Monday recommended an
almost no-growth budget for the coming year but pledged to focus on
education and social services.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 2001 budget, which calls for no tax increases, provides more
spending for public schools, salary increases for university
professors and cuts in community college property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Included is a $50-per-pupil increase in state aid to schools for
the next budget year, which begins July 1.
</P>
<P>
   There is also money to bolster spending for an array of social
service programs such as medical assistance and in-home help for
frail elderly Kansans.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring in all revenue sources, Graves proposed spending $8.7
billion, 2.3 percent higher than his spending plans for this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This budget is the most challenging of the past five years,''
the governor, a Republican, said in his State of the State message.
</P>
<P>
   ``That does not mean, however, we cannot provide effective,
efficient and vital services and programs to the people of
Kansas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the speech, some Democrats lambasted the governor,
charging that he was not recommending enough spending for education
and for helping the needy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The budget shortfall is not the result of any economic crisis,
it is the result of Bill Graves' management crisis and absent
leadership,'' said Rep. Jim Garner, a Coffeyville, Kan., Democrat
who is the House Democratic leader. ``Kansas Democrats know state
government can and should do better.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the governor spoke, the Kansas Legislature convened its
annual session and introduced a range of bills covering subjects
such as abortion, ethics, the State Board of Education and school
uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed $4.4 billion general fund budget for the budget
year that begins July 1 represents a 0.8 percent increase in
spending over the budget Graves wants enacted for the current year.
Income and sales taxes are the primary fuel for the general fund.
</P>
<P>
   The new budget contains specific benefits for the Kansas City
area.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson County Community College would receive an additional
$2.27 million, part of an $11.8 million package of new state aid.
Kansas City Kansas Community College would receive an additional
$884,000 under the program.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of the money for each institution would be
dedicated to property tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   The School for the Deaf in Olathe, Kan., would receive $300,000for rehabilitation and repair projects, including money for
building, walkway, parking area and fire safety work. The School
for the Blind in Kansas City, Kan., would receive $239,000 for
completion of an independent living facility.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since early in the 1990s, the governor is
recommending a budget smaller than the one the previous Legislature
enacted.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting cuts Graves has recommended in the budget for the
current year, his new budget is about $30.7 million less than the
current budget, enacted last year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tight budget, Graves said the state's economy is
strong. He offered no regrets for past tax cuts, which are one
reason for the tight budget this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We merely are in a period when we need to control our
spending,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Dick Bond, an Overland Park, Kan., Republican,
warned that the governor and the Legislature could not continue
their heavy-duty spending on education without facing serious
problems soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to have to look at tax increases if we are
to fund education as we have in the past,'' Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   Graves said he wished he could have provided the full
$50-per-student increase that the Legislature appropriated for the
current budget year. The governor has suggested cutting that to
$37, but the budget committees of both houses have recommended
rejecting the cut and providing the full $50.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake, we worked hard to try to find the money for
that goal; it's a mutual goal,'' the governor told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic leader in the Senate, Anthony Hensley of Topeka,
chided Republicans, saying they were only now climbing on the
education bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``In recent months Republican legislators, responding to their
opinion polls, suddenly realized that education is the top priority
of voters in this state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hensley added: ``They are attempting to grasp the banner of
education, in spite of consistently voting, in years of budget
surpluses, against many of the same proposals they now clamor
for.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic leader said the top priority of Senate Democrats
was to protect the $50-per-student increase for this year and the
same amount already approved for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the governor's proposal, public schools would receive the
$50 of additional state aid they expected for each of their
students next year.
</P>
<P>
   As drawn by the governor, however, the budget next year is
unusually tight. It leaves only $338 million for a reserve fund,
the minimum called for by law.
</P>
<P>
   The budget for this year also is tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've dug the hole a little deeper,'' House Speaker Robin
Jennison, a Healy, Kan., Republican, said.
</P>
<P>
   So if tax collections fall short of projections, the budget for
next year will require changes. That, Jennison said, could mean
cutting back on the $50 of increased per-student aid.
</P>
<P>
   He and other lawmakers say if tax collections perk up, the need
to cut the budget next year will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a hope the revenue picture will improve,''
Jennison said.
</P>
<P>
   State administrators are not so sure. Preliminary indications,
they say, suggest that collections may fall below projections.
Currently they are lagging about $9 million behind predictions.
</P>
<P>
   Graves, nevertheless, decided to recommend $21.1 million of
additional spending next year as part of an effort to restructure
higher education and improve coordination among colleges and
universities.
</P>

   Supporters of the higher education change applauded him for the

   ``His commitment to fund the reforms will do much to ease the
transition now under way in higher education,'' said Rep. David
Adkins, a Leawood, Kan., Republican who is chairman of the House

   The Legislature may have to trim Graves' new budget, but plenty
of time exists for deliberation, said Rep. Bill Reardon, a Kansas
City, Kan., Democrat who is a member of the House Appropriations
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of different things we can look at,'' he said.
``The idea that money has to be found this week isn't correct.''

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Monday began as a fairly typical Rockets practice day. Kelvin Cato
remained in street clothes, his sprained right wrist in a
protective splint. Tony Massenburg lifted weights alone, his
strained groin keeping him off the court. Steve Francis was held
out because of a sprained ankle. Walt Williams stayed home with the
flu.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Assistant coach Jim Boylen was moved from guard to small forward
in what has become his almost daily duty of providing a healthy
body necessary to hold practice.
</P>
<P>
   But there was one new development. Rockets center Hakeem
Olajuwon not only practiced for the first time since Nov. 25 but
drew jaw-dropping raves.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon said he hopes to return to the lineup Saturday in
Chicago, 6{ weeks after his Dec. 1 hernia surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to have Dream back in practice, and he was very
sharp,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``He had spring. He
didn't have the stamina, which is expected. He looked spry. It was
a good first practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a full practice. He was energetic. The stamina part
(was a problem) when we started going full-court. But I was really
happy with how springy he looked. I think it's a big boost for us
to have one of our leaders and a great player. I think it was a big
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the team felt to see Olajuwon back on the court,
Tomjanovich said, ``If you're home alone, and your big brother
comes home, do you feel better? Depends what you're doing when
you're home alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The home-alone Rockets have been losing 11 of their past 14
games since Charles Barkley joined Olajuwon on the injured list.
Olajuwon would not predict he would turn the team around with his
return, but he clearly was encouraged by Monday's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the practice went very well,'' he said. ``I think I
have to do more strengthening and conditioning. In the half-court,
I felt so comfortable; I felt free out there. But when we started
running up and down, it was a different game.
</P>
<P>
   ``From building my legs, they were much stronger. There was a
lot of power and confidence. I'm looking forward to coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich said it was premature to know how much Olajuwon
would play initially, or even to aim for Saturday in Chicago rather
than Monday in Dallas. But once he is back, the coach said, ``You
just let him be Hakeem Olajuwon.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon said he was not concerned with how he is reintroduced
into the rotation. He said that adjustment would come naturally as
his conditioning allows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is to get me to feel comfortable on
the court, to judge just by playing when I run out of gas and take
me out and put me back, and work me back smoothly,'' he said. ``I
want to make a contribution. There's no question in my mind I feel
comfortable, crisp.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon's teammates were gushing after seeing him play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really played well in practice today,'' forward Matt
Bullard said. ``He was jumping. He was shooting his jump hook. His
jumper was falling. It was really nice to see him out here. Now all
we have to do is get him to learn all the plays we've got.''
</P>
<P>
   Said guard Steve Francis: ``Dream looked great. That's real
encouraging for us young guys to see a guy, knowing the magnitude
of his injury, work so hard to get back on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Though his teammates lauded Olajuwon's agility, he said that
part of his return did not surprise him.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon had been averaging 14.8 points and 8.3 rebounds through
14 games when he was hurt early in the second half Nov. 26 at
Portland. He had on occasion shown flashes of his ability to
dominate as he once did, scoring 31 points against the Kings and
grabbing 15 rebounds against the Warriors. And now, after weeks of
weight training, Olajuwon said he feels stronger than before the
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I've been working out, I felt so comfortable, a lot of
elevation on my jumper and my jump hook,'' Olajuwon said. ``I
wasn't surprised. I think I can do much more.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I was playing without pain. I was very
explosive on defense, making moves without pain. I'm very
excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Told he looked happy, Olajuwon beamed and held his right hand
out waist-high.
</P>
<P>
   ``My jump hook,'' he said, ``my elevation was so high. I have to
get used to shooting down at the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   In a season in which the Rockets have had to get used to things
changing, that's an adjustment they will happily accept.

EDITORIAL: COPING WITH TEACHER SHORTAGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Jan. 11:
</P>
<P>
   Educators have been warning for years that the country would
face a crippling teacher shortage unless it raised teacher salaries
and attracted fresh talent to the profession. But as the Secretary
of Education, Richard W. Riley, noted in Washington Sunday, the
country has fallen so short of qualified teachers that ``schools
have been forced to put any warm body in front of the classroom.''
Faced with public outrage over failing schools _ and the need to
fill more than two million teacher vacancies over the next 10 years
_ the states, Congress and the presidential candidates are floating
proposals to attract more people to the profession. The problem
will require a great deal more resourcefulness.
</P>
<P>
   After years of indifference, the states have embarked on a
bidding war for the available talent. New York graduates roughly
21,000 teachers each year _ only to see two-thirds of them hired in
other states that offer better opportunities. Gov. George Pataki
hopes to change that picture with an inducement package that would
include free tuition for public university graduates who work in
low-performing schools and modified pension rules that would allow
retired public employees to teach without losing their retirement
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   These are promising measures, but they do not address the salary
imbalances that place urban centers like New York City at a
disadvantage. The city has more than 90 percent of the state's
uncertified teachers and is losing its best teachers to suburbs
that pay as much as $30,000 more per year. Gov. Gray Davis of
California wants to confront a similar imbalance by offering home
loans, salary bonuses and tuition forgiveness for teachers who
agree to work in low-performing schools.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that the country will need to hire 250,000
teachers a year over the next 10 years to keep pace with demand.
This will be difficult, given a full-employment economy and low
teachers' salaries. Nationally, the average starting pay for a
teacher is $25,735 _ compared with $42,862 for engineers, and
$40,920 for computer scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has historically viewed public schooling
as a local matter in which Washington plays only a peripheral role.
But the outcry over failing schools has reached Congress too. Vice
President Al Gore has proposed federally financed salary increases
for veteran teachers who serve in poor districts. A bill to provide
more incentives for teachers is being sponsored in the Senate by
Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York, and in the House by Rep.
George Miller of California. Among other things, it would forgive
undergraduate loans for people who teach for at least five years
and would cover 75 percent of the training costs for teachers who
become board-certified ``master teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   It is important to raise the salaries of teachers and to restore
their status as respected professionals. That will help attract
talent to the profession and ensure that every child in America has
access to a teacher who is well trained and capable.

FORMER BOXER MAKES JUMPING ROPE THE EXERCISE OF CHOICE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By GINIA BELLAFANTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a commonly held belief that women in the fashion business
stay thin by avoiding all foods that contain more calories than a
sage leaf and by engaging only in very specific kinds of exercises,
like walking the full distance from a garden table to the powder
room at Michael's. Asked to state her fitness regimen in the
February issue of Marie Claire, Cynthia Rowley responded, ``I went
to the gym once, about four years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Others do work out with greater frequency, however. The Sports
Center at Chelsea Piers, for example, has drawn a fair number of
those who use the word ``beyond'' when they used to say
``fabulous.'' At the moment, the routine many of them regard as
beyond involves that most anachronistic piece of exercise
equipment, the jump-rope. On a recent Tuesday evening at the Piers,
Aerojump, a class devised and taught by a former middleweight
boxer, Michael Olajide Jr., had representatives from the Versace
company, Visionaire and the Ian Schrager hotel empire all in
attendance. Many who came for the Aerojump class scheduled at 7:30
p.m. stayed for a second one at 8, and most were devoted followers
of the lean Olajide, who, during his fighting days, was known as
``the silk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the draw,'' said Samira Nasr, a fashion editor at
Harper's Bazaar, who initiated her friend Lisa Marie Fernandez, a
stylist, into Aerojump. Like many others, Ms. Nasr discovered
Olajide (pronounced oh-LAH-zhah-day) by walking by when he was
giving a class.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the high trendiness level of the clientele, there is no
Prada Sport in evidence. Women and men work out in nondescript
shorts, T-shirts and running shoes. The status symbol to possess is
the official Aerojump rope made of a thin red polynylon cord and
foam-covered handles that say Michael Olajide Jr. on them. Olajide
calls his rope (which costs $15) ``the rainmaker,'' because putting
it to use is so perspiration intensive.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Olajide's classes involve performing various
choreographed maneuvers with rope very, very quickly in time to the
kind of thumping music that conjures up an image of a model
traveling down a runway in skin-tight metallic hip-huggers. ``It's
underground house, jungle house,'' Olajide said of the music.
``It's not aerobic-y. It makes you think you're not working out as
much as that you're in a club.''
</P>
<P>
   But being in a club is as similar to taking one of Olajide's
classes as watching ``E.R.'' is to receiving a triple bypass.
Olajide's rules call for one jump for every revolution of the rope.
Sometimes, knees are lifted high in the air; sometimes feet jump
together from side to side; often the rope is turned by arms
crisscrossed below the chest. The secret there, Olajide said, is to
make sure that one's hands are extended beyond the width of one's
body. ``How easy is that?'' he said. In fact, not very easy at all.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Reilly, the owner of Waterfront Boxing, a downtown gym
that also offers supervised jump-rope, said that even those capable
of running four-minute miles might not necessarily be able to make
it through the kind of fast-paced class Olajide teaches.
</P>
<P>
   But the prospect of crippling exhaustion seems to deter few.
Betsy White, Sports Center's spokeswoman, said that Aerojump
classes typically attract 25 to 30 people while many other classes
at the gym bring in between 15 to 20.
</P>
<P>
   Cassie Yu, a designer of women's clothes sold at Scoop and other
stores, sounds like an infomercial when she talks about Olajide.
Ms. Yu has followed fitness trends from aerobics to step aerobics
to spinning. ``I tried other classes, and I didn't break a sweat,''
she said in a locker room after an Aerojump class last week.
</P>
<P>
   Olajide attributes his popularity in part to the fact that he is
a former real-life athlete rather than, say, a performance
artist/waiter/teacher of push-ups. ``If I want legal advice, I'm
going to go to a lawyer, not a computer scientist,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   But Olajide may be overlooking a factor that people in the
fashion universe rarely overlook: appearance. ``He's so good
looking, you forget what you're doing,'' said Paige Bondurant, an
account executive at Versace, who has been going to Aerojump for
four months. After taking back-to-back classes last Tuesday night,
Elena Kolpachikova, a model, originally from Ukraine, left looking
pale and eviscerated. But she wasn't too wiped out to kiss the
instructor before making her exit.

LEVITY AMID GRAVITY OF WAR AGAINST TB 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOYCE WADLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You don't expect to see a beer bottle, even if it is
a rare-in-these-parts Jack Daniel's beer bottle, in an honored spot
in the office of one of the country's premier tuberculosis
researchers, or to find the professor, who has a voice that sounds
eerily like John Goodman's and a physique like an NFL lineman's,
cracking up the gang in the lab.
</P>
<P>
   But here is Dr. William R. Jacobs, in sneakers and a stained
blue sweater, entertaining the troops with stories about a recent
trip to Russia, and if you enter his cramped office _ where two
huge open jars of Fruit Loops and Hershey's Kisses are on the desk,
and framed photos of ``heroes of microbiology'' are next to the
beer bottle _ he will tell you stories, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia in the '70s had employed 60,000 people in 20 facilities
across Russia, making biological warfare,'' Jacobs, 44, is saying,
in such a way as to make the gritty laboratories of the Albert
Einstein College of Medicine morph into a neighborhood bar. ``They
would just grow up tons of anthrax to stick into SS-18 bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the Department of Defense has deemed it would be cost
effective to go ahead and pay them to work on something like
tuberculosis, which is a huge problem in Russia, as opposed to
taking a nice job in Iran making anthrax.
</P>
<P>
   ``So anyway, we go over, contingent of TB specialists, to see
their facilities, where they have their animals, mice. Our
facilities here, you gown up, you work with a HEPA filter over a
hood, the air in the room changed every seven minutes. The Russians
have this room where the air isn't filtered, the hood isn't
working, and the containment'' _ the doctor starts laughing here _
``they have two cats; they don't feed them that often.''
</P>
<P>
   More laughter, accompanied by fist, gestures, that Goodman-esque
voice, rising in volume. ``Any mouse gets out of the cage, boom!
Slam! This is Russia, babe, I'm not making this stuff up! One of
the premier labs in Moscow, and their containment is two hungry
cats!''
</P>
<P>
   Even though tuberculosis is down in the United States, many
public health officials are worrying about the need for screening
in cities with large immigrant populations and at ports of entry.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs' concerns are global. If you visit him at Einstein, in
the Bronx, he will repeatedly slam you with statistics: 270 people
die every hour from tuberculosis, he says. He believes that a third
of the people on the planet are infected. He has one goal: to
eradicate the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, in the 15 years he has devoted to this endeavor, has
made several important finds: He was the lead researcher of the
team that discovered a gene within the tuberculosis bacterium that
enables it to cause disease; he developed a light-sensitivity test
with Dr. Barry Bloom, now the dean of the Harvard School of Public
Health, that indicates resistance to TB drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Jacobs' contribution was to create the genetics, the
knowledge and the methods that everybody in the world is using,''
Bloom says. ``Another interesting thing about Bill: He's enormously
bright, but he does not have the standard pedigree. He went to
something called Edinboro State. No one has ever heard of that
college.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also interesting that Jacobs does research despite the
lifetime encumbrance of retinitis pigmentosa, an eye disease that
limits his peripheral and night vision and that now makes it
difficult for him to see one of the tests he devised.
</P>
<P>
   Walking down a hallway, he bumps into a bucket and mop. (Bam!
Careem!) Visits to places like Disneyland, he jokes, are tough.
Luckily, his son and daughter (10 and 12) and his wife (a special
education teacher) are ``compassionate.''
</P>
<P>
   Why hasn't the researcher devoted himself to his own disease?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think that when something's too close, you get
blinded. I was always afraid I'd get too emotionally involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Another question: How does a fellow who selected his college
(the aforementioned Edinboro State, in the northwest corner of
Pennsylvania), based on a Playboy ranking of party schools, end up
with a doctorate in molecular cell biology (University of
Birmingham) in the gratification-delayed world of research? There
is a reason, but it embarrasses Jacobs, whose father was a
steelworker in West Mifflin, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   First came Jacobs' seminal encounter with science, in the ninth
grade, as he was studying the effects of plant growth hormone. The
off-campus experiment involved a next-door neighbor who had
impounded the budding scientist's baseball. The young Jacobs
sprayed the growth hormone on the neighbors just-planted corn and
tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day they grew a foot, and after a week, they all fell
over dead,'' Jacobs says, hooting.
</P>
<P>
   Off to college went Jacobs, majoring in math and minoring, much
less successfully, in girls. In pursuit of one, he attended a
prayer meeting. The woman married someone else, but Jacobs became a
Christian. He is concerned about discussing this. Most scientists
can't relate to God, and he doesn't want to be viewed as some
``wacko,'' but there it is.
</P>
<P>
   His doctoral work, which was with leprosy, and his subsequent
work with tuberculosis were tied to the need to ``do right by my
fellow man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to a prayer meeting because of a woman, but I was
hungry for God,'' Jacobs says. ``I wasn't satisfied with my life. I
know God was calling for me, that there is some plan in my life.''

EDITORIAL: ACTION ON AIDS IN AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Jan. 11:
</P>
<P>
   Imagine 40 million hungry and destitute orphans in sub-Saharan
Africa by the year 2010 _ roaming the streets without schooling or
work, prime candidates for the criminal gangs, marauding militias
and child armies that have slaughtered and mutilated tens of
thousands of civilians in countries like Sierra Leone and Liberia
in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of nightmare that prompted the U.N. Security
Council to convene Monday for an unprecedented examination of a
health issue _ the global spread of AIDS, especially in sub-Saharan
Africa, where experts predict that more people will die of AIDS in
the next decade than have died in all the wars of the 20th century.
The Clinton administration is wise to use its monthlong leadership
of the Security Council to put this devastating crisis, too often
hidden by secrecy and shame, at the top of the world's security
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer scale of Africa's AIDS epidemic defies comprehension.
South of the Sahara, more than 14 million have died thus far. In
some countries one in four adults is infected, the majority under
the age of 25. In South Africa, which has the highest rate of
infection in the world, 3.5 million people will die in the next
decade. The United Nations has called the spread of AIDS in Africa
``the worst infectious disease catastrophe since the bubonic
plague,'' which killed one-third of Europe's population in the 14th
century.
</P>
<P>
   For these nations, AIDS is not just a humanitarian problem. It
is, as Vice President Al Gore argued in a forceful speech to the
Security Council Monday, a ``security crisis.'' In attacking the
young it saps work forces, undermining economic development and
political stability. AIDS has killed disproportionately high
numbers of teachers, doctors, nurses.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is seeking $325 million from Congress in next
year's budget to combat AIDS abroad, an increase of $100 million
from current levels. The added funding would support education and
prevention programs, community-based care, blood screening and
testing, and special care for orphans. Increased funding is surely
welcome, but this figure is woefully inadequate when measured
against the scale of the problem. The U.S. spends $7 billion a year
on AIDS prevention, treatment and research at home, where 40,000
new cases are diagnosed every year. In Africa, 5.6 million new
cases appear annually in countries with the most ill-equipped
health care systems on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The stigma attached to AIDS has hampered efforts to curb the
epidemic. That may be where Monday's Security Council debate makes
its most lasting contribution. By giving this crisis the prominent
platform it deserves, the United States is finally providing the
leadership needed to overcome what the vice president properly
decried as ``the ignorance and indifference that lead to
infection.''

 BUSH CAMPAIGN CONTESTS A McCAIN BALLOT SPOT  
(lb) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The presidential campaign of Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas on Monday began the process of trying to knock his chief
rival, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, off the ballot in the
Republican primary in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign, which is backed by the state Republican
Party, told election authorities that it was filing what are known
as general objections to the nominating petitions filed by the
McCain camp, the first step in a possible challenge.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to comply with the difficult petitioning rules, the
McCain campaign has said it has collected enough signatures to get
McCain on the ballot in 25 of the state's 31 congressional
districts. Helped by the foot troops of the state party, Bush is
expected to qualify statewide for the March 7 primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
   It is a longstanding tradition in New York for front-runners to
use the rules to get the petitions of underdogs disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several days, the Bush campaign is required to
cite specific problems with the petitions. Dan Allen, a spokesman
for the state party, said the campaign had not decided yet whether
to do that, but wanted to keep its options open.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said the Bush campaign and the state party were motivated
in part by a lawsuit filed by the McCain campaign challenging the
ballot rules, which are considered the toughest of any state.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said that although McCain contends that the rules are too
hard, the state party believes that McCain has had a difficult time
because he lacks grass-roots support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush supporters want to check and make sure that the
McCain people actually went through and got the support of
Republicans statewide, as opposed to having just anyone signing
petitions,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the McCain campaign in New York, Guy Molinari,
the Staten Island borough president, has warned against a petition
challenge by the Bush campaign. Bush's New York campaign is led by
Gov. George Pataki and the state party chairman, William Powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are making a terrible mistake,'' Molinari said.
``There are going to be a lot of hard feelings against the governor
and the state chairman.''

   MILAN, Italy _ Last fall, back in the 1900s, America had a talk
about men. Were they suffering a collective loss of self-worth, as
Susan Faludi argued in her book ``Stiffed: The Betrayal of the
American Male''? Had the shallowness of contemporary culture robbed
men of any sense of real masculinity beyond stylish posturing? Are
these the reasons the world is now stuck with Maxim magazine?
</P>
<P>
   ``Fight Club,'' starring Brad Pitt and Ed Norton, was the
entertainment vehicle for some of these ideas, and it seemed
inevitable that the first men's-wear shows of the year 2000 would
not go off without a few allusions to the film, which was released
to fanfare a few months ago. Set in a nameless city at the end of
the 20th century, ``Fight Club'' centers on men who feel so
softened by a society that forces them to look good and keep neat,
Ikea-filled apartments that they meet to beat each other up. Only
then can they viscerally experience some notion of heroism and
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours before her show on Saturday in Milan, where the
first round of the fall 2000 men's collections are under way,
Donatella Versace explained that the clothes she was about to
present had a ``Fight Club'' theme. That theme apparently
translated into camouflage-print suits, as well as shirts and
jackets, with razor blades sewn onto them. There were also tight,
low-slung leather pants loaded with zippers. The zipper one would
actually use made a big ``U'' from front and center to just beneath
the lower back. Of these pants, Ms. Versace seemed particularly
proud. ``He's screaming, `Unzip me,''' she joked when a model tried
them on. In fact, the model looked as if he were thinking about
maybe trying a different job, like indexing textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Versace, who had Jade Jagger and Missy Elliot in the black
vinyl seats at her show, said that it was the atmosphere of ``Fight
Club'' she was after, not necessarily the meaning. Few other
marketers have topped the Versaces in the realm of objectifying men
and holding them to unattainable standards of, well, beauty. For
Ms. Versace or any designer to grapple with the movie's meaning
would really require abandoning the whole spectacle of a men's
fashion show.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Belgian designer Dirk Bikkembergs was close to pulling
just such a move. He was obviously thinking about the bruised male
personality when he turned out his collection. He showed in a
desolate space, the kind in which secret, ritualistic fist fighting
might take place. The show featured models with their shirts off,
looking dirty and cut up. Some had black eyes. The clothes
themselves were loose, drab and warriorlike, as though the men
wearing them were expecting some kind of rumble in the middle of
the world's risotto capital.
</P>
<P>
   It probably goes without saying that the mood was very different
the following evening at Gucci. One has to hand it to Tom Ford, the
house's designer, for not latching onto the most obvious and
immediate reference to male-identity issues in the pop-cultural
arsenal. There were no sharp objects or scarred faces on display.
Perhaps because he is a fit Texan, but more likely because he's in
command of a very powerful ship at the moment, Ford probably
doesn't sit around thinking much about men who aspire to be
something they can't be, or wishing he was as macho as John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   And his customer isn't weighted with this kind of burden,
either. He lives for style and doesn't have any complicated
feelings about it. He's the guy who has written the most sardonic
dot-com ad on television, or started the record label of the
moment, or landed a job with Rem Koolhaas. He's in Notting Hill one
day, Silver Lake the next. His Palm Pilot reminds him to send Spike
Jonze and Sofia Coppola a wedding present.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are less uptight about proving their masculinity,'' Ford
said the morning of his show. ``They are just looser.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true that a man would have to be pretty loose, pretty
self-possessed to wear some of the things Ford showed, including
shoulder bags with the Gucci logo, fur coats and scarves tied
around the head.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond those looks, though, Ford was reintrepreting his louche
sensibility within the context of a more classic vocabulary. ``I'm
sick of all that flash,'' he said. ``I don't want to see
rhinestones anywhere, especially on men.'' He showed tweed suits, a
leap from the velvet of the past, and even bow ties, although
unusually large bow ties.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Ford said he didn't send clothes down the
runway he couldn't see wearing himself. But when he took his bow at
the end of the show, it wasn't in an orange leather motorcycle
jacket but in a simple black suit and white shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that Ms. Faludi is on to something when she contends
that many young men have lost their sense of usefulness and public
purpose, one wonders if they will now take to the suit again, the
ultimate symbol of utility and social worth.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was featured prominently not only at Gucci and Prada
but also at Dolce &AMP; Gabbana, a house not known for conformity. Like
Gucci's, Dolce &AMP; Gabbana's mood was more restrained than it has
been in the past. There were double-breasted coats and relics of
the Cheever era, two-button suits, which for years have vanished.
There was wackiness, too, at Dolce _ gold and red velvet pants and
floral-print satin shirts. The shirts, though, were shown with
ties.
</P>
<P>
   At John Bartlett's collection for Byblos, one of the most
reality-based of the Milan's men's shows thus far, good-looking
suits appeared among the many knits.
</P>
<P>
   Pinstripe suits seemed appropriate when they were shown at Prada
Monday night, given that the house is flush with a sense of
corporate virility from having won another round in the America's
Cup races over the weekend in New Zealand. (Stuck in New Zealand
with the flu, Miuccia Prada was unable to attend her show.) Prada
Sport was not displayed this year, presumably to keep the emphasis
on the grown-up formality Prada was presenting.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it does speak to these confusing times that Ms. Prada
showed her suits with thin-soled shoes Tony Soprano might wear to a
wedding, and also with oversize ostrich handbags that his
therapist, Jennifer Melfi, might covet.
</P>
<P>
   Suit sales have been declining for years. Is this really going
to be the hour of their return? ``A whole generation has missed out
on wearing them,'' said Robert Lohrer, editor of DNR, the trade
magazine devoted to men's clothing. Of course, that generation will
have to afford them first.

GEN. L.F. CHAPMAN, 86, DIES; FORMER MARINE COMMANDANT  

</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gen. Leonard F. Chapman Jr., the former commandant
of the Marine Corps who guided the service through the height of
the Vietnam War and the social and racial upheavals of that era,
died of cancer on last Thursday in suburban Virginia. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   After his retirement from the military in 1972, Chapman served
as commissioner of immigration and naturalization.
</P>
<P>
   When he was appointed commandant by President Lyndon B. Johnson
in 1968, Chapman was known for his organizational achievements. His
sons, Leonard F. Chapman III and Walton F. Chapman, were both
Marines who served in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   An artillery officer who fought in the Pacific in World War II,
Chapman regularly visited Vietnam where two of the service's three
divisions were fighting, encouraging his troops with confident
statements that the North Vietnamese ``can't force us out.''
</P>
<P>
   With racial tensions and an increase in drug and alcohol
problems threatening all the services, Chapman pointedly refused to
follow the Army or the Navy in agreeing to changes like allowing
beer in military barracks or longer hair styles and beards.
Instead, he defused racial tensions, including a near riot at Camp
LeJeune, N.C., with programs to enhance cultural awareness and
eliminate discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a gentleman and a leader and he epitomized everything
it means to be called Marine,'' said Gen. James L. Jones, the
present commandant. ``His many contributions kept the Marine Corps
on the right path and brought us to where we are today.''
</P>
<P>
   The son and grandson of Methodist ministers, Chapman was born in
Key West, Fla., on Nov. 3, 1913. He spent most of his childhood in
DeLand, near Orlando, and graduated from the University of Florida
in 1935. He joined the Marines and was a captain when the United
States entered World War II, taking part in the battles of the
Coral Sea and Midway. Later, he fought with the First Marine
Division on Peleliu and Okinawa, receiving the Legion of Merit and
the Bronze Star.
</P>
<P>
   After the Korean War, he served in Japan, and, in July 1956,
became the commanding officer of the Marine Barracks in Washington,
where he introduced the Friday night retreat parades that have
become a familiar tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, he was elevated to the rank of lieutenant general and
named chief of staff of the Marine Corps. In this position he
promoted more efficient methods of management, which he described
in The Marine Corps Gazette as ``changes in the techniques which we
use to manage, commit and control'' the strength of the service.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson skipped over two other candidates in 1968 to name
Chapman commandant of the Marine Corps. Known as ``an organization
man,'' his organizational skills were immediately tested in the
Vietnam War and subsequent withdrawal. He was determined to bring
back his two Marine divisions with all their equipment, telling his
troops, ``Don't leave anything behind worth more than five
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latter years of the war, the Marines faced problems of
racial hostility and violence like those rocking the rest of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   After the violence at Camp LeJeune in 1969, Chapman issued a
1,000-word order to all commanders to take positive steps to
eliminate discrimination in promotions, assignments and in social
activity on the bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Marine must understand that the Marine Crops does
guarantee equal rights, equal opportunity, and equal protections,
without regard to race,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The changes included a full review of recent promotions to
ensure fairness and allowing black marines to use the clenched-fist
salute for black power.
</P>
<P>
   Underpinning this order was Chapman's insistence that change
would not mean relaxing the service's spartan standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``These high standards breed pride,'' he said, ``and pride, in
turn, builds the kind of discipline that is essential to
battlefield success with minimum casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   When he retired as a four-star general in 1971, he was awarded
the Distinguished Service Medal by President Richard M. Nixon. He
served as commissioner of immigration and naturalization from 1973
until 1976, promoting a curb on illegal immigration that he said
was costing the country billions of dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman was married to Emily Walton Ford Chapman, who died in
1992. His son Leonard died in a scuba diving accident in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his son Walton, of Shelburne Falls, Mass., he is
survived by a daughter-in-law, Gayle Chapman Harmes, and a
granddaughter.

PATAKI WANTS TAX BREAK FOR ECOLOGICALLY HELPFUL BUILDING EFFORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gov. George E. Pataki plans to propose a tax break
Tuesday for builders who construct or renovate buildings in ways
that cut pollution, waste, energy use and indoor air contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's plan could breathe new life into ``green building''
legislation that has floated in Albany for two years. If adopted,
the tax breaks could make New York a national leader in promoting
ecologically beneficial building methods, according to several
environmental experts.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the governor said Pataki's initial package of tax
credits would be unveiled on Tuesday as part of his budget proposal
for the next fiscal year and would be limited to $25 million spread
over several years. They said the goal was to create enough demand
for environmentally beneficial technologies and materials so that
they would become standard in all construction.
</P>
<P>
   The first new structure to take advantage of the program could
be a 25-story residential tower proposed for Lower Manhattan. The
Battery Park City Authority is scheduled to request proposals
Tuesday for construction of the 337,000-square-foot building,
calling for details like carpets and paints that emit no hazardous
fumes, computer-controlled lighting and energy systems that trim
electricity bills, and special window glass and rooftop gardens
that insulate in winter and deflect the heat of the summer sun.
</P>
<P>
   In a printed statement about his tax credit plan, Pataki hailed
the Battery Park proposal as the kind of project the state hoped to
encourage. The building proposal, he said, contains ``high
environmental standards that put New York State and Battery Park
City solidly in the green.''
</P>
<P>
   Many states, including New York, already have a variety of
financial incentives encouraging developers and building owners to
improve energy efficiency, but the proposed tax credit program,
which would be much broader, would be the first of its kind in the
country, said Ashok Gupta, the senior energy economist for the
Natural Resources Defense Council, a private group that has
promoted the legislation in the state. ``We're very excited about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Pataki's version of the tax credits, an architect would
assess construction plans and certify that they met standards like
using recycled materials and nonpolluting air-conditioning systems,
as well as other requirements that would be drawn up by state
environmental officials. The credits would only be available on
buildings over 20,000 square feet, meaning small structures _ like
a cooperative Brooklyn brownstone _ would not qualify.
</P>
<P>
   A builder could get a tax credit for up to 5 percent of the cost
of environmentally beneficial technologies or materials, or 6
percent if the building was in an economically troubled part of the
state.
</P>
<P>
   If the tenants of a building all hewed to the same standards, an
extra 2 percent credit could be claimed.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Assemblyman Paul D. Tonko, a Democrat from Montgomery
County who has sponsored similar legislation for two years, said
the governor's enthusiasm for the idea increased prospects that a
bill could pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been wanting to attack the energy crisis in this state
from both the consumption side and the price side,'' Tonko said
Monday. ``Consumption here is still higher than the national
average. Let's hope this is the year for this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tonko and other critics have complained that Pataki's
proposal is too limited in scope, with just a few large projects
like the Battery Park proposal potentially consuming most of the
available money.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental experts held high hopes for the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real estate industry, the unions, builders, essentially
everybody is saying we can change industry practices with this
approach,'' Gupta of the Natural Resources Defense Council said.
``In 5 or 10 years, you won't need tax credits because this would
be the new industry norm.''
</P>
<P>
   Some large commercial buildings built recently, like the Conde
Nast headquarters at 4 Times Square, have incorporated a variety of
environmental features, but few residential buildings have, so far.
</P>
<P>
   The Battery Park tower would be the first in the Northeast to do
so, according to the authority, a public benefit corporation
created 32 years ago to oversee development of the former landfill
site.
</P>
<P>
   From the outside, it would resemble the other sweeping
brick-faced structures in the riverside complex of apartments and
offices. But the authority wants the builder to include appliances
that use 30 percent less energy than the current allowance under
state energy codes, and air filters to keep indoor air from
accumulating dangerous fumes that have become a problem in some
modern, tightly sealed buildings.

WOODS BEGINS YEAR WHERE HE LEFT OFF  
 LPGA CELEBRATES 50 YEARS  
 GARY NICKLAUS SET TO DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Instead of being spoiled by success, Tiger Woods is motivated by
it.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' insatiable desire for excellence has been the driving
force behind his phenomenal winning streak, which reached five
consecutive starts when he won the Mercedes Championships in
Kapalua, Hawaii, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Almost three years ago, Woods won the Masters by a
record-setting 12 strokes, yet he looked at himself and saw major
room for improvement. So he modified his swing and became stronger
physically and, at 24, he has widened the gap between him and the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Until Sunday, nobody had won five consecutive starts since Ben
Hogan in 1953. And if Woods wins his next start, he will equal the
second-longest streak in tour history, matching Hogan's streak of
six straight victories in 1948. It will be at either the Phoenix
Open, which will begin Jan. 27, or the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National
Pro-Am, which will begin Feb. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Can Woods threaten Byron Nelson's career streak of 11
consecutive victories, set in 1945? A record that once seemed
unlikely to be matched does not seem so to Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you could say it's untouchable,'' Woods said
before last weekend's tournament. ``I don't care what era you're
in, if a player is hot, the player is hot. I believe someone can do
it. You need luck. But you also need to play well.''
</P>
<P>
   A golfer also needs supreme focus, and Woods clearly has it. For
him, money is not the No. 1 motivator, and his fame is sometimes
more of a hassle than a help. Woods wants to be remembered as the
best golfer who ever lived, the type of careerlong goal that is
likely to keep driving him for the next 15 to 20 years, no matter
how many tournaments he wins.
</P>
<P>
   The countless hours that Woods has spent refining his game
showed during the Mercedes, where he outlasted Ernie Els to win a
classic duel on the second hole of sudden death. Throughout the
tournament, Woods coped with the gusting winds in Maui by hitting
low, head-high tee shots with his 3-wood that bored through the
wind. Woods perfected that shot during the past year, and his
improved distance control with his short irons has enabled him to
capitalize on his distance off the tee.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is now a complete player, and his excellent physical
conditioning has helped him remain strong despite his worldwide
travel schedule. Since turning professional in 1996, Woods has
gained more than 20 pounds, and almost all of it is muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to compete against players who are much
stronger than you,'' Woods said. ``If you're not stronger, you're
going to get your butt kicked. My body developed late. In our
family, for some reason, the genes kick in late. When I turned pro,
I was 20 years old, 158 pounds. Now I'm 180. That's a combination
of lifting as well as natural maturation.''
</P>
<P>
   David Duval, who finished third at the Mercedes, is also
beginning 2000 with a stronger, leaner body, but right now,
everyone else on tour is chasing Woods. It will be interesting to
see how long Woods can keep the streak alive. But it's a tribute to
his character that he has refused to let his success diminish his
desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never put a limitation on your own abilities,'' Woods
said. ``If you put a limitation on it, you can't get any better.''
LPGA CELEBRATES 50 YEARS
</P>
<P>
   The Ladies Professional Golf Association kicked off its 50th
anniversary season Monday night with a black-tie Night of Champions
gala in Palm Beach, Fla., honoring many of the women who helped
begin the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Karrie Webb was the winner of the 1999 player of the year award.
Webb also won the Vare Trophy for the lowest scoring average. Mi
Hyun Kim was honored as the rookie of the year, Val Skinner won the
Komen award and Nancy Scranton won the Heather Farr player award.
</P>
<P>
   The LPGA also honored Jamie Farr with the commissioner's award,
Judy Rankin with the Patty Berg award, Betty Hicks with the Ellen
Griffin award, Renee Powell with the service award, Amy Fox with
the teacher of the year award, Sandra Eriksson with the
professional of the year award and Kathleen Teichert with the coach
of the year award.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 LPGA season begins Friday with the Office Depot
Tournament in West Palm Beach, Fla.
GARY NICKLAUS SET TO DEBUT
</P>
<P>
   Gary Nicklaus, son of Jack Nicklaus, will make his debut as a
full-fledged member of the PGA Tour this week at the Sony Open in
Hawaii. The younger Nicklaus earned his tour card for the first
time at qualifying school last year and, at age 30, he feels
confident that he can be a contender on tour. Nicklaus will also
play at next week's Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, and he hopes to play
in about 30 events this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest improvement has come in my course management,''
said Nicklaus, assessing his game. ``My putting has also improved
dramatically. When I putt well, I score well.''

NEW JERSEY CRACKS DOWN ON YOUNG WHO USE TOBACCO AND LIQUOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ In a burst of prohibitive zeal aimed at New
Jersey's youth, state lawmakers voted Monday to make it illegal for
people under 18 to buy or possess tobacco products, or for those
under 21 to drink alcoholic beverages on private property.
</P>
<P>
   The under-age-drinking bill, which is supported by police and
municipal officials throughout the state, would close a loophole
that has made it difficult for the police to crack down on rowdy
summertime house parties and backyard keggers at rental houses
along the Jersey Shore.
</P>
<P>
   But the tobacco ban is opposed by many police officials and most
leading antismoking groups, who say it would achieve little and
could even make smoking more appealing to rebellious teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   The two bills easily passed both houses of the Legislature, but
it is unclear whether they will be signed by Gov. Christie Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco ban would subject people under 18 who are caught
buying or holding any form of tobacco to a $25 fine, which would be
refunded after they sat through an education program about the
dangers of tobacco use. A violation would be considered a civil
offense, like a parking ticket, but not a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents noted that the Legislature was in good company.
Within New Jersey, at least 27 towns have some sort of ban on
under-age smoking. Nationwide, 29 states prohibit the purchase of
tobacco by minors, 17 prohibit its possession and 12 states
prohibit its use.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to send a consistent message to minors that you
shouldn't be doing this,'' said Assemblyman Guy R. Gregg, a
Republican restaurant owner from Mount Olive who first proposed the
ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of the 15-year-old who goes to the 7-Eleven and buys
some cigarettes from an 18-year-old friend,'' he said. ``The
18-year-old gets caught, the store owner gets fined, he fires the
18-year-old perhaps, then the 15-year-old still has the cigarettes.
He can smoke them and say, `I didn't do anything wrong.' It's a
mixed message for the kid.''
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Downs, the director of New Jersey Breathes _ a
coalition of 45 antismoking groups, including the American Cancer
Society, American Heart Association and American Lung Association _
said there was no evidence that bans of any kind reduced tobacco
use by children and teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do know what does work, which is nothing short of a
comprehensive, well-funded, sustained approach to tobacco
control,'' said Downs, whose coalition is seeking $75 million for
that purpose from New Jersey's share of the nationwide settlement
of tobacco litigation.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Matthew L. Myers, president of the National
Center for Tobacco-Free Kids, said that tobacco companies supported
such bans ``because it transfers the responsibility for their
wrongdoing to children.''
</P>
<P>
   A ban could actually be harmful, he said, ``if people think that
solves the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Many local police officials in New Jersey oppose the ban, saying
it would be impossible to enforce and would further alienate
troubled young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to undo 15 years of community police work that
we've done to build a rapport with the youth in our community,''
said Robert L. Herndon, the chief of police in Allendale and the
president of the New Jersey State Association of Chiefs of Police.
``The kids who are smoking, we know where they are. If we start
enforcing this, they're going to move off Main Street, so to
speak.''
</P>
<P>
   The ban on under-age drinking or possession of alcoholic
beverages on private property, which excludes religious observances
and drinking in the presence of a parent or guardian, carries a
$500 fine and a six-month suspension of driving privileges.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in resort communities along the Jersey Shore have
lobbied for the ban for years. In Avalon, the police began raiding
house parties and arresting large numbers of under-age drinkers a
few years ago, but those efforts were stopped in the courts. Last
November, the borough paid $1.5 million to settle a federal lawsuit
brought by some of those who were arrested, said Mayor Martin L.
Pagliughi.
</P>
<P>
   The new bill passed in the Legislature would take the handcuffs
off Avalon's police officers, Pagliughi said, adding, ``This gives
us the right to break up the party.''

OTHER CANDIDATES TAKE AIM AT BUSH IN REPUBLICAN DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>

for their ...'')

<P>
   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. _ Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain
sparred tensely in a Republican debate here Monday night over what
kind and what size of tax cut the country can afford, with McCain
ridiculing Bush's stated fear that Washington would gorge itself on
the growing surplus if the money was not returned to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't understand the role of the president of the United
States,'' McCain told Bush, turning to face him. ``The president of
the United States will veto bills _ will veto bills _ that spend
too much.''
</P>
<P>
   In a voice that seemed to chide and belittle Bush, McCain added,
``That's what being president of the United States is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it was one of the few times that McCain of Arizona, the
principal challenger to Bush for the Republican presidential
nomination, sharply criticized the front-runner, other rivals took
additional swipes at Bush, the Texas governor, on a variety of
fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes attacked Bush for a broken pledge, made in his 1994
campaign for governor, not to raise sales taxes in Texas. Gary
Bauer repeatedly and emphatically pressed Bush to defend his desire
to promote freer trade with China, given its history of human
rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   And Forbes, setting his sights on Bush for a second time,
challenged him to make three pledges about what he would do if he
became the Republican nominee and, beyond that, the American
president.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes wanted Bush to promise that he would select a running
mate who opposed legal abortion, appoint Supreme Court justices
with that same position and keep that position intact and
undiminished in the party platform.
</P>
<P>
   Bush declined, but without ever using that word, in one of
several answers that sought to evade conflict or specificity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to pick a vice president who can be the president,''
Bush said. ``I'll pick judges who strictly interpret the
Constitution.'' He added that he would ``work to keep the
Republican Party pro-life.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes responded: ``It's a typical hedge. Where's the pledge,
not a hedge?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said, ``I don't know how I can be more clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush frequently tried to defuse the attacks on him with humor,
getting off a number of good jokes that drew robust laughter from
the audience at Calvin College, where the debate was held. For
example, he thanked Forbes for a question that assumed that Bush
would be the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   With time ticking rapidly away before the Iowa caucuses on Jan.
24 touch off a rapid-fire series of state contests that could well
yield a nominee by early March, Bush's rivals were in part looking
to inflict some last-minute damage.
</P>
<P>
   But they also seemed, at times, to be trying to lock him into
conservative positions before he proceeded to a general election
contest. Bush would not let that happen, carefully avoiding any
commitment or statement that might come back to haunt him.
</P>
<P>
   Except for their squabbling over taxes, Bush and McCain
demonstrated remarkable amity toward each other. Twice Bush
answered a question by praising, and agreeing with, the response
McCain had just given, including McCain's vow never to negotiate
with terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   And at one point, they clasped hands and held them aloft as they
agreed not to run any negative advertisements about each other.
That gesture followed Forbes' refusal to make a similar resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``If being negative is telling the truth, I will continue to
tell the truth,'' Forbes said. ``People deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush replied: ``I'll run positive ads. And I'm darned sure not
going to do to candidates what this man did to Bob Dole in 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   The pledge that Forbes mentioned, and which is highlighted in a
television commercial that he began airing last week, concerns a
document from 1994 that bears Bush's signature and promises not to
raise the sales tax in Texas. The debate opened with a discussion
of that commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers have not denied the document's authenticity, nor
did Bush. Bush indeed raised the sales tax in Texas, but he
explained Monday night that the overall changes in the tax codes in
Texas in his years as governor amounted to a $3 billion cut, not an
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said to him, ``A pledge should not be used as a trinket
to win the election. I think that's what makes American people
cynical about politics _ pledges are made and then quickly
forgotten after the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush quickly replied, ``One thing that makes the American people
cynical is negative advertising on TV. I am a tax-cutting person,''
said Bush, whose proposal for a $483 billion tax cut over five
years has become the centerpiece of his campaign in New Hampshire,
which holds its primary on Feb. 1. ``I know how to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of the first third of the 90-minute debate, which
featured all six of the Republican candidates for their party's
nomination, it was all taxes all the time, regardless of what the
question was, to the point where it became a running joke.
</P>
<P>
   There was an even sharper exchange between Bush and Bauer on the
subject of American trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had said that he did not support trade with Cuba because of
the repressive, Communist government of its leader, Fidel Castro.
Bauer countered that Chinese officials were equally repressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor, you just made the case for withdrawing
most-favored-nation status for China,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush shot back, ``I did not.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said, ``Everything you just said about Cuba applies to
China.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, insisted there was a ``huge difference between
trading with an entrepreneurial class, like that which is growing
in China, and allowing a Fidel Castro government to skim capital
monies off the top of capital investment.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Bush's funniest comments, but also one of his oddest,
came when he was asked about the professional baseball player who
made racist comments and the decision by the Atlanta Braves to give
him psychological counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he agreed with that action. And when the questioner
started to pose a follow-up that began by citing a Harvard
University professor, Bush cut her off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consider the source,'' he said mischievously, to copious
laughter. ``If she had said a Calvin professor, I would have been
listening.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush attended the business school at Harvard University several
years after he graduated from Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   The debate, broadcast nationally on MSNBC, was the third time in
just five days that the suddenly debate-mad Republicans had shared
a stage. The dense cluster of encounters reflected the intensifying
pace of the campaign for the nomination, with the first state
contest, the Iowa caucuses, just two weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   But this was the first Republican debate in Michigan, which
holds its primary, a potentially pivotal one, on Feb. 22.

FORMER ENERGY OFFICIAL BLAMED FOR SETBACKS IN LASER CONSTRUCTION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The principal architect of the $4.5 billion program to ensure
the safety and reliability of the nation's nuclear stockpile bears
prime responsibility for cost overruns and scheduling delays at a
colossal laser in California, a panel commissioned by Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson has found.
</P>
<P>
   The laser, called the National Ignition Facility and known by
the acronym NIF, would create conditions similar to those in
nuclear weapons, allowing scientists to study the properties of
such weapons without exploding them. It would also enable officials
to certify that the stockpile was safe and effective _ so-called
stockpile stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   Although the project was originally expected to cost $1.2
billion and to be finished by 2003, Richardson angrily announced in
September that he had been informed of the overruns by laser
officials. The project also suffered other setbacks, including the
resignation of its director, E. Michael Campbell, amid questions
about his academic credentials.
</P>
<P>
   The panel that Richardson appointed to investigate the problems,
led by Dr. John McTague, a former vice president for technical
affairs at the Ford Motor Co., released a draft report Monday. The
panel, which is formally a subcommittee of the Secretary of Energy
Advisory Board, said that ``no one gets a passing grade on NIF
management,'' criticizing an absence of clear lines of
accountability at the Energy Department, Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory, where the laser is under construction, and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The report reserved its most scathing language for Dr. Victor H.
Reis, who until July was the assistant secretary of energy for
defense programs. One of Reis' responsibilities was the stockpile
stewardship program, whose creation he oversaw in response to the
nation's moratorium on nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
   The report said, for example, that the requested size of a
contingency fund to cover unexpected technical setbacks was far too
small for an installation that would be the world's most powerful
laser. ``Victor Reis should not have approved a budget based on a
contingency factor of 15 percent,'' the report said. ``Such a
contingency may be appropriate for an apartment building,'' it
added, ``but it is not appropriate for a technologically intensive
project, such as NIF.''
</P>
<P>
   Reis resigned from the Energy Department in July after a
disagreement with Richardson over how to reorganize the department
after accusations that China might have stolen designs for American
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Mullins, executive director of the Secretary of Energy
Advisory Board, said the Energy Department had no influence on the
wording of the report. ``We firewall,'' Ms. Mullins said, adding
that department officials were ``very respectful not to get
involved in the writing of these reports in terms of the
recommendations that they make.''
</P>
<P>
   Reis expressed surprise that the findings focused on his role in
approving the contingency fund, since earlier reviews done outside
the department had found no problems with it. ``We had two
specific, independent reviews,'' he said. ``Neither of those
indicated that there was problem with the contingency.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I did not have a large staff here, so I really had
to depend on those external reviews.''
</P>
<P>
   But McTague said, ``Vic Reis was named because the key decisions
occurred on his watch; the buck stopped there.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel found that several unexpected technical difficulties
would slow the project and make it more expensive, but that the
project could be completed with ``additional funds, an extension of
the schedule'' and other measures, like an overhaul of the
management structure.
</P>
<P>
   Those difficulties include problems with maintaining ultraclean
conditions in the long beam lines through which 192 laser beams
would travel before converging on a fusion fuel pellet, heating and
compressing it until it releases a burst of fusion energy. Dust
motes in the beam lines can disrupt the lasers and prevent them
from reaching the pellets with full power.
</P>
<P>
   The panel did not arrive at a precise estimate for the cost
overruns, but suggested that the project should be rescheduled in
such a way that 96 of the beams were completed first, with the
other 96 beams added later. Completion of the second set of beams
could be put off until as late as 2008, the report said, a schedule
that would put the laser five years behind its original timetable,
although some experiments could be completed before then. Officials
involved in the project have estimated that the cost overruns could
be as high as several million dollars.
