<HEADLINE> Roundup: Speedy Poverty Reduction Urged at UNCTAD X </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Reducing poverty is a key to
the development of the developing countries and a basis for their
integration into the globalizing world.
</P>
<P>
This is a consensus reached at the 10th session of the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development, which is being held
here from February 12 to 19.
</P>
<P>
James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, said that the
prospects for future reduction in the numbers of those living in
poverty do not look bright.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty remains intractable despite economic growth in many
countries," Wolfensohn said, citing that by 2008 the same number
of people, about 1.2 billion world-wide, may still be living on
under one U.S. dollar a day.
</P>
<P>
This situation reflects the problem of income inequality, which
in turn reflects inequality of opportunity, the World Bank chief
said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the two-way relationship between poverty and
growth, Wolfensohn said rapid growth is a necessary if not a
sufficient condition for poverty reduction, but persistent poverty
and inequality can reduce growth rates.
</P>
<P>
He urges for equitable and inclusive investment in human
capital and for wider access to the infrastructure and capital
needed to broaden the basis of opportunity.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund Michel
Camdessus said that the slowness of progress in reducing poverty
appears "all the more unacceptable," considering the positive
dynamics at work in the world.
</P>
<P>
"The widening gaps between rich and poor within nations and the
gulf between the most affluent and most impoverished nations are
morally outrageous, economically wasteful and potentially socially
explosive," Camdessus said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the world to work together to build up the
capacity of developing countries to fight against poverty and to
mobilize the necessary resources to support their efforts.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the developed countries to support the efforts of
the poorest countries by assigning the highest priority to
providing unrestricted market access for all exports from the
poorest countries, by working strenuously to encourage flows of
private capital to the lower-income developing countries and by
backing up all the pledges to reduce poverty with financial
support.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to help reduce poverty, Director-General of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) Mike Moore urged the developed
countries and international agencies to respond collectively to
the problems of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs).
</P>
<P>
Moore said that the best response to LDCs problems should be an
integrated response by all donors and international agencies.
</P>
<P>
"We already have the Integrated Framework for trade related
technical assistance," he said, referring to the framework as an
opportunity to do something really valuable for the developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
LDCs account for only 0.5 percent of world trade and the most
marginalized group of countries in world trade.
</P>
<P>
"They need both free access to markets -- both developed and
among their other developing partners -- and even more importantly,
assistance to build up their institutional and human capacity, and
their infrastructure," Moore said, adding that "this is a moral
and an economic imperative."
</P>
<P>
Moore called for greater efforts to achieve well designed
programs in and for the LDCs and greater coherence within and
among the international agencies involved in assisting the LDCs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wolfensohn of the World Bank noted that trade
liberalization alone is not a "panacea" for growth and poverty
reduction.
</P>
<P>
He said that if liberalization is to deliver its potential
benefits, governments need to take, and external partners need to
support, a range of complementary action in areas such as
infrastructure upgrading, governance and institutional reform and
social investment in education and health care.

<HEADLINE> China Beats Thailand in Thomas Cup Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese men's badminton
team won its first victory over Thailand 4-1 in the second-round
of the Thomas and Uber Cup Asian Zone Qualifier here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese players looked a bit tense and nervous and almost
lost their control of the game early the match as Chen Hong, now
ranked 11th in the world, suffered a straight 0-2 loss in the
opening match to Thailand's Polsana Boonsak, who ranked 48th in
the world.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old obscure Thai didn't give Chen any chance to
get back during the 40-minute match and grabbed his victory by 15-
8 and 15-10.
</P>
<P>
In the doubles match, Zhang Jun and Zhang Wei also met strong
resistance from Thailand's Kitikul Kitipon and Sudhisodhi Khunakom.
After taking the first game by 15-8, the Chinese lost the second
10-15. However, they rallied up after a 7-7 tie in the third game
and beat the Thais 15-9.
</P>
<P>
The match lasted 65 minutes. Starting from the third match,
however, the Chinese seemed to have regained their confidence and
began to display their formidable might and excellent skills. It
cost them only one and a half hours to win the last three matches,
all at a score of 2-0, and seal a satisfactory 4-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
The Thais didn't field their best doubles players, world 11th
ranked Pramote Teerawiwatana and Tesana Panvisvas, with
replacements Sudket Prapakamol and Patapol Ngernsrisuk against Liu
Yong and Yu Jinhao. The Chinese duo didn't have much trouble to
win the match 15-5, 15-8 within 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"It is always hard to play the first singles in the first
match of a team, especially for a young man like Chen Hong, who
never played in team matches before," commented Li Yongbo, general
coach of the Chinese badminton team.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there should be any problem for us to qualify
and reach the Thomas Cup finals," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who looked very upset after his defeat, said that he
failed to fully relax himself during the match and therefore
couldn't find the right feeling to play.
</P>
<P>
In other matches of the Thomas Cup second-round qualifier,
Hong Kong, China, edged Chinese Taipei 3-2 while; the Republic of
Korea beat Singapore 5-0 and India beat Japan (leading by 3-1 by
press time).
</P>
<P>
In the first match of the Uber Cup second-round qualifying,
Indonesia beat India 4-1; Hong Kong beat Chinese Taipei 3-2; Japan
beat Singapore 5-0 and the DPRK Korea beat Thailand 5-0.

<HEADLINE> Greece Concerned Over Situation in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Greece Thursday voiced its
concern over the developments in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo
and condemned all terrorist actions on Serb targets.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman Panos Beglitis said Thursday
that Greece was concerned over peace in Kosovo following the
attacks of ethnic Albanians on members of the Serb community in
the northern town of Mitrovica, which, split between the
predominantly-Serb north and the almost exclusively ethnic
Albanian south, has been a flashpoint for the ethnic tensions
plaguing Kosovo as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Greek foreign ministry condemned all terrorist
actions on Serb targets and urged the ethnic Albanian leadership
in Kosovo to isolate all terrorist elements.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reaffirmed Greece's position on Kosovo, saying
that Greece called for the implementation of the U.N. Security
Council resolution 1244 which provides for the safeguarding of
Kosovo's territorial integrity as a part of Yugoslavia within the
framework of the respect of human rights of the ethnic communities
living in the region.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis described the
situation in Kosovo as dangerous, warning that the peace in the
Yugoslav province could collapse if the conflicts continued.
</P>
<P>
Violence erupted between the two communities earlier this month
and two French peacekeeping soldiers were wounded and one ethnic
Albanian sniper died in a gunfight on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Greece currently has a strong battalion of 1,200 men being
stationed in Urosevac and Kosovo Polje in southern Kosovo, but a
Greek company of 120 soldiers has been ordered to rush to the
northern Kosovo town of Mitrovica as a reinforcement for French
and British troops there.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Recommends Tuvalu as U.N. Member State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Thursday recommended that Tuvalu be admitted
as member state of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Security Council had a vote this morning with
the result of 14 in favor and one abstention.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the voting, Chinese Deputy Permanent
Representative to the United Nations, Shen Guofang, said the
Chinese Government attached great importance to the desire of
Tuvalu for joining in the United Nations and the Chinese
delegation believed that as a member state of the United Nations,
a country should truly implement the obligations contained in the
Charter of the United Nations and seriously abides by the
resolution 2758 of the U.N.General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
This was the important basis on which to judge whether a
country has met the standards of being a member state of the
United Nations, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation also believed that the most important
thing is that the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter and
the resolution of the General Assembly should be implemented, Shen
said.
</P>
<P>
Proceeding from this principled position, the Chinese
delegation could not support Security Council's recommendation to
the General Assembly for accepting Tuvalu as a new member state,
Shen noted.
</P>
<P>
Proceeding form the long-term interests of the peoples of
China and Tuvalu, and also taking into consideration the requests
from different parties, China was not going to block this
recommendation, Shen added.
</P>
<P>
Tuvalu will become the 189th member state of the United
Nations if the General Assembly approves.
</P>
<P>
Tuvalu, a tiny pacific island nation, has a population of
about 10,500 and an area of some 26 sq. kms.

<HEADLINE> Greece, UK Still Concerned Over Austrian Political Developments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Greece and Britain are still
concerned over the recent political developments in Austria
following the rise of the Austrian far right and its participation
in the country's new coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after their talks in Athens Thursday, which, among
others, also touched the political situation in Austria, both
Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou and visiting British
Deputy Agriculture Minister Joyce Quinn said that their respective
governments shared the same views on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou also confirmed that he had recently a phone
conversation with his British counterpart, Robin Cook, to discuss
the participation of the extreme-right Freedom Party, led by Joerg
Haider, in Austria's new coalition government.
</P>
<P>
On her part, Quinn said that Europe must continue to be
concerned over Austria's political developments.
</P>
<P>
Greece has made it clear that governments of European Union (EU)
countries should respect in practice the principles and values
which led to the creation of the union.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Coalition of the Left and Progress and its youth ring
have also staged a rally outside the Austrian embassy in Athens to
protest the reappearance of the Austrian far right.

<HEADLINE> Irish PM Says Did Not Support N.Irish Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern said on Thursday that his government had not supported
Britain's decision last week to suspend the power-sharing
executive in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that his meetings with British Prime Minister
Tony Blair and other parties on Wednesday had been constructive.
</P>
<P>
"Unilateral suspension was not something that the government
supported because it was in breach of the British-Irish Agreement,
" a Reuters report quoted Ahern as saying in a speech to the Irish
parliament in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
But Ahern added that Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Peter
Mandelson had suspended the Belfast government, in which
Protestant and Roman Catholic politicians had shared power,
because he believed any other course of action would have created
more problems.
</P>
<P>
Britain decided last Friday to suspend the province's home rule
coalition of majority Protestants and minority Catholics on the
grounds that the Ireland Republic Army (IRA) guerrillas had not
given a clear commitment to disarm.
</P>
<P>
The crisis deepened earlier this week when the IRA broke off
contact with the province's disarmament commission.
</P>
<P>
Blair and Ahern held talks in London on Wednesday with leading
Northern Ireland politicians. Both declared that all sides
remained committed to the peace process launched by the landmark
1998 Good Friday Agreement but there was no sign of progress on
the impasse over arms.

<HEADLINE> OAU, U.S. Envoy to Mediate Ethio-Eritrea Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United States will
send envoys to Ethiopia to mediate the Ethio-Eritrea border
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian News Agency reported on Thursday that Ahmed Ouyahia,
a special envoy of OAU Chairman Algerian President Abdul Aziz
Bouteflika and former U.S. national security advisor and the
presidential envoy Anthony Lake will come to Addis Ababa next
week.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian official reiterated his country's commitment to
the peaceful resolution of the Ethio-Eritrean border conflict in
line with the OAU framework agreement and modalities for the
implementation of the agreement that were adopted by the OAU
summit in Algiers in last July.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the technical arrangement which is part of OAU's
peace plan, the official said unless the arrangements are
substantially reworked to reflect the framework agreement and the
modalities, it would be difficult to find a peaceful solution to
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The status quo ante must be returned in full and the lack of
clarity and the obvious ambiguity of the technical arrangements in
this regard is something that Ethiopia will never accept, he
emphasized.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Political Parties and Groups in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The 6th parliamentary elections,
to be held on Friday, will be a crucial battle between the rival
reformist and conservative factions for a new power balance.
</P>
<P>
For the first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution, political
parties and groups with different backgrounds actively take part in
the polling in favor of different factions.
</P>
<P>
The following is a brief introduction of political parties and
groups in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
</P>
<P>
Political parties and groups appeared in Iran after the World
War II and actively entered political arena in the 1960s. After the
Islamic revolution, most of political parties and groups were
dissolved or outlawed, though the law on political parties and
groups was approved in 1981 by the Majlis (parliament).
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Iran announced again to allow activities of political
parties and groups, but ordered them to register and receive
permission from the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
A five-member Commission of Article 10 of Parties Law was formed
by representatives of the State Prosecutor General, the Judiciary,
the government and two Majlis deputies to supervise activities of
parties and groups.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the commission Ali Movahhedi Savoji announced on
January 29 that the government has so far issued permits to 111
political parties and groups.
</P>
<P>
Iran's legal parties and groups are believed to be subordinate
to three main factions or camps, the leftist (reformist), the
centralist (moderate) and the rightist (conservative).
</P>
<P>
The leftist camp is led by the Islamic Iran Participation Front,
the Assembly of Combatant Clergy, the Islamic Revolution's
Mujahedin Organization, the Union of Islamic Association of
University Students (Unity Consolidation Office).
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Reza Khatami, younger brother of President Mohammad
Khatami, and former Majlis Speaker Mehdi Karubi are believed to be
the leaders of the camp which strongly supports the reformist
policies of President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The centralist camp includes mainly the Party of Constructive
Executives of Iran, the Moderation and Development Party. Former
Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi and some senior officials of
the government of former President Hashemi Rafsanjani are prominent
figures in the camp.
</P>
<P>
Famous groups in the rightist camp are the Society of Combatant
Clergy, the Islamic Coalition Society and the newly-formed Society
of Islamic Revolution Devotees.
</P>
<P>
The current Majlis Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri is believed to
be the leader of the rightist camp and the prominent figures
include former Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, Secretary
of the Guardians Council Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati.
</P>
<P>
The leftist camp was isolated in the 4th Majlis elections in
1992, but returned to the scene in the 5th Majlis elections in
1996.
</P>
<P>
On the threshold of the 1997 presidential elections, the leftist
camp joined hands with the centralist camp to help Khatami win an
unexpected landslide victory over the rightist.
</P>
<P>
In order to win the 6th Majlis elections on Friday, some 18
leftist and centralist parties and groups joined the "May 23
Front," which was formed in support of Khatami after 1997
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
About 19 rightist political parties and groups formed "the
Coalition of Followers of the Line of the Imam (Ayatollah Musavi
Khomeini) and the Leader (Ayatollah Ali Khamenei)" against the "May
23 Front."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some opposition groups led by the Freedom Movement of
Iran and National Front also formed "the Coalition of National and
Religious Forces" in support of the reformers to run for the Friday
polling.
</P>
<P>
However, many other parties and groups announced to be
independent from the three major coalitions.

<HEADLINE> Most Palestinians, Israelis Pessimistic Over Prospect of Peace: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 17 (Xinhua) -- As the Israeli-Palestinian
peace track stuck in an impasse, an opinion poll published here
Thursday showed over half of the Israelis and Palestinians are
pessimistic over the prospect of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, 54.6 percent of Israelis and 60.8 percent
of Palestinians believed that even if they were separated in two
states as part of a peace accord, the deeply-rooted hostilities
would probably or surely not end.
</P>
<P>
Conducted by the Jerusalem Media and Communication Centre, a
Palestinian media service based on Arab East Jerusalem, the poll
also indicated that only 23.5 percent of the Palestinians believed
the Israeli government sincerely wants peace with them.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, on both
interim and permanent issues, have ground to a halt in the last 13
days over a dispute on an overdue Israeli troop withdrawal from the
West Bank. The Palestinians accused Israel of violating signed
agreements and harming mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
The two sides missed the self-imposed deadline on February 13
for reaching a framework agreement on the final status issues such
as the status of the Palestinian entity, the future of Jerusalem,
Jewish settlements and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Talks over these thorny issues have made little headway since
they were launched last September.
</P>
<P>
The latest poll reflected the wide gaps between the two sides
over these sensitive issues. For example, 65.8 percent of the
Israelis polled are opposed to the dismantling of Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, while 67.3 percent of
the Palestinians said all the settlements should be removed.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the poll showed that most Israelis have
realized that a Palestinian state would be an inevitable reality.
Ironically, 78.1 percent of the Israelis surveyed thought there
would be a Palestinian state in the future, while only 52.5 percent
of the Palestinians believed that a Palestinian state would be
established.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have threatened to declare statehood by
September if the two sides fail to reach a final peace treaty in
the month as scheduled in their latest interim agreement signed in
Sharm el Sheikh of Egypt last September.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wholesale Prices Remain Unchanged in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
January's performance in Producer Price Index (PPI), which
measures inflation pressures before they reach the consumer,
followed a tiny 0.1 percent increase in December, smaller than
previously thought.
</P>
<P>
Last month, cigarette prices fell by 4.9 percent, the largest
decline since August 1993. However, if excluding cigarette prices,
wholesale prices would have risen 0.2 percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, outside the volatile energy and food categories, the
"core" rate of inflation at the wholesale level declined by 0.2
percent in January, suggesting that most other prices are under
control. Many analysts predicted that the core rate would actually
rise by 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that for all of 1999, wholesales prices
grew by 3 percent reflecting a big rebound in energy costs. In
1998, wholesale prices were flat.
</P>
<P>
In January, all energy prices increased by a solid 0.7 percent,
following a 0.4 percent gain the month before. Production limits
by oil-producing nations and increased demand because of winter
weather accounted for the rise in energy costs.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices rose by a sizable 3 percent, while heating oil
jumped by a whopping 6.2 percent. But residential natural gas
prices fell by 0.2 percent and residential electric power prices
dropped by 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Total food costs rose a slim 0.1 percent in January as falling
prices for vegetables, fruits, turkeys and chickens helped offset
rising prices for eggs, beef, pork and fish.
</P>
<P>
Other factors contributing to January's performance in overall
wholesale prices: light-truck prices fell by a sharp 0.8 percent,
while car prices rose 0.1 percent. Airplane prices, however, rose
a sizable 1 percent, the biggest gain in five years.
</P>
<P>
In another report, the Labor Department said the number of new
claims for unemployment benefits fell by an expected 20,000 to 283,
000 for the week ending Saturday. That was the first decline in
four weeks. The four-week moving average that smoothes out week-to-
week volatility, however, rose to 281,500.

<HEADLINE> Ottawa Stresses Canadian Values on Issue of Talisman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government has
reiterated its stand not to impose sanctions on the Calgary-based
Talisman Energy Inc. in the face of pressure from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloy Axworthy said Wednesday that
Ottawa makes its own policy in Canada "based on Canadian values
and Canadian judgment as to the most effective way to support the
peace process in Sudan."
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the United States announced sanctions
in the same day against the Sundan's Greater Nile Petroleum
Operating Company Ltd. The United States has been accusing the
Sudanese government of using oil revenues in its war against
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The unilateral action is not shared by its northern neighboring
country. As Canada's largest independent oil producer, Talisman
owns 25 percent of the Greater Nile project which is worth 1.2
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company Ltd. was the
latest on the U.S. sanction list of more than 120 Sudanese
companies and government agencies.

<HEADLINE> Millennium Forum Aims to Give Global Civil Society a Collective Voice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- In an unprecedented
effort to bring a more holistic approach to solving global
problems, the Millennium Forum will bring together more than a
thousand representatives of citizen's groups from all over the
world to consult about the "United Nations for the 21st Century."
</P>
<P>
Scheduled for May 22-26 at the U.N. Headquarters in New York,
the Millennium Forum in particular will strive to solicit the best
thinking of civil society in all its sectors worldwide as they
relate to six broad themes: peace, the eradication of poverty,
human rights, the environment, globalization, and the
strengthening of the world body.
</P>
<P>
The Millennium Forum will be held as part of preparations for
the 55th U.N. General Assembly session in September, known as "the
Millennium Assembly."
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan advised the convocation of
the Millennium Assembly and the Millennium Summit in order to
shape the future of the 188-member United Nations and to make the
world body much stronger in meeting challenges in the new century.
</P>
<P>
In tackling such a wide range of issues, and in its attempts
to reach a new level of global diversity and participation, the
Forum is unique for a United Nations-related civil society
conference -- and it reflects the vanguard of thinking about how
civil society can play a more effective role in addressing
pressing challenges.
</P>
<P>
"The expansion and increasing activism of civil society has
changed the way a whole range of social, environmental and
economic issues are understood and approached worldwide," said
Techeste Ahderom, co-chair of the Forum. "This expansion and
activism of civil society has given rise to a whole new
methodology of 'people's participation' in solving complexing
human problems."
</P>
<P>
"The next step in this evolving process is for civil society
to find its collective voice in a manner that is more widely
representative of all of the world's peoples -- and it is to that
end that the Millennium Forum promises a significant step forward,
" Ahdernom said.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the Millennium Forum seeks to create a process
whereby the input from global civil society can be collected and
consulted upon in an open, transparent and representative manner,
reflecting democratic principles, the organizers said.
</P>
<P>
The Forum will focus on six main sub-themes under the main
theme of "the United Nations for the 21st Century." Specifically,
these main sub-themes are: peace, security and disarmament, the
eradication of poverty (including debt cancellation and social
development), human rights, sustainable development and the
environment, the challenges of globalization, and the
strengthening of the United Nations and other international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Up to 1,200 representatives of non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) and other groups of civil society are expected to gather at
the United Nations in May to discuss these topics through an
program of "interactive plenaries" that have been designed to
advance the often overly "compartmentalized" process of discussion
that often take place at international meetings, the organizers
said.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Chief to Tour Flood Areas in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. children's
agency chief is scheduled to tour flood-affected areas of
Mozambique Friday in order to get a first-hand look at the agency'
s response to a disaster that has created urgent humanitarian
needs for 150,000 people, including 30,000 children, and which has
sparked concern over outbreaks of disease.
</P>
<P>
The executive director of the United Nation's Children's Fund
(UNICEF), Carol Bellamy, will travel by helicopter to the affected
areas, and will visit with local officials and residents hit by
the country's worst flooding in 50 years, UNICEF officials said
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During the tour, Bellamy is expected to be accompanied by
Mozambique's health minister and the director of disaster
management, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF is currently pre-positioning supplies of medicine to
combat potential outbreaks of cholera and malaria. Contaminated
water and an increase in the mosquito population are responsible
for the heightened threat of disease.
</P>
<P>
"Even though the water is receding, in many areas we remain
very concerned about the possibility of disease," said UNICEF
Representative Mark Stirling in Maputo, capital of Mozambique. "
Our approach has been to get the needed drugs in place before
outbreaks occur, hopefully giving local communities a chance to
stop the problem before it starts."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, UNICEF sent 500 kilograms of urgently needed
medical supplies by helicopter to the isolated town of Chokwe, and
will dispatch high-energy biscuits to this area Friday for the
large number of malnourished children who have been without food
since the beginning of the week.
</P>
<P>
A 40-ton shipment of essential medicines and medical supplies
arrived in Maputo Wednesday, flown in from UNICEF's supply center
in Copenhagen, Denmark. UNICEF is helping the Government of
Mozambique to strategically position and distribute these supplies,
which also include 500,000 sachets or oral rehydration salts, said
the officials.

<HEADLINE> Canada, U.S. Open Talks on Smog Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Canada is in talks with the
United States on a cross-border smog treaty, The Ottawa Citizen
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Environment Minister David Anderson launched
negotiations with the United States Wednesday in a bid to complete
a deal by September, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Anderson was quoted as saying Canada must be serious about smog
reductions at home before seeking new guarantees from Americans to
cut their smokestack emissions.
</P>
<P>
Canadian studies show 30 to 50 percent of smog-causing
pollution in the Windsor-Quebec City corridor comes from the U.S.
sources. Up to 90 percent of smog in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia
originates in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Officials in New York have a different story, saying Ontario,
Canada's most populated province at the sourthern border, has lax
smog controls and has caused health problems and pollution in that
state.
</P>
<P>
Ontario's coal and oil-fired power plants will be three times
higher than New York State's plant by 2003, American officials say.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbouring areas are the key in the on-going talks
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Minister Anderson Wednesday welcomed a commitment from Ontario
Environment Minister Tony Clement, who has pledged to match any
action taken by the U.S. government to curb emissions.
</P>
<P>
"That will be the key to success in negotiations because, if we
don't have Ontario doing as much as the Americans, the Americans
are unlikely to listen to the Canadian government," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency set tough rules last
year requiring U.S. coal-fired plants in 22 states to cut nitrogen-
oxide emissions 28 percent by 2007.
</P>
<P>
Ontario has pledged to cut nitrogen-oxide emissions by 45
percent,but it doesn't expect to meet that target until 2015, the
newspaper said.

<P>
The U.N. chief expressed the concern that civilians were still
being deliberately targeted in different front-line areas in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to all parties involved to respect the rights of
noncombatants to be treated as civilians as well as their right to

The U.N. Secretary-General reiterated his call on all parties
to cooperate fully with the United Nations in the provision of
relief assistance for the survival of affected population.
</P>

Annan also expressed his concern over the recent fighting that
has led to significant population displacement in the country and
hoped that all parties would take urgent measures to halt the

<HEADLINE> Bank Of England Calms Interest Rate Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 17 (Xinhua) - The Bank of England has moved to
calm fears that big jumps in high street sales and average
earnings would force up interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Bank published a benign report Thursday on the UK's
inflation outlook, hinting that interest rates may not rise much
more this year.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics' figures show retail sales
in January grew by 1.5 percent to finish 6.1 percent up on the
year -the highest annual rate of increase for two years.
</P>
<P>
They followed Wednesday's figures showing average earnings in
December rising at an annual rate of 5.5 percent - above the 4.5
percent threshold which the Bank regards as being consistent with
the Government's inflation target.
</P>
<P>
Mervyn king, Deputy Governor of the Bank, told a press
conference that inflation was on course to hit the government's 2.
5 percent target in two years' time, and that Britain's brisk
economic growth would soon start to slow.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Says Inflation Dangers Still Existing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan Thursday cautioned that inflation dangers
still exist and said interest rates may have to rise to prevent
the booming U.S. economy from overheating.
</P>
<P>
In key testimony to U.S. Congress, Greenspan said cooling
domestic demand, fired up by outsized increases in the stock
market, now was more pressing than before as mounting economic
imbalances threatened the record-breaking expansion.
</P>
<P>
Even though inflation has remained low outside of a burst in
energy prices, this favorable condition cannot last unless the
growth rate slows to less than the 4 percent gains of the past
three years, Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
"The FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) will have to stay
alert for signs that real interest rates have not yet risen enough
to bring the growth of demand into line with that of potential
supply, even should the acceleration in productivity continue,"
Greenspan told the Banking Committee of the U.S. House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
In Fed's twice-a-year formal report on the economy, Greenspan
said productivity-driven gains in the stock market had boosted
consumer spending so much that higher interest rates may be
necessary to bring demand growth back in line with supply. "The
boost to aggregate demand from the marked pickup in productivity
growth implies that the level of interest rates needed to align
demand with potential supply may have increased substantially," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Fed has raised short-term rates four times since June 1999
in an effort to cool the U.S. economy, but Greenspan said he saw "
little evidence" that the economy had slowed down appreciably. The
central bank is widely expected to raise rates once again when its
policy-making FOMC next meets in March.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan noted that tight labor markets have yet to increase
wage pressures. Even if the gains in productivity continue, he
said, they could have a downside for the economy by pushing
soaring stock prices even higher.
</P>
<P>
As part of his testimony, Greenspan presented the Fed's new
economic forecast for 2000. In terms of growth, the Fed said it
expected output to grow by between 3.5 and 3.75 percent. Inflation
at the consumer level was forecast at between 1.75 and 2.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Greenspan also urged Congress to devote the huge
federal budget surpluses being generated by the good economic
times to paying down the national debt rather than using the money
for increased federal spending or cutting taxes.

<HEADLINE> Defense Chief Praises New Federal Tactics in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev on Thursday praised the new tactics employed by federal
troops in fighting Chechen rebels and predicted that the military
operation will end shortly.
</P>
<P>
"I think that the operation will be completed in the near
future," Sergeyev said, referring to the military campaign
launched in the breakaway republic last September.
</P>
<P>
The federal forces have made great headway in the past few
weeks, driving rebels out of the strategically important Chechen
capital of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
The federal troops have only to "finish the bandits off in the
gorges and mountains" in southern Chechnya, the Interfax news
agency quoted the defense chief as saying.
</P>
<P>
He commended his forces for their new tactics of "remote war,
which is advantageous for us and extremely disadvantageous for the
bandits."
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said "remote defeat" is being inflicted to the rebels
by federal artillery and aerial strikes and that casualties among
the Russian troops "have been much reduced" to two to three a day.
</P>
<P>
Up to 3,000 rebels continue to resist the federal troops in the
southern mountains, but they are "fragmented and dispersed," the
minister said.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Opposition Leader Asks Savimbi's Followers to Lay Down Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Angolan opposition leader
Eugenio Manuvakola Thursday appealed to the rebel soldiers to lay
down their arms and abandon their leader Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Manuvakola, head of the Renovated Commission of the National
Union for Total Independence of Angola (RC of UNITA), said at the
Luanda International Airport upon his return from Paris that the
rebels following Savimbi are currently committing "suicide".
</P>
<P>
The repentant rebel leader visited France, Belgium and Italy as
part of his party's effort to bring the UNITA members living in
those countries together for peace, unity and national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
"We have been carrying a diplomatic campaign aimed at
explaining to the members of the party outside the country that
continuing to follow Jonas Savimbi constitutes a suicide", he
said.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader said that a considerable number of UNITA
militants living abroad have started to understand the appeal for
unity and national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
On the results of his one-month visit to the three European
countries, Manuvakola said it was positive,during which he met
with government officials of these countries who advised him to
keep on isolating Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Manuvakola and other repentant UNITA militants set up the
Renovated Commission of UNITA in September 1998, expelling Savimbi
from the leadership, through an extraordinary congress in January
1999.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Likely to Continue Importing Food: Institution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe is likely to continue
relying on importing such basic food products as wheat and maize,
the Zimbabwe Financial Holdings (Finhold) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the 1999/2000 season, the total maize production is expected
to be about 1.6 million tons against a national consumption figure
of about 1.9 million tons, Finhold, a leading financial
institution in Zimbabwe, said in its latest economic review.
</P>
<P>
Shortages of essential farming inputs such as fuel and
fertilizers and the late start of the rainy season would result in
low agricultural production, Finhold said.
</P>
<P>
Finhold also noted that there is a shortage of foreign currency
in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Although tourism is said to have the greatest potential for
generating foreign currency and creating employment, the financial
institution said there is no serious commitment by stakeholders to
enhance development.
</P>
<P>
"Performance in the tourism industry is likely to be below
expectations due to the critical shortage of fuel prevailing in
the country," it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the export of tobacco, soya beans and other farm
products is expected to be hampered by the managed exchange rate
which lowers the export revenue from these agricultural produce in
local currency terms.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Minister Calls for Efforts to Solve Economic Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior Zimbabwean official
stressed here Thursday that the government should take its
economic problems seriously.
</P>
<P>
Florence Chitauro, minister of Public Service, Labour and
Social Welfare, said that voters' recent rejection of the draft
constitution is a warning to the government that people are not
happy with the negative economic situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
she said although the ruling Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-PF) would be challenged on an economic
platform in the forthcoming parliamentary elections, the public
should understand that correction of economic problems was not
something that could be overcome overnight.
</P>
<P>
She told the Zimbabwe News Agency: "We have taken this
seriously and even the president has accepted the outcome of the
referendum."  "We now have to sit and find the way forward that
is why there will be an emergency central committee meeting
tomorrow (Friday)," she said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that it would be interesting to know as well
from those who campaigned for the "no" vote what their way forward
was.
</P>
<P>
She denied views coming from some political circles that
Zanu-PF was happy with the rejection of the draft constitution
because it preferred the Lancaster House Constitution which
ensured jobs for all present cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabweans rejected the draft constitution with 53.2 percent
people voting against the document and 44.1 percent people
supporting it in the constitutional referendum on February 12 and
13.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Company to Build Steel Factory in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. corporation Enron will
build a factory making steel slabs at Beluluane, some 17
kilometers west of the Mozambican capital Maputo.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. company and the Maputo provincial government signed
here Thursday a memorandum of understanding on the Maputo Iron and
Steel Project.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican authorities have granted the project 400
hectares of land in Beluluane which is expected to become an
industrial park.
</P>
<P>
The iron and steel factory is the anchor project for the use of
the natural gas from Pande in southern Inhambane Province.
</P>
<P>
Enron's plan is to use the gas in the iron ore reduction
process prior to the manufacturing of the steel slabs. The ore
itself is expected to come largely from Phalaborwa in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to the memorandum, Enron will inject a direct foreign
 investment of 1.1 billion U.S. dollars for the first phase of the
project and approximately 400 million dollars for the gas project.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase, the factory is expected to produce about
two million tons of steel slabs per year, to be exported through
the port of Maputo.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the factory is scheduled to begin in 2002 and
should be concluded in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Enron's Commercial Director Timothy Rebhorn said here Thursday
that during the construction phase, the factory would employ about
3,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 full-time workers would be needed to operate the
factory, the director said, adding that a further 5,000 jobs will
be created indirectly.

JOHANNESBURG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki said Thursday that his government will continue
discussions with Zimbabwean officials and private companies to
avert a major economic crisis in that country.

<P>
At a news conference after the meeting, Mbeki said that he and

<P>
Mbeki, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel and Mineral and Energy
Affairs Minister Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, met Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe in Harare last week.
</P>

Mbeki said the finance department had not considered offering

Manuel Wednesday refuted claims that South Africa had offered
Zimbabwe an 800-million rand lifeline to shore up its flagging
economy.

MAPUTO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The flood waters of the Limpopo

BAGHDAD, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The resignation of U.N.
officials in Iraq has confirmed the severe unfairness created by
the U.S. and Britain in the oil-for-food program, the Iraqi News
Agency reported Thursday.
</P>

The report quoted Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz as
saying on Wednesday evening that the resignation of top U.N.
humanitarian official in Iraq, Hans von Sponeck, and head of the

<P>
Jutta Burghard resigned on Monday, saying she did so because she
does not see the U.N. resolution 1284 on Iraq can meet its
humanitarian target in the near future.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Aziz slammed the U.S. and Britain for impeding
the approval of contracts Iraq concluded with world companies,
saying that if such contracts were ratified, the living conditions
of the Iraqi people would improve a little bit.
</P>
<P>
In a rare move, Aziz also held U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
responsible for the obstacles and hardships facing the
implementation of the oil-for-food program, which allows Iraq to
export a certain amount of oil and use the revenues to buy
humanitarian goods for its people under U.N. supervision.
</P>
<P>
So far, Iraq has sold a large amount of oil to other countries
but failed to import enough food, medicines and other items because
many contracts were rejected by the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Both Sponeck and Burghard implied that they resigned in protest
against the "human tragedy" caused by the decade-old U.N. sanctions
on Iraq since 1990 following its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Last December, the U.N. Security Council adopted resolution 1284
on Iraq which calls for the return of U.N. arms inspectors to Iraq
in exchange of possible suspension of sanctions. Iraq has rejected
the resolution.

territories and with the Turkish officials' assistance despite the
international norms and laws that the U.S. claims to abide by and
despite the Turkish official statements of respecting Iraq's
sovereignty and territorial integrity," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman slammed the so-called Northern Watch Force in
Turkey which comprises U.S. and British warplanes responsible for
patrolling the northern "no-fly" zone in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department Spokesman James Rubin admitted Monday U.S.
officials visited northern Iraq last week for talks on implementing
a reconciliation agreement between the two major parties in the
region, the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union
of Kurdistan (PUK).
</P>
<P>
The KDP and PUK, at odds over sharing power and revenues in the
region where the Iraqi central government has lost its control,
fought two years of intermittent clashes before the U.S. mediated a
reconciliation agreement between them in Washington in September
1998.
</P>
<P>
"The only solution to such abnormal state in northern Iraq is to
halt the foreign interference in the region in a way which help the
central authority to prevail," concluded the Iraqi spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its western allies unilaterally set up two so-
called no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq after the 1991
Gulf War, claiming it was intended to protect the Kurds in the
north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from attacks of the Iraqi
government.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad does not recognize the two no-fly zone zones, noting
that they were not authorized by the United Nations Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
Bases in Turkey, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia were frequently used by
U.S. and British warplanes in launching attacks against Iraqi
targets in the two zones.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been providing support for Iraqi opposition
factions, including independence-seeking Kurdish parties, with the
aim of overthrowing the Iraqi government under President Saddam
Hussein.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
will in March begin an emergency operation to provide relief food
to an estimated 400,000 people affected by prolonged drought in
the Karimoja region in northeastern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The food will be distributed through gradual geographical
targeting of the most affected areas, Radio Uganda reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The drought has affected Kotido and Moroto districts, forcing
Karimojong warriors to move with their animals to the neighboring
districts of Lira, Katakwi, Soroti, Kumi and Kapchorwa.
</P>
<P>
There have been increasing reports of vehicles being ambushed
by those warriors desperate for food and of high incidents of
cattle rustling among rival Karimojong ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Karimoja is a region often hit by drought, which leads to big
migrations in search of drinking water for both people and cattle.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government
decided Thursday to stabilize foreign exchange, interest rates and
consumer prices to increase exports in order to reverse the trade
deficit, reports here said.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting held later in the day, the government decided to

bankruptcies and bad loans of financial institutions.
</P>
<P>

dollars for this year. The nation enjoyed a trade surplus of 24.5
billion U.S. dollars last year.

CAIRO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
DOHA -- Qatar underestimated the decision which the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries is planning to take to put an end
to the current rising in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
A Qatari official in the oil industry said the current rise in
oil prices is mainly attributed to the speculation process and it
does not reflect the market fundamentals since there is no evidence
for an increase in the demand.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- An official source in the Egyptian telecommunications
sector said the number of the mobile phones subscribers is
approaching 1 million.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Nazeef, minister of telecommunications and information,
said the number of mobile phone subscribers reached 950,000 while
the number of coin cabins reached 17,000 and the number of centrals
in villages reached 91,700.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Saudi Arabian Airlines said it had sold 24 old
aeroplanes to an American Airliner for an amount of 100 million U.S
dollars, pointing out that it plans to start work this year in
building hangars for its new air fleet.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian economic daily Alalam El-Yom on Thursday quoted
Saudi Airlines manager, Khaled Bib Bakr, as saying the company sold
16 Tristar-1011 aircraft and eight Boeing 268-737, operating since
1980, to the Miami-based Custom Air Support.
</P>
<P>
Bin Bakr added that the company plans to start work this year in
constructing hangars and a maintenance center for the new aircraft
at a cost of about 533 million U.S dollars.
</P>
<P>
ALGIERS -- A reliable source in the Bank of Algeria said the
country's external debts at the end of last year reached 28.315
billion U.S dollars, down 2.1 billion dollars from 1998.
</P>
<P>
The source said on Tuesday that the debts' annual service
declined from 47.5 percent in 1998 to 39.05 percent in 1999 thanks
to the rise in world oil prices which led to the increase of
Algeria's revenues from oil exports.
</P>
<P>
There was also an improvement of the foreign debts ratio against
the gross domestic product to 58.9 percent in 1999 from 64.8
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The stake of rescheduled debts equals 51.4 percent while the
multi-parties loans account for 92.9 percent from the total amount
of loans.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, 80 percent of the loans due to the
Organization of Trade and Development in Europe has not been
repaid. The short term loans amounts to 175 million U.S. dollars as
against the total of 28.315 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> US Sanctions on Oil Company in Sudan Is Unilateral: Malaysian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said here Thursday that the move by the United
States to impose trade sanctions on the operations of an oil
company in Sudan is a unilateral action.
</P>
<P>
The move does not restrain Malaysia from investing in the
petroleum sector overseas and Malaysian companies are entitled to
operate anywhere, he told reporters after a meeting of the Supreme
Council of the United Malays National Organization (UMNO) when he
was asked to comment on whether or not the action could affect the
position of the country's oil giant Petronas.
</P>
<P>
Petronas holds 30 percent interest in a consortium known as
Greater Nile Operating Co. which is involved in the Muglad Basin
oil development project in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
However, Mahathir did not dismiss the likelihood of the action
affecting Petronas' operations.
</P>
<P>
Any actions taken by the United States would affect the oil
industry, he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The world currently needs a large amount of oil and sanctions
would only increase the price and decrease supply, he added.

<HEADLINE> Kenya, U.N. Agency Join Hands in Water Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan capital Nairobi
will join a United Nations program on Managing Water in African
Cities in a bid to avert a crisis in the urban water resources.
</P>
<P>
A Memorandum of Understanding was signed Wednesday between
Acting Executive Director of the U.N. Center for Human Settlements
Klaus Toepfer and Kenyan Minister for Local Government J. Kamotho,
Toepfer announced at a press conference here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi-based U.N. agency and the city of Nairobi will
cooperate to design an action plan for water demand management and
establish a joint unit in the city water department, according to
the memorandum.
</P>
<P>
A pilot project will also be initiated demonstrating the use of
water saving technologies, Toepfer said.
</P>
<P>
Another plan for the rehabilitation of the Nairobi Dam will
involve harvesting weeds and setting up community based solutions
to reduce pollution, he said.
</P>
<P>
To promote public awareness of water conservation is also an
important component of the project, he added.
</P>
<P>
The program on Managing Water for African Cities aims to
address the water crisis in Africa by helping cities manage urban
water resources. The project has started in seven cities like
Abidjan, Addis Ababa, Johannesburg and Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent study by the World Commission on Water
for the 21st Century, more than half of Africa's population lack
access to safe water and nearly two-thirds lack adequate
sanitation.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Importers Disappointed at Govt's Ban on Ugandan Fish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan fish importers have
expressed disappointment at the government's delay in lifting the
ban on fish importation from Uganda, the Rwanda News Agency
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The fish importers attacked the government for not addressing
the matter urgently, which has led to a deficit of over 6,000 tons
of fish products.
</P>
<P>
The demand for fish on the Rwandan market is 12,600 tons and
only 6,433 tons were locally produced in 1999, which is
inadequate, according to John Uwumusalaba, an official in charge
of fisheries and fish farming in the Rwandan Ministry of
Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government imposed a ban on fish importation from
Uganda last April following reports of fish poisoning in Uganda,
Tanzania and some parts of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan Agriculture Minister Ephraim Kabaija said that the
cabinet decided the ban and it will only be lifted if Uganda gives
confirmation of safety of their fish products.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) imposed its ban on fish from east
Africa last March following reports of rampant poison fishing on
Lake Victoria, the largest in Africa.
</P>
<P>
EU lifted the ban on Tanzania last December.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Some United Nations
environment experts have begun taking water quality samples from
the contaminated river Danube to help handle the cyanide spill at
a gold mine in northwestern Romania.
</P>
<P>
Klaus Toepfer, executive director of the United Nations
Environment Program (UNEP) based in Nairobi, made the remarks at a
news briefing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that the scientists who worked in Yugoslavia for
the assessing of the environmental impact by the Nato bombing
arrived in Romania Wednesday evening at the request of the
Romanian government.
</P>
<P>
Two mobile laboratories have been moved to Romania for the
emergency sampling, he said, adding if requested by other affected
countries of the region, the laboratories could be available too.
</P>
<P>
"We are also ready to assist the European Commission in its
response to this emergency and the first response must be a
reliable initial assessment of the immediate risks to the
environment and human health," he said.
</P>
<P>
On January 30 a wastage treatment unit at the Baia-Mare gold
mine leaked and about 100 tons of untreated water flowed into the
Danube river.
</P>
<P>
So far the volume of cyanide in the river is 33 times higher
than the normal level and caused a great panic in the region.

<HEADLINE> Austrian President to Visit European Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Austrian President Thomas
Klestil will visit the European Union's executive body on March 8
after his country was isolated by its EU partners following the
swearing-in of its new government which included the far-right
Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
The visit, confirmed here on Thursday by European Commission
sources, will be the first by Klestil who has been serving as
Austrian president for the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
Klestil's visit will coincide with the weekly commission
meeting. The Austrian president will be expected to explain his
country's case and ask for understanding from the European
Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation bloc, as well as
Austria's EU partners, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
Commission sources described the scheduled visit as a formal
one but did not say who will be accompanying the president on his
Brussels tour, or whether he would also visit Belgium, which is a
hard-line opponent against the Austrian incorporation of extreme
rightists into the government.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Foreign Minister Benita Ferrore-Waldner already asked
for understanding by her counterparts from other EU member states
during their council meeting earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
She said the Freedom Party chief Joerg Haider does not speak
for her country, which is constitutionally represented only by its
president, prime minister and foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Austria's 14 EU partners joined hands in isolating the country
after its coalition government between the conservative People's
Party and the far-right Freedom Party was sworn in on February 4.
</P>
<P>
The 14 EU nations agreed to isolate Austria politically and
would not support Austria's representatives seeking positions in
international institutions.
</P>
<P>
But the 14 have agreed to continue working relations with
Austria within the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Haider and his extreme-right party have been criticized for
their non-tolerant and xenophobic approach. It is feared they
will hinder the EU enlargement process that is already underway.
</P>
<P>
Among the 12 applicant countries now seeking EU membership,
Austria borders with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and
Slovenia.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices to Fall Below 25 Dollars Per Barrel: Saudi Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 18 (Xinhua) -- International oil prices will
drop under 25 U.S. dollars per barrel soon, visiting Saudi
Petroleum and Mineral Resources Minister Al Naimi said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The recent rise of oil prices was caused not only by reduced
production, but also by speculative activities, Naimi said at a
meeting with South Korea Commerce, Industry and Energy Minister
Kim Young-ho, who asked Saudi Arabia to make efforts to stabilize
oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Kim said the recent high oil prices are burdening oil-consuming
countries like South Korea and excessively high prices will not be
good for oil-producing countries.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have peaked now and will fall below the 25-dollar
level soon, said Naimi, who arrived here for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Naimi said Saudi Arabia could not act alone even if it wanted
to reduce oil prices because of the regulations by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
Naimi said he believed that 20 to 25 dollars per barrel is the
optimum level for oil prices.

<HEADLINE> Moussa Summons U.S. Ambassador to Express Concern Over South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa Thursday summoned U.S. Ambassador in Cairo Daniel Kurtzer to
express Egypt concern over the worsening situation in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Moussa also appealed to Israel to stop its violation of the
April 1996 Understanding which ended Israel's large-scale "Grape of
Wrath" raid against Lebanon. The understanding bans attacks on or
from civilian areas, but it does not restrict raids on combatants.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Moussa warned that
Israel's continued attacks on Lebanon will lead to very grave
developments.
</P>
<P>
Moussa spelled out Egypt's rejection to Israeli's continued
attacks on civilians and civil installations in Lebanon and as
they are beneficial neither to Lebanon nor to Israel or the
peace tracks.
</P>
<P>
The attacks cast doubt on Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
credibility and his policy towards peace, Moussa pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Asked what the U.S., the major sponsor for the Mideast peace-
making, should do towards the situation, Moussa made
it clear that Cairo has asked Washington to shoulder its
responsibility as sponsor of the peace march in the region in
order to halt the Israeli aggression on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Tensions in south Lebanon mounted when last Tuesday Israel
bombed three Lebanese power plants and injured 15 Lebanese
civilians on retaliation for Lebanese guerrillas' killing of six
Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a border strip in south Lebanon in 1985 with a
claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Takes New Initiative for Agricultural Revival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government has
taken a new initiative to revive the agriculture sector, Minister
for Food, Agriculture and Livestock Shafqat Ali Shah Jamote was

revolves around six parameters including alleviation of rural
poverty, sustainable agriculture, social equity, self-reliance,
enhanced productivity and export orientation.
</P>

of minor crops to 0.36 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Both Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo and Vice President Atiku Abubakar have expressed their
willingness to accept anti-corruption probe, The Guardian, a
leading Nigerian newspaper, reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Abubakar as saying both the president and
himself welcomed the latest amendment to the anti-corruption bill
by the National Assembly which strips them of immunity.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Nigerian community in London during his official
visit to Britain on Wednesday, Abubakar reiterated the
government's commitment to stamping out corruption in both public
and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government is ready to uphold justice and fair
play in its activities and determined to change the international
community's perception of Nigerians as corrupt people.
</P>
<P>
"We have the political will and commitment to implement reforms
and changes to improve the conditions of the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Abubakar, over one billion U.S. dollars has been
recovered from those who looted the country's treasury and about
600 million dollars has been frozen from their accounts abroad.
</P>
<P>
The anti-corruption bill was the first bill sent to the

MOGADISHU, February 17 (Xinhua) -- More than 70 deaths from
cholera have been reported in dozens of villages in southern
Somalia, according to local authorities.
</P>
<P>
Doctors in the region warned that more than 100 people are on
the verge of death in the temporary quarantine facilities
scattered throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
The doctors attributed the spread of the disease mainly to the
poor sanitation and inadequate clean water supplies.
</P>
<P>
A source told reporters Thursday that despite efforts by the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and technical
contributions from the World Health Organization (WHO), the
disease is still spreading because of insufficient medical
supplies.
</P>
<P>
But the cholera epidemic is now becoming sporadic with its
fatalities decreasing in Mogadishu as several quarantine
facilities have been opened to hold the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, anti-dehydration solution and other medical supplies
have been distributed in the quarantine facilities of Mogadishu,
thus bringing about tangible progress in slowing down the spread
of the disease and the number of its victims in the capital.
</P>
<P>
However, monitoring the disease in the remote countryside areas
and villages is difficult.

The shortage of foreign currency had negative repercussions in
the various sectors of the economy especially the energy sector,
hence the need for urgent solutions, he noted.

The composite stock index of the Shanghai Stock Exchange opened

today. The total turnover hit 40.829 billion yuan (4.92 billion U.

TEHRAN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran's legislative elections on
Friday provides a golden chance for the ambitious reformers to beat
the powerful conservatives for a change in the Islamic Republic
under theocratic rule.
</P>
<P>
The reformers, newly-grown in recent two years, hope the Friday
polling will be a replay of the 1997 presidential elections in
which moderate President Mohammad Khatami won an unexpected
overwhelming victory over the powerful conservatives.
</P>
<P>
With a strong support from the people, the radical-turned
reformers expect to take over the Majlis or parliament currently
dominated by the conservatives in order to help President Khatami
push forwards his political reforms.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, then isolated radical and minister of Culture and
Islamic Guidance, was unknown before the presidential race, and he
won wide support after the people were angered when the
government threw its weight behind hard-line candidate Majlis
Speaker Nateq Nouri.
</P>
<P>
His promise and policy for political reforms to establish a
civil society with freedom and democracy helped boost his
popularity not only inside Iran, but also in international arena.
</P>
<P>
Political parties and newspapers sprung up like mushrooms in the
country after Khatami was sworn in. Even opposition and dissidents
turned around to support him to establish a new society with less
restrictions and based on the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
However, the conservatives, following a series of defeats from
the reformers, sensed a threat to the Islamic regime, particularly
to the values and ideals of the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
They believed that the political reforms with western style of
democracy and freedom would bring the Islamic theocratic rule under
question.
</P>
<P>
During the past two and half years, the conservatives wasted no
efforts to pressure Khatami's supporters, both the reformers and
the moderate centralists, to bow to Islamic theocracy.
</P>
<P>
Reformist ministers of Khatami's cabinet came under fire or even
impeached and dismissed by the conservative-dominated parliament,
which has the power to veto his programs.
</P>
<P>
A number of pro-reform newspapers were closed down and
journalists were tried and jailed on charges of taking moves
against
the Islamic system.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the people's expectations, the reformers realized
that they could not tolerate the conservatives any more and the
only way left for them was to oust the conservatives in order to
release the country of the deadlock caused by power struggles.
</P>
<P>
"Reform is indispensable and irreversible," Mohammad Reza
Khatami, a top reformist runner and younger brother of President
Khatami said in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can stop it," he stressed, and experience has shown that
democracy along with reform at every level is the only way to make
the people's dreams come true.
</P>
<P>
"Without political developments (reforms), the country can not
push forwards cultural and economic changes," emphasized Hadi
Khamenei, another well-known reformist candidate and younger
brother of the conservative supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
"Political developments mean that the people should know their
rights and defend their rights and political developments can
remove the hurdles on the way of cultural and economic
developments," he told a student rally on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The young generation, mainly born after the Islamic revolution,
openly demanded rapid changes in the society by ousting the
conservatives, even the centralists who have close links with the
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
In pro-reformist rallies, college and high school students
voiced strong opposition to the re-entry to the parliament of
former President Hashemi Rafsanjani, a well-known and skilled
moderate centralist, who is widely believed to be the future
speaker.
</P>
<P>
"With Hashemi (Rafsanjani), political developments impossible,"
the slogans echoed in various rallies throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The centralists, including Rafsanjani himself, agreed with the
need of reforms in the country, but they are against turbulent
changes through radical ways and proposed to start the process from
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Reformers have foreseen a victory for supporters of President
Khatami in Friday's polling and are confident that the moderate
coalition of reformers and centralists will enjoy a majority in the
future parliament.
</P>
<P>
"The May 23 Front (the moderate coalition) will be able to win
two third of the Majlis seats in the polling and the result is
clear now," Ali Reza Nouri, a top reformist runner, told Xinhua at
a student rally on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With his supporters enjoying a majority in parliament, President
Khatami could step up his control on other key institutions
currently under the rule of the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
However, the sharp difference inside the moderate coalition,
particularly between the reformers and the centralists, may create
some new problems for Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign and local analysts believe that a triangle balance
of reformers, centralists and conservatives will emerge in the
Iranian legislative body.
</P>
<P>
No matter what the result is, an impressive change is predicted
in the Islamic Republic following the Friday polling. Parties and
groups with different political backgrounds are enabled to play
important role in the country.

NEW DELHI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- India's six infrastructure
industries grew by a healthy 8 percent in the first 10 months (
April 1999 to January 2000) of the current fiscal year against 2.9
percent recorded a year ago, the Central Statistical Organization
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The strong growth was powered by steel, cement and petroleum
refineries, despite a slower growth of 5.2 percent in January 2000
due to poor performance of electricity and crude sectors.
</P>
<P>
While steel sector rose by 11.7 percent during the period,
cement sector grew by 15.3 percent and petroleum refinery grew by
23.6 percent.
</P>

However, crude petroleum sector declined by 1.4 percent while
electricity sector rose by 6.9 percent and coal sector only
recorded a growth of 0.1 percent.

The six infrastructure industries account for 26.68 percent of

MANILA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
giving top priority to the construction of the 2,500 kilometers
railway in Mindanao, Transportation and Communications Secretary
Vicente Rivera said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Rivera said in a statement that the railway is expected to
trigger commercial and industrial progress in the southern island,
including the far-flung areas along the rail routes.
</P>
<P>
He said the railway is also believed to enhance Mindanao as an
investment site in the East Growth Area, a growth polygon composed
of Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government is offering the 200-billion-peso (5
billion U.S. dollars) Mindanao Railways Development Project to
foreign developers, said Rivera.
</P>
<P>
Because of the size of the project, the government would have
to divide the project into parts that could be offered to various
developers instead of a single proponent.
</P>
<P>
Conceived during the term of former president Fidel Ramos, the
project will traverse major cities and growth area in the south
including the cities of Zamboanga, Cagayan de Oro, Iligan and
Davao.
</P>
<P>
The first phase is expected to be completed by 2004, while the
entire railway will take around 12 years to complete.

Moscow regards as "utterly unacceptable contacts between

<HEADLINE> Olympic Bidding Hot Topic in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's bid to host the 2008
Olympic Games has become a hot topic of discussion at the ongoing
session of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, and that of
the Beijing Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
More than 400 deputies to the city's People's Congress, or over
50 percent of the total, have signed a proposal supporting the
city's competition for the 2008 games since the session opened
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The deputies say that they are confident the city will win the
bid, as Beijing proved it is capable of holding such a grand-scale
event with the success of the 11th Asian Games held here in 1990
and other large-scale international competitions. The city has
also worked out feasibility plans for the infrastructure
facilities that will be needed.
</P>
<P>
In the past three days, about 300 members of the city's CPPCC
have left messages on the website opened by the Beijing Olympic
Bid Committee to express their best wishes for success.
</P>
<P>
Telephone hotlines opened for the public to show their support
and offer suggestions have been ringing non-stop. Local citizens
are calling the committee representatives with ideas for making
the city more competitive, ranging from cleaning up the
environment to easing traffic congestion.
</P>
<P>
When Beijing decided to apply for the 2008 Olympics last year,
it has launched 18 urgent air pollution control measures and
another 28 measures for improving air quality, and banned the use
of high-sulphur coal in the city proper, said local officials.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has also set aside 46 billion yuan to
substantially improve the air quality of Beijing in the next four
years.
</P>
<P>
On April 7, 1999, the Beijing Olympic Bid Committee formally
presented Beijing's bid report to Juan Antonio Samaranch,
president of the International Olympic Committee at its
headquarters in Switzerland. Beijing's rivals now include Osaka,
Paris, Toronto, Istanbul, Seville, Buenos Aires, and others.
</P>
<P>
Beijing applied in 1991 to host the 2000 Olympic, but lost to
its strong rival Sydney.

<HEADLINE> Spring Festival Boosts China's Consumer Goods Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- China's consumer goods market
witnessed hefty growth in the first two months of the year thanks
to the annual Spring Festival spending spree.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the State Administration of Internal Trade said
that market sales in the country's four municipalities, Beijing,
Tianjin, Shanghai and Chongqing, swelled by more than 20 percent
over the week-long holiday compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, the sales revenue of the municipality's 100-plus
large and medium-sized department stores totaled some one billion
yuan in the lunar New Year period, an increase of 38 percent on an
annual basis.
</P>
<P>
Many department stores held sales and entertainment activities
this year to bring in the customers, who took the bait. Wangfujing
Street, a famous commercial avenue in Beijing, welcomed 800,000
holiday shoppers daily and its sales revenue climbed up by 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
Supermarkets, with improved shopping environment and services,
saw an even more remarkable increase in sales. The two largest
supermarkets in Shanghai, the Hualian and Lianhua stores, had
sales increases of over 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Frozen food, seafood, fresh vegetables and fruit sold best
before the holiday, while gifts and nourishing food accounted for
60 percent of the total Spring Festival sales.
</P>
<P>
Consumers nationwide said that they were content with the
supply and variety of goods stocked on the shelves this year.
</P>
<P>
The prices of consumer goods were mostly stable during the
holiday in the country, according to the administration.

<HEADLINE> China Strikes Out on UL Trademark Infringement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- China is launching a crackdown
on trademark-related infringement involving U.S.-based
Underwriters' Laboratories, to check the violations against UL,
the State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) released today.
</P>
<P>
In an urgent document jointly issued by the SIPO, Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the General Administration
of Customs, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce and
the State Administration for Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine,
law enforcement agencies in various localities are urged to
strictly combat piracy of the UL trademark, a license authorized
by Underwriters' Laboratories in the United States for ensuring
export quality.
</P>
<P>
The violations include illegal use of the UL trademark or
similar marks for products, trading in trademark-pirated goods,
printing the illegal marks, and providing storage and
transportation to trademark violators.
</P>
<P>
The "UL" mark is widely respected throughout the United States
and the other North American countries as a symbol of safe
products.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration for Industry and Commerce has
registered UL as a trademark.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the special merits of the mark, some enterprises have
illegally imitated it since 1993, which spoiled the reputation of
Chinese exports.
</P>
<P>
According to SIPO officials, state authorities urged local
governments to establish telephone hotlines for tips on violations.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Coalition Leaders Push For Demirel's Extension in Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The three leaders of Turkish
ruling coalition have pushed the button for a constitutional
amendment that will enable President Suleyman Demirel's term to be
extended, Turkish Daily News reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, who sponsored the amendment, told
his Democratic Left Party deputies that he had signed the draft two
days ago, along with ruling partners Nationalist Action Party
Chairman Devlet Bahceli and Motherland Party leader Mesut Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
The draft was then presented to leaders of main opposition True
Path Party and Virtue Party. True Path Party leader Tansu Ciller
followed suit, but afterwards she backed away due to criticism
coming from Virtue Party officials.
</P>
<P>
The two main opposition parties proposed an amendment to the
Constitution on Tuesday, seeking a direct election of next
president by the people.
</P>
<P>
The draft signed by ruling coalition leaders aimed to reduce the
presidential term from the current seven years to five years and to
allow a president who has served for one term to run for a second
term. The existing Constitution says that no one may be re-elected
president for a second term.
</P>
<P>
The draft was the first step to clear the way for Demirel, whose
seven-year term in office expires in may, to remain in office for
five more years.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining that the proposed Constitutional amendment got
popular support, Ecevit said that "I believe that it will make a
significant contribution to the preservation of stability in our
country."
</P>
<P>
During the coming days, drafts submitted by ruling and
opposition parties are expected to be debated in the Constitutional
Affairs Committee. Since the majority of the committee members are
from the ruling parties, the committee is expected to reject the
oppositions' draft.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predicted that Ecevit's proposal should, theoretically,
get through parliament easily.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Forecast to See 5 Percent Growth in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 17 (Xinhua) -- A national research group
forecast a five percent economic growth for Cambodia this year, a
one percent increase over 1999, the Cambodia Daily reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodia Development Resource Institute (CDRI) said that
Cambodia will see an economic recovery in 2000, citing projected
increases in international aid, foreign investment and tourism.
</P>
<P>
According to the CDRI projections, foreign aid disbursement, in
grants and loans, will be up by 37 percent from 205 million U.S.
dollars in 1999 to 280 million dollars in 2000. Private foreign
investment will grow by 20 percent from 150 million dollars to 180
million dollars, while tourism will boom with a 30 percent
increase of foreign visitors this year over 1999.
</P>
<P>
In addition, construction and transportation will be the main
engines of growth, according to a macro-economist at the CDRI.
</P>
<P>
But the agriculture sector will enjoy only a 0.5 percent rise,
3 percent less than the government projection, because of low
production and the lack of investment in agri-industry projects,
the CDRI report said.
</P>
<P>
Rice production for 2000 is projected at 3.56 million tons,
only a 2.7 percent increase over 1999. Exports of fish production
and timber will also be reduced this year and the majority of
investment will still go to the urban areas, not the rural
agricultural areas.
</P>
<P>
With the 5 percent economic growth, about 30,000 new jobs will
be created in the service and industry sectors, but not as much as
Cambodia needs.
</P>
<P>
The CDRI team sees strong economic growth in the future, if
Cambodia continues to be stable and progresses on its reforms.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Buy 100,000 Tons of Relief Food: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government
will buy 100,000 tons of grain from local markets to feed millions
of famine victims in the country, the Ethiopian Herald newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government made the decision because of, among others, a
delay of food aid commitment by donors and relief organizations,
Commissioner Simon Mechale of the Disaster Prevention and
Preparedness Commission was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the relief food, including transportation, amounts
to 248 million birr (about 30 million U.S. dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
Acting Agriculture Minister Mengistu Huluka was quoted as
saying that the local purchase will not affect grain supply in the
country, as food shortage was limited only to drought-stricken
areas while the national agricultural production has increased by
eight percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Country Team in Ethiopia appealed last month
to contribute relief food to Ethiopia where more than eight
million people were reportedly suffering from hunger.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission said
earlier that there were only 100,000 tons of food reserve in the
country, hardly enough for two months at the planned distribution
level.

<P>
LAGOS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The French government has
expressed its willingness to help Nigeria in its efforts to secure
debt cancellation from its creditors, a local newspaper the Punch
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the visiting Chairman of the French
National Assembly, Patrick Olier, as saying that France would make
its own effort to assist Nigeria in its negotiations on debt
reduction with the Paris Club.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during his meeting with the speaker of the House of
Representatives, Alhaji Ghali Umar Na'abba, Wednesday in the
country's capital Abuja, Olier said there was need to strengthen
relationship between the two countries in order to ensure
development and mutual reward.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is a great country on which the future of Africa lies,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Olier further stressed the need for the Nigerian legislature
to work together with the French parliament to identify areas of
possible assistance, in spite of the difference between the
government system of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Na'abba said Nigeria was committed to the success
of the present democratic process after the long-term military
government of the country.
</P>
<P>
He also called the French investors to invest in Nigeria's
on-going privatization scheme of the government, which aimed to
revive the country's ailing economy.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Expected to Attract More Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is among the top four
African countries expected to benefit from increased transnational
business flows in the next three to five years, said a United
Nations poll.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, which conducted jointly by the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the
International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and released recently in
Bangkok, Thailand, prospects for a business boom in many African
nations might be brighter than it looks on the surface.
</P>
<P>
Those countries topped on the poll's list of "attractive"
prospects are South Africa, Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, Tunisia and
Ghana, local media reported Thursday. The poll was conducted at
the end of 1999 and covered 296 of the world's largest
transnational corporations.
</P>
<P>
Most of the corporations surveyed "have a presence in Africa
but less than 10 percent of their global assets is there", said
the poll.
</P>
<P>
However, the poll cited the prevalence of extortion, bribery
and difficult access to global markets as the major negative
respect to woo the foreign investors into the African continent.

<HEADLINE> "Mafiaboy" Responsible For Web Attacks, Expert Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 16 (Xinhua) -- A hacker who calls himself
"mafiaboy" is believed to be responsible for at least two of the
attacks on leading Web sites, American Broadcasting Company (ABC)
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chat room logs now in the possession of the FBI show that "
mafiaboy" asked others what sites he should take down -- before
the sites were attacked, ABC quoted Internet security expert
Michael Lyle.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of hackers have claimed credit for the attacks in on-
line chats, but Lyle says mafiaboy is the only one so far who
appears to be credible.
</P>
<P>
Chat room log files can be faked, but Lyle said he spoke with
mafiaboy over the Internet last Thursday and again last Friday and
those conversations bolstered the evidence against the young
hacker.
</P>
<P>
Lyle said mafiaboy told him specific details about the ports
that he used to connect with the zombie computers and launch the
attacks -- information that only someone involved in the attack
would know.
</P>
<P>
The reason investigators believe different culprits were
responsible for some of the attacks is that the software tools
used to launch the attacks on Yahoo! and eBay were different than
those used to attack CNN.com and E*TRADE, Lyle said.
</P>
<P>
The attacks on CNN.com and E*TRADE are believed to have been
launched using TFN, a software program that's widely available on
the Internet. The attacks on Yahoo! and eBay were launched using a
more sophisticated set of tools, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lyle said he has turned his information over to the FBI and has
been working with investigators. Based on his conversations with
mafiaboy, Lyle said the teen likely committed the attacks to boost
his notoriety within the hacker community.
</P>
<P>
In a later conversation with Lyle, mafiaboy claimed credit for
attacking CNN.com, E*TRADE and several smaller sites.
</P>
<P>
Mafiaboy, who has been described as a 15-year-old Canadian, is
believed to be a copycat who launched his attacks only after Yahoo!
was knocked off-line on Feb. 7, ABC reported in its late evening
news.
</P>
<P>
Investigators have located more than a half-dozen computers
used in last week's attacks.

<HEADLINE> Yi'an Technology Stock Soars on Shenzhen Bourse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Shares of Yi'an, a high-tech
stock listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, have become the most
valuable in China's inland with the stock closing at 115.63 yuan
per share today, yet higher than yesterday's record 105 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The share price peaked out at 126.31 yuan today to break a new
record. Before this, no Shenzhen or Shanghai shares had ever gone
above 100 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong Yi'an Technology Development Share-Holding Co. Ltd
entered the stock market on January 4 last year at an issue price
of 8.7 yuan per share.
</P>
<P>
The company's subsidiary, the Wanyan Company, developed the
first video compact disc player in the world. It later cooperated
with an American chip producer based in Silicon Valley to develop
DVD chips, DVD players and satellite telecommunications equipment.
</P>
<P>
The Yi'an Technology stock climbed to 83 yuan per share weeks
ago to become the strongest on the Shenzhen Bourse. Some insiders
had expected the price to nose-dive, as such heights are unusual
for a domestic stock.
</P>
<P>
Stock analysts have warned individual buyers against a buying
frenzy of the stock.
</P>
<P>
Other high-tech stocks on the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses
have also shown double-digit growth in recent days. Both of the
two stock exchanges witnessed a bullish market since February 14,
when the stock indexes increased 138.94 points to 1,673.94 points
and 369.96 points to close at 4,322.37 points, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Construction Begins on First Qinghai-Tibet Expressway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Construction of the Ping'an-
Xining expressway began today on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau in west
China.
</P>
<P>
It is the first expressway on the highest plateau in the world.
</P>
<P>
The 34.78-kilometer expressway, designed for speeds of 100
kilometers per hour with four bus lanes, extends from Ping'an to
Xining in the east part of Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
It is part of a main artery -- the Lanzhou-Xining expressway,
which is 118 kilometers long at the average altitude of over 2,000
meters. China has invested nearly 4.4 billion yuan (over 528
million U.S. dollars) in the project.
</P>
<P>
The local economy is expecting swift development once the
expressway is completed, said Su Sen, deputy governor of Qinghai.
</P>
<P>
The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, 4,000-5,000 meters above the sea
level, embraces the whole area of Tibet and Qinghai, western
Sichuan and southwestern Gansu provinces -- an area of 2.3 million
square kilometers.

<HEADLINE> China to Check for Illegal Logging Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua)-- The State Administration of
Forestry will launch a nationwide check-up on logging activities
to weed out any illegal practices, the People's Daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The administration received nearly 500 reports of illegal
logging last year from civilians. Its sample survey of 17 counties
found that over half of them have violated the logging ban
instituted after severe flooding in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The daily said that deliberate logging in protected forests
reflects some local governments' flawed perception of the
relationship between the economy and ecology.
</P>
<P>
The campaign has the support of about a dozen media
organizations, which have pledged to expose any wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> 40 Percent of Chinese to Live in Town in Ten Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- More than 40 percent of the
Chinese population will live in cities and towns within the next
decade, official statistics show.
</P>
<P>
According to results of a survey, conducted by the Urban Survey
Organization under the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) last
year, 30.4 percent of the population lived in cities in 1998. The
proportion was 12 percentage points greater than figure in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, the proportion of rural residents
has dropped from over 80 percent to less than 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
The process of urbanization is accelerating. New groups of
urban residents have emerged and expanded, including rural
residents doing non-farming business at home, rural residents
commuting to work and live in big cities, and urban residents
migrating outside their hometown to work.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, five percent of China's population, or
60 million people, lived outside their permanent residence for
more than six months in 1998.
</P>
<P>
As the market develops and more money is available in urban
areas, the Chinese people are giving less consideration to the
residence registration requirements as they move to new places.

HONG KONG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong stocks fell 62.16
points, or 0.36 percent, to close at 16,981.23 today, as Cable and
Wireless HKT was unable to offset falls of other technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
The turnover was 25.564 billion HK dollars (3.277 billion U.S.

</P>
<P>
Analysts said the market was still dominated by the merger
talks between Pacific Century CyberWorks (PCCW) and C&AMP;W HKT, which
rose 1.77 percent and 6.26 percent, respectively, today.
</P>
<P>
However gains for C&AMP;W HKT and PCCW failed to keep the market in
positive direction due to decline of other tech-related stocks
such as China Telecom and Hutchison Whampoa, and at the same time,
investors are waiting for another interest rates rise by the U.S.
Federal Reserve, they added.

<HEADLINE> 20th Century Warmest of Past Five Centuries: Scientists (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Scientists say the average
surface temperature of the earth in the 20th century was the
warmest it's been in the past five centuries, according to latest
findings of a Sino-U.S. joint research team.
</P>
<P>
Since 1500, the earth's temperature has increased about one
degree centigrade, with half of that increase taking place in the
20th century, according to the joint study based on an analysis of
the underground temperature gauging of over 600 boreholes
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Today's British academic journal Nature published their
research, co-authored by Shaopeng Huang and Henry N. Pollack at
the University of Michigan and Po-Yu Shen of the University of
Western Ontario.
</P>
<P>
Shaopeng Huang, a Chinese scientist working for the University
of Michigan, said that in the northern hemisphere, inhabited by
half the world's population, the temperature change has been 1.1
degrees C over the past five centuries and 0.6 degree C in the
20th century.
</P>
<P>
The scientists forecast that the average surface temperature of
the earth may rise by 1.2 degrees in the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Huang explained that present-day subsurface temperatures may
also give clues of temperature changes that occurred in the past.
He added that subsurface temperatures come from geothermal flows
deep within the earth, and from surface temperatures.

Huang described the boreholes as "thermometers" inserted into
the "body" of the earth by scientists.
</P>
<P>
Temperature signals travel slowly through the rocks,
penetrating only about 500 meters in 1,000 years, "so the upper
500 meters archive a historical record of temperature changes that
have occurred in the last thousand years," according to Pollack.
</P>
<P>
The boreholes are distributed in eastern North America, central
Europe, southern Africa and Australia. And the borehole
temperature data provided by Chinese scientists has led to similar
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists here believe that the changing global
temperature may have great impact on human life, and could lead to
a series of disasters.
</P>
<P>
Ye Duzheng, a leading scholar at the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, said a rise in the earth's temperature of even one
degree could give result in the evaporation of more surface water,
swifter glacier melting, and rising sea levels.
</P>
<P>
The study of global climatic change has become a pioneering
research field attracting many scientists worldwide. Many
scientists attribute global warming to human activities and
industrial air pollution.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The unemployment rate in Israel dipped to a seasonally
adjusted 8.9 percent of the workforce in the fourth quarter of
1999, the first quarterly decrease in a year, the Central Bureau of
Statistics (CBS) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The rate represents a slight drop form the 9.1 percent rate
during the July-September period. For the year, however, the
average of weekly joblessness rose to 8.9 percent, compared to 8
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Israel said the jobless rate would not turn around
until late this year of early next.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Ehud Barak spoke by telephone Wednesday with
Russian Prime Minister and acting President, Vladimir Putin. Barak
thanked Putin for Russia's role in the Middle East peace process
and welcomed the success of multilateral talks recently held in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Barak also thanked Putin for his involvement in the release of
two hostages, an Israeli citizen and a member of the Russian Jewish
community, who were held in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Interior Minister Natan Sharansky announced Wednesday that
daylight saving time this year will last a record 192 days, a move
which could arouse the opposition of the religious public.
</P>
<P>
In previous years, when the ultra-orthodox Shas minister Eliyahu
Suissa headed the Interior Ministry, daylight saving time lasted
only 155 days.
</P>
<P>
Knesset Interior and Environment Committee Chairman David
Azoulai, also of the religious Shas party, said that he intends to
block Sharansky's initiative to extend daylight saving time.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The security cabinet moved Wednesday to speed up the process
of deciding retaliatory moves in Lebanon by empowering Barak,
Foreign Minister David Levy, and Transportation Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai to approve such action.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet trio is to meet and decide an appropriate Israel
Defense Forces response within an hour or two from the moment the
need arises.
</P>
<P>
The special team, proposed by Barak, is a compromise between IDF
Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz's request for an automatic okay to shoot
into villages from which attacks been launched on Israeli soldiers,
and the current need to convene the entire security cabinet for
such an approval.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Economy Rises by 4.7 Percent Last Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Israel's gross domestic
product (GDP) surged at a 4.7 percent annual rate in the fourth
quarter of 1999, bringing the growth rate for the second half of
the year to a seasonally adjusted 5.4 percent, local newspapers
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The figures marked a sharp quickening of economic activity in
the second half of 1999 compared to the first half, when the GDP
grew by only 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Growth was consistent throughout the July-December period, with
the GDP rose by 4.4 percent in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The higher growth rate in the second half of 1999 was mainly
spurred by a 15.6 percent increase in exports of goods and service,
led by software exports, the papers said, citing figures released
by the Central Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, unemployment rate fell to 8.9 percent in the forth
quarter from previous 9.1 percent, the first quarterly decrease in
a year, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
The economy grew by just 2 percent on a yearly basis last year,
down from 2.2 percent in 1998 and 2.9 percent in 1997. It was the
slowest pace of the last decade. The annual unemployment rate was
8.9 percent, higher than 8 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
But economists believed that the figures in the second half
showed that the economy was turning around from a four-year
slowdown. Some predicted a growth rate of above 4 percent this
year, higher than the 3 percent target set by the government.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Avraham Shochat said Wednesday that the economy
will expand faster than 3 percent a year in the next four years,
boosted by development of high technology and foreign investment.

<P>
BANGKOK, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Uruguayan representative
to the 10th Session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD X) called here Thursday for a radical change
in international organizations to match new global circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Perez Del Castillo of Uruguay said that the main
problems of the world economy transcended the mandates and
competence of any single organization.
</P>
<P>
"Whereas in the past a narrow framework and a single
international organization could usefully tackle issues, for
example trade barriers at the World Trade Organization, that world
is gone, and the problem of unemployment, for example, cannot be
solved within the International Labor Organization alone," he said.
</P>
<P>
The most logical solution to this problem would be to
reconstruct the international system, he pointed out, saying that
a more achievable response might be a radical change in the
approach which leaves aside dogma and faces problems in an
integrated and coordinated manner.

<HEADLINE> Asia Dynamic in Attracting FDI: UNCTAD Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Asia and the Pacific have
emerged as one of the most dynamic regions in attracting foreign
direct investment (FDI) over the past decade, a report by the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued here Thursday at the ongoing 10th
Session of UNCTAD said that annual average FDI flows to the region
quintupled between the 1980s and the 1990s from just under 16
billion U.S.dollars to slightly more than 80 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The region's share in world annual average flows doubled from
nine percent to 18 percent, while its share of flows to developing
countries remained stable at 55 percent, the release said.
</P>
<P>
However, the UNCTAD noted in the report that the financial
crisis broke out in 1997 had a negative impact on FDI inflows in
1998, when the region recorded the first decline in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
But preliminary estimates suggest that FDI flows held steady
with a one percent increase in 1999, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
FDI flows into the Asia-Pacific region in the past decade was
highlighted by the success stories of China and India, it said.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1980s, China, the largest country in the region,
had average flows three quarters the amount of those attracted by
one of the smallest country, such as Singapore.
</P>
<P>
However, 10 years later, China's average flows had grown by a
multiple of 13, reaching 41 billion dollars, while Singapore's
more than doubled to eight billion.
</P>
<P>
FDI in South Asia grew over the decade by a multiple of 15,
which is mainly attributed to the gradual opening to FDI of India,
the largest country in the subregion.
</P>
<P>
Average flows to India were negligible at the end of the 1980s
and stood at 2.7 billion dollars in the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The problem of FDI flows in Asia and the Pacific is the uneven
distribution among countries.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent of the region's inflows in the late 1990s
went to just six economies: China, China's Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
As for the sources of these flows, developed countries continue
to dominate flows to the Newly Industrializing Economies (NIEs),
namely Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, while the
NIEs themselves dominate the flows to many other countries
including China.

On the Sino-U.S. cooperation in the agriculture field, Zhu said
that the implementation of the Agreement on US-China Agricultural
Cooperation signed last year will help the U.S. farm produce enter
the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has begun to carry out the agreement by
sending two business groups to the U.S. to inspect farm produce.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of Chinese wheat experts will leave for the United
States on Sunday for a business/study tour.
</P>
<P>
Led by Zhou Mingchen, general manager of China National Cereals,
Oils &AMP; Foodstuffs Import &AMP; Export Corp., the delegation will visit
wheat-growing areas in northwest America, including the states of
Oregon and Montana.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in January, A delegation of Chinese Customs officials
made an pre-inspection tour of the U.S. to check out orange
growing.
</P>
<P>
On U.S. granting asylum to China's Falun Gong practitioners,
Zhu said that China is firmly opposed to any action by the United
States to grant asylum to China's Falun Gong practitioners.
</P>
<P>
Zhu took the position when asked to comment on the statement
made by some officials from the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service during their Hong Kong visit that it is
possible the United States would give asylum to the Falun Gong
practitioners.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the Falun Gong is a cult that harms the Chinese
people and society, and the Chinese government's lawful ban of the
organization is an effective measure to protect the basic human
rights and freedom of Chinese citizens, maintain social stability
and prevent the cult from causing more serious damage to the
public.
</P>
<P>
The move has won the Chinese people's support and the
understanding of the international community, Zhu added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.S. immigration officials disregarded the
facts when they made the statement about giving possible asylum to
the cult members. Their attitude is a typical demonstration of the
double standard the U.S. adopts on the cult problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu demanded that the U.S. understand and honor the Chinese
government's principled stand on the Falun Gong issue to avoid
interferring in China's internal affairs and creating new
difficulties for Sino-U.S. relations.

</P>
<P>

carried out effectively and smoothly because some member states
blocked it.
</P>
<P>
"We urge member states concerned to adopt constructive and
responsible attitudes to create good conditions for the
improvement of the humanitarian situation in Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Jordanian House Clears Scandal on PM's Son </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian lower house of
parliament has dismissed a massive financial bribery charge against
a son of Prime Minister Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh after a four-week
unprecedented investigation.
</P>
<P>
At a closed-door session of the 80-member House of Deputies on
Wednesday, 68 of the 72 deputies attending the meeting voted to
dismiss the charge as baseless after reviewing a 32-page report on
the case by a special nine-member committee of the house.
</P>
<P>
A month ago, lawmaker Mahmoud Kharabsheh charged Issam Rawabdeh,
the eldest son of the prime minister, with asking for some 2
million U.S. dollars of bribes from a potential investor from the
United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
The money was demanded to help the investor win a 108-million-
dollar contract to build a tourist village near the Queen Alia
international airport, 35 kilometers south of Amman, according to
the charge.
</P>
<P>
The potential investor was identified as Abdul Rahman Kurd.
</P>
<P>
The special house committee, in an unprecedented move, sent
three members to UAE to interview Kurd, who denied that the
Rawabdeh family had asked for any financial benefits for the
airport project.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Rawabdeh remained sullen and silent during the
house session on Wednesday, but was congratulated by a flock of
deputies after the vote.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh said earlier that the scandal was meant to tarnish his
and his family's reputation when it came up ahead of a major
government reshuffle in January.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh had been rumored that he would lose his premiership in
the shakeup and the positive economic indicators saved his job.
</P>
<P>
Seven ministers left the cabinet in the reshuffle which was
aimed at garnering more support for various administrative, social
and economic reforms carried out in the kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Parliamentary Election Campaigns End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The week-long election campaigns
officially ended on Thursday morning despite rushed elections
workers were still trying to garner more support for their
candidates.
</P>
<P>
Minutes before the deadline at 0900 hours local time (0530 GMT),
teenagers supporting different parties and groups were busy with
putting up posters with mottoes and slogans and spreading colored
leaflets to passers-by and houses.
</P>
<P>
The capital city of Tehran returned to normal with serious
traffic jams as usual, but with a colorful face left over by the
election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
However, state-run radio and television, controlled by the
powerful conservatives, continued their interviews with people on
the sensitive polling, which is believed to change the power
balance in the country.
</P>
<P>
The elections will kick off at 0900 hours local time (0530 GMT)
on Friday. Out of the 63 million population, over 38 million people
above 16 years old will be eligible to cast their votes at 36,000
polling stations in 28 provinces across the country.
</P>
<P>
However, not final number of the candidates was announced so
far. Contradicted reports put the number of candidates at 6,083 and
5,824, since the issue of candidates' eligibilities and rejections
still remained unsolved.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry, which is responsible for carrying out
elections, has announced not to accept illegal disqualification of
candidates by the Guardians Council, a powerful conservative
watchdog on elections.
</P>
<P>
Both the reformers supporting President Mohammad Khatami and the
conservatives, who dominates the country's most sensitive organs
but suffered heavy setbacks in recent years, pinned their hope to
the polling.
</P>
<P>
However, observers believed that the moderate coalition of
reformers and centralists would be able to win a majority in the
expanded 290 parliament as the Iranian people hope a new
legislative body to speed up Khatami's reforms.

<HEADLINE> PSE President Assures Investors of Integrity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE)
President Jose Luis Yulo Thursday called on the investors not to
shy away from local stock market even as it experienced a rough
ride caused by the controversy on the BW Resources fiasco.
</P>
<P>
Yulo made the call in the wake of reports that many investors
have already pulled out their money as a result of the alleged
inside trading anomaly committed by brokers and officers of the BW
Resources Inc.
</P>
<P>
BW Resources Inc. came into the limelight by storm after its
brokers were suspected of having manipulated its share prices late
last year which is a clear violation of the Revised Securities Act.
</P>
<P>
Yulo admitted in a statement that for the last four days since
the investigation of the said stock market anomaly started share
prices at local courses simmered down consecutively.
</P>
<P>
However, he discounted allegation that this was predominantly
caused by the rise and fall of the BW share prices alone which
contributed a great deal in affecting the volume of transactions
at the local bourses.
</P>
<P>
Yulo pointed out that despite this fiasco, the PSE still
maintains its integrity and transparency as a means to let the
people know that it does not engage in any illegal activity at the
local bourses,particularly if this affects public interests.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada also expressed confidence
that the stock market can recover soon from the sharp drop it has
experienced the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Director General Felipe Edalla of the National
Economic Development Authority said the massive selldown Wednesday
which forced share prices to drop to a 10-week low does not
directly affect the economy.
</P>
<P>
According to Medalla, the economy mainly relies on commercial
banks and foreign direct investments, both of which remain strong
at present.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta Determined to Combat Corruption: Wahid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
not hesitate to combat corruption, collusion and nepotistic
practices, President Abdurrahman Wahid said here Thursday,
emphasizing Jakarta's political will to clear the way to ensure a
good and transparent governance.
</P>
<P>
"You know that the government has shown its political will to
abolish corruption. Just because no corrupter has been brought to
a court does not mean that the government does not work," Wahid
said before the Presidential Forum on Business Ethics and Anti-
Corruption Reform.
</P>
<P>
He also said that his government will combat the rampant
corruption in the country because he wants foreign investors to
come and invest in Indonesia to accelerate the ongoing economic
recovery process.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the government will respect international law on
investment agreements, the president Wahid said his government
will uphold law enforcement as much as it can.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said that giving law certainty to foreign investors who
are investing in the country is one of the important things the
Indonesian government is going to do.
</P>
<P>
For domestic investors to be able to play a greater role in
Indonesia's economy, Wahid urged Indonesian businesspeople to
compete with foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Based on data issued by the National Coordinating Investment
Board(BKPM), the total value of investment in Indonesia in 1999
was 52.5 trillion rupiah (7.4 billion U.S. dollars) or down 11.6
percent compared to the previous ear when the value reached 59.4
trillion rupiah (8.4 billion dollars)
</P>
<P>
The board also reported that in 1999 the foreign investment
dropped to 10.6 billion dollars or 22.1 percent lower than the
1998 figure of 13.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
But it predicted that in the year 2000, the investment in
Indonesia will recover and keep rising.

<HEADLINE> EU Hails S. Africa's Decision on Bilateral Trade Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
Development Commissioner Poul Nielson Wednesday night warmly
welcomed the South African government's approval of a new
compromise deal on the labelling of two sensitive spirit brand
names.
</P>
<P>
The positive result will pave the way for full implementation
of EU- South Africa Trade Agreement and help both sides build a
"constructive and fruitful partnership" in the years ahead, he
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral free trade deal signed in Pretoria last October
should have come into effect on January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
However, Italy and Greece refused to ratify the accord,
accusing South Africa of continuing to use the two spirit brand
names of "grappa" (a brand used by Italian liquor producers) and
"ouzo" ( a brand used by Greek liquor producers) on liquor
products made in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
EU Monday hammered out a compromise formula, saying the trade
deal could not be implemented unless South Africa agreed to phase
out using of "grappa" and "ouzo" in five years.
</P>
<P>
The South African cabinet agreed to accept the proposal
Wednesday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> 3 Killed In Cargo Plane Crash In California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 16 (Xinhua) -- All three people aboard an
Emery Worldwide DC-8 cargo plane were killed Wednesday when it
crashed into an auto salvage yard near Sacramento, the capital of
California, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Western Region spokesman
Jim Whitehead said the wide-bodied cargo jet crashed shortly after
the pilot reported a "severe center of gravity problem."
</P>
<P>
Witnesses described seeing a fiery crash that ignited at least
100 cars and sent a huge black cloud of smoke into the nighttime
sky. There were no reported injuries on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Emery Flight 17 left Sacramento Mather Airport,
a former U.S. air force base that has been converted for civilian
use, shortly before 8 p.m. PST and was headed to Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
Firefighting crews and other emergency personnel were on the
scene, and the flames were dying down and the National
Transportation Safety Board said it was sending inspectors to the
scene of the fiery crash.
</P>
<P>
The plane carried three crew members: the pilot, first captain
and a flight engineer, all believed to be Emery employees, said

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Banks Show Balance in Foreign Exchange Transactions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Banks in south China's
Guangdong Province reported a record balance in foreign exchange
transactions last year with the volume standing at 6.186 billion U.
S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Information from the Guangzhou Branch of the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said this marks an end
to the deficits in foreign exchange transactions suffered by these
banks in recent years.
</P>
<P>
A group of banks have been designated to replace enterprises in
undertaking foreign exchange transactions as part of China's 1994
reform of its foreign exchange system.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong's export-oriented economy is highly developed, and
its foreign trade makes up about 40 percent of China's total.
Though the province had always had a favorable balance in foreign
trade, banks incurred deficits in foreign exchange transactions
yearly since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Since the latter half of 1998, Guangdong has taken steps to
improve foreign exchange control, fight against smuggling and
fraud in foreign exchange transactions, and raise foreign exchange
recovery ratio from exports.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the National People's Congress (NPC) approved
an article to the country's Criminal Law designed to punish fraud
and other illegal activities in foreign exchange transactions.

<HEADLINE> China Donates Live Butterfly Pupae to Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The Kunming World Expo Garden
in southwest China's Yunnan Province has donated 250 live
butterfly pupae to a British butterfly farm.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time China has sent live butterfly pupae
abroad.
</P>
<P>
The 30 varieties of pupae, including Byasa Nevilli and Papilio
Bianor, were given to Stratford-Upon-Avon Butterfly Farm of
Britain. The pupae were artificially bred and therefore not under
state protection or jurisdiction of international pacts.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan is resource-rich in butterflies owing to its unique sub-
tropical environment. There are more than 200 species of the
insect in the province.
</P>
<P>
The Butterfly Farm of the Kunming World Expo Garden is the
first organization to breed butterflies through artificial means
in China. It has researched artificial breeding techniques for a
decade and has been raising butterflies for the commercial market
for five years.
</P>
<P>
During last year's Kunming World Expo Fair from May 1 to
October 31, the butterfly farm set free tens of thousands of
butterflies each day, a spectacle that attracted crowds of
tourists and lepidopterists.

<HEADLINE> Oil-for-Food Plan Should be Implemented Earnestly: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- China has always held that the
United Nations' oil-for-food plan should be implemented earnestly
in order to remove the humanitarian difficulties now facing the
Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao made the remarks
at a regular press conference here today when commenting on the
recent resignation of Hans von Sponeck, former U.N. humanitarian
coordinator in Iraq, and Jutta Burghard, the head of the World
Food Program (WFP) in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side has taken note of the resignation of the two
Iraq-based senior officials of the international organization,"
Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He praised the active and laudable efforts made by the two  U.
N. senior officials in improving the humanitarian situation in
Iraq during their terms.
</P>
<P>
He said that China hopes that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
will name their replacements as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Zhu regretted that the U.N. oil-for-food plan could not be
carried out effectively and smoothly because some member states
blocked it.
</P>
<P>
"We urge member states concerned to adopt constructive and
responsible attitudes to create good conditions for the
improvement of the humanitarian situation in Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two UN senior officials resigned in protest against the
nearly 10-year sanction on Iraq.

<HEADLINE> China Opposes Possible Asylum for Falun Gong Practitioners: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- China is firmly opposed to any
action by the United States to grant asylum to China's Falun Gong
practitioners, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said
at a regular press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu took the position when asked to comment on the statement
made by some officials from the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service during their Hong Kong visit that it is
possible the United States would give asylum to the Falun Gong
practitioners.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the Falun Gong is the cult that harms the Chinese
people and society, and the Chinese government's lawful ban of the
organization is an effective measure to protect the basic human
rights and freedom of Chinese citizens, maintain social stability
and prevent the cult from causing more serious damage to the
public.
</P>
<P>
The move has won the Chinese people's support and the
understanding of the international community, Zhu added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.S. immigration officials disregarded the
facts when they made the statement about giving possible asylum to
the cult members. Their attitude is a typical demonstration of the
double standard the U.S. adopts on the cult problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu demanded that the U.S. understand and honor the Chinese
government's principled stand on the Falun Gong issue to avoid
interfering in China's internal affairs and creating new
difficulties for Sino-U.S. relations.

NAIROBI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Provisional results of the
latest census in Kenya revealed that the population of the East
African country now stands at 28 million.
</P>
<P>
It represents an increase of 35 percent over 21 million ten
years ago, but two million short of the 30 million population
predicted by experts just before the census, according to a report
by the Daily Nation newspaper on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that AIDS has taken its toll on the
population and about one million Kenyans have died of the disease
since 1989.
</P>
<P>
The census, which was carried out in eight days last August,
was the first census the country ever had since 1989.
</P>
<P>
According to the census, there are half a million more women
than man and the gap is growing.
</P>
<P>
The provisional results also indicated that the population of
the Kenyan capital Nairobi has hit two million from 1. 3 million
ten years ago.
</P>

Kenya is one of the few sub-Saharan African countries to

<HEADLINE> World Bank Funds Zambia 375 Million U.S. Dollars on Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has set aside
375 million U.S. dollars to assist Zambia but warned that this
amount is likely to be reduced if some conditions like economic
reform are not met, according to a report by the Times of Zambia
newspaper on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has been given a new lending base case scenario but
could fall into low case lending if it fails to meet some or all
conditions attached to the assistance, said World Bank resident
representative Lawrence Clark earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
He said the 375 million dollars for 2000-2002 will be
concentrated on removing constraints to diversified growth and
have been evenly divided between adjustment and investment
lending.
</P>
<P>
The bank will monitor the conclusion of transactions of Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), a comprehensive good governance
program and agreed budgeted levels of social sector spending, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Failure in any or some of these could push Zambia into a low
case scenario, involving a program support that would be
substantially less than the level of 375 million dollars proposed
in the base case," the representative warned.
</P>
<P>
According to Clark, the current World Bank portfolio in the
country stands at 600 million dollars for 14 projects.
</P>
<P>
However, about 60 percent of the commitments remain undisbursed
largely because of the weak capacity in both public and private
sector in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government has been making efforts in recent years
to privatize the copper-producing country's copper mines to
attract foreign investment and advanced technology and management
as soon as possible to revive the ailing mining industry.

Addressing a public rally at Kitolhu sub-county in Kasese
district, the president reiterated the government's call for ADF
rebels to take advantage of the Amnesty Law and surrender to the

<HEADLINE> EU Expected to Lift Ban on Ugandan Fish Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is
expected to lift ban on fish products from Uganda by the end of
this month, enabling the country's second largest foreign
exchange earner to recover from its rock bottom.
</P>
<P>
Uganda Investment Authority Executive Director Margaret Kigozi,
who disclosed this news, said that the country had worked on a
number of issues as requested by the 15-member bloc.
</P>
<P>
EU inspectors wanted proof of a detailed sampling plan to check
for poisoning in the fish, water and sand of Lake Victoria. They
also demanded for documentation of the surveillance program, and
training of local fish inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Kigozi said that they are seeking 3.5 million U.S. dollars from
the government to upgrade 15 fishing sites.
</P>
<P>
EU, Uganda's largest fish products buyer in the world, imposed
a ban on Uganda's fish products in March 1999 following incidents
of fish poisoning on Lake Victoria and poor hygienic conditions
at landing sites. The ban made Uganda lose about 72 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange shortage, effected at least in part by the
fish ban, led to continued depreciation of Uganda's currency and
affected lives of some 700, 000 people living on fishing industry
along the coast of the lake.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Qualify for Debt Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will qualify for the
Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative in a week's time,
the country's Finance Deputy Minister Godfrey Simasiku said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by Thursday's Zambia Daily Mail newspaper as
saying in the parliament that Zambia is in the process of
graduating for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) sponsored
initiative and if all goes well, this would be done within one
week.
</P>
<P>
He said the HIPC initiative would see the country's debt
reduced by 90 percent, which means that the government would be
able to increase funding for most of its ministries, departments
and agencies.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, most of the problems being faced by
the government today were inherited and what the government is
trying to do is to correct the situation.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Far-right Leader Pays Private Visit to Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Joerg Haider, the far-right
Freedom party leader of Austria, made a private visit to Montreal
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release from Montreal, Haider faced
protest by the Canadian Jewish Congress, which refused to allow
him to visit Montreal's Holocaust Center.
</P>
<P>
Congress President Moshe Ronen expressed concern about Haider's
presence in Canada, accusing him of using "an appeal to fear and
divisiveness to gain political party power."
</P>
<P>
The protesters also warned of "image repair" being conducted by
the far-right party leader, who has praised Hitler for years.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Foreign Minister lloyd Axworthy also said Wednesday
that the federal government "received information last night" that
Haider had arrived "for a private visit."
</P>
<P>
But the minister noted "there was no indication from the
Austrian government or embassy that he would be coming."
</P>
<P>
"It is unusual but there is no visa requirement for Austrian
citizens so anybody can get on a plane and arrive in Canada and if
they have a proper passport they are given entry," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly hope that it's not being used for purposes of
extolling some of his views," he stated, adding "I suppose we'll
watch with particular interest what Mr. Haider does here or says
here during his visit."
</P>
<P>
Haider is scheduled to go to Toronto Thursday to continue his
surprise visit to a North American country, the news release said.
</P>
<P>
His Freedom party joined the coalition government of Austria on
February 4 this year, triggering strong international protests.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Israel have recalled their ambassadors
from Austria, while the European Union has imposed sanctions on
Austria.

BELGRADE -- The Yugoslav government Wednesday lodged a protest
against the intrusion of NATO military aircraft into its airspace
to the Paris-based International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
, announced Yugoslav Minister of Transport Dejan Drobnjakovich.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Drobnjakovich said that NATO military
planes twice intruded into Yugoslav airspace southeast over the
Adriatic Sea on February 2 and 14, which were detected by Belgrade
aviation authorities. The intrusion posed threats to the national
civil aviation and forced the Tivat Airport in Montenegro to close
for two days, he told reporters. The government will ask the ICAO
headquarters to force NATO to observe its international
obligations and stop violating Yugoslav airspace, said
Drobnjakovich. (Yugoslavia-NATO-Protest)

In talks with Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs Martonyi
Janos, Meidani, who arrived here Monday for a two-day official
visit, spoke highly of Albanian-Hungarian relations, and hoped
that Hungary will continue to give support to his country in
fields such as international affairs and trade development.
Referring to bilateral economic and trade cooperation, the
president noted that the Albanian economy has already lifted
itself out of its low with a growth last year reaching 8 percent
and inflation dropping below 5 percent, which serves as a
favorable condition for cooperation. (Hungary-Albania-Ties)

On Sunday, Polish police detained the Belarussians on the

in Poland. Ten of them were held over 12 hours. The Belarussian
Foreign Ministry protested to the Polish ambassador Tuesday,
charging that Warsaw did not handle the issues in the spirit of
cooperation and mutual respect. On the other hand, Polish Foreign
Ministry spokesman Pawel Dobrowolski said Wednesday that Belarus "
over-reacted" to the matter, because it was an administrative
decision of Poland with no political background. (Poland-Belarus-

<HEADLINE> Unqualified Imports Rise Slightly in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua)-- The volume of sub-standard
goods shipped into China rose 3.1 percent in 1999, and inferior
import goods saw a 0.14 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
Li Changjiang, director of the State Administration of Entry-
Exit Inspection and Quarantine, said that a total of 3.1 million
individual import and export commodities worth some 119.2 billion
U.S. dollars were inspected last year, China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
A total of 18,000 shipments of import goods, worth 3.38 billion
U.S. dollars, were found to be faulty, while 10,000 shipments of
export commodities valued at 290 million U.S. dollars failed to
meet quality standards, the Daily said.
</P>
<P>
Rice, vegetable oil, natural rubber, crude oil and agricultural
chemicals were among those imported products with noticeable
increases in substandard rates, while meat, beans, coke, maize and
steel products were the chief export items with quality problems,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to efforts by the inspection and quarantine authorities,
Chinese commodities gained entry in 1999 to some markets that had
been previously denied: Chinese poultry has been allowed to enter
the Swiss market, Russia and Singapore have lifted bans on Chinese
meat, and the Japanese government has eased restrictions on
importing Chinese rice straw.
</P>
<P>
As a result of five years of work on the matter by the
inspection administration, the European Union gave Chinese seafood
normal access to its markets earlier this month, according to the
daily.
</P>
<P>
The administration had also been credited for successfully
handling such major incidents as the chicken flu in Hong Kong and
dioxin in chicken from Belgium and three other EU nations.

Citizens have the right to criticize and make suggestions to
government institutions and their staff members. They also have
the right to complain, bring lawsuits against or report law-
breaking activities and dereliction of duty on the part of
government officials.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee these rights of citizens, government institutions
at all levels have set up offices receiving petitions and personal
visits.
</P>
<P>
And the people's procuratorial organs and administrative
supervisory systems at central to local levels have established
offense-reporting organs.
</P>
<P>
The news media have also strengthened supervision of cases
involving dereliction of duty, abuse of power and infringement
upon citizens' legitimate rights and interests by government staff
members.
</P>
<P>
Those who have suffered losses due to the infringement upon
citizens' rights by government institutions or staff members, have
the right to compensation according to law.
</P>
<P>
China specially formulated the Administrative Procedure Law in
1991 and the State Compensation Law in 1995.
</P>
<P>
To date, nearly 440,000 administrative cases and 2,566 state
compensation cases have been handled by people's courts,
effectively safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of
citizens.

Prison authorities insist on administering prisons according to
law. They have devoted great efforts to carrying out the practice
of making public prison affairs to inmates, raising the
transparency of law enforcement and conscientiously guaranteeing
the legitimate rights of convicts.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1998, some 361,000 convicts were given
reductions of sentence or released on parole, accounting for 25
percent of the total imprisoned population.
</P>
<P>
The establishment and development of the lawyer and legal aid
systems are playing an increasingly important role in protecting
the legitimate rights and interests of citizens, and maintaining
the correct enforcement of the law.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China has nearly 9,000 law offices, and the number
of licensed lawyers exceeds 100,000. Between 1979 and 1999,
lawyers in China pleaded for the accused in three million criminal
cases. In 1998 alone, they pleaded for the accused or acted as
attorneys in 296,668 criminal cases. As a result, the legitimate
rights and interests of the suspects and accused were effectively
safeguarded.
</P>
<P>
Since the Legal Aid Center of the Ministry of Justice and the
China Legal Aid Foundation were established in 1996 and 1997,
respectively, more than 800 legal aid institutions have been set
up. This enables an increasing number of poor citizens to benefit
from legal services free or at a reduced charge, according to law.
Incomplete statistics indicate that in 1997, legal aid
institutions at various levels and personnel engaged in legal
services handled some 50,000 cases requiring legal aid, and
provided legal advice to more than 400,000 people.

Judgments in all cases, whether subject to public hearing or
not, are announced openly.
</P>
<P>
While court sessions are opened for case hearing, evidence,
cross-examination, attestation and debate have been conducted on
the spot, thus increasing the rate of judgment announcements in
court.
</P>
<P>
Procuratorial organs have intensified the supervision of law
enforcement by redressing according to law the problems of failure
to observe the law, weak law enforcement and miscarriages of
justice.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the procuratorial organs demanded that public security
organs give reasons as to why 9,335 cases had not been filed, of
which 5,207 cases were finally designated to be placed on file.
</P>
<P>
They put forward suggestions for correcting the extended
detention of 70,992 people, and raised for correction 9,964 cases
which involved violation of the law during investigation.
</P>
<P>
They approved the arrest of 582,120 of the 689,025 suspects
transferred by public security and state security organs for
examination and approval of arrest, and issued additional warrants
for the arrest of 6,957 people and the prosecution of 3,904 people.
</P>
<P>
They filed public charges against 557,929 of the 668,425
suspects transferred for approval of prosecution, and decided not
to arrest 93,218 people and not to prosecute 11,225 people.
</P>
<P>
They protested 3,791 criminal judgments they deemed wrong, and
raised 1,211 cases for correction, which involved violations of
the law in the trial procedure.
</P>
<P>
They also raised 9,672 cases for correction, which involved
violations of the law by related departments for approving the
reduction of a sentence term, release on parole, and temporary
serving of sentences outside the prison.

37 million civil cases, 1.45 million cases of economic disputes
and nearly 100,000 administrative cases.
</P>
<P>
The public security and judicial organs cracked down on serious
crimes related to murder, explosion, poisoning, robbery, large-
scale theft, rape, kidnapping, gangs, and guns, effectively
protecting the safety of people's lives and property.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the legitimate rights of criminal suspects and the
accused were protected according to law.
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, people's courts have pronounced more than 40,000
people not guilty according to law because of lack of evidence of
crimes.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, in a bid to strictly enforce laws and
strengthen the protection of human rights during the judicial
process, people's courts have carried out an in-depth reform of
adjudication methods.
</P>
<P>
Efforts have been made according to law to promote public
adjudication in an all-round way, and strengthen the supervision
of adjudication by society and public opinion so as to ensure
judicial fairness.
</P>
<P>
Except for those unsuitable for public hearing as prescribed by
the law, all first instance cases are now subject to public trial.
The rate of open court sessions for second instance cases has also
been raised gradually.

In old China, women did not have any right at all to
participate in public affairs.
</P>
<P>
But since the establishment of the People's Republic of China
in 1949, women's right to participate in the administration of
state and social affairs has been protected according to law, with
the level of their involvement in public affairs rising constantly.
</P>
<P>
When the First National People's Congress (NPC) was held in
1954, women deputies only accounted for 11.9 percent of the total,
while in 1998, when the Ninth NPC was convened, women deputies
numbered 650, constituting 21.81 percent of the total.

the rate in any other country.
</P>
<P>
The physical conditions of women have greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
In 1949, China had only nine maternity and child care centers,
with limited numbers of beds and medical workers.
</P>
<P>
But in 1998, there were 514 maternity and child care hospitals
and hospitals for gynecology and obstetrics, with 87,000 beds and
82,000 medical personnel, and 2,724 health care centers for women
and children, and 88,000 medical personnel.
</P>
<P>
A national health care network for women and children has been
initially formed.
</P>
<P>
During the early years of the People's Republic, due to poor
health care conditions, old methods prevailed in deliveries, and
the mortality for pregnant and lying-in women was as high as 1,500
per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, China had 47 hospitals for gynecology and obstetrics,
with 108,634 gynecologists and obstetricians trained in Western
medicine.
</P>
<P>
The number of midwives rose from 13,900 in 1949 to 48,696 in
1998, and that of rural midwives exceeded 310,000.
</P>
<P>
Some 66.8 percent of women gave birth in hospital, modern
methods were adopted for 94.5 percent of deliveries in rural areas,
and the mortality of pregnant and lying-in women dropped to 56.2
per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
The average life expectancy of Chinese women rose from 36 years
in 1949 to 73.2 years in 1997.
</P>
<P>
This is 4.5 years higher than the figure for men and eight
years higher than the average life expectancy of 65 years set as a
goal by the United Nations for women all over the world by the
year 2000.

In old China, women had few employment opportunities. Today,
women enjoy equal rights with men to work, as well as the right to
acquire equal pay for equal work and special labor protection.
</P>
<P>
In 1949, there were only 600,000 women workers and staff
members in China, accounting for 7.5 percent of the total
workforce.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, women employees numbered 340.67 million, constituting
48.7 percent of the total employees, higher than the world's
average of 34.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Of the 450 million rural laborers in China, 320 million, or 71
percent, are engaged in agricultural production, of whom, 210
million are women, forming 65.6 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
There are only five countries in the world, where women's
salaries equal 80 percent or more of men's, while the income of
Chinese women is equivalent to 80.4 percent of that of their male

</P>
<P>
Women employees enjoy special care during menstruation,
pregnancy, childbirth and lactation periods, and child-bearing
women employees enjoy a three-month paid maternity leave.

Since 1990, the gap between the school attendance rates for
boys and girls has narrowed from 1.28 percentage points to 0.1
percentage point.

China has adopted practical measures to develop hygienic and
health care undertakings for children, protecting the life and
health of children.
</P>
<P>
In 1949, there were only five children's hospitals in China,
with 139 beds. By 1998, children's hospitals numbered 37
throughout the country, with 9,808 beds and 60,446 pediatricians
trained in Western medicine.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 15,000 hospitals at or above the county
level had set up departments of gynecology, obstetrics and
pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of tetanus among the newborn dropped to 0.27 per
thousand. Infant mortality declined from 200 per thousand in the
early years of New China to 33.2 per thousand in 1998, and the
mortality of children under the age of five was down to 42 per
thousand.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the physical conditions of children have improved
noticeably.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the mortality rate of children under five caused by
diarrhea had fallen by 67.8 percent compared with that in 1991,
and that caused by pneumonia was down 44.6 percent.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, ethnic
minorities, along with the majority Han ethnic group, have been
the masters of the state, equally enjoying all of the civic rights
granted by the Constitution and laws, and in addition enjoying the
special rights of ethnic minorities according to law.
</P>
<P>
The right of the people of the ethnic minorities to participate
on an equal footing in state administration is guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
In all the previous National People's Congresses and the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conferences, the
percentage of ethnic minority delegates and members has exceeded
the proportion of the ethnic minority population in the national
population.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic-minority delegates accounted for 14.37 percent of the
Ninth National People's Congress delegates selected in 1998, and
for 11.7 percent of the committee members of the Ninth Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, both surpassing the 8.
9 percent proportion of the ethnic minority population in the
national population.
</P>
<P>
Each of the 55 ethnic minorities has its own delegates and
committee members. There are over 2.7 million ethnic-minority
cadres throughout China, and a fairly large number of ethnic-
minority personnel working in central and local state organs,
administrative organs, judicial organs and procuratorial organs.
</P>
<P>
China practices ethnic regional autonomy in areas where ethnic
minority people live in compact communities.
</P>
<P>
According to the relevant laws, among the chairman and vice-
chairmen of the standing committee of the people's congress of an
autonomous area there must be one or more citizens of the ethnic
group or groups exercising regional autonomy in the area concerned.
</P>
<P>
The head of an autonomous region, autonomous prefecture or
autonomous county should be a citizen of the ethnic group
exercising regional autonomy in the area concerned, and the other
members of the people's governments of these regions, prefectures
and counties shall include members of the ethnic group exercising
regional autonomy as well as members of other ethnic minorities as
far as possible.

By the end of 1998, 126 regulations on the exercise of autonomy
and 209 separate regulations had been enacted by the autonomous
areas. If resolutions, decisions, orders and instructions from the
higher-level state organs are not suited to the actual conditions
of the autonomous areas, the organs of self-government of these
areas may be flexible in carrying them out or may decide not to
carry them out after gaining approval from the higher state organs.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, in accordance with state laws and regulations,
organs of self-government in autonomous areas also enjoy the right
to control their economies and local finances, the right to
develop educational, scientific, technological and cultural
undertakings, and the right to use and develop the local spoken
and written languages.
</P>
<P>
Before the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, economy,
culture and social development were very backward in its ethnic
minority areas. People of ethnic minorities, mainly engaged in
agriculture and animal husbandry, lived in poverty.
</P>
<P>
Since 1949, the state has adopted special policies and measures
to assist and support the economic development and social progress
of the ethnic minority areas in the aspects of capital, technology
and personnel.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the total industrial and agricultural
output value in autonomous areas grew from 3.66 billion yuan in
1949 to 852.35 billion yuan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The output of pig iron, raw coal, crude oil and generated
energy in these areas increased respectively from 9,000 tons, 1.78
million tons, 52,000 tons and 80 million kilowatt/hours in 1952 to

</P>
<P>
Remarkable improvements have been made in the lives of the
minority peoples.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the net income per peasant in ethnic-minority
autonomous areas had reached 1,633.11 yuan, or 21.5 times the 1980
figure; the per capita possession of grain came to 424.4 kilograms,
or 1.5 times the 1978 figure; and the average salaries of
employees in the ethnic-minority areas amounted to 5,593 yuan, or
7.9 times the 1981 figure.
</P>
<P>
In old China, the illiteracy rate among ethnic minorities was
often over 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
Only 10 percent of school-age children attended school in the
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, 97 percent of the people in the
Tibet Autonomous Region were illiterate, and there were only 16
secondary schools in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the People's Republic, the educational
situation in ethnic-minority areas has been improved remarkably,
and the illiteracy rate has been reduced by 68 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, there were 94 institutions of higher learning and 226,
400 students in these institutions in ethnic autonomous areas, 13,
466 middle schools with 5.2964 million students, and 90,704
primary schools with 12.409 million pupils.
</P>
<P>
To date, the state has independently founded 12 specialized
ethnic universities and institutes, 59 ethnic teachers' training
schools, 158 ethnic secondary vocational schools, 3,536 ethnic
middle schools, and 20,906 ethnic primary schools.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, the gap between the school attendance rate in the

</P>
<P>
Since the 1950s, the Chinese government has helped a dozen
ethnic minority peoples create or improve 13 scripts.
</P>
<P>
The state has established special bodies to organize the
editing and publishing of ancient writings of ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
More than 120,000 titles of such works have been collected, of
which over 110,000 have been edited and 5,000 published.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 experts and scholars organized by the state
have completed the editing and publishing of five series of books
on ethnic-minority issues, including A Brief History of China's
Ethnic Minorities, Brief Records of Ethnic Minorities' Languages
and A General Survey of Ethnic Autonomous Areas, comprising over
400 titles with 90 million words.
</P>
<P>
Now each of the 55 ethnic minority groups has a brief written
history. The Chinese government has set up special institutions
for the preservation, translation and research of the three major
epics of ethnic minorities: Gesar, Jianggar and Manas.
</P>
<P>
The three epics and treatises concerning them have been

<P>
In Tibet, there are more than 1,700 places for Tibetan Buddhist
activities, and 46,000 lamas and monks. In old China, the medical

backward. Local and epidemic diseases ran rampant, and the
population declined steadily.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of New China, medical and health conditions
in such areas have been remarkably improved, the populations have
increased rapidly and the standard of health has risen greatly.

<P>
According to statistics, medical and health institutions in
ethnic autonomous areas grew from 361 in 1949 to 16,724 in 1998,
the number of hospital beds grew from 3,310 to 392,671 and the
number of medical personnel from 3,531 to 605,255.

<P>
Fifty years is but a moment in human history. Nevertheless, in
the past 50 years the Chinese people have made a great historic
leap in the development of human rights.
</P>
<P>
In safeguarding and promoting human rights, although setbacks
occurred, one indisputable basic fact is that after unremitting
efforts over half a century, the poverty-stricken, weak and
humiliated old China has become an independent New China in the
early stage of prosperity, and the 1.25 billion Chinese people
have become the masters of their own fates.
</P>
<P>
They have changed the terrible situation of chronic hunger,
cold and ignorance, rid China of the label of "The Sick Man of
East Asia," lead a civilized and healthy life of plenty, and enjoy
unprecedented democracy and freedom.
</P>
<P>
We can say that the human rights situation in present-day China
is totally different from that of the old China -- even compared
with the years before the initiation of reform and opening-up, the
great progress that has been made in this respect is universally
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it must be admitted that China is still a
developing country. Limited by impediments of natural, historical
and economic development, there is still room for improvement with
regard to the levels of China's democratic and legal construction,
the degree of social civilization and people's living standards.
</P>
<P>
However, on the basis of 50 years of development, especially
with the successful experiences accumulated in the past 20 years
of reform and opening-up, the Chinese government and people are
capable of solving the problems on the road of advance, and will
make constant progress in their endeavors to improve human rights.

<P>
First, to fully realize human rights is a basic goal of China's
cross-century development.
</P>
<P>
After China adopted the policy of reform and opening-up, it
worked out a cross-century economic development strategy to
realize modernization in three stages, each stage being aimed at
enhancing China's overall national strength and improving the
Chinese people's living standards.
</P>
<P>
This inevitably entails improving the human rights situation.
The goals of the first and second stages -- to solve the problems
of food and clothing of the entire Chinese people and to enable
them to live a relatively comfortable life -- have already been
basically achieved; the goal of the third stage -- to reach the
level of the medium-developed countries in the mid-21st century,
so that the entire Chinese people can realize common prosperity -
already has a relatively good foundation.
</P>
<P>
At the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
held in 1997, on the basis of summing up experiences, and from the
height of China's cross-century development, while reiterating the
three-stage development strategy, emphasis was placed on the
construction of a democratic and legal system.
</P>
<P>
The congress stressed the continuance of political
restructuring, the further expansion of democracy, the perfection
of the legal system, "governing the country according to law, to
build a socialist country ruled by law," and making "governing the
country according to law" a basic state policy.
</P>
<P>
In March 1999, the Second Session of the Ninth National People'
s Congress included "governing the country according to law, to
build a socialist country ruled by law" in the Constitution,
making "governing the country according to law, to build a country
ruled by law" a basic goal of the political restructuring and the
construction of a democratic and legal system, which is fixed in
the form of the fundamental law of the state.

<P>
The essence of "governing the country according to law, to
build a country ruled by law" is guaranteeing that the Party and
the government control political power and administer the state
according to law, that the law-enforcement departments work in
accordance with the law, and that the citizens exercise their
rights and perform their duties in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
In short, we must guarantee human rights in the country's laws
and systems. Therefore, the implementation of the strategy of
governing the country according to law and the realization of the
goal of building a country ruled by law possess important and
essential significance in guaranteeing human rights and promoting
China's cross-century development of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Second, since China introduced the policy of reform and opening-
up, it has found a road for the promotion and development of human
rights that suits its reality.
</P>
<P>
China is a developing country in the East with a long history
and a huge population, but with a relative shortage of resources
and wealth. To promote human rights in such a country, China
cannot copy the mode of human rights development of the developed
Western countries, nor can it copy the methods of other developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
China can only start from its own reality and explore a road
with its own characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Since the introduction of the policy of reform and opening-up,
China has, on the basis of summing up its historical experiences
and drawing lessons from them, found a road to building socialism
with Chinese characteristics, and therefore has found a road to
promoting and developing human rights which is in line with the
country's reality.
</P>
<P>
This means putting the rights to subsistence and development in
the first place, under the conditions of reform, development and
stability, and thus promoting human rights development in an
overall way.

<P>
The characteristics of this road are, in terms of the basic
orientation of developing human rights, that we stick to the
principle of developing the productive forces and promoting common
prosperity, based on the improvement of the living standards of
the entire people and promoting the human rights of the entire
people; in terms of the order of priority, the top priority is
given to the rights to subsistence and development, while taking
into consideration the people's political, economic, social and
cultural rights and the overall development of individual and
collective rights; in terms of the methods of promoting and
guaranteeing human rights, we stress that stability is the
prerequisite, development is the key, reform is the motive power,
and government according to law is the guarantee.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, China has stuck to this correct road of
development. As a result, not only have the living standards and
mental outlook of the Chinese people changed greatly, but a set of
relatively complete political and legal systems that guarantee the
people's democratic rights have been formed.
</P>
<P>
Thus, great progress has been made in putting human rights into
a legal and institutional framework, and China's human rights
development has been improving constantly.
</P>
<P>
Practice has proved that building socialism with Chinese
characteristics is a road of development that is in accordance
with the fundamental interests of the Chinese people, and also the
only road which can effectively promote human rights in China.
</P>
<P>
We can say that China's cross-century development objective in
the sphere of human rights has been set, the foundation has been
laid, and the road has been opened.
</P>
<P>
Looking forward to continuous progress in the 21st century, we
have every reason to believe that as long as we follow the plans
laid down at the Party's 15th National Congress, while continuing
to carry out the three-stage economic development strategy,
earnestly implement the general plan of governing the country
according to law, and strive to build a socialist country ruled by
law, China's human rights situation will see steady improvement.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Implement Large Agriculture Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will set up a
large scale farm project covering 4,000 hectares in the southern
state of Johor within 2000, Agriculture Minister Mohamed Effendi
Norwawi said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Ministry has asked the Royal Agriculture
College in England to prepare the project's master plan which
would be ready in about three to six months, he told reporters in
the state's capital Johor Baharu, according to Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
The project, the first for Malaysia, would involve livestock
and fresh water fish rearing, vegetable and fruit cultivation as
well as other cash crops, the minister said after attending a
seminar on the Third National Agriculture Policy there.
</P>
<P>
The project is scheduled for completion in three years and will
be a catalyst in the area of development for farmers and
smallholders in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the Federal and Johor state governments and
the private sector would be involved in the development of the
project and in the provision of facilities for Research and
Development (R&AMP;D),production, marketing, grading and packaging.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand to Lean More on Australia in Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Defense
Minister Mark Burton has signaled that his country could become
more dependent on Australia to cover shortfalls in its military
capability.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a defense seminar organized by the New Zealand
Institute of International Affairs here Thursday, Burton said New
Zealand is "a small country with limited means and we cannot do
everything. If we spread ourselves too thinly by trying to do too
much, we will end up not being able to do anything well."
</P>
<P>
East Timor has shown that none of the countries involved in the
peacekeeping force is able to stand alone, he said.
</P>
<P>
"New Zealand's considerable contribution was complementary to,
and complemented by, the resources of Australia in particular ...
In refining over the coming months the priorities for the New
Zealand Defense Force, this balance of a highly qualified, highly
skilled and well-equipped force that can complement that of our
defense friends,particularly Australia, will be an important
consideration," the defense minister said.
</P>
<P>
Burton also made clear at the seminar that New Zealand is
likely to scrap an F-16 fighter aircraft deal with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
"The government is of the view that our defense forces are
spread too thinly and are not sufficiently well equipped for what
we want them to do. We intend to set priorities to ensure money is
spent where it is most needed and not on every opportunity to buy
that comes along," he said.
</P>
<P>
The priorities for the New Zealand government are to upgrade
the army, including recruiting more soldiers, improve the air
force's maritime surveillance and airlift capabilities and provide
an effective naval transport capability, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The lease-to-buy deal for 28 F-16 fighters was made by the
previous New Zealand government with the United States. Leasing
the F-16s is estimated to cost 181 million U.S. dollars in the
next 10 years,rising to about 350 million U.S. dollars if New
Zealand takes up an option to buy them.

<HEADLINE> Africans Urged to Preserve Traditional Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) Wednesday called on traditional healers to develop special
gardens to preserve African medicinal plants.
</P>
<P>
Preserving the plants would enable countries to manufacture
their own medicines, including tablets and injectables, said WHO
African regional director Ebrahim Samba.
</P>
<P>
Samba was officially opening a WHO forum on the role of
traditional medicine in the health delivery system in Harare.
</P>
<P>
The WHO would support countries in producing sufficient
quantities of the medicines to satisfy local demand and for
export, he said.
</P>
<P>
The three-day forum is being attended by representatives from
46 African countries, including traditional healers, managers of
traditional medicine programs and associations of health
practitioners.

<HEADLINE> Bank Robberies Decline in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan police headquarters has
 announced a decline in bank robberies and murder cases in 1999
compared with the records of 1998, the state-run Kenya Times
newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Releasing the data of reported cases Wednesday in the capital
Nairobi, deputy police spokesman Dola Indidis said 22 bank
robberies were committed countrywide last year, with 10 other
attempts foiled by police.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 27 bank robberies were recorded with only one attempt
foiled, Indidis said, adding that Nairobi led in cases of bank
robberies -- 13 cases in 1999 and 19 cases in 1998.
</P>
<P>
On murder cases, 1,625 incidents were reported last year as
against 1, 632 in 1998, reflecting a decrease of seven cases
nationwide, Indidis said.
</P>
<P>
The year 1999 is remembered for the swift counter-robbery
operations taken by police on February 24 as they recovered 40
million shillings (some 650,000 U.S. dollars) grabbed from a
security courier van in Nairobi's industrial area by armed
robbers.

<HEADLINE> IOC Slams "Dysfunctional" SOCOG  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) Thursday launched an extraordinary attack on
Sydney Olympics organizers for failing to promote the success of
the marketing programs of this year's games.
</P>
<P>
Senior IOC member Dick Pound told a media briefing there was a
dysfunctional relationship between the Sydney Organizing Committee
for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) and its sponsors.
</P>
<P>
"There appears to be from a distance a dysfunctional
relationship between the organizing committee and those people who
made it possible for the organizing committee to do a lot of what
it has to do for these Games," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The details of how this developed I don't know. What we're
trying to do is to identify the problem. There's got to be a
bridge built in the next few months so that these Games will be
the success that they ought to be," Pound said.
</P>
<P>
Pound blamed senior SOCOG management, including President
Michael Knight, for the continuing bad press about the marketing
program.
</P>
<P>
"I have to confess to a feeling of considerable frustration at
the failure to acknowledge the success of this marketing program.
SOCOG doesn't seem to be communicating," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pound said it was frustrating to read the bad press when the
Sydney Games marketing program was the most successful Olympics
program ever.
</P>
<P>
He said sponsors had approached the IOC about their unhappiness.

<TEXT>
<P>
In old China, whenever serious disasters befell, the exposed
bodies of those who had died from starvation could be found
everywhere. In 1931, when eastern China was affected by floods,
145,000 people died as a result.
</P>
<P>
But New China pays great attention to relief work, and makes
every effort to protect and save people's lives and property, and
ensure the basic needs of life of people in disaster-stricken
areas.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary statistics, in the past 50 years since
the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC), the Central
Government has allocated more than 30 billion RMB yuan as relief
funds for serious natural disasters, solving the problem of
provisions in 2.2 billion cases, helping over 800 million people
rebuild their homes, rebuilding more than 100 million collapsed
houses, providing billions of items of clothing for 200-odd
million people and curing a billion cases of disease or injury
resulting from disasters.
</P>
<P>
The rights of workers have been realized to the full. In 1949,
the number of unemployed workers was 4.742 million, with an
unemployment rate of 23.65 percent. In addition, millions upon
millions of peasants were bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the number of employed people nationwide totaled 699.
57 million, and the number of registered unemployed persons was 5.
71 million, with a registered unemployment rate of 3.1 percent. (

III. Civil Rights and Political Rights of Citizens Ensured
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the People's Republic, China has made
great progress in its efforts to build its democratic and legal
systems, and people's civil rights and political rights are
maintained and guaranteed according to law.
</P>
<P>
China's Constitution clearly states that "All power in the
People's Republic of China belongs to the people." The organs
through which the people exercise state power are the National
People's Congress (NPC) and local people's congresses. Deputies to
the people's congresses at all levels are elected, and are
responsible to and accept supervision from the people.
</P>
<P>
In China, except for those who have been deprived of their
political rights, all citizens aged 18 or above, irrespective of
ethnic status, race, sex, occupation, family background, religious
belief, education, property status or length of residence, have
the right to vote and stand for election.
</P>
<P>

enjoy the right to vote and stand for election. According to
statistics, the voting rate all over the country has maintained a
level of over 90 percent. Every region, ethnic group, social
stratum, organization and group has its proportion of
representatives in the people's congresses at all levels.

Statistics show that in provinces where elections of members
for a new term of office on the villagers' committees were
completed in 1999, the proportion of peasants taking part in the
elections reached more than 90 percent in most cases and more than

Democracy at the grass-roots level is an important means for
ensuring that citizens directly exercise their democratic rights.
</P>
<P>
By directly electing members of villagers' committees and
deciding upon major affairs of their villages through democratic
discussions, the rural masses fully exercise their rights of
democratic election, democratic policy-making, democratic
management and democratic supervision.
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, rural areas throughout China have already carried
out three or four elections of new villagers' committees. Most of
the villagers' committees have established villagers' congresses
and representative conferences and the system of making public
village affairs.
</P>
<P>
Since the promulgation of the new Organic Law on Villagers'
Committees in 1999, nearly half of the provinces, municipalities
directly under the Central Government and autonomous regions have
published their own rules and regulations on the election of
villagers' committees.
</P>
<P>
The election of villagers' committees has been increasingly
standardized, and villagers' right to nominate candidates is
respected.
</P>
<P>
The election procedure, which guarantees the rights of voters,
has been gradually regularized.
</P>
<P>
The procedure involves the methods by which villagers select
formal candidates through preliminary elections, formal candidates
run for the election on an equal footing, voters choose from among
a large number of candidates, candidates make speeches, voters
mark their ballots in specially-designated rooms, ballots are
counted openly, and the election results are announced on the spot.

At present, over 95 percent of rural people in China have
enough to eat and wear, and about 25 percent of them live well-off
lives.
</P>
<P>
While making great efforts to develop the economy and improve
the living standards of the people throughout the country, China
has spared no effort to help poverty-stricken people have enough
to eat and wear. Especially since the adoption of the policy of
reform and opening to the outside world, the Chinese government
has regarded it as a most urgent task to help poverty-stricken
people have sufficient food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
According to the government's unified plan and arrangements, a
large-scale help-the-poor drive has been started throughout the
country in a planned way. Over the past 20 years, the Chinese
government has helped more than 200 million rural people get
enough food and clothes, and has reduced the number of poverty-
stricken rural population from 250 million in 1978 to 4.2 million.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of poverty-stricken people in the total rural
population has decreased from 30.7 percent to 4.6 percent. The
average annual net income of poverty-stricken people increased
from 206 RMB yuan in 1985 to 1,318 RMB yuan in 1998, and the
production and livelihood levels of poverty-stricken areas have
greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
In the past 20 years, the poverty-stricken population worldwide
has risen year by year, and the poor have become poorer. In China,
however, the number of poverty-stricken people has been decreasing
by 10 million every year on average, making China lead the world
in the speed of reducing the number of poverty-stricken people.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the World Bank and the UNDP issued a report after a
comprehensive survey of China's help-the-poor work, which points
out: "The number of poverty-stricken people is increasing in many
places in the world, but China is an exception." And "China has
achieved world-renowned progress in solving the poverty problem."

Three security systems--the basic living security system for
people laid off by state-owned enterprises, unemployment insurance
and the basic living security system for residents of cities and
towns--have been established, and thus the basic needs of life of
laid-off and unemployed people have been effectively guaranteed.
Meanwhile, wages have been rising rapidly; the average annual
income of employees in cities and towns increased from 445 RMB
yuan in 1952 to 7,479 RMB yuan in 1998, or an increase of 3.8
times based on comparable prices.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, the working time has been shortened from
eight hours a day and 48 hours a week in the past to the present
eight hours a day and 40 hours a week. Before the founding of the
PRC, there were only a few small training schools for technicians
in the whole country.
</P>
<P>
But now, a multi-form and multi-layer vocational education and
training system has been established, basically meeting the needs
of economic construction. The proportion of new employees in
cities and towns receiving various types of training has reached
70 percent.
</P>
<P>
There was no social security system for employees in old China,
but in New China a comprehensive and well-funded social security
system has gradually emerged. At present, except for some ex-
employees whose pensions are still paid by their old enterprises,
the number of people participating in the basic retirement
insurance policy is 94.33 million, a coverage rate of 84 percent.
Among them, there are more than 28 million retired people.

At the end of 1999, a total of 99.12 million employees were
covered by unemployment insurance, more than 15 million unemployed
were receiving relief funds and 7.5 million unemployed people had
been re-employed.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of New China, the state has set up free
medical services and a labor-protection medical care system at
public expense, and at the end of 1998, 177.81 million persons
were benefiting from these services.
</P>
<P>
Insurance against injury at work is now practised in more than
1,700 cities and counties throughout the country, covering over 37.
8 million employees, and childbirth insurance is available in 1,
412 cities and counties, covering 27.77 million women employees.
By the end of October 1999, 668 cities and 1,638 counties in the
country had established systems for ensuring basic living needs,
benefiting two million residents living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
In old China there was not even the most basic medical and
health service for ordinary people. But nowadays, medical
institutions can be found everywhere, and a comprehensive medical
and health service system has begun to emerge.
</P>
<P>
In 1949, China had only 3,670 medical institutions, 84,600
hospital beds and 505,000 medical and health personnel, and there
were only 0.15 hospital bed, 0.93 medical and health personnel, 0.
67 doctor and 0.06 nurse (paramedic) per thousand people. In 1998,
China had 314,100 health institutions, 3.143 million hospital beds
and 4.4237 million medical and health personnel, and there were 2.
4 hospital beds, 3.64 medical and health personnel, 1.65 doctors

The people's health has greatly improved. The incidence of
acute epidemic diseases has decreased from 20,000 per 100,000
people before the founding of the PRC to 203.4 per 100,000 people;
the death rate, from 33 per 1,000 people to 6.49 per 1,000 people
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The average life expectancy of Chinese people has increased
from 35 years in 1949 to 70.8 years at present, 10 years longer
than that of the developing countries and the same as that of the
medium-developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Culture and education in old China were extremely backward.
Most working people had almost no opportunity to receive education.
</P>
<P>
However, the right to receive education in New China is
guaranteed and realized. In 1998, nine-year compulsory education
was practised in areas where 73 percent of the population live.
The enrollment rate for primary school-age children has increased
from 20 percent before 1949 to 99.3 percent, and for junior middle
school-age children, 87.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
These figures exceed the average figures for developing
countries in the corresponding period. Over the past 50 years, 230
million illiterates have been taught to read and write, the
illiteracy rate has decreased from 80 percent of the total
population to 14.5 percent; adult illiteracy rate has decreased
below 5.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Lead ASEAN Investment Promotion Mission to Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will lead the
first investment promotion mission of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN), which will visit Japan beginning February
28, Malaysian International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah
Aziz said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two-day mission, to be led by Rafidah herself, will offer
the region as a single attractive destination to lure more
investments in the aftermath of the economic crisis, she said at a
press conference after meeting here Takashi Tajima, secretary-
general of the Asian Productivity Center.
</P>
<P>
All the 10 ASEAN member countries -- Brunei, Cambodia,
Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand and Vietnam -- will be represented in the mission
together with representatives from their respective private
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said the main objective of the mission is to show
Japanese investors that the ASEAN has already recovered from the
economic crisis and to provide the ASEAN with the opportunity to
market the countries in the grouping collectively.
</P>
<P>
During the mission, a seminar will be held where ASEAN
Secretary-General Rodolfo Severino will deliver a progress report
on the ASEAN Free Trade Area and the ASEAN Investment Area and
speakers who have investments in the region will be invited to
talk about their companies' experience in doing business in the
ASEAN, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Our priority now is to bring in foreign investments into ASEAN
after the financial crisis. It does not matter where the
investment dollars go to. Each of us has our own competitive
advantage. The best way to inform these investors of the actual
situation now in each of our countries is to go and meet them
personally," she said.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said it was better to work in the ASEAN concept for if
investors go out of the ASEAN, then the region will lose
completely.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN investment mission is one of the initiatives agreed
upon at the 31st ASEAN Economic Ministers meeting held in
Singapore last year, at which it was also decided that Singapore
will head a similar ASEAN investment promotion mission to the
United States in March or April while Thailand will lead the third
such mission to Europe in June.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Thursday
suggested that the Asian Productivity Organization (APO) move
toward formulating Asian benchmarks to gauge productivity, quality
and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah
Aziz told reporters that she made the suggestion during her
meeting with APO Secretary-General Takashi Tajima here.
</P>
<P>
Until today, Asian countries, including Malaysia, are using
Western benchmarks but they are not applicable in all instances,
Rafidah told a press conference after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
She was of the view that Asian countries can formulate their
own benchmarks based on the Asian working environment.
</P>
<P>
However, she said, "Of course we will continue to tap on
Western methods too and adapt them into Asian benchmarks to suit
our needs."
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said that although the task would be time-consuming, it
is an initiative that should be taken given the globalization
process and the fact that foreign investors invest in Asia because
of the better returns.
</P>
<P>
Having Asian benchmarks will make Asian industries even more
competitive and perhaps one day, they will be adopted by the rest
of the world, she said.

<HEADLINE> Field Trials of GMOs Urged in New Zealand </HEADLINE>

<P>
WELLINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's crown
research institute, Agresearch, has warned that years of cutting
edge research will be at risk if the government puts a ban on
field trials of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
</P>
<P>
Agresearch has applied to New Zealand's Environmental Risk
Management Authority (ERMA) for permission to breed a sheep
without the gene which limits muscle growth. But ERMA has received
about 80 public submissions on the application, with most opposing
the experiment.
</P>
<P>
The Green Party, whose support is badly needed by the minority
government newly-formed by the Labor Party and the alliance in the
parliament, has called for a moratorium on genetic engineering
field trials until a Royal Commission of Inquiry into genetic
engineering has been completed.
</P>
<P>
An Agresearch spokesman, John Bass, said here Thursday in a
statement that the sheep gene experiment is part of ground
breaking research the crown research institute has been doing on
muscle damage.
</P>
<P>
He said that about 30 other groups are now concentrating on the
gene and the research will not be worth resuming if the institute
loses its competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
The research can provide important information about the muscle
wasting process in humans," Bass said.
</P>
<P>
But the Green Party health spokesperson, Sue Kedgley, said the
institute should follow the example of the biotechnology company,
Monsanto, and put the project on hold until after genetic
engineering inquiry.

Hence China has thoroughly changed the situation which
prevailed in old China in which the majority of the Chinese
population lived in a state of hunger or semi-starvation, and has
created the miracle of feeding 22 percent of the total population
of the world on only 7 percent of the world's total cultivated
land, the white paper noted.
</P>
<P>
At present, over 95 percent of rural people in China have
enough to eat and wear. The average life expectancy of Chinese
people has increased from 35 years in 1949 to 70.8 years at
present, up to level of the medium-developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, China has
made great progress in its efforts to build the democratic and
legal systems, and people's civic rights and political rights are
maintained and guaranteed according to law, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress and local people's congresses
are the organs through which the people exercise state power.
Deputies to the people's congresses at all levels are elected, and
are responsible to and accept supervision from the people.

As parties friendly to the Chinese Communist Party, the eight
non-Communist parties participate in government and political
affairs, engaging in consultations concerning state policies and
leadership candidates, management of national affairs, and the
formulation and implementation of state policy, laws and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the people's political consultative
conferences at different levels play an important role in the
state's political life by means of political consultation,
democratic supervision and participation in the administration and
discussion of state affairs, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"Democracy at the grass-roots level is an important means for
ensuring that citizens directly exercise their democratic rights,"
the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
By directly electing members of villagers' committees and
deciding upon major affairs of their villages through democratic
discussions, the rural masses fully exercise their rights of
democratic election, democratic policy-making, democratic
management and democratic supervision.
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, rural areas throughout China have already carried
out three to four elections of new villagers' committees,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
"China guarantees, according to law, that citizens enjoy
extensive basic freedoms and rights," the paper stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution clearly states that citizens enjoy freedom of
speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of procession,
of demonstration and of religious belief. Freedom of the person
and personal dignity, and the residences of citizens are
inviolable. Freedom and privacy of correspondence of citizens are
protected by law.

<P>
"The state protects the freedom of religious belief and the
normal religious activities of citizens," the paper said.

<P>
"Both the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference include people who have
religious beliefs and who come from various social groups and

</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, in a bid to strictly enforce laws and
strengthen the protection of human rights during the judicial
process, people's courts have carried out an in-depth reform of
adjudication methods.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts have been made according to law to promote public
adjudication in an all-round way, and strengthen the supervision
of adjudication by society and public opinion so as to ensure
judicial fairness," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The establishment and development of the lawyer and legal aid
systems are playing an increasingly important role in protecting
the legitimate rights and interests of citizens, and maintaining
the correct enforcement of the law, it said.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that ethnic minorities, along with the majority
Han ethnic group, have equally enjoyed all of the civic rights
granted by the Constitution and laws, and in addition enjoying the
special rights of ethnic minorities according to law.
</P>
<P>
China practices ethnic regional autonomy in areas where ethnic
minority people live in compact communities. The autonomous areas
have the right to enact regulations on the exercise of autonomy
and separate regulations in light of local political, economic and
cultural characteristics.

"Fifty years is but a moment in human history," the paper noted.
Nevertheless, in the past 50 years the Chinese people have made a
great historic leap in the development of human rights.
</P>
<P>
"We can say that the human rights situation in present-day
China is totally different from that of the old China -- even
compared with the years before the initiation of the reform and
opening-up policy, the great progress that has been made in this
respect is universally acknowledged," it said.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that since China introduced the policy of
reform and opening-up, it has found a road for the promotion and
development of human rights that suits its reality.
</P>
<P>
"This means putting the rights to subsistence and development
in the first place, under the conditions of reform, development
and stability, and thus promoting human rights development in an
all-round way," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Practice has proved that building socialism with Chinese
characteristics is a road of development that is in accordance
with the fundamental interests of the Chinese people, and also the
only road which can effectively promote human rights in China,"
the paper stressed.
</P>
<P>
It expressed the belief that as long as China follows the plans
laid down at the Party's 15th National Congress, while continuing
to carry out the three-stage economic development strategy,
earnestly implement the general plan of governing the country
according to law, and strive to build a socialist country ruled by
law, its human rights situation will continue to see marked
improvement.

<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full text of
the white paper China issued today on its human rights progress in
the past 50 years, entitled "50 Years of Progress in China's Human
Rights":
</P>
<P>
The year 1999 witnessed the 50th anniversary of the founding of
the People's Republic of China. For the previous half century, the
Chinese people, led by the Chinese government, had unswervingly
probed into and fought for the elimination of poverty and
backwardness, the building of a rich, strong, democratic and
civilized country, and the achievement of the lofty ideal of
complete human rights. As a result, the situation of human rights
in China has seen tremendous changes.
</P>
<P>
I. A Historical Turning Point in the Progress of Human Rights
in China
</P>
<P>
In the old semi-colonial, semi-feudal China, the broad masses
were oppressed by imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat capitalism,
and had no human rights at all. But after New China was founded in
1949, the Chinese government and people waged a series of large-
scale campaigns, rapidly sweeping away the dregs left over from
the old society, and established a basic political system which
could promote and protect human rights, so that the nation and
society took on an entirely new look and a new epoch was started
for the progress of human rights in China.
</P>
<P>
--Realizing and upholding genuine and complete national
independence, and creating the requisite premise for the progress
of human rights. Invaded and enslaved by various foreign powers,
old China lost its state sovereignty, and its people's human
rights lost their minimum guarantee. The first important
achievement of the Chinese Communist Party, which led the Chinese
people to victory in the people's democratic revolution, was to
drive the imperialist invaders out of China, paving the way for
China to realize real independence.

II. Great Improvement in the Rights to Subsistence and
Development, and Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
</P>
<P>
In the past 50 years since the founding of New China,
especially since the initiation of reform and opening to the
outside world some 20 year ago, the Chinese government has always
put the people's rights to subsistence and development first,
focused on economic construction, and made efforts to develop
social productivity.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, China's economy and society have advanced by
leaps and bounds, its comprehensive national strength has been
raised, and the people's livelihood has improved by a large margin
by realizing two historic leaps -- bringing them from poverty to
having enough to eat and wear, and then to living a better-off
life.
</P>
<P>
In 1952, China's GDP was only 67.9 billion RMB yuan, a figure
which rose to 7,939.6 billion RMB yuan in 1998, with an average
annual growth rate of 7.7 percent allowing for price rises, or
over 2.5 times the average world growth rate in the same period.
</P>
<P>
From 1952 to 1998, the industrial added value increased by 159
times calculated according to the constant prices, with an average
annual growth rate of 11.6 percent; the agricultural added value
increased by 4.5 times, with an average annual growth rate of 3.3
percent; and the total foreign trade volume increased from US$ 1.
13 billion in 1950 to US$ 323.9 billion in 1998, or an increase of
287 times, with an average annual growth rate of 12.5 percent. (

<P>
The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
which was inaugurated in 1949, witnessed the adoption of the
Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, served as the country's provisional constitution, the
election of the Central People's Government, and the declaration
of the birth of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The Common Program clearly stipulated that state power belonged
to the people, who, according to the law, had the right to vote
and stand for election, and had the freedoms of ideology, speech,
publication, gathering, forming associations, communication,
personal affairs, residence, change of residence, religious belief
and demonstration.
</P>
<P>
It also stipulated that all the laws, decrees and judicial
systems enacted by the reactionary Kuomintang government to
oppress the people had been abolished, that laws and decrees were
to be formulated to protect the people, and that the people's
judicial system was to be established.
</P>
<P>
In February 1953, China promulgated the Electoral Law of the
People's Republic of China. In December 1953, a general election
was held nationwide. The registered electors accounted for 97
percent of the citizens of and above the age of 18, of whom 85.88
percent participated in the election. They elected 5.669 million
grass-roots deputies, and 1,226 deputies to the National People's
Congress. These deputies featured wide representativeness.

This was the first nationwide general election in Chinese
history; it helped to realize the people's democratic right to
participate in the management of state affairs.
</P>
<P>
In September 1954, the First Session of the First National
People's Congress was held in Beijing. Based on the people's
democracy, the session adopted the Constitution of the People's
Republic of China. Before being submitted to the National People's
Congress for examination, the draft Constitution was made public
for the whole country to hold a two-month discussion. About 150
million people took part in the discussion, and put forward more
than 1.16 million questions and suggestions for amendments and
supplements.
</P>
<P>
The enacting of the national constitution on the basis of such
a broad discussion by the whole country was not only unprecedented
in Chinese history, but also rare in the history of the world. The
Constitution stated the nature of the state, the functions of
state organs, and the rights and duties of citizens, laying a
foundation for China's democracy and legal construction.
</P>
<P>
The construction and improvement of the basic political system
on the basis of people's democracy provided a fundamental
political guarantee for the realization of the right of the people
to be the masters of their own affairs.

Prostitution, drug trafficking and addiction, and gambling are
social evils left over from old China, as well as chronic social
diseases endangering the people's physical and mental health. They
were resolutely prohibited right after the founding of New China.
</P>
<P>
In November 1949, the second people's congress of Beijing took
the lead in prohibiting prostitution. The city promptly closed all
brothels, and provided education and medical treatment for
prostitutes, enabling them to live off their own labor. Following
Beijing, all other large, middle-sized and small cities nationwide
successively prohibited prostitution.
</P>
<P>
In a short period of time, this hotbed of crimes, which had
seriously ruined women's physical and mental health and their
dignity for more than 3,000 years in China, was stamped out. As
for drug taking, gambling and other social evils which were
closely connected with the reactionary ruling forces and the
underworld in old China, the people's government, on one hand
mobilized the masses to struggle against and punish drug producers,
drug traffickers and gambling rings, and on the other it did
extensive publicity work so as to enhance the consciousness of the
masses, and reform drug addicts and gamblers.
</P>
<P>
After two to three years of efforts, these social plagues,
which had not vanished despite repeated prohibitions in old China,
were basically wiped out, and China's social life took a new and
healthy turn for the better.

On the premise of fully respecting the will of ethnic
minorities, and respecting and protecting their religious beliefs,
customs and habits, the Chinese government helped minority peoples
to reform their backward production methods and social systems,
and develop economic and cultural undertakings, thus enabling the
social development of the ethnic minorities to leap over several
historical stages.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee the special rights and interests of ethnic
minorities, the Chinese government established ethnic self-
government organs and instituted ethnic regional autonomy in the
areas where ethnic minorities live in compact communities.
</P>
<P>
In August 1952, China promulgated the Outline for the
Implementation of Ethnic Regional Autonomy in the People's
Republic of China, which specifies the details of the policy of
ethnic regional autonomy. The successful implementation of ethnic
regional autonomy has effectively guaranteed the equal rights of
ethnic minorities in the big family of China, and their right to
administer their respective ethnic and local affairs in a self-
governing manner.

economic development and the improvement of the people's enjoyment
of human rights.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of New China, the People's Government
carried out land reform and other democratic reforms, and adopted
powerful measures to stabilize prices and promote economic
development.
</P>
<P>
It took only three years for China to heal the wounds of war,
and build the national economy and the people's livelihood to the
highest level in history. On this basis, the Chinese government
lost no time in starting the socialist reform of agriculture,
handicraft industry and capitalist industry and commerce, thus
fundamentally eliminating the system of exploitation of man by man
and establishing basic economic system of socialism.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Chinese people have become the masters of their
means of production and the owners of the wealth of society, thus
calling forth their enthusiasm for building a new country and
creating a new life, and promoting the rapid development of
society and the economy, and the improvement of the people's
livelihood.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the national total industrial output
value in 1957 had increased by 128.3 percent over that of 1952,
with an average annual growth of 18 percent; the total
agricultural output value had risen by 25 percent; and the average
consumption level of all the people in the country had grown by
more than one third.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the socialist system has provided the
basic guarantee for the people throughout the country to
constantly improve their human rights situation on the basis of
equal participation in economic development and sharing labor
achievements.
</P>
<P>
Through these profound social reforms, involving getting rid of
the old and creating the new, New China has not only realized a
historic turning point in the development of human rights, but
also initiated a brand-new starting point for further exploration
and the progress and development of the cause of human rights. (

According to a United Nations estimate, China ranks seventh in
the world in terms of the size of its economy; 11th in total
foreign trade volume; second in foreign exchange reserves; and
ninth in comprehensive national strength.
</P>
<P>
At present, the GNP created by China within 12 days is
equivalent to the GNP of the whole year of 1952. Now China leads
the world in the output of steel, coal, cement, chemical
fertilizer, TV, crops, meat, cotton, peanuts, rapeseed, fruit and
other important industrial and agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
China's total grain output increased from 110 million tons in
1949 to 510 million tons in 1998, or an increase of over 3.5 times,
with an average annual growth rate of 3.1 percent, higher than the
world growth rate during the same period. Meanwhile, the
proportion of China's grain output in the world's total increased
from 17 percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
At present, China ranks first in the world in terms of total
grain output, and the average per-capita amount of grain, meat,
eggs and aquatic products exceeds the world level. Hence China has
thoroughly changed the situation which prevailed in old China in
which the majority of the Chinese population lived in a state of

In 1949, the average annual income per urban resident was less
than 100 RMB yuan, and that per rural resident, less than 50 RMB
yuan. In 1978, the average annual income per urban resident came
to 343 RMB yuan, and that per rural resident, 134 RMB yuan.
</P>
<P>
 Between 1978 and 1998, the average annual income per urban
resident increased to 5,425 RMB yuan, or an increase of 3.3 times
allowing for price rises, with an average annual growth rate of 6.
1 percent, and that per rural resident, to 2,162 RMB yuan, or an
increase of 4.6 times allowing for price rises, with an average
annual growth rate of 7.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The annual net consumption level of the people increased from
80 RMB yuan per capita in 1952 to 2,972 RMB yuan in 1998, and the
savings deposits of both urban and rural residents grew from 860
million RMB yuan to 5,340.8 billion RMB yuan. In the early days of
New China, 80 percent of urban residents' income was used to buy
food and clothes, and 90 percent in rural areas, which dropped to
55.6 percent and 59.6 percent, respectively, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Engel coefficient (the proportion of food expenditure in
consumer expenditure) of urban residents was always over 57
percent before the policy of reform and opening to the outside
world was introduced, a figure which dropped to 44.5 percent in
1998, and consumption has reached the well-off level as a whole.
In 1954, the Engel coefficient of rural residents was as high as
69 percent.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, the consumption structure of rural residents had been
greatly improved, with the Engel coefficient decreasing to 53.4
percent; their cultural, recreational and service expenditures had
risen up to 25.4 percent; and the proportions of accommodation and
clothing expenditures were 15.1 percent and 6.2 percent,
respectively. This indicates that in consumption the proportion
dedicated to mere means of subsistence has remarkably decreased,
and that dedicated to development and enjoyment has greatly risen.

KUALA LUMPUR, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's air freight
industry has been urged to consolidate to face tremendous changes
from accelerated globalization and liberalization in the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
Making the call here Thursday, Malaysian Prime Minister

forwarders might have to seek strategic partners in the transport
and logistics chain, paving the way for mergers in the air freight
industry.

"Given such a situation, it is timely and relevant for the
Malaysian freight community to work together to consolidate their
resources and operations," he said when opening "Air Freight Asia

He said, "The government believes that such mergers will boost
our competitive edge in new markets in the Asia Pacific and beyond.

Mahathir said the air freight industry is likely to witness
even greater competition between the traditional airlines and the
integrators as they transform into total logistics service
providers.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the local freight forwarders to consider
partnering with shipping and road haulage companies to enable them
to become multi-modal companies or total logistics providers
linking surface, sea and air freight businesses.
</P>
<P>
Another significant development that might impact the industry
is the merger of cargo divisions of airlines, he said, adding that
although this relatively new development involves a very limited
number of airlines, the benefits of such tie-ups would eventually
encourage other airlines to enter into similar arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir was of the view that the consolidation of the
Malaysian freight industry will benefit all parties with the
players to profit from their foresight while their customers would
enjoy better rates and services.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Ready to Testify in Anwar Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Thursday that he would present himself for
testimony in the sodomy trial of his former Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim if the court rules that it is relevant for him to
testify.
</P>
<P>
"If it's relevant of course I will have to go. That is the law.
There is nothing I can do about it," Mahathir told reporters after
opening the Air Freight Asia 2000 Conference here when asked to
comment on a defense request for his testimony in the trial.
</P>
<P>
Hoping that his testimony would be relevant to the case as he
would not like it to be just a kind of political stunt, Mahathir
said,"If it is not relevant to the case and they just want to make
a political show of it, I don't think it is being very fair."
</P>
<P>
The High Court here is hearing Thursday submissions from the
prosecution and the defense on the relevancy of Mahathir's
testimony before deciding whether the prime minister should be
called to the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
Justice Arifin Jaka decided to hear the submissions after the
prosecution objected Wednesday the defense's move to call Mahathir
as witness. The prosecution said it would not be relevant to the
case.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, 52, who is serving a six-year jail sentence for
corruption,and his adopted brother Sukma Darmawan Sasmitaat Madja,
39, are jointly charged with sodomizing Azizan Abu Bakar, 39, the
former driver of Anwar's wife.

WARSAW, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Relations between Poland and
Belarus turn further tense after the long detention of 47
Belarussian citizens by Polish police.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Polish police detained the Belarussians on the
border, accusing them of engaging in illegal commercial activities
in Poland. Ten of them were held over 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
The Belarussian Foreign Ministry protested to the Polish
ambassador Tuesday, charging that Warsaw did not handle the issues
in the spirit of cooperation and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Polish Foreign Ministry spokesman Pawel
Dobrowolski said Wednesday that Belarus "over-reacted" to the
matter, because it was an administrative decision of Poland with
no political background.

Last August, Poland expelled 25 Belarussians for the same

<HEADLINE> Rodman Suspended One Game, Fined $10,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- It took Dennis Rodman all
of two games to get himself suspended.
</P>
<P>
Rodman was suspended one game without pay and fined $10,000
today by the NBA for his actions in the Dallas Mavericks' 112-99
loss to the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday. He will sit out Thursday's
home contest against one of his former teams, the Detroit Pistons.
</P>
<P>
The flaky forward reacted somewhat harshly to the suspension,
telling reporters he and NBA commissioner David Stern should "get
in a ring and get it on."
</P>
<P>
In just his second game with the Mavericks, Rodman was tossed
with 7:16 to play. He became livid after officials missed an
obvious illegal defense by Bucks center Ervin Johnson, who was
camped in the lane while Rodman, his defensive assignment, stood
well behind the 3-point line.
</P>
<P>
As play went the other way, Rodman continued to berate the
officials and received his first technical from referee Ken Mauer.
In an effort to prove his point, Rodman retreated to the scene of
the missed call and sat down in the lane to demonstrate Johnson's
defensive position. He immediately was given his second technical
and an automatic ejection by official David Jones.
</P>
<P>
Rodman tore off his No. 70 jersey and handed it to a boy under
the basket before exiting.
</P>
<P>
"They always have it out for me," Rodman said after the contest.
"The first person they look for is Dennis Rodman. He looked at me
and threw me out. I didn't say anything. I sat down and that was
it."
</P>
<P>
Rodman actually was having a good game before tossed. He had 16
rebounds -- the most by a Dallas player this season -- and added
six points and four assists in 36 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The Mavericks had won seven of eight games before Rodman
arrived, but have lost two straight with the eccentric rebounding
star in the lineup.

<HEADLINE> Norway Offers to Help Solve S. Lankan Ethnic Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Norway Wednesday evening
expressed its willingness to help initiate a dialogue between the
Sri Lankan government and Tamil Tiger rebels to resolve the ethnic
problem in the country, the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry said in a
press release Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek, who was here on a
one-day visit on Wednesday, said his country was willing to do
this when he met Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga and
discussed with her and her officials for four hours modalities for
starting direct talks between the government and the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
The minister had earlier discussed the issue with opposition
leader Ranil Wickremesinghe.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a bitter ethnic civil war between
government troops and LTTE rebels who demand a separate state for
minority Tamils in the north and east of the country since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Vollebaek said that the conflict in Sri Lanka could only be
solved by political means and that the basis for a dialogue must
be established between the parties, according to the press release.
</P>
<P>
"This places a heavy responsibility on the parties themselves.
I am encouraged by the expressed willingness to seek a political
solution. However this will take time. It will be difficult and
will require courage and sacrifices. It will require the necessary
political will from the parties," the minister was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar described the
Norwegian foreign minister's mission as a historic juncture in
bilateral relations. He hoped that the important meetings held
would pave the way for bringing peace to Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
At discussions at the ministerial level, views were exchanged
on the prospects of greater bilateral cooperation through trade
and investment, developments in the region and matters pertaining
to international issues.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, February 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 100,000 children, 40
percent of them of pre-school ages, are roaming the streets of
Ukraine, posing a serious threat to the country's social order,
authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An official from the presidential office told the press that
the country's homeless population, estimated to total 280,000, is
increasingly younger while the number of homeless children from
rural areas is on an alarming rise.
</P>
<P>
He called for more public attention to the vast number of the
young homeless, which he said constitutes a breeding ground for
juvenile delinquency.
</P>
<P>
The official stressed the need to build more homes for children,
noting that Ukraine now has only 82 orphanages, far from enough to
cope with the situation.
</P>
<P>
On January 28, President Leonid Kuchma issued a decree urging
joint efforts by government and communities to halt the increase
of homeless children and give them the assistance needed. The
government has set up a special committee to deal with the problem.

</P>

Albania with technological support needed for the latter to
further stabilize its economy, hoping that Albania would assist
Hungary in its participation in the economic reconstruction in
Southeast Europe.

During his visit, Meidani also met his Hungarian counterpart
Goncz Arpad and signed an agreement on bilateral health and
medical cooperation.

YANGON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Electric power generated by the
state-run Myanmar Electric Power Enterprise (MEPE), the main
electricity supplier of the country, totaled 3.498 billion

drop from the 3.636 billion kwh a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures of the official Economic

compared with a year ago.

Myanmar is building five more hydroelectric power plants--
Paunglaung, Zaungtu, Mone, Thaphanseik and Maipan, which, upon
completion, will add 407 mw more to Myanmar's installed generating

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar absorbed a total of 37.
553 million U.S. dollars in foreign investment in the first 10
months of 1999, 84.8 percent less than the 247 million dollars
drawn in the same period of 1998, according to the country's
Central Statistical Organization.
</P>
<P>
These investments, which came from Britain, Japan, Thailand,
India, Singapore, China's Hong Kong, Indonesia and South Korea,
covered the sectors of mining, manufacturing, hotels and tourism,
and fishery.
</P>
<P>
The sharp drop in foreign investment is attributed mainly to
the impact of the Asian financial crisis which, the Myanmar
authorities admitted, has brought about a reduction of 70 percent
in direct investment from member countries of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, since Myanmar opened to
foreign investment in late 1988, the country had obtained from 24
countries and regions a total of 7.1244 billion dollars in
investment by the end of October 1999.

with 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The growth of agriculture and fishing sectors was due to
greater harvests of rice, sesame, safflower, soybean, sorghum and
tomato, and also due to the large catch of shellfish and fish, the
secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
In the service sector, a great dynamism was seen in trade,
communications, transport and finances, reflected in higher rates
of employment, the secretariat noted.
</P>
<P>
Mining, down by 3.2 percent, was the only sector that
registered a fall last year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Official Calls on Ecuador to Resume Constitutional Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Under Secretary
for Political Affairs Thomas Pickering Wednesday urged all
Ecuadorian political parties to maintain social and political
stability and contribute to economic development in the country.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador's political parties have a role to play "in preserving
Ecuador's fragile democracy," Pickering told a press conference at
Carondelet Palace after a two-hour meeting with Ecuadorian
President Gustavo Noboa.
</P>
<P>
He said he had a better understanding of the economic
difficulties the country has confronted and that he was convinced
President Noboa will undertake the reforms necessary to improve
the economy.
</P>
<P>
Pickering also condemned a bloodless coup on January 21 which
deposed President Jamil Mahuad. Noboa who then was vice president
assumed presidency with the support of the military.
</P>
<P>
Though the coup "demonstrated the worst imaginable" for this
country, "Noboa deserves the support of all Ecuadorians, of the
United States and the international community," Pickering said.
</P>
<P>
The Ecuadorian constitution clearly indicated that the
president is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and all
military forces "have an obligation to obey his authority and not
involve themselves in politics," Pickering added.
</P>
<P>
Pickering's brief visit to Ecuador is part of his tour to
Colombia, Venezuela and Brazil.

<HEADLINE> Clinton:N.Ireland Peace Hopeful Despite Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said he was still hopeful of the future of the Northern Ireland
peace process despite the difficulties it currently met.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after the Irish Republican Army (IRA)
announcement on Tuesday of withdrawal from the talks with Northern
Ireland's disarmament body, which plunged the already troubled
peace process deeper into crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the White House, Clinton said
the development was "unfortunate" and the peace process was "in a
rough spot."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, there are still some positive things in the
peace process, stressing that "the Irish had no taste of what self-
government" one year ago. "They now have had it, and they like it.
"
</P>
<P>
The second positive point is the IRA has "given no indication
whatever that they will revert to violence," Clinton added. "And
so that means that they still think even, no matter what the
rhetoric says, that all the parties really believe that they ought
to find a way to work this out."
</P>
<P>
Clinton told reporters that he followed the development on
Northern Ireland "virtually every day."
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you what the end will be; I can only tell you
that I think we're way ahead of where we would have been. And I
still think there's a good chance we'll get there," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We've got to keep going forward. The most important thing now
is to look about how to go forward," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of parties involved in the Northern Ireland peace
process blamed each other for the failure to make a breakthrough
in the effort to rescue the Good Friday agreement signed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The peace process ran into an impasse after Britain suspended
Northern Ireland's self-rule last week due to IRA's rejection to
disarm itself and a lack of progress in the talks on the issue.
</P>
<P>
British officials took some comfort however from the fact that
the IRA gave no sign of ending the cease-fire it has observed
since 1997.

<HEADLINE> SOEs Urged to Improve Competition Edge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Large enterprises and
conglomerates should improve their competition edge to form a
solid base for China's national economy, says today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Being large does not necessarily mean being strong, warned the
English Language paper, adding that the emergence of conglomerates
must bring about better allocation of resources, higher efficiency,
and hereinafter, multiplied profits.
</P>
<P>
Large enterprises and conglomerates must have their own
advantages and competitive edge, which is mainly embodied in their
technological innovation, new product development capability and
their marketing ability, the Daily says.
</P>
<P>
They must set up their own enterprise image, core products,
famous brand names, technological patents and independent market
shares.
</P>
<P>
They also must be capable of developing new products and
expanding the market continuously. "Otherwise, the larger they are,
the more danger they will be in."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper called for these firms pay attention to their
financial structure, saying that many Chinese large State-owned
enterprises are now burdened with heavy debts. the State Council
is carrying out the debt-equity swap policy, which is conducive to
creating a favorable environment for SOEs with high debt rates.
</P>
<P>
Large conglomerates must check their accounts carefully to
excise non-operating assets, superfluous branches, and non-
profitable businesses to improve their efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Scientific market investigation is most conducive to making the
correct production decision, the newspaper says. At present, with
the income increase and the saturation of traditional consuming
products, growth brought by production scale expansion barely
exists any longer.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Smuggling Efforts Yield Progress: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Large-scale smuggling, which
once undermined the State coffer and hurt China's domestic
industries, is now essentially under control, today's China daily
quoted a senior Chinese customs official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"But that does not mean the war is over, and the Chinese
government will in no way relax its efforts to eliminate smuggling,
" said Qian Guanlin, head of the General Administration of Customs.
</P>
<P>
Qian told a national conference Tuesday that the successes
achieved in anti-smuggling campaign are visible in three areas:
the somewhat similar figures of the Chinese customs' figure of the
Chinese mainland imports from Hong Kong with the Hong Kong customs
' figure of its exports to the mainland, the surge in customs
tariff income and the improvement of domestic manufacturing
enterprises' economic conditions, the Daily said.
</P>
<P>
"Because most smuggled goods are shipped from Hong Kong to the
mainland, the export volume from Hong Kong to the mainland
reported by mainland customs used to be much less than the figure
by the Hong Kong customs before the initiation of the anti-
smuggling campaign," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The mainland's customs book noted the figure at 11.7 billion U.
S. dollars less than that provided by the Hong Kong side in 1997.
During the first 11 months of 1999, the mainland's figure was 3.5
billion U.S. dollars higher than Hong Kong's, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the customs tariff income soared by 71.1 billion
yuan (8.6 billion U.S. dollars), or 80.2 percent, from a year
earlier to hit 158.9 billion yuan (19.1 billion U.S. dollars) in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that his administration will try to completely cut
off the capital flow channels of smugglers by further working with
banks to strengthen the computer network system this year, the
paper said.

MEXICO CITY February 16 (Xinhua) -- Trade between Mexico and
the European Union (EU) will increase 150 percent in two or three
years after the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) enters into force, a
Mexican official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The new FTA will safeguard market access, cut tariffs and fix
rule of origin, said Mexican Vice Foreign Trade Secretary Decio de

Mexico City.

<HEADLINE> Urbanites in Guangzhou Enjoy More Living Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The per capita living space
in Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, had
expanded to 12.21 square meters by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The figure exceeded the national standard for a relatively
comfortable life as set by the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
A local government official attributed this to the drop in
price of commercial housing and the steady increase in local
residents' net income.
</P>
<P>
Right now, the per sq. meter selling price of commercial
housing in Guangzhou has sunk to 5,000 yuan or less. Meanwhile,
the per capita disposable income in urban Guangzhou averages 12,
019 yuan annually.
</P>
<P>
The price of a 60-sq-m apartment is roughly six to 10 times a
family's annual income-- a figure that is affordable for the
majority of local residents, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The city sold commercial housing with floor space totaling 6.24
million square meters last year, setting an all-time record.

<HEADLINE> Supply of High-Quality Vegetables to HK Guaranteed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Quality inspection of
vegetables for the dinner tables of Hong Kong has been strictly
observed in Guangdong Province, which borders the international
metropolis, according to the provincial Entry-Exit Inspection and
Quarantine Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Jun, vice director of the Animal and Plant Quarantine
Office with the bureau, dismissed the rumor that vegetables in
Guangdong might be contaminated with heavy metal pollutants.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua that the office has stepped up the effort on the
related quarantine inspection. No such toxic substance was
detected in vegetables going to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Over 300 cargo trucks carrying fully-loaded fresh vegetables
leave Guangdong for Hong Kong every day. They are collected by
some 60 special purchase stations from 170 designated vegetable
fields in Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
"We send our best vegetables to Hong Kong," said Zhang Wenbin,
director of a vegetable company affiliated with the Guangdong Food
Import and Export Company. "Even vegetables with minor
deficiencies are not qualified for the export."
</P>
<P>
He said that each basket of vegetables ready for transportation
weighs 5,000 kg and is labeled with such specifics as place of
origin, weight, quality inspection serial number and date of
delivery.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong health department has worked closely with the
quarantine bureau in Guangdong to share information. Official
sources said that no cases of Hong Kong residents poisoned by
vegetables from Guangdong were reported in 1999.
</P>
<P>
At this time of the year, spinach, rape and lettuce are popular
vegetables in Hong Kong. The city depends heavily on the vegetable,
fruit and livestock from Guangdong.

<HEADLINE> Grain-Deficient Area Reports Stable Grain Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu
Province, a region where grain shortages are not uncommon, now has
an ample supply thanks to successive good harvests in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Despite a severe drought, the province harvested 8.1 billion kg
of grain last year, the third highest output in its history. Grain
production in Gansu has recorded steady growth since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Gansu's grain reserve has been equal to the provincial sales of
commodity grain for two years.
</P>
<P>
A local agricultural official credited the success to
improvement of farm conditions and application of agro-techniques.
</P>
<P>
Gansu has turned 1.4 million ha of low-yielding mountain slopes
into terraced fields and built many water-saving projects.
</P>
<P>
Starting this year, Gansu will optimize its agricultural
structure and replace unmarketable crop strains with high quality
ones, the official said. The acreage of high quality wheat and
maize will be expanded to 266,000 ha of land in the next five
years.

<HEADLINE> IAAF Rejects Christie Plea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- World athletics governing body
the International Amateur Athletic Association will not intervene
on behalf of Linford Christie, over his suspension from coaching
in Australia.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF, who have banned Christie from competing until he
faces their arbitration panel in April, insist it is up to the
British authorities to lend their support to him.
</P>
<P>
UK Athletics found Christie not guilty of committing a drugs
offence after he tested positive for the anabolic steroid
nandrolone at an indoor meeting in Dortmund last February.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the decision from the government of New South Wales
to ban Christie from using facilities to coach his training squad,
an IAAF spokesman said they were sympathetic towards the former
Olympic 100 meters champion.
</P>
<P>
IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said: "This is a decision by the
government of New South Wales. We cannot and do not have the power
to do anything in support of Christie.
</P>
<P>
"We believe this is a matter for the British government and UK
Athletics. Christie is a free citizen and they should take up this
matter on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
"We understand the New South Wales government have special
rules regarding this issue and they believe they have made the
right decision regarding Christie.
</P>
<P>
"All we can do is reiterate that Christie is suspended from
competing by the IAAF. He remains not guilty of the charge against
him until our Arbitration Panel meets and reviews his case," said
the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> 76ers Land Bull's Kukoc in Three-Way Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chicago Bulls today
traded away versatile forward Toni Kukoc, one of the last links to
their dynasty. The Philadelphia 76ers acquired him in hopes of
starting one.
</P>
<P>
Chicago, Philadelphia and Golden State today completed a three-
way deal. The Warriors acquired guard Larry Hughes and forward
Billy Owens from Philadelphia and shipped guard John Starks and a
conditional No. 1 pick to Chicago. The Bulls also received guard-
forward Bruce Bowen from the Sixers.
</P>
<P>
"In making this trade we add championship experience,"
Philadelphia general manager Billy King said. "Toni provided us
with added scoring and veteran leadership."
</P>
<P>
The pick, acquired from Washington in the Chris Webber deal in
1994, will go to Chicago provided it is not among the top three in
the 2000 draft. If it is a top-three pick, it becomes Chicago's
unconditionally in 2001. Washington has the fifth-worst record in
the league.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Kukoc, who has battled back spasms this season,
is averaging 18.0 points, 5.4 rebounds and 5.2 assists in 24 games.
He was the 29th pick in the 1990 draft and the only player to lead
his team in minutes, scoring, rebounding and assists in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Sixth Man of the Year in 1996, Kukoc was a member of the
Bulls' last three championship teams. After finding a way to get
his shots with Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, Kukoc now joins
a team that features the league's leading scorer, Allen Iverson.
</P>
<P>
Co-existing with Iverson in the framework set forth by
Philadelphia coach Larry Brown reportedly had been a problem for
Hughes, who gets a chance to blossom in the Bay Area. Hughes is
averaging 10.0 points in 50 games this season.
</P>
<P>
Owens, 30, rejoins Golden State, where he enjoyed three solid
seasons between 1991-94. He is averaging 5.9 points and 4.2
rebounds in 46 games this season.
</P>
<P>
Starks, 34, has appeared in 33 games this season and is
averaging 14.7 points and 5.2 assists per game. He is an 11-year
veteran who has averaged 13.6 points and 3.9 assists during his
career.
</P>
<P>
Bowen, 28, has appeared in 42 games as a reserve this season.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Political Structure of Islamic Republic of Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran's legislative elections on
Friday pit the ambitious reformers against the powerful
conservatives for a better future with more freedom and democracy.
</P>
<P>
The reformers hope to take over the Majlis, or parliament,
currently dominated by the conservatives in order to push forwards
the political reforms initiated by President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives, who suffered serious defeats in recent two
years but still control most of the sensitive bodies, vow to defend
the values and ideals of the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The composition of the new legislative body will have an
important impact on the Islamic country's future domestic and
foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
The following is a brief look at the political structure of Iran
ahead of this crucial election:
</P>
<P>
Leadership
</P>
<P>
The leader: Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Husseini Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
The supreme leader is the highest authority in the Islamic
Republic of Iran, who exercises the combined political and
religious power and is a manifestation of theocracy or the
integration of politics with religion in the country.
</P>
<P>
The leader determines the general policies of the system, holds
the supreme command of the armed forces and is also the highest
authority of the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
The leader signs the order of appointment of the president and
is authorized to dismiss the president if he is proved to be
incompetent or have violated his legal functions.
</P>
<P>
The leader is elected by the Experts Assembly composed of 86
senior clerics chosen directly by the people.
</P>
<P>
The Executive
</P>
<P>
The President: Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The president is the second highest authority, who is
responsible for the implementation of the constitution and the
exercise of the executive powers, with the exception of those
matters directly related to the supreme leader.
</P>
<P>
The president shall be responsible for the nation, the supreme
leader and the Majlis within the limits of the constitution and
shall have an obligation to assent all legislation of the Majlis or
the result of a referendum.
</P>
<P>
Elected by the direct vote of the people for four-year term, the
president also heads the cabinet comprising 22 ministers, who shall
be appointed by the president and approved by the Majlis with a
vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
The Legislature
</P>
<P>
Majlis Speaker: Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Consultative Assembly, or Majlis, serving as the
lower house, is responsible for enacting laws on all matters. The
current number of representatives in the Majlis is 270, which will
rise to 290 after the 6th elections on Friday.
</P>
<P>
All legislation passed by the Majlis shall be endorsed by the
Guardians Council, the upper house which comprises six clerical
canonists appointed by the leader and six jurists elected by the
Majlis.
</P>
<P>
The Majlis has the authority to summon the president or
ministers for questions on certain matters if at least one-fourth
of the Majlis members support the idea. Majlis deputies may also
impeach a minister in cases deemed necessary by them.
</P>
<P>
Majlis deputies are elected directly by the people for a four-
year term while the office term of the speaker is one year, which
can be extended after votes within the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
The Judiciary
</P>
<P>
The Judiciary Chief: Ayatollah Mohmoud Hashemi.
</P>
<P>
The Judiciary is one of the power branches in Iran, which
protects individual and social rights. Its major functions are to
supervise the proper implementation of laws, uncover crimes,
prosecute and punish criminals, take suitable measures for
preventing the commission of crimes and reforming the offenders.
</P>
<P>
The highest authority of the power branch is the head of
judiciary, who is appointed directly by the leader for a five-year
term.
</P>
<P>
The justice minister is responsible for all matters concerning
the relations of the judiciary with the executive and the
legislature branches.
</P>
<P>
The State Expediency Council
</P>
<P>
Chairman: Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Besides the three branches of the government, the arbitrary
State Expediency Council was formed in 1988 under the orders of
late supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
The council is responsible for overcoming the differences of
views between the Majlis and the Guardians Council. It also serves
as an advisory body to the supreme leader in drafting general
policies of the country.

"Such irresponsible and dumb American behavior comes within a

The report quoted Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz as
saying on Wednesday evening that the resignation of top U.N.
humanitarian official in Iraq, Hans von Sponeck, and head of the
World Food Program (WFP), Jutta Burghard, has proved that Iraq did
not get benefit from the humanitarian program.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Top Reformist Runner Mohammad Reza Khatami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Mohammad Reza Khatami, a brother
of the moderate President Mohammad Khatami, has risen to prominence
as a leading reformist runner in the Friday parliamentary polling.
</P>
<P>
The reformist Islamic Iran Participation Front (IIPF) has sought
to make Khatami the top winner in the polls while the pro-reform
young generation even hope Khatami to be the speaker of next Majlis
(parliament) to work along with his elder brother for a better
future.
</P>
<P>
Slogans such as "Khatami, Khatami, we support you" and "Khatami,
Khatami, we love you" were heard whenever and wherever he appeared
in the week-long election campaign which ended Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The slogans indicated many people see him as a surrogate for the
president.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Reza Khatami was born in 1959 and was unknown before
his brother won an unexpected overwhelming victory over the
conservatives in 1997.
</P>
<P>
A soft-spoken doctor, he served as deputy health minister in his
brother's government, but resigned to seek a seat in the powerful
parliament, which has the power to veto reformist programs of
President Khatami's government.
</P>
<P>
Inspired by the strong support of the Iranian people,
particularly the young generation born after the 1979 Islamic
revolution, Khatami and some senior officials decided to form the
IIPF to help President Khatami in his reforms.
</P>
<P>
The IIPF, established in December 1998, soon became the
spearhead of Khatami's reformist movement, which the conservatives
see as a threat to the Islamic theocratic rule in the country.
</P>
<P>
Following his brother, Khatami underlined the reform initiated
by President Khatami is "indispensable and irreversible" and no one
can stop it.
</P>
<P>
He noted democracy along with reform at every level is the only
way to make the people's dreams come true.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president's youngest brother has won enough support
from the people and there is no doubt that many voters will cast
their votes for him.
</P>
<P>
However, observers doubted Khatami can be elected the Majlis
Speaker since he is facing a strong challenge from former President
Hashemi Rafsanjani, who enjoys support from both the centralists
and the conservatives.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Top Centralist Hopeful Hashemi Rafsanjani </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 17 (Xinhua) -- As a top centrist hopeful for
the Friday parliamentary polls, the former Iranian president
Hashemi Rafsanjani is widely believed to regain the post of Majlis
(parliament) speaker he once assumed for almost 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Being a top Iranian politician and like the supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Rafsanjani has always tried to be above
factional struggles and used his influence and skills to close
ranks among different factions.
</P>
<P>
Born in March 1934, Rafsanjani was a religious student of the
late leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini and became a prominent
Islamic activist before the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
After the revolution, he was appointed a member of the powerful
Revolutionary Council and became one of the founders of the Islamic
Republic Party, which ruled Iran in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Elected as a member of the first Majlis in 1980, he served as
Majlis speaker from 1980 to 1989 when he became president and
remained on the post until August 1997.
</P>
<P>
After Mohammad Khatami won the 1997 presidential elections,
Rafsanjani was named as chairman of the State Expediency Council,
which is responsible for settling differences between the Majlis
and the Guardians Council and offering suggestions to the leader on
the country's general policies.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts agree Rafsanjani is not satisfied with his current
post. But he said he decided to run for the parliamentary elections
to push forward economic developments which he started during his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
"If I were in the Majlis, I would be able to help reform," he
said, "I do not enjoy power, but I have not achieved my objectives
yet."
</P>
<P>
However, the reformers, the main supporters of President
Khatami's policies on political developments (reforms), showed
strong opposition to Rafsanjani's candidacy and regarded his re-
entry to the Majlis as a hurdle for Khatami's programs.
</P>
<P>
"With Hashemi (Rafsanjani), political development impossible,
with Hashemi, eternal freedom, impossible," pro-reform students
shouted in campaigning rallies.
</P>
<P>
But local and foreign analysts believed that Rafsanjani will win
the post of Majlis speaker, even if he will not be the top winner
in Friday's polls.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Congress to Help Pay for Congo Peace Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Thursday urged Congress to help pay for a U.N.-led peace
monitoring mission to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, saying
that Africa does matter to the United States.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the opening session of the five-day National
Summit on Africa in Washington, Clinton tried to persuade a
reluctant Congress to help pay for a 5,500-member U.N. cease-fire
monitoring mission in Congo.
</P>
<P>
"We have learned the hard way in the United States over decades
and decades that the costliest peace is far cheaper than the
cheapest war," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has asked Congress to pay about 42 million dollars of
the estimated 160 million dollars cost of the mission.
</P>
<P>
An Africa trade bill, though approved by the Senate in November
1999, was bogged down in a dispute between the House of
Representatives and the Senate over textile import and broader
budget issues.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said his main message to Congress was "Africa does
matter to the United States" and Washington should help a
continent where many people "live on the bare edge of survival."
</P>
<P>
Clinton was welcomed to the summit in a traditional African way:
three men in long striped robes with drums strapped across their
chests paraded through the auditorium, pounding the drums with
their hands.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Mir to Stay Afloat For Five More Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Mir space station will
be kept afloat for at least five more years thanks to a deal
signed Thursday, said Yuri Semyonov, president of a Russian space
technology company.
</P>
<P>
Semyonov's Energia space rocket corporation and Gold and Apple
Transfer, an international holding based in Virgin Islands,
founded a new international space corporation, MirCorp, on
Thursday, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Energia owns a 60 percent stake in the new venture, Tass quoted
Semyonov as saying in London.
</P>
<P>
"Energia has necessary possibilities for ensuring a minimal
time of the station's work, which we estimate at five years,"
Semyonov said.
</P>
<P>
"We have full responsibility for our words, and can ensure
efficient work of the station," he added.
</P>
<P>
The deal marks the first time that Mir opens for international
commercial use without financial participation of the Russian
government.
</P>
<P>
Shirija Katuria, one of the investors in the MirCorp, said
commercialization of space would open untold opportunities for
pharmaceutical and medical research, satellite repair, and in
prospect, for a start to colonization of outer space, Tass
reported.
</P>
<P>
Mir, which was designed for a service life of three and a half
years, has been in orbit for 14 years. The lack of government
funding had forced operators to prepare for its final ditching
into the Pacific in August.
</P>
<P>
Russia is also under pressure from its partners of the
International Space Station (ISS) to drop Mir and concentrate on
the ISS.

<HEADLINE> Papandreou: Greece Ready to Discuss Anything Except Sovereignty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou stressed Thursday that Athens was ready to talk with
neighboring Turkey about anything except its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"Greece is prepared to discuss anything that does not affect
its sovereign rights," Papandreou said at an annual foreign policy
conference in Athens.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Greece had repeatedly expressed its desire for
improvement of relations with Turkey and the gradual establishment
of a climate of calm.
</P>
<P>
Future moves for the improvement of relations between Greece
and Turkey, he said, would be implementation of the recently
signed bilateral cooperation pacts, expansion of confidence-
building measures, regional cooperation and support for Turkey's
European Union (EU) prospects.
</P>
<P>
He added that the expansion of confidence-building measures
should be based on the 1988 agreements signed between the then
foreign ministers, Karolos Papoulias of Greece and Mesut Yilmaz of
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at odds for
decades over their territorial dispute in the eastern Aegean Sea
and the Cyprus problem, but the two neighbors have since last June
begun to improve their strained relations.
</P>
<P>
In January and February, the foreign ministers of Greece and
Turkey, Papandreou and Ismail Cem, exchanged visits and signed a
total of nine agreements for bilateral cooperation in a variety of
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Both countries have insisted that the momentum of improvement
in bilateral relations should continue. However, Greece has
refused to start negotiations with Turkey over its sovereign
rights in the Aegean Sea because Athens says it has no dispute
with Ankara in the region but the delimitation of the Aegean
continental shelf.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Criticizes Israeli Attacks on Lebanese Civilian Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Thursday criticized Israel for its attacks on Lebanese civilian
targets.
</P>
<P>
Israeli sources said earlier in the day that Israel's security
cabinet gave Prime Minister Ehud Barak wider powers to order
retaliatory raids on Lebanon, including attacks on civilian
targets.
</P>
<P>
In response to the reports, U.S. State Department spokesman
James Rubin told a briefing that civilian casualties must be
prevented.
</P>
<P>
"This means that there should be no attacks from populated
areas in order to ensure that there are no attacks against
populated areas," Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe that Israeli attacks against civilian
infrastructure and populated areas will solve the problem. Such
action only add to the suffering of the people of Lebanon," he
added.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Rubin also blamed Lebanon's Hezbollah
guerrilla group for recent violence in south Lebanon, saying: "the
latest escalation in southern Lebanon is cynical and a deliberate
effort by the Hezbollah to wreck the prospects for peace in the
region."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said both Israel and Lebanon should adhere to a 1996
agreement which bans attacks from or on civilian areas while
allowing attacks on combatants.
</P>
<P>
The State Department spokesman said a five-nation international
monitoring group set up to reduce tension in south Lebanon remains
an "important tool" even if it is difficult to convene a meeting
for the moment because of violence.
</P>
<P>
last Friday, the United States tried to set up a meeting of the
international monitoring group, but Israel walked out.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the U.S. and French joint chairmen of the monitoring
group will try to contact the other governments represented in the
group: Israel, Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
"In lieu we are working on ways to have the co-chairmen be in
contact with the capitals to begin to allow this process (of
holding a meeting) to take place," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez and Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) Chairman Reinaldo
Ciavaldini presented Thursday an oil investments and transactions
plan to be developed by the country up to the year 2009.
</P>
<P>
The plan has as its goal to double the state oil company PDVSA'
s size, to consolidate its presence in the United States, and to
increase the sale of Venezuelan oil products and its byproducts in
South and Central America, said Ciavaldini.
</P>
<P>
The present 3.5 million barrels a day (bpd) production will not
be increased, but next year it will be gradually raised up to 5.8
million bpd in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
He said that the production costs could be reduced by 20
percent. It does not mean a cut in the budget for wells
maintenance, but to reach higher levels of efficiency and
productivity,
</P>
<P>
Eleven billion dollars will be invested in the next 10 years in
the gas program and 300 billion dollars to develop orimulsion, for
which negotiations have been started with Asian countries as
possible markets for this product.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela produces a lot of orimulsion, which is a kind of
emulsified crude oil (a mixture of bitumen, water and emulsifiers).

<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program
(WFP), the UN international food aid organization will
distribute food to over 1.1 million internally displaced people
and others considered vulnerable in Angola this month.
</P>
<P>
The WFP said in a report issued here that a total of more than
1.13 million people around the country would receive the food
deliveries.
</P>
<P>
The largest consignment was allocated to more than a quarter
of a million people camped in and around the city of Malanje, some
350km east of the capital, Luanda.
</P>
<P>
The next major group of beneficiaries are over 197,000 people
in the country's second city, Huambo, in the central highlands,
and over 193,000 in Bie, also in the central highlands.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tank Truck Explosion Kills Three in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Three men died Thursday in
the Gulf of Mexico port city of Coatzacoalcos, in the eastern
Mexican state of Veracruz, when a tank truck exploded.
</P>
<P>
The explosion, which occurred at midday Thursday in that city,
made a noise that was heard several kilometers away. Although the
incident happened 150 meters from the entrance gate to the
Coatzacoalcos Customs office, the terminal was not damaged.
</P>
<P>
The vehicle that exploded was parked in a soldering shop, which
was empty but contained gasified ethyl alcohol residuals enough to
cause the accident, said the Civil Protection Municipal Unit of
the zone, Francisco Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
Ramirez said that only two of the three bodies had mutilations
and third degree burns.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pentagon Vows to Continue Anthrax Vaccinations of Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It's very important that we use the existing and available,
safe and effective vaccine to give our troops that go in harm's
way the protection that they deserve," said Marine Corps Major
General Randy West, who is a special adviser on biological warfare,
at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Sue Bailey, the assistant secretary of defense for health
affairs, said the Defense Department intends to continue toward
its goal of immunizing all 2.4 million members of the active and
reserve military against anthrax, which is a naturally occurring
bacteria that, when inhaled, can cause death within a few days.
</P>
<P>
In a report released Thursday, the National Security
Subcommittee of the House Government Reform said the anthrax
vaccine program is based on "a paucity of science" and should be
suspended.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine has come under increasing scrutiny from lawmakers
as soldiers have expressed concerns about taking the six-shot
regimen. Complaints included fevers, muscle pain and dizziness.
Reserve and National Guard pilots testified that morale was
plummeting and colleagues would resign rather than take the
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered all active
duty and reserve troops to get the shots, starting with soldiers
most likely to encounter biological warfare overseas. More than
380,000 service members have been immunized so far.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 to 300 have refused to take it because of concerns
about its safety and efficacy, Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 reports of adverse reactions have been filed, but
Defense Department officials said only 72 were serious enough to
require hospitalization or a day off from work. While Food and
Drug Administration officials have linked the vaccine to few of
the reactions with a high level of confidence, the agency has not
been able to rule it out entirely.

<HEADLINE> Gates Unveils Next Generation of PC Computing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft unveiled its
most ambitious software product Thursday in an attempt to make
ground in the high-end computing world.
</P>
<P>
The company's chairman and chief software architect Bill Gates
announced the worldwide availability of Windows 2000, the software
giant's much-hyped new operating system for businesses.
</P>
<P>
Debuting the new products in San Francisco, Gates promised that
the version of Windows 2000 for servers will finally give his
company a place in the coveted market for high-end, powerful
computers. He acknowledged the current market dominance of Unix
and mainframe systems, but predicted that Microsoft will make
further inroads.
</P>
<P>
Aimed at Intel-based business systems, Windows 2000 initially
will be available in three versions: professional for laptops and
desktops; server for low-end servers; and advanced server for more
powerful machines with as many as eight processors.
</P>
<P>
Windows 2000 adds numerous capabilities, including tools to
make it easier for administrators to manage computers from afar
and improvements in how several servers can divvy up a heavy
workload. It also includes features, such as universal serial bus
(USB) support, that are likely to appeal to those running the
software on desktop and laptop systems.
</P>
<P>
In all cases, Microsoft said that Windows 2000 will help
business function in Internet time. The platform has integrated
Web communications, security and application services and can help
e-business solutions to market faster.

<HEADLINE> Tech Stocks Hit New High, Blue Chips Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 17 (Xinhua) -- Technology stocks on Wall
Street hit the new record high Thursday despite a warning of
higher interest rates from Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan,
but the blue chip stocks fell on fears of higher rates.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index closed up 121.27 at
4,548.92, surpassing the record closing high of 4,485.63 set on
February 10.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 46.84 at 10,514.57,
extending its loss of 156.68 points Wednesday. Broader stock
indicators were mostly higher with the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
rising 0.59 at 1,388.26.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan's comments on inflation and his warning of higher
rates did not scathe investors away from technology stocks. The
Federal Reserve chairman told the House Banking Committee that
inflation remains a threat to the U.S. economy while many
Americans are enjoying the longest economic expansion in history.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan's warning indicated more than one hike in interest
rates this year, analysts said. The Federal Reserve has raised
rates four times sine last June in efforts to keep inflation under
control but those increases, Greenspan said, have had little
impact.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index fell on worries about the warning of higher rates.
Financial stocks dragged lower and American Express slumped as
well.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 3.71 at 601.26. But the American Stock
Exchange index rose 35.21 at 937.46 and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 10.66 at 558.42.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,561 down, 1,447 up and 504
unchanged.

NYSE volume declined to 1.03 billion shares from 1.04 billion
in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Housing Heads for Soft Landing, Says Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economic
expansion will continue this year but with slightly more moderate
growth in the face of higher interest rates and the threat of
inflation, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) said
Thursday in a report.
</P>
<P>
However, NAR said, enough momentum exists in the U.S. housing
market to avoid a drastic decline. With mortgage interest rates
forecast to average 8.2 percent this year, NAR expects existing-
home sales to slide 5.8 percent to 4.9 million units in 2000,
still the third best year on record.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted its chief economist James F. Smith as saying
that the U.S. housing market will experience a "soft landing" this
year in terms of home sales. "The picture-perfect economic
conditions, which produced a fourth consecutive annual home-sale
record in 1999, will not prevail this year," Smith said. "
Specifically, inflation fears are heating up, stock market gains
are likely to moderate and consumers may become more concerned
about spending and debt."
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the integration of the world economy and its role
in U.S. interest rates and housing markets, Smith said that many
international investors like the safety of U.S. Treasury bills,
notes and bonds. Since fixed mortgage rates are usually priced off
of the yield on 10-year treasuries, the more of those that
investors demand, the lower mortgage rates will be in the United
States. He expects real economic growth in Europe this year to
closely match U.S. growth. Japan is expected to have little, if
any growth, while the rest of Asia should lead the world in
economic performance. Latin America, a large market for U.S.
exports, should also do quite well.
</P>
<P>
The association's economic forecast projects U.S. economic
growth, as measured by GDP, to slow slightly to average 3.8
percent in 2000. Consumer price inflation should average 2.1
percent this year and rise to 2.8 percent in 2001. The
unemployment rate is expected to average 4.3 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
NAR projects total housing in the United States to drop 7.8
percent in 2000 to 1.54 million units. New-home sales are expected
to drop 3.4 percent to 875,000 units. The median existing-home
price is expected to rise 2.6 percent to 136,500 U.S. dollars,
while new-home prices are expected to rise 6.6 percent to a median
of 168,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
NAR is America's largest trade association, representing more
than 750,000 members involved in all aspects of the residential
and commercial real estate industries.
