Holyfield wins 12-round decision.

 &UR; URGENT &QL;

 &UR; AP Boxing Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Evander Holyfield gave his hometown fans what
they wanted, but not in the fashion they would have chosen, and had
to go the distance Saturday night to outpoint challenger Vaughn
Bean in a heavyweight title bout.
	   Holyfield did score a knockdown in the 10th round, but there
were several occasions during the match before 41,357 fans in the
Georgia Dome that he looked like an old fighter.
	   Perhaps in winning the unanimous decision the WBA and IBF
champion, who will be 36 on Oct. 19, used up too much energy
promoting his homecoming.
	   The turnabout was definitely an Atlanta tribute to a hometown
hero. Even promoter Don King noted that it was a salute to
Holyfield, but also to ``my promotional talents.''
	   Bean, ridiculed for fighting weak opposition, gave it all he had
but fell far short. Judge Duane Ford of Nevada scored it 116-111,
while Al DeVito and Leroy Brown, both of New Jersey, each had it
117-111 for Holyfield.
	   The Associated Press scored it 116-111 for Holyfield.

Turland win's women's marathon for Australia, Lesotho gain's first
</HEADLINE>
gold in men's race
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Turland quotes; will be led by 1300 GMT with
Sunday's track finals

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Heather Turland, a 38-year-old
mother of five who only started running in her early 30s, led an
Australian 1-2 in the women's marathon at the Commonwealth Games
Sunday.
	   After finishing in 2 hours, 41 minutes, 24 seconds, she was
hugged by one of her sons at the finish line before the whole
family joined in the celebrations.
	   Lisa Dick came home second, 24 seconds behind but ahead of
Namibia's Elizabeth Monghudi, a one-time leader. Monghudi finished
in 2:43:28.
	   ``It's a dream come true. I never ever thought I'd win something
like this,'' Hurland said.
	   ``It's really special being my last Commonwealth Games, but now
it looks like I'll have to go on to Sydney 2000.''
	   Turland will be age 40 at the Sydney Olympics.
	   Thabiso Moqhabi pulled away from the field four miles (6.4
kilometers) from home in the men's race to win Lesotho's first
Commonwealth Games gold. He finished in 2 hours, 19 minutes, 15
seconds.
	   Tanzania's Simon Bisiligitwa and Andea Suja made it an African
sweep of the men's medals on the streets of Kuala Lumpur by placing
second and third in 2:19:42 and 2:19:50 in a slow race in the early
morning sunshine.
	   Turland led the women's race of only 12 starters for a long
spell before she was joined by Mongudhi, who edged past her after
10 miles (16 kilometers).
	   The Namibian tried to pull away but the Australian moved back on
her shoulder and regained the lead. Although Mongudhi tried to get
back, Turland had too much strength and pulled confidently away and
the fading Namibian was caught by Dick in the last two miles.
	   After 26 runners started out in the men's race, England's David
Taylor made the early move until he was caught by a pack of six
runners.
	   Moqhabi kicked ahead in the last quarter of the race and the
runner from Lesotho made a decisive break after 20 miles (32 kms).
	   The rest of the field were unable to respond and Moqhabi wasn't
challenged in the final stages of the race.
	   Taylor finished fourth in 2:20:30.

	   ___ &QC; 
	   Round 5: Holyfield landed a left to the head, then missed badly

to the body as Holyfield missed. Bean got in a right high to the

ropes. Bean got in a left to the face as Holyfield missed, and Bean
landed a left to the head at the minute mark. Bean was warned again
for a low blow, although the punch in question did not look low.

first few rounds. Bean landed a left to the head, and Holyfield
answered with a left to the head. Then they clinched and backed
away. Bean got in a right to the body, and seemed to be beating
Holyfield to the punch. Holyfield landed a light right to the head,

landed in the first 45 seconds of the round. Bean then got in a
right to the head, then bulled Holyfield to the ropes before they

Officials in Philippines puzzle over cause of ferry disaster

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Local fishermen Sunday rescued 11
people who survived more than a day in chilly storm-whipped waters
after a Philippine passenger ferry sank with 430 people on board, a
provincial official said.
	   The death toll rose to 37 as more bodies were recovered near the
mouth of Manila Bay, where the Princess of the Orient went down
Friday night. At least 305 people have been rescued in an ongoing
search of the area, officials said.
	   Rough weather continued to hamper rescue operations. A navy ship
was forced to turn back Sunday before reaching the accident area
because of powerful waves.
	   Maritime officials puzzled, meanwhile, over why the large
Princess of the Orient began tilting in a tropical storm and then
quickly sank.
	   The ship, with a capacity of 3,900 passengers, had been rocked
by strong waves and winds but should have been able to withstand
much worse weather, officials said.
	   Survivors said the ship sank in less than an hour _ highly
unusual for a vessel with no apparent damage.
	   Ramon Revilla Jr., governor of Cavite province, said fishermen
discovered the 11 survivors Sunday at various places along the
Cavite coast, which faces the area where the Princess of the Orient
sank near the mouth of Manila Bay.
	   Many of the dead bodies were found floating in life jackets and
covered with grease and oil from the ship.
	   For a second day, a large group of anguished relatives waited at
a pier in Manila for the return of rescue ships.
	   They began crying as a navy patrol craft pulled up with 13
bodies, including two children, bloated from decomposition and
covered with flies.
	   ``I hope my sister isn't one of them,'' said Praxedes Coronas,
54, as she stared at the pile of bodies. ``We've been sleepless
since yesterday, not being able to confirm whether she's dead or
alive.''
	   Carlos Go, chief executive officer of Sulpicio Lines, the owner
of the 24-year-old ship, insisted it was in seaworthy condition
despite an on board fire in 1997.
	   Sulpicio Lines also owned the Dona Paz, a ferry which collided
with a tanker in 1987, killing 4,341 in the world's worst peacetime
shipping disaster. A year later, 250 people died in the sinking of
another ship owned by the company, the Dona Marilyn.
	   A surviving crew member, Vincente Go, said the ship began
listing to the left and would not stabilize even after the crew
began pumping ballast water to the right side. Normally, large
ships pushed one direction by heavy winds or waves naturally bob
back.
	   Another crew member said the ship's cargo may have suddenly
shifted to one side in the heavy seas.
	   But maritime officials said some other, still undetermined,
factor must have been involved.
	   Tropical storm Vicki was beating the northern Philippines with
75 kilometer (45 mile) per hour winds when the ship left Manila at
about 8 p.m. (1200 GMT) Friday for Cebu, about a day's journey to
the south.
	   A storm warning prohibited ships of less than 500 tons from
sailing but did not apply to the 13,734-ton ferry.
	   A few hours later the ship reported it was listing 25 degrees
near Fortune island off Batangas province, about 60 kilometers (40
miles) south of Manila and then lost radio contact.
	   The company said 338 passengers and 92 crew were aboard the
ship. No foreigners were reported on board.

 &UR; Holyfield wins 12-round decision &QL; 
 &UR; By ED SCHUYLER Jr. &QC; 
 &UR; AP Boxing Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Evander Holyfield gave his hometown fans what
they wanted. Vaughn Bean gave a lot of people what they didn't
expect.
	   Holyfield, looking at times like an old fighter, knocked Bean
down in the 10th round and won a unanimous decision over the
scrappy challenger before 41,357 in the Georgia Dome on Saturday
night.
	   While Bean was fighting only his eighth opponent with a winning
record, Holyfield showed the guile that comes from long years of
experience in top-flight competition.
	   Bean was pushing Holyfield into the ropes late in the 10th round
when the champion suddenly sidestepped Bean and flung him into the
ropes with his left arm. Bean was hung up in the ropes when
Holyfield landed a right to the side of the head that dropped him
for a seven-count.
	   ``He hit me when I was down,'' Bean said, although he was still
on his feet when the punch landed. ``The ref didn't do his job. I
know I was on his home turf. He hit me right on the temple. The ref
could have stepped in.''
	   ``I've got to take advantage of every opportunity I get, because
he's a good fighter,'' said Holyfield, who will be 36 on Oct. 19.
``I just turned and hit him. That's part of the boxing game.''
	   The disappointed Bean, who was ranked No. 1 by the IBF and was
Holyfield's mandatory challenger, said: ``I thought I won the fight
_ same song.''
	   Last March 29, Bean lost an IBF title bid against then-champion
Michael Moorer on a 12-round majority decision. This time the
decision wasn't close.
	   Judge Duane Ford of Nevada scored it 116-111, while Al DeVito
and Leroy Brown, both of New Jersey, each had it 117-111 for
Holyfield.
	   The Associated Press scored it 116-111 for Holyfield.
	   Though an easy winner, Holyfield found the awkward Bean much
tougher than most observers thought he would be.
	   ``I did not come in overconfident,'' Holyfield said. ``I hit him
with good shots. He also hit me with good shots. You have to give
the man credit. The man came to fight. He's much better than people
gave him credit for. He's a competitor. This was his day to
shine.''
	   Shining, but not winning.
	   While Bean fought well, the loss was a costly one. It's not
known when or if he might get another title shot.
	   Bean did not come out fighting in the early rounds, but in
rounds 5, 6 and 7 his awkward style bothered Holyfield as the
challenger landed short, chopping rights to the head and several
shots to the body.
	   Bean, however, lacked Holyfield's power, and that hurt his
chances.
	   The 25-year-old Bean, who looked flabby at 231 pounds (104
kilos), actually came back to have the best of the final round and
Holyfield appeared a weary champion at the bell.
	   ``He loves his job,'' Bean had said, referring to Holyfield.
	   This fight, however, looked to be a lot more like work than fun
for the 217-pound (98-kilo) pound champion.
	   Holyfield showed none of the fire he had in two fights against
Mike Tyson, but he was cagey and tough enough to handle Bean and
clever enough to score the big knockdown in the 10th.
	   Holyfield's next fight is expected to be a mandatory WBA defense
against Henry Akinwande of Britain. King said he would like to put
that fight in Las Vegas. Holyfield was supposed to fight Akinwande
in June, but that fight was postponed when Akinwande tested
positive for hepatitis-B.
	   The turnout for Holyfield's third title defense in his hometown
was the biggest since 70,000 watched Muhammad Ali regained the
undisputed heavyweight title from Leon Spinks in the New Orleans
Superdome in September 1978.
	   Holyfield earned at least dlrs 5 million for his 36th victory
against three defeats. He has 25 knockouts.
	   Bean, of Chicago, lost for only the second time against 32
victories. He has 25 knockouts.
	   His purse was dlrs 1.8 million for his second IBF title bid.

 &UR; Angels beat Mariners 5-3

<TEXT>
	   ANAHEIM, California (AP) _ With Jack McDowell dominating Seattle
once again, the Anaheim Angels rallied from a three-run deficit to
beat the Mariners 5-3 Saturday night and move within a game of the
AL West lead.
	   Anaheim, which had fallen two games behind first-place Texas
during a four-game losing streak, broke a 3-all tie in the sixth on
Matt Walbeck's RBI single off Paul Spoljaric (4-5) and took a
two-run lead on Troy Glaus' single.
	   McDowell (5-3) improved to 11-1 against the Mariners, allowing
three runs and eight hits in 6 1-3 innings. Anaheim's bullpen got
eight straight outs, with Troy Percival pitching the ninth for his
41st save.
	   Seattle's Alex Rodriguez hit his 40th homer and became the third
player ever to hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases in the same
season, joining Jose Canseco (42 homers-40 steals for Oakland in
1988) and Barry Bonds (42-40 for San Francisco in 1996).
 &UR; Athletics 8, Rangers 4
	   In Arlington, Texas, Oakland stopped the Rangers' four-game
winning streak, overcoming Juan Gonzalez's 300th career homer.
	   Ben Grieve went 3-for-4 and Matt Stairs drove in two runs as the
Athletics took a 6-0 lead against the AL West leader and stopped
their five-game losing streak.
	   Aaron Sele (18-11) lasted just 3 1-3 innings, allowing four runs
and eight hits. Jimmy Haynes (11-8) took a shutout into the sixth
before allowing Gonzalez's 44th homer of the season.
 &UR; Royals 7, Indians 6
	   In Cleveland, Manny Ramirez hit his 44th and 45th homers, but
the Cleveland bullpen failed to hold a 6-0 lead.
	   Ramirez's homers gave him a major league-record eight in five
games, tying the mark reached twice by Washington's Frank Howard in
1968.
	   The Royals scratched out the winning run in the ninth off Paul
Shuey (5-3) to snap Cleveland's six-game winning streak.
	   Scott Service (6-3) pitched one scoreless inning and Jeff
Montgomery worked the ninth for his 35th save.
 &UR; White Sox 5, Red Sox 2 &QR; 
	   In Chicago, Mike Cameron hit a three-run homer as Chicago won
despite getting only five hits. The loss kept Boston's magic number
for clinching the AL wild card at five. The Red Sox are 4 1/2 games
ahead of Anaheim and five games ahead of Toronto.
	   Pedro Martinez (18-7) lost his third straight start, allowing
seven hits and two earned runs with three walks and nine strikeouts
in seven innings.
	   John Snyder (7-2) won his third straight decision, allowing six
hits over six innings with one walk and three strikeouts.
	   Darren Lewis homered for Boston.
 &UR; Orioles 5, Yankees 3
	   In Baltimore, rookie Sidney Ponson ruined David Cone's second
try at his 20th victory.
	   Ponson (8-8) allowed six hits in 7 1-3 scoreless innings,
walking two and striking out five. In his previous start against
New York, the right-hander allowed two hits over 6 2-3 shutout
innings on June 16 for his first major league victory.
	   Cone (19-7), looking to match his career high in victories,
allowed 12 hits and five runs in eight innings.
	   Alan Mills got three outs for his second save.
 &UR; Tigers 8, Twins 7, 10 innings
	   In Detroit, Damion Easley hit a game-winning homer for the
second time in three days, a two-run shot in the 10th inning that
sent Minnesota to its 10th straight loss.
	   Easley followed Tony Clark's leadoff single with his 26th homer
off Rick Aguilera (3-9). Easley went 3-for-5 with two doubles, two
RBIs and three runs scored.
	   Minnesota's Paul Molitor was 3-for-5 with a homer and three
RBIs, extending his hitting streak to 16 games.
	   A.J. Sager (4-1) got the win.
 &UR; Devil Rays 7, Blue Jays 5
	   In St.Petersburg, Florida, Bubba Trammell hit a pinch three-run
homer during a four-run eighth.
	   Ben Van Ryn (0-1) and allowed Fred McGriff's RBI single before
Trammell, hitting for Paul Sorrento, homered off Carlos Almanzar.
	   Albie Lopez (7-3) worked a scoreless eighth for the victory, and
Roberto Hernandez got the final three outs for his 26th save.
	   McGriff also homered for the Devils Rays. Toronto's Jose Canseco
hit his 44th homer, matching his career high.

	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ Mark McGwire was 0-for-4 in the St. Louis
Cardinals' 7-4 win over the Milwaukee Brewers on Saturday night,
striking out four times and getting hit by a pitch.
	   McGwire, who struck out four times in a game for the first time
this season, has 64 homers, one ahead of Chicago's Sammy Sosa.
McGwire has left the plate without making contact 311 times this
season: an NL-record 156 walks, 149 strikeouts and six times when
he was hit by a pitch.
	   McGwire was plunked in the ribs by Steve Woodard (10-12) in the
first, right after Brian Jordan hit his 24th homer.
	   Fernando Tatis hit his seventh homer and pinch-hitter John Mabry

beat Chicago.
	   The loss dropped the Cubs into a tie for the NL wild-card lead
with the New York Mets, 4-3 winners over Florida.
	   Jon Nunnally homered twice and drove in four runs for the Reds,
and Jason Bere (2-2) allowed only two hits over eight innings. Mark

out Mike Redmond on a 3-2 pitch with the bases loaded as New York

six-run fourth. He tied his career high set last season with his
29th homer.
	   Brian Johnson and Doug Mirabelli also homered for the Giants.

	   Mike Maddux (3-4) was the loser.
	   Derrick May homered for Montreal, and Bobby Abreu connected for
Philadelphia.

streak against the Astros.
	   Guillen, who also drove in five runs in an Aug. 16, 1998, game
against Florida, doubled off Jose Lima (15-8) in fourth inning, and
hit his 14th home run in the fifth. He has 20 RBIs in 15 games and
83 for the season.
	   Turner Ward also homered for the Pirates. Francisco Cordova
(13-13) allowed eight hits and three walks in eight innings.
 &UR; Braves 5, Diamondbacks 0
	   In Phoenix, Tom Glavine became the first 20-game winner in the
major leagues this season and Atlanta became the first team to win
100 games in consecutive seasons since Philadelphia in 1976 and
'77.
	   Glavine (20-6) pitched a six-hitter with five strikeouts and one
walk to reach 20 wins for the fourth time in his 11-season career.
It was his 18th career shutout.
	   Brian Anderson (12-13) allowed all five runs and 11 hits in 7
1-3 innings. Arizona was shut out for the 15th time, the most in

gold in men's race
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS spelling of men's winner and that Turland has four
children not five; ADDS this is Lesotho's first medal at any major
championship; will be led by 1300 GMT with Sunday's track finals

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Heather Turland, a 38-year-old
mother of four who only started running in her early 30s, led an
Australian 1-2 in the women's marathon at the Commonwealth Games
Sunday.
	   After finishing in 2 hours, 41 minutes, 24 seconds, she was
hugged by one of her sons at the finish line before the whole
family joined in the celebrations.
	   Lisa Dick came home second, 24 seconds behind but ahead of
Namibia's Elizabeth Monghudi, a one-time leader. Monghudi finished
in 2:43:28.
	   ``It's a dream come true. I never ever thought I'd win something
like this,'' Hurland said.
	   ``It's really special being my last Commonwealth Games, but now
it looks like I'll have to go on to Sydney 2000.''
	   Turland will be age 40 at the Sydney Olympics.
	   Thabiso Moqhali pulled away from the field four miles (6.4
kilometers) from home in the men's race to win Lesotho's first
medal at any major championship. He finearly
morning sunshine.
	   Turland led the women's race of only 12 starters for a long
spell before she was joined by Mongudhi, who edged past her after
10 miles (16 kilometers).
	   The Namibian tried to pull away but the Australian moved back on
her shoulder and regained the lead. Although Mongudhi tried to get
back, Turland had too much strength and pulled confidently away and
the fading Namibian was caught by Dick in the last two miles.
	   After 26 runners started out in the men's race, England's David
Taylor made the early move until he was caught by a pack of six
runners.
	   Moqhali kicked ahead in the last quarter of the race and the
runner from Lesotho made a decisive break after 20 miles (32 kms).
	   The rest of the field were unable to respond and Moqhali wasn't
challenged in the final stages of the race.
	   Taylor finished fourth in 2:20:30.

Shooters hope for more events in next Commonwealth Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Commonwealth Shooting
Federation is hoping to include all Olympic shooting events in the
2002 Manchester Commonwealth Games.
	   Federation president Graeme Hudson said it would recommend an
increase in events to the Commonwealth Games Federation.
	   ``We hope other Olympic events like double trap, women's skeet
and traps can be included in the Manchester 2002,'' Hudson said.
	   In Kuala Lumpur, there were 30 shooting events _ 15 for pairs
and 15 for individuals. They included air pistol, sport pistol,
sport rifle prone, free pistol, rapid fire pistol, free rifle
prone, free rifle 3 positions, skeet, trap and full-bore rifle.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SOCOG STUDY: Sydney Olympics organizers have had a large
presence in Kuala Lumpur as their preparations continue for their
own games starting in September 2000.
	   SOCOG president and New South Wales government minister Michael
Knight said one challenge Sydney organizers had noted was how to
get more fans into events.
	   Knight said the crowds in Kuala Lumpur were huge outside the
stadiums, but were only large inside when the local teams or
athletes were performing well.
	   ``There's been huge crowds out in the common domain, in the
public areas outside the stadium, sharing the spirit, being part of
the event,'' Knight told reporters outside the main Bukit Jalil
stadium. ``While that's great and we want to encourage that in
Sydney, we'd like to try and work harder to actually get them into
the stadium, get them to buy a ticket and be part of the action as
well as sharing the spirit outside.''
	   Knight said the Sydney organizers would have to rely on a good
performance by the Australian team in 2000 to bring in the crowds.
	   ``If the athletes are performing well from the host country,
then people want to come whatever the price,'' Knight said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   DISABLED EVENTS RETURN: Members of the Manchester 2002
Commonwealth Games organizing committee are also in town as they
prepare for their turn. The Manchester organizers will bring back
some events for disabled competitors and will also trim the regular
sport program from 16 to 14.
	   Tenpin bowling is not on the proposed list despite a strong
debut here, meaning Australia's Cara Honeychurch will likely slip
back to the anonymity she had before becoming the star of the
kegling in KL.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MASCOT BATTLE: Almost as strange as seeing the men's 100-meter
runners pose and preen was the sight of Commonwealth Games mascots
holding their own race at the main stadium.
	   While Ato Boldon won the main sprint event in 9.88 seconds, a
local hero won the battle of the mascots in a considerably slower
time. Wira the orangutan edged Kit the Cat from Manchester, with
Scotland's Super Squirrel and Canoose the Canadian goose tied for
third.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   IT'S A WRAP: Following the epic seven-hour opening ceremony, the
games will close Monday with a relatively snappy performance. Queen
Elizabeth II, Malaysian King Tuanku Ja'afar and Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad will be the guests of honor.
	   The ceremony starts with a cultural presentation at 8 p.m. (1200
GMT) and the whole show will be over an hour and a half later. For
those wanting a little more for their closing ceremony ringgit,
there will be a post-closing concert.

Official in China accuses U.S. of ulterior motive in beetle ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The United States intends to use a requirement
that Chinese exporters treat packages for a destructive type of
beetle as a weapon for reducing its trade imbalance with Beijing, a
Chinese trade official was quoted as saying Sunday.
	   Starting in late December, the United States will require that
crates and pallets carrying Chinese goods to the United States be
fumigated or treated with heat or preservatives to kill the Asian
long-horned beetle. The beetles from China have eaten through
thousands of trees in the New York and Chicago areas.
	   The ban on Chinese exports in untreated wooden crates is
excessive, Business Weekly quoted Zhou Shijian of the China Chamber
of Commerce of Metals, Minerals and Chemicals Importers and
Exporters as saying.
	   ``The under-estimation by the United States of the potential
loss to China's exports also betrays its true intention to narrow
its trade deficit with China,'' he said. ``This is not a proper way
to solve the problem.''
	   Zhou warned the costs of treating the packaging would be passed
on to U.S. consumers.
	   China estimates goods worth dlrs 30 billion to dlrs 40 billion,
or 50 percent to 60 percent of China's annual exports to the United
States will be affected.
	   The U.S. trade deficit with China is estimated at dlrs 63
billion this year.

Ansett Airlines looks to firm up relations with Singapore Airlines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Australian airline Ansett Australia
needs to establish its new commercial relationship with Singapore
Airlines before deciding on an equity tie-up, chief executive Rod
Eddington said Sunday.
	   The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has given
formal approval for a trilateral relationship between Ansett, Air
New Zealand and Singapore Airlines.
	   ``Our major focus with Singapore and Air New Zealand is to get
the commercial relationship to work,'' Eddington told Channel
Nine's Business Sunday television program.
	   ``Once we can demonstrate that can work ... that's the time to
talk about equity.''
	   Eddington said in the medium to long-term, he personally thought
it would be a good idea for Singapore Airlines to become an equity
partner, but ultimately that decision was for Ansett shareholders.

Song composed for German unity day shows country still divided
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A nation's anthem is usually played and loved by
all parties in an election campaign. But as Germany's race enters
its final week, the ``Deutschlandlied'' is no longer just
background music.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's camp accuses left-wing politicians
organizing next month's German Unity Day celebrations of
desecrating the anthem by hiring a composer to add a few bars from
the one played in communist East Germany. Some are threatening to
boycott the official festivities.
	   Leftists say the conservatives stomped on the sensitivities of
18 million former East Germans in their effort to score political
points.
	   With only a week until the Sept. 27 parliamentary election, no
one is sure how the anthem fight will play among those voters, now
a potentially vital swing region in a tight national race.
	   But the reaction underscores how Germans from the two halves are
still struggling to follow the same tune, eight years after
unification.
	   The composition _ part of a longer medley _ was commissioned by
the Lower Saxony state government to be played at the official Oct.
3 Unity Day ceremony, to be held in the state capital of Hanover
this year.
	   The state's governor happens to be Gerhard Schroeder, the Social
Democrat challenging Kohl in the federal election.
	   When word about the ``musical collage'' got out this summer,
Kohl's party wasted no time blasting Schroeder and the Social
Democrats for ``tactlessness.''
	   Germany's national anthem, to music written by Joseph Haydn in
1797, was kept by the western half after World War II, although the
controversial first verse from 1841 starting with ``Deutschland,
Deutschland ueber alles'' (Germany above all), is no longer sung.
	   The general secretary of Kohl's conservative Christian
Democrats, Peter Hintze, says the anthem is ``the melody of
freedom,'' and shouldn't be ``disfigured'' by mixing in a few bars
of the anthem used in the former communist east.
	   Another Kohl ally, Bavaria Gov. Edmund Stoiber, said he would
boycott the national ceremony if the song is played, contending
that the communist-era passage would mock the memory of all who
suffered under East Germany's totalitarian government.
	   But many in the east, far from being offended, are at a loss to
understand the fuss.
	   ``A mix of both German anthems is also a symbol of the growing
together from east and west,'' says Uschi Kretschmer, a 40-year-old
businessman from the eastern city of Magdeburg.
	   The coach of the Magdeburg water polo team, Hannes Koch, says
the East German anthem reminds him of ``the great performances of
our athletes at world championships and Olympic games.''
	   Another easterner, Social Democratic deputy chairman Wolfgang
Thierse, told German radio that history ``will always include
conflicting, bitter memories'' that can't just be ignored.
	   Bardo Henning, the 40-year-old pianist and jazz composer from
Berlin who fused the anthems, says he was caught off guard by the
passionate reaction to the piece, meant to showcase east-west
integration.
	   The criticism suggests that the process has a ways to go, he
said. ``But maybe the debate spurred by this composition can
contribute to that too.''
	   Officials in Lower Saxony insist the composition will be
presented as planned. Germany's official national anthem will then
be played at the end of the ceremony _ unaltered and in its
entirety.

Activists urge government to take action against unemployment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A group of labor activists chanted and carried
banners to the offices of the territory's government on Sunday to
demand new measures to combat rising unemployment.
	   About 12 activists from the Anti-Poverty, Anti-Unemployment
Alliance marched from the financial district to the central
government offices to present a letter calling for unemployment
benefits and a minimum wage.
	   ``We oppose the government's saving the market, but not saving
the people!'' they shouted, a reference to billions of dollars the
government spent last month to prop up the stock market.
	   Hong Kong has no jobless benefits or minimum wage. With
unemployment hitting a 15-year high of 5 percent last week, the
government has mainly responded by initiating programs to retrain
laid-off workers.
	   The protesters also condemned Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd.,
the largest private employer in the territory, for telling
employees last week to accept a 10 percent pay cut or risk being
fired. They burnt a collage of Hongkong Telecom logos in front of
the government offices.
	   Leung Kwok Hung, leader of the April Fifth Action Group, a small
but active Hong Kong organization that frequently demonstrates for
democracy and human rights in China and Hong Kong, said that
government should do more to solve the unemployment problem.
	   He said he hopes Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa will address new
measures in his policy address early next month.

Thailand asks for freedom of movement for Cambodian opposition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Thailand has called on the Cambodian
government to lift a travel ban on its opposition lawmakers so that
efforts to end the country's political crisis won't be derailed.
	   Thailand's Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra
expressed concern to National Assembly president Chea Sim that
earlier guarantees of freedom of movement have not been followed
through, according to a copy of the letter from the Thai official
made public Sunday.
	   Cambodian leader Hun Sen ordered a travel ban on 53
newly-elected parliamentarians and more than a dozen military and
police officials loyal to the opposition after a grenade attack on
his Phnom Penh residence on Sept. 7. No one was injured in the
blast.
	   Hun Sen, who had accused opposition politicians of provoking
violence through massive street rallies calling for his ouster,
said the ban was necessary to prevent potential suspects in the
grenade attack from fleeing the country.
	   Legal experts said the real intent appeared to be to keep
parliamentarians-elect in Cambodia until the new National Assembly
was convened.
	   The opposition had earlier threatened to boycott the new
parliament in protest against alleged fraud by Hun Sen's party in
winning the July 26 parliamentary elections.
	   Thailand has played a key role in trying to end the political
crisis, which erupted into violence earlier this month when police
cracked down on pro-opposition street demonstrators.
	   Sukhumbhand last week informally brokered an agreement paving
the way for talks between the rival party heads on Sept. 22.
	   In his letter, Sukhumbhand told Chea Sim, secretary-general of
Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party that opposition leaders Prince
Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have carried through on promises
to end all demonstrations and to attend an all-party summit meeting
under the king's auspices on Tuesday.
	   They have also said they would attend the convening of the
National Assembly ``on the basis of the assurances by the Royal
Cambodian Government of the safety, freedom of movement and freedom
from arrest and detention of all parties,'' noted the letter, dated
Sept. 18.
	   The Thai government was ``deeply concerned that any delay,
uncertainty or failure in honoring these mutual commitments by
either side could derail the process'' of convening the National
Assembly, forming a new government and having its representative at
the United Nations officially recognized, it said.
	   It could also delay Cambodia's admission to the regional
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and, ``at this juncture when
the people of Cambodia are suffering greatly,'' full resumption of
foreign aid that was suspended after Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh in a
violent coup d'etat last year.
	   The travel ban on top opposition leader Ranariddh was lifted
Friday to allow him to travel to Bangkok, Thailand, for the
weekend, but the ban remains on other opposition figures.
	   A somber Sam Rainsy laid a wreath in front of the National
Assembly to commemorate the 16 people who died in a March 30, 1997,
grenade attack on a peaceful rally he was leading against judiciary
corruption. Sunday was a Buddhist religious holiday.
	   The small park in front of the parliament, dubbed ``Democracy
Square'' was also the site of a 16-day around-the-clock protest
against election fraud, broken up by baton-wielding riot police
after the Sept. 7 grenade attack on Hun Sen's home.
	   Thousands were drawn to the park during the sit-in, especially
when Sam Rainsy spoke, but only a few motorbike drivers slowed down
to catch a glimpse of the democracy fighter as he lit incense in
memory of the dead Sunday.

Mahathir says he's not directing Anwar's prosecution
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
denied Sunday he was directing an investigation into alleged sexual
misconduct by a former deputy turned political opponent.
	   With the sordid political drama entering its third week,
Mahathir, 73, dismissed allegations that police had tortured two
allies of Anwar Ibrahim and coerced them into saying that Anwar had
sodomized them.
	   ``Nobody is going to come out and confess something that is very
damaging to themselves,'' said Mahathir.
	   ``He can verify the torture (allegations). Anybody can go and
find out. Ask these people whether they had been tortured or not,''
he told reporters.
	   Anwar, 51, fired as deputy prime minister and finance minister
on Sept. 2, accused police of torturing his adopted brother and a
friend.
	   Sunday's newspapers carried banner-headlined stories containing
explicit details of the alleged offenses, spiced with words that
Malaysians would never use in conversation.
	   Sukma Dermawan, 37, a businessman who is Anwar's adopted
brother, was arrested without explanation on Sept. 6. News reports
said he told police Anwar had sodomized him in April in his room at
the deputy prime minister's official residence.
	   Another friend and sometime speech writer, Munawar Anees, 51,
reportedly said he had been sodomized by Anwar at his private
residence in 1993. Anees was arrested Sept. 14 under the Internal
Security Act, which allows indefinite imprisonment without trial.
	   On Saturday they were sentenced to six months in prison on the
basis of the statements. Anwar has denied the charges.
	   Sodomy is a crime in this conservative Muslim nation and could
lead to the arrest of Anwar, who has posed the most serious
political challenge to Mahathir of his 17-year rule.
	   But Mahathir said he was not the one who would order Anwar's
arrest. ``The due process of law will have to take place. I am
quite sure that the people who are into managing these things know
their job,'' said Mahathir, who is also Malaysia's home minister in
charge of police.
	   Since he was fired, Anwar has made speeches in Kuala Lumpur and
traveled to Malaysian villages in the last week, drumming up
support against Mahathir and flinging accusations against his
former boss.
	   On Saturday, Anwar called Mahathir ``Malaysia's chief Tarzan''
and his political buddies ``apes and elephants,'' according to the
Bernama news agency.
	   Mahathir said he was not intimidated by the words or the
swelling crowds at Anwar's meetings. A new rally was planned for
Sunday in Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``I am not concerned at all,'' Mahathir said. ``But he has been
holding rallies which have been illegal.''
	   In recent days, Anwar has begun directly calling for Mahathir to
resign, something even opposition parties in Malaysia have not
dared to do. He has alleged that Mahathir has siphoned off
governing party funds. Mahathir denied the charge.
	   Mahathir said he was pained by the turn of Malaysian politics.
``I wish he hadn't done this and succeeded me.''
	   Anwar, once Mahathir's heir-apparent, has said he is being
targeted because he has become a serious challenge to Mahathir's
grip on power.
	   Police have said Anwar may be arrested any day on allegations
that include treason. He has not been formally charged.

Floods bury entire town in Mexico's southern Chiapas state
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEJANDRO RUIZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VALDIVIA, Mexico (AP) _ This small town on the Pacific Coast of
Chiapas is no more. It was buried under tons of mud, rocks and
fallen trees brought on by torrential floods that devastated much
of the state.
	   About the only thing standing is a big statue of the Virgin of
Guadalupe in the main square and the locomotive and cars of a
freight convoy in the train station _ both partly buried in caked
mud.
	   Several hundred survivors in the community of 7,000 people say
as many as 200 bodies may be buried under the avalanche that rolled
off mountainside down the Novillero River and into the low lands.
	   Many are injured and many are missing _ probably swept out to
sea. No one knows. Information is hard to come by. Valdibia was
still cut off Saturday and there was little outside aid. Food and
drinking water were scarce.
	   A few government helicopters came in once in a while with food
and medicine. But it was far from enough.
	   A couple of reporters to reach here traveled from Tapachula,
about 100 miles (160 kilometers) miles southwest near the
Guatemalan border _ first by helicopter, then fording the swollen
the river on horses they rented for dlrs 1, and then by bicycles
they hired.
	   ``It was between around four o'clock in the morning (of Sept. 8)
when the waters started hitting really hard,'' Alejandra Dominguez,
50, recalled. She was dressed in a white shirt and blue pants, and
sat dejectedly on the platform of the train station, staring at
Locomotive No. 5848.
	   She is the wife of the station watchman. She says he was struck
by a boulder near the station and taken to a nearby hospital. She
hasn't heard from him yet.
	   ``Many people were swept away and died here. I saved myself
climbing on top of the engine,'' Mrs. Dominguez said, tears rolling
down her cheeks.
	   By government count, 181 bodies have been recovered and hundreds
of people _ maybe as many as 550 _ are missing. An estimated
450,000 have been left homeless in the state, devastated by the
rains for the past two weeks.
	   The federal Department of Health warned the death toll may rise
as more bodies are recovered.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo arrived in Tapachula on Saturday for
his fifth visit in 10 days to coordinate relief efforts. But
getting help is extremely difficult.
	   Like Valdibia, at least 35 rural communities have been badly
damaged and remain virtually inaccessible.
	   ``I saw how the floods carried away around 50 people. Others
were surprised by death and buried by mud,'' said Juan Manuel del
Valle, a farmhand.
	   Judith Escobar, a widow and mother of six children, had a
similar story to tell. ``There are many dead, maybe several
hundred. We saw how they were swept away by the waters. We got
saved by God's will,'' she said.
	   Near downtown, rows of houses and other buildings are covered
with mud _ some with their roofs smashed. A few dogs and pigs root
in the debris looking for something to eat.
	   Scavenger birds circle overhead, attracted by the putrefaction
and the small of decaying bodies. A few men with tools dig in the
mud, trying to clear a few homes or looking for some loose timbers
to build a shack.
	   One was Guadalupe Vasquez, a farmer from the edge of town. He
and his family were saved. ``But I lost everything. The farm was
wiped out.''

Swedes expected to hesitantly keep socialists in power

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ After a campaign notable for its high
level of doubt, Swedes on Sunday began voting in national elections
that were expected to keep the Social Democrats in power but with a
weakened position.
	   The campaigns for the 349 seats in the Riksdag parliament
centered on the question of whether continuing Sweden's high-tax
ways would restore its comprehensive welfare state or stunt its
economic recovery.
	   Carl Magnus Heckscher, a 50-year-old manager casting his ballot
in suburban Stockholm, said he was voting for the main conservative
party, the Moderates, because he believes the current government is
stifling initiative and private enterprise.
	   ``But I'm afraid the Social Democrats are winning again,'' he
said.
	   Polls supported him, indicating on Saturday that the Social
Democrats would get the biggest share of the seven parties expected
to win seats _ about 38 percent.
	   That's far short of a majority and a significant drop from the
45 percent the party got four years ago.
	   But most of the Social Democrats' lost votes apparently were
siphoned off by the Left Party, who have shown poll support of 10
to 12 percent. With a predicted 5 percent for the Greens, the
Social Democrats would have enough support to continue governing
the country they have run for most of the past seven decades.
	   Prime Minister Goeran Persson says he doesn't want a coalition
government with those parties, but Left or Green alliances with any
of the other four parties likely to win seats is seen as anywhere
from improbable to impossible.
	   The polls also showed about 12 percent of the 6.6 million voters
undecided in the final days of the campaign, about double the
number in previous elections.
	   In previous years, poll respondents used to ``say `I am,' but
now they say `I vote for','' Toivo Sjoeren of the SIFO polling
organization said in characterizing the decline in decisiveness.
	   It's a notable phenomenon because Swedish political style
encourages close involvement. American-style orchestrated
spectacles are rare; the characteristic event is a politician _
from city office aspirants on up to Cabinet ministers _ giving
short talks to attentive audiences in a marketplace or square, then
answering questions from the crowd.
	   But many voters have apparently been shaken by the trials of the
1990s, when funding for Sweden's cradle-to-grave welfare state was
slashed to try to dig the country out from under a crushing debt.
	   The economic pragmatism of the Social Democrats over the past
four years disappointed many who had seen the party as caring,
while others remember that difficult times under the 1991-1994
non-socialist government led by the Moderates party.
	   While distress over declining social services attracted many to
the Left Party's promise of a full restoration of the welfare
state, some have gravitated right.
	   Dagny Claesson, 86, said she was voting for the Christian
Democrats, the most conservative of the major parties, because
they've promised increased support for hospitals.
	   Sweden has wrestled its way back to some extent. The government
predicts a small budget surplus this year, inflation is negligible
and unemployment is falling, although still troubling at more than
7 percent.
	   Finance Minister Erik Aasbrink said last week that ``we need a
few more years to restore the welfare state,'' but admitted that
the easy days of previous decades will never come back.
	   Moderates leader Carl Bildt says even those reduced expectations
are too high. With the world's highest tax burden, Sweden will lose
jobs in an increasingly competitive global economy and become a
stepchild of a unifying Europe, he contends.
	   But even tax-cutting conservatives aren't proposing that Sweden
take a sudden plunge. Bildt promises a tax cut of 80 billion kronor
(dlrs 10 billion) over three years _ a substantial amount for a
country of only 8.8 million people, but only enough to reduce
Sweden's tax burden to 50 percent of gross domestic product, still
one of the world's highest levels.

Queen Elizabeth II visits Malaysia during political storm
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with queen's arrival

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The state visit of Queen Elizabeth
II, which began Sunday, has been threatened by a political
bombshell that could explode during her visit.
	   After a highly successful three-day visit to the tiny kingdom of
Brunei, the queen and her husband, Prince Philip, arrived in the
capital of this former British colony Sunday to begin their first
state visit since 1989.
	   The Southeast Asian nation is embroiled in an ugly political
clash that could sully the queen's visit.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's sacked deputy, Anwar Ibrahim,
has accused his former mentor of ordering witnesses tortured in a
court case against him. Mahathir denied that Sunday during a visit
to the Commonwealth Games.
	   The queen is to preside over Monday's closing of the games, the
first to be held in an Asia country.
	   Anwar, who was fired as deputy prime minister and finance
minister on Sept. 2, said Saturday that his adopted brother and a
friend were tortured into confessing that he had sodomized them.
	   Anwar had scheduled a rally in the capital's huge Freedom Square
at the same time the queen was scheduled to visit nearby St. Mary's
Cathedral on Sunday.
	   Most of Anwar's rallies have been attended by thousands of
cheering supporters, but people near the square Sunday said police
were telling them to stay away. Orange police tape around the
square was left over from the marathon race, observers said, but it
seemed to act as a deterrent because the square was empty.
	   Police have said they are investigating Anwar on allegations of
unlawful sex acts, leaking state secrets and abusing his powers.
	   Anwar, 51, married with six children, has vehemently denied the
allegations. He said Mahathir instigated the accusations because he
feared his deputy's challenge to his 17-year leadership.
	   The queen and Prince Philip also planned to visit athletes who
are competing in the 16th Commonwealth Games.
	   The royal couple will also attend a state banquet in their honor
and pay visits to the tallest skyscraper in the world, an
exhibition highlighting British industry and a recording studio to
meet with Malaysian pop music stars.
	   Prince Philip, an avid environmentalist, will visit the World
Wide Fund for Nature's Education Center in a national park outside
the capital.

Accident investigator says Philippine ferry was carrying heavy

cargo

cargo may have shifted, causing it to sink &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A Philippine passenger ferry that
sank with 430 people on board was carrying heavy cargo that may
have shifted in heavy waves, causing the ship to tilt and then
sink, the chief investigator said Sunday.
	   Eleven more people were rescued Sunday after spending more than
a day in chilly storm-whipped waters, bringing the number of
survivors to at least 305, officials said. At least 37 people were
dead.
	   Rough weather continued to hamper rescue operations. A navy ship
was forced to turn back Sunday before reaching the accident area
because of powerful waves.
	   Maritime officials puzzled over why the large Princess of the
Orient began tilting in a tropical storm Friday night and then
quickly sank.
	   The ship, with a capacity of 3,900 passengers, had been hit by
strong waves and winds but should have been able to withstand much
worse weather, officials said.
	   Survivors said the ship sank in less than an hour _ highly
unusual for a vessel with no apparent damage.
	   Chief accident investigator Arnie Santiago said the ship was
carrying 15 vehicles and 66 containers of truck parts and other
heavy materials which may not have been properly secured.
	   ``The way the ship tilted indicates that the cargo moved,'' he
told The Associated Press.
	   He said some of the ship's water seals also may have been
damaged by an on board fire in 1997. After the fire the 24-year-old
ship was repaired at a Singapore dry dock.
	   A surviving crew member, Vincente Go, said the ship began
listing to the left and did not stabilize even after the crew began
pumping ballast water to the right side. Normally, large ships
pushed one direction by heavy winds or waves naturally bob back.
	   The ship's owner, Sulpicio Lines, also owned the Dona Paz, a
ferry which collided with a tanker in 1987, killing 4,341 in the
world's worst peacetime shipping disaster. A year later, 250 people
died in the sinking of another ship owned by the company, the Dona
Marilyn.
	   Ramon Revilla Jr., governor of Cavite province, said fishermen
discovered 11 survivors Sunday morning at various places along the
Cavite coast, which faces the area where the Princess of the Orient
sank near the mouth of Manila Bay.
	   For a second day, a large group of anguished relatives waited at
a pier in Manila for the return of rescue ships.
	   They began crying as a navy patrol craft pulled up with 13
bodies, including two children, bloated from decomposition and
covered with flies.
	   ``I hope my sister isn't one of them,'' said Praxedes Coronas,
54, as she stared at the pile of bodies. ``We've been sleepless
since yesterday, not being able to confirm whether she's dead or
alive.''
	   Tropical storm Vicki was beating the northern Philippines with
75 kilometer (45 mile) per hour winds when the Princess of the
Orient left Manila at about 8 p.m. (1200 GMT) Friday for Cebu,
about a day's journey to the south.
	   A storm warning prohibited ships of less than 500 tons from
sailing but did not apply to the 13,734-ton ferry.
	   A few hours later the ship reported it was listing 25 degrees
near Fortune island off Batangas province, about 60 kilometers (40
miles) south of Manila, and then lost radio contact.
	   The company said 338 passengers and 92 crew were aboard the
ship. No foreigners were reported on board.

Moqhali dances for joy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Marathon man Thabiso Moqhali won a
first medal of any color in any games for the small African country
of Lesotho on Sunday and was keen to stay on his feet.
	   ``I am going to celebrate by dancing. I like dancing,'' said
Moqhali. But a few hours later he was sound asleep at the village,
probably still dreaming of the gold he has chased since running his
first Commonwealth Games marathon in 1986.
	   It was left to Lesotho's chef de mission, Kenneth Hlasa, to
explain what the victory means to the south African country of 2
million people, currently undergoing political dispute.
	   ``It is so important I can't ever explain it properly,'' Hlasa
told The Associated Press. ``It's the first medal by anyone from
Lesotho in any event. He's certainly a hero and maybe he'll become
an idol for people to look up at.''
	   Hlasa said Moqhali was confident ahead of Sunday's race. At his
last start, he was third in the Belgrade marathon in April.
	   ``He was expecting to do well,'' Hlasa said. ``He predicted he
would win the gold medal.''
	   At home, no one expected a gold, however.
	   ``Everyone knows about the Kenyan runners and the Australian
runners,'' Hlasa said. ``Football is our main sport but even in
that our team is nothing to write home about.''
	   Hlasa is hoping Moqhali helps raise the profile of track and
field at home. The government funds the Commonwealth Games team,
but more could always be done.
	   ``Maybe he will help us,'' Hlasa said. ``At least now we have a
gold medal so we deserve more assistance.''
	   Moqhali, who ran his first marathon as an 11-year-old, pulled
away from the field four miles (6.4 kilometers) from home and
finished in 2 hours, 19 minutes, 15 seconds.
	   Tanzania's Simon Bisiligitwa and Andea Suja made it an African
sweep of the men's medals in the early morning race, but for once
the glory went to a country that has come not to expect it.

Fusion 3, United 1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Diego Serna had two goals and an assist
Saturday night and the Miami Fusion clinched an MLS playoff berth
with a 3-1 victory over D.C. United.
	   Miami's victory, coupled with New England's 3-0 victory over
Tampa Bay on Saturday, gave the expansion Fusion the fourth and
final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference as both New England
and Tampa Bay were eliminated.
	   Eastern Conference champion United (23-8) will face the Fusion
(15-16) in a best-of-3 opening-round playoff series which starts
Sept. 30 at RFK Stadium.
	   Serna assisted on Paulinho McLaren's goal in the 18th minute,
broke a 1-1 tie with a goal in the 53rd minute and put the match
away with a goal in the 80th minute.
	   United, playing a man down after midfielder Ben Olsen was
ejected in the 35th minute, lost at home for just the second time
in 15 games this season.
	   Jaime Morneo scored United's only goal in the 50th minute.
 &UR; Revolution 3, Mutiny 0
	   In Foxboro, Massachusetts, the New England Revolution won its
third straight MLS match, beating the Tampa Bay Mutiny 3-0 on
Saturday night.
	   The result meant little as both squads were mathematically
eliminated from the playoffs when Miami defeated D.C. United on
Saturday night.
	   The win marked New England's fourth victory this season against
the Mutiny (10-20).
	   New England (11-19) opened the scoring in the 20th minute when
Imad Baba converted a rebound, his fifth goal of the season.
	   Tampa Bay played without U.S. internationals Frankie Hejduk
(right hamstring strain) and Roy Wegerle (right Achilles' strain).
	   The Revolution took a two-goal lead in the 59th minute on an
8-yard strike by Joe-Max Moore.
	   Six minutes later, a cross by the Revolution's Paul Keegan was
punched away by Tampa Bay goalkeeper Doug Petras, only to have the
ball go into the net off the head of Mutiny defender Chad McCarty.
	    &UR; Burn 1, Wizards 0
	   In Kansas, Jason Kreis scored the only goal as the Dallas Burn
clinched the fourth and final playoff spot from the MLS's West
Division with a victory over the Kansas City Wizards on Saturday
night.
	   The Burn (15-16) eliminated the Wizards (12-19) as Kansas City,
also shut out 1-0 in Chicago by the Fire on Thursday, needed at
least a win or a draw to stay in playoff contention.
	   Kreis scored in the 25th minute on an assist from Mickey
Trotman, beating Wizards goalkeeper Mike Ammann.
	   The Wizards, who had just two shots on goal in Chicago, had 12
against Burn goalkeeper Mark Dodd.
 &UR; Rapids 2, Crew 1
	   In Denver, Substitute Wolde Harris dribbled through two
defenders to score the winning goal in the 68th minute Saturday
night as the Colorado Rapids beat the Columbus Crew 2-1.
	   The victory clinched third place in the MLS Western Conference
for the Rapids, who will meet the Fire in the opener of the
best-of-3 semifinal Oct. 1 at Chicago.
	   Paul Bravo of the Rapids opened scoring with a penalty kick in
the 40th minute.
	   The Crew's Stern John tied it in the 44th minute, pouncing on a
rebound off Rapids goalkeeper Marcus Hahnemann.
	   The goals for Harris and Bravo brought their individual point
totals to 30 for the season, breaking Chris Henderson's team record
of 28 set in 1997.

Aussie mum wins women's marathon, Lesotho gains first medal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A 38-year-old mother of four who
only started running in her early 30s, Heather Turland surprised
herself by winning the Commonwealth Games marathon Saturday.
	   She now looks forward to running for Australia at the Sydney
Olympics in 2000 when she will be 40.
	   On the day Lesotho gained its first ever medal in a major
championship when Thabiso Moqhali raced to gold in the men's
marathon, Turland gave some hope to the 30-somethings with a
convincing win in the women's race in the early morning sun in
Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``It's a dream come true. I never ever thought I'd win something
like this,'' said Hurland, who notched up gold medal No. 70 for her
country at these Games.
	   ``It's really special being my last Commonwealth Games, but now
it looks like I'll have to go on to Sydney 2000.''
	   Lisa Dick came home second, 24 seconds behind for an Australian
1-2 with Namibia's Elizabeth Monghudi taking the bronze.
	   In the men's race on the same course, Moqhali pulled away in the
final four miles (6.4 kilometers) to win the title from two
Tanzanians, Simon Bisiligitwa and Andea Suja for an African sweep
of the medals.
	   Six more sets of athletics medals were being decided in
Malaysia's National Stadium later Saturday while England and
Australian shooters collected golds on the range at Langkawi
Island.
	   Michael Gault collected his third of the Games by winning the
men's air pistol and Timothy Lowndes of Australia finally made it
to gold here after a bronze in the pairs free rifle prone and a
silver in the pairs 3-Position.

Plane crash ends in ``orgy of violence,'' newspaper says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Survivors of an aircraft which crashed
in Myanmar last month were tortured and brutally raped by ethnic
minority villagers in a region where hatred of the central,
military-run government runs high, a Bangkok Post report said
Sunday.
	   A Myanmar government statement, received in Bangkok, described
the article as based on ``pure speculation,'' contradictory and
confused.
	   The domestic airliner, a Fokker Friendship F-27, crashed in
rugged terrain Aug. 24, with the government reporting four days
later that all 36 persons aboard were killed. All were Myanmar
nationals.
	   Officials issued contradictory information for several days
after the crash, including a report that some had survived. Since
then, little information about the accident has emerged from the
country's secretive government.
	   The Bangkok Post report said villagers of the Shan minority
converged on the crash site to engage in ``one of the most
atrocious orgies of violence in recent memories.''
	   At least one woman, an air hostess, was gang-raped and male
survivors were tortured, the paper reported. ``The villagers
chopped off ears and fingers to get gold jewelry, The hated men of
the Burmese army were kicked and punched, living and dead alike,''
the story said.
	   The English-language daily said as of last week, authorities in
Myanmar, also known as Burma, had arrested 30 Shan villagers and
were continuing to unravel the fate of the aircraft and its
passengers.
	   The official release, which attacked the account, provided no
new information. It said the story was ``heavily spiced with racial
hatred, violence, political motivation and anti-military sentiments
to create a Hollywood-style sensationalism.''
	   The Myanmar military has been engaged in anti-insurgency
operations in Shan State, where opposition to the central
government has deep roots.
	   Recent refugees interviewed by the Associated Press say troops
have herded thousands of villagers into relocation centers and
claim violence against the local population, including rape,
killing and forced labor, is common.
	   The Post said the aircraft was on a routine flight from Yangon,
the capital, to the city of Tachilek, 560 kilometers (348 miles) to
the northeast. It said there were 39 passengers, half of them
Myanmar military officers and their families.
	   An approaching storm forced the landing to be aborted, and when
the pilot attempted to regain altitude the plane's tail apparently
struck a nearby hill and plunged into a forest.
	   It took three days, the Post said, for searchers to locate the
downed craft but local villagers probably found the site shortly
after the accident.
	   They discovered at least five persons still alive, including the
air hostess, a female university student and at least one infant.
But there is a possibility that all had survived but were unable to
move.
	   The injured hostess was savagely raped for four days before she
finally died, while a similar fate may have befallen the university
student, the newspaper account said, adding that at least 14 men
have confessed to raping the stewardess.
	   The aircraft was reportedly looted with a number of rifles and

Prime minister says Malaysia ready to bid for 2008 Olympics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Following its successful staging
of the Commonwealth Games, Malaysia will bid to become host of the
2008 Olympics, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Sunday.
	   ``I doubt whether we can succeed, but we will make a bid
anyway,'' the national news agency Bernama quoted Mahathir as
telling reporters after visiting the Commonwealth Games main press
center.
	   He noted the greater difficulties in playing host to the
Olympics, which had 11,000 athletes at Atlanta in 1996, compared to
those of the Commonwealth Games, which had about 5,000 here and
slightly more than half the number of sports.
	   For one thing, Mahathir said, Malaysia needed to have a fairly
good number of athletes to compete against world-class sportsmen.
	   ``We can't just be the host with no (competitive) participation.
So that is a little bit more difficult to produce than just to
build stadiums,'' he added.
	   International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch
made a similar point when he visited the Commonwealth Games here
earlier.
	   Sydney will stage the 2000 Summer Olympics and Athens is the
2004 Summer Games host.

Economy, tax reform the centerpieces of Howard's reelection hopes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia would survive the global
financial turmoil and emerge the economic ``strongman of Asia'' if
the government were reelected in Oct. 3 national elections and
allowed to implement its tax plan, Prime Minister John Howard said
Sunday.
	   Officially launching his conservative Liberal Party's election
campaign, Howard firmly pinned his reelection hopes on economic
issues by devoting most of his speech to his controversial tax
plan.
	   With Howard's ruling coalition trailing the opposition Labor
Party in most opinion polls less than two weeks before election
day, the launch was seen as a key opportunity to inject some fire
into the campaign.
	   Overshadowed in the news by Australian sporting achievements in
the Commonwealth Games and U.S. Open tennis, campaigning by the
major parties has so far been lackluster.
	   Standing center-stage at a theater in Parramatta, in Sydney's
western suburbs, Howard outlined his vision for a future Australia
to a crowd of party faithful including senior government ministers
and his wife and children.
	   ``There is no reason that by the year 2030 the Wall Street of
the Asia-Pacific should not run slap bang through the central
business district of a major Australian city,'' said Howard,
standing beneath a party banner which read ``A stronger
Australia.''
	   In the 2 1/2 years of his government, ``Australia has become the
strongman of Asia because ... we have followed policies which have
protected the Australian people from the worst impacts of the Asian
downturn,'' he said.
	   Further reform was necessary, particularly of the tax system,
``if we are to survive the challenges of international economic
circumstances.''
	   Howard's main policy is a plan to reform the tax system,
including introduction of a broad-based consumption tax.
	   ``I have never, in 24 years of public life, been more certain
than I am today that I'm doing the right thing for Australia in
pursuing the cause of taxation reform,'' Howard said, to cheers and
applause.
	   Voters rejected such a tax in a 1993 election.
	   Howard also announced new spending for education and health, and
for an expansion of Australia's work-for-unemployment benefit
scheme.
	   Mounted police watched as about 150 demonstrators jeered as
Howard and senior ministers arrived for the function. The
demonstrators were protesting the new tax, uranium mining and the
placement of a planned airport.
	   There were no arrests or violence.

Sudan says civilians killed in shelling from Eritrea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan on Sunday said that artillery fire
from Eritrea had killed a number of civilians, including a baby
girl.
	   An army spokesman, Gen. Abdul-Rahman Sirul-Khatim said the
shelling last week targeted five villages near the town of Kassala,
which is 400 kilometers (240 miles) east of the capital Khartoum.
	   He said the Wad Sharifaie refugee camp east of Kassala also had
been hit.
	   Sirul-Khatim blamed ``long-range artillery shelling'' for the
deaths, but did not give details on the number killed or where they
died.
	   Sudan has long accused Eritrea of aiding opposition groups
intent on overthrowing the government of Lt. Gen. Omar el-Bashir,
who took power in a military coup in 1989 and installed an Islamic
regime.
	   Northern political opponents of el-Bashir have joined forces
with the Sudanese People's Liberation Army, which has been fighting
since 1983 for more autonomy for the south's Christians and
animists from the Islamic North.
	   The National Democratic Alliance, an umbrella group for the
opposition, is headquartered in the Eritrean capital Asmara.

U.N, Thailand ask for freedom of movement for Cambodian opposition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The United Nations on Sunday said it
was ``seriously concerned'' about the Cambodian government's ban on
international travel by opposition lawmakers, calling the move
unconstitutional.
	   The statement by the U.N. Special Representative of the
Secretary General for Human Rights in Cambodia, Thomas Hammarberg,
followed a warning by Thailand that efforts to end the country's
political crisis could be derailed if the ban is not lifted.
	   Cambodian leader Hun Sen ordered a travel ban on 53
newly-elected parliamentarians and more than a dozen military and
police officials loyal to the opposition after a grenade attack on
his Phnom Penh residence on Sept. 7. No one was injured in the
blast.
	   Hun Sen, who had accused opposition politicians of provoking
violence through massive street rallies calling for his ouster,
said the ban was necessary to prevent potential suspects in the
grenade attack from fleeing the country.
	   Legal experts said the real intent appeared to be to keep
parliamentarians-elect in Cambodia until the new National Assembly
was convened.
	   The opposition had earlier threatened to boycott the new
parliament in protest against alleged fraud by Hun Sen's party in
winning the July 26 parliamentary elections.
	   ``Government officials have made it clear this decision has been
taken at the highest levels and will not immediately be reversed,''
the U.N. representative said, adding that freedom of movement is a
fundamental liberty recognized under international and Cambodian
law.
	   Thailand's Deputy Foreign Minister, Sukhumbhand Paribatra, also
expressed concern that pledges of freedom of movement have not been
followed through, according to a copy of a letter from the Thai
official to National Assembly president Chea Sim.
	   Thailand has played a key role in trying to end the political
crisis, which erupted into violence when police cracked down on
pro-opposition street demonstrators. Sukhumbhand last week
informally brokered an agreement paving the way for talks between
the rival party heads on Sept. 22.
	   In his letter, Sukhumbhand told Chea Sim, secretary-general of
Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party, that opposition leaders Prince
Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have carried through on promises
to end all demonstrations.
	   The opposition leaders said they would attend the convening of
the National Assembly ``on the basis of the assurances by the Royal
Cambodian Government of the safety, freedom of movement and freedom
from arrest and detention of all parties,'' noted the letter, dated
Sept. 18.
	   The travel ban on top opposition leader Ranariddh was lifted
Friday to allow him to travel to Bangkok, Thailand for the weekend,
but the ban remains on other opposition figures, including
prominent dissident Sam Rainsy.
	   Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh in a violent coup d'etat last year.
	   A somber Sam Rainsy laid a wreath in front of the National
Assembly on Sunday, a Buddhist religious holiday, to commemorate 16
people who died in a grenade attack on a peaceful rally he led
there in March 1997.
	   The small park in front of the parliament was also the site of a
16-day around-the-clock protest against election fraud, broken up
by baton-wielding riot police after the Sept. 7 grenade incident at
Hun Sen's home.
	   Thousands were drawn to the park dubbed ``Democracy Square''
during the sit-in, especially when Sam Rainsy spoke, but only a few
motorbike drivers slowed down to catch a glimpse of the politician
as he lit incense in memory of the dead Sunday.

Canterbury wins in extra time to advance to grand final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Canterbury overcame a 16-point deficit
with 11 minutes to play then outscored Parramatta in extra time to
beat the Eels 32-20 Sunday and advance to Australia's National
Rugby League grand final.
	   The Bulldogs fought back from 18-2 down to level at 18-18, then
scored two more converted tries and two field goals for a 30-point
blitz in 31 minutes.
	   It was their second victory in as many weeks in extra time after
beating Newcastle 28-16 last Saturday, and their fourth finals win
in a row after finishing ninth on the 20-team table.
	   They will play the Brisbane Broncos in Sunday's grand final
after the Broncos humbled Sydney City 46-18 Saturday in the other
semifinal.
	   Parramatta players thought they'd reached their first grand
final since 1986 when winger Shane Whereat crossed for his second
try to make it 18-2, but the Bulldogs quickly began their comeback.
	   Tries to five-eighth Craig Polla-Mounter, fullback Rod Silva and
center Willie Talau, along with two goals to winger Daryl Halligan,
had the game level.
	   Polla-Mounter thought he'd won the match after the siren in
normal time when a 50-meter field goal attempt fell inches under
the crossbar.
	   It took the video referee three minutes to rule but he was not
needed when Polla-Mounter made no mistake from 20 meters out 45
seconds into extra time. The pivot then barged over from dummy half
to make it 23-18.
	   Halligan, who missed a simple shot at 18-6 down with 10 minutes
left, converted to extend the lead to seven points.
	   A second field goal to Polla-Mounter made it 26-18 before
Parramatta fullback Clinton Schifcofske potted a penalty goal for
26-20 with two minutes left.
	   Attempting anything for a try, Parramatta coughed up the ball
and lock Travis Norton crashed over to seal the match.
	   The Eels led 12-2 at halftime but became the fourth team to lose
during the finals after a week off. (djp)

36 Orangutans reintroduced to jungle habitat in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thirty-six orangutans, rescued from
devastating forest fires last year, were given a second chance at
freedom when wildlife officers released them back into the wild.
	   Workers at a primate refuge center said Sunday they reintroduced
the apes into unburned jungle habitat in East Kalimantan province.
	   The orangutans, 17 males and 19 females, were taken by
helicopter Saturday from the Wanariset Samboja refuge to the
Meratus forest, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) to the northwest,
said veterinarian Amir Ma'arif.
	   He said that after being airlifted, the orangutans, aged between
four and six years, were put in a special cage, the roof of which
was opened on Sunday.
	   The apes are expected to venture out and gradually adapt to
their new surroundings.
	   Some food will be supplied over coming days, but this would be
decreased in stages to encourage them to find their own in the
forest, where another 100 orangutans already live.
	   ``Usually they need one or two weeks before leaving the cage,''
he said. ``We will continue monitoring their condition.''
	   The apes were brought to the refugee over several months last
year after fires forced them to flee their old habitats.
	   Some were treated for wounds and sickness. Others were underfed.
Those judged recovered were released.
	   Ma'arif said 151 orangutans remain at the center, near East
Kalimantan town of Balikpapan, about 1,250 kilometers (760 miles)
northeast of Jakarta. Another ape release is expected to be
attempted within six months.
	   About 500,000 hectares (1.2 million acres) of forest were burned
by last year's fires that also produced a choking smoke haze over
much of Southeast Asia.
	   At least another 120 orangutans were killed, some by poachers,
during the fires.
	   Often poachers kill mother orangutans and sell their infants on
the illegal exotic pet market.
	   In the past, biologists estimated that 20,000 orangutans lived
in the wilds of Borneo, but the figure has dwindled to around 2,000
because much of their habitat has been destroyed by development and
fires.

Duchess of York's mother killed in Argentina; report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Susan Barrantes, mother of the Duchess of York,
has been killed in a car accident in Argentina where she lived, the
British news agency Press Association reported Sunday.
	   The agency quoted Buckingham Palace as saying Queen Elizabeth II
was given the news when she arrived Sunday in Kuala Lumpur, the
Malaysia capital, during a foreign tour.
	   A Buckingham Palace spokesman could not be immediately contacted
in London.
	   ``It is an absolute tragedy and I'm extremely sorry. I'm very
upset by it,'' Press Association quoted the duchess' father, Maj.
Ronald Ferguson as saying.
	   Mrs. Barrantes was the widow of Hector Barrantes, an Argentine
polo player. She left Ferguson for Barrantes when the Duchess of
York, the former Sarah Ferguson, was a child.
	   The duchess, now 38, and her sister remained in Britain with
Ferguson, who also remarried.
	   The duchess, a controversial figure regularly accused of trading
on her royal connections, is the ex-wife of Prince Andrew, the
queen's second son.
	   They were married in 1986 and divorced 10 years later and have
two daughters, Princess Beatrice, 10, and Princess Eugenie, 8.
	   There was no immediate word on the whereabouts of the duchess.
She has been spending time this summer in Italy with her latest
beau.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A 38-year-old mother of four who
only started running in her early 30s, Heather Turland surprised
herself by winning the Commonwealth Games marathon Saturday.
	   She now looks forward to running for Australia at the Sydney
Olympics in 2000 when she will be 40.
	   On the day Lesotho gained its first ever medal in a major
championship when Thabiso Moqhali raced to gold in the men's
marathon, Turland gave some hope to the 30-somethings with a
convincing win in the women's race in the early morning sun in
Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``It's a dream come true. I never ever thought I'd win something
like this,'' said Turland, who notched up gold medal No. 70 for her
country at these Games.
	   ``It's really special being my last Commonwealth Games, but now
it looks like I'll have to go on to Sydney 2000.''
	   Lisa Dick came home second, 24 seconds behind for an Australian
1-2 with Namibia's Elizabeth Monghudi taking the bronze.
	   In the men's race on the same course, Moqhali pulled away in the
final four miles (6.4 kilometers) to win the title from two
Tanzanians, Simon Bisiligitwa and Andea Suja for an African sweep
of the medals.
	   Six more sets of athletics medals were being decided in
Malaysia's National Stadium later Saturday while England and
Australian shooters collected golds on the range at Langkawi
Island.
	   England's Michael Gault collected his fourth gold medal to go
with his title at the Games at Victoria four years ago by winning
the men's air pistol.
	   ``This is due reward for a lot of training,'' Gault said. ``I
was up against some professional shooters from India and Malaysia
and to get another gold is amazing.
	   ``I've been told if I was Malaysian I would have won four cars
and a house.''
	   Timothy Lowndes of Australia finally made it to gold after a
bronze in the pairs free rifle prone and a silver in the pairs
3-position.

Gault wins fourth gold

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ English shooter Michael Gault won
his fourth gold medal of these Commonwealth Games Sunday, beating
Indian sharpshooter Jaspal Rana in the men's air pistol
competition.
	   Australian Timothy Lowndes won the gold in the men's individual
free rifle 3-position competition, and Desmond Davies of Wales won
the skeet title on the games' last day of shooting.
	   Gault scored 679.9 to Rana's 677.4 in winning the air pistol.
Earlier, he had defended his 1994 free pistol title and won golds
in the pairs events for both those pistols. Gregory Yelavich of New
Zealand won the bronze. He also shot 677.4, but lost 9.2-8.4 to
Rana in a shootout for the silver.
	   Rana had two golds from these games, where he defended his
center-fire pistol title.
	   ``This is due reward for a lot of training,'' said the
44-year-old Gault. ``I was up against some professional shooters
from India and Malaysia and to get another gold is amazing.
	   ``I've been told if I was Malaysian I would have won four cars
and a house,'' he said, referring to the incentives being offered
to athletes from the host nation.
	   Lowndes pulled ahead with a 96.3 in the final round and won the
free rifle shooting with a total score of 1,235.3. Canadian Wayne
Sorensen, who led 1,141-1,139 afer the preliminary round, finished
with 1,234.4 for the silver after a 93.4 in the final round.
	   England's Kenneth Parr beat South African Jaco Henn 8.9-8.5 in a
shootout for the bronze after the two tied at 1,225.6.
	   Davies won with 145 targets in the skeet, ahead of the 144 of
Joe Trinci of Canada and 143 of David Cunningham of Australia.

Queen Elizabeth II visits Malaysia during political storm
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with arrival at cathedral. ADDS byline.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A church service near Freedom
Square was the first stop for Queen Elizabeth II, who arrived
Sunday in this former British colony roiling with a sordid
political drama.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's sacked deputy, Anwar Ibrahim,
headed toward the square in a convoy, defying police restrictions,
to hold a rally at the same time the queen was attending services
at nearby St. Mary's Cathedral.
	   Many of the thousands in the streets said they were there to
catch a glimpse either of the queen, or Anwar, who has made an
unprecedented challenge to Mahathir's 17-year-rule.
	   The queen walked into the cathedral with her husband, Prince
Philip, for a half-hour service, to be followed by chats with
members of the congregation. There were no cheers as Philip waved
from the window of a black Bentley.
	   The church bells for a moment drowned out the call to prayer
from a nearby mosque.
	   Just over a kilometer (just under a mile) away, about 2,000
Muslims, many wearing orange headbands and chanting, ``Reform''
gathered at the National Mosque for prayers, planning to march to
the central Merdeka Square to hear Anwar's speech.
	   With hundreds of police scattered around the area and the
possibility of barricades along the roads, it was doubtful whether
Anwar would arrive before the queen's departure.
	   After a highly successful three-day visit to the tiny kingdom of
Brunei, the queen came to Malaysia mainly to preside over the
closing ceremony of the 16th Commonwealth Games on Monday. They are
the first games in Asia.
	   It was unlikely that the queen would have been exposed to the
headlines in almost all of Malaysia's Sunday papers, declaring in
boldface type that two men had confessed to being sodomized by
Anwar.
	   Anwar said the men were coerced and that Mahathir was behind a
plot to diminish his popularity in this conservative Muslim
country, where many readers considered the newspaper articles
pornographic.
	   Most of Anwar's rallies have been attended by thousands of
cheering supporters, but police told reporters they would not allow
him to speak Sunday. They told some people to stay away but
hundreds gathered, anyway.
	   The royal couple will also attend a state banquet in their
honor, visit the tallest skyscraper in the world, an exhibition
highlighting British industry and a recording studio to meet with
Malaysian pop music stars.
	   Prince Philip, an avid environmentalist, will visit the World
Wide Fund for Nature's Education Center in a national park outside
the capital.

Thousands of Afghans rally in protest of Iranian troop buildup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Kabul, Afghanistan (AP)- An estimated 10,000 Afghans chanting
anti-Iranian slogans staged a rally in the eastern town of Khost on
Sunday to protest Tehran's massive troop buildup on the Afghan
frontier, Kabul radio reported.
	   Iran has deployed about 200,000 troops on its border with
western Afghanistan in a showdown with the Taliban religious army
over the murder of Iranian diplomats when its forces seized the
northern town of Mazar-e-Sharif last month.
	   The Afghani demonstrators demanded that Iran pull back its
forces, and vowed to turn out in defense of their country should
Iran launch an attack on Afghanistan, Taliban-controlled Kabul
radio reported. The protesters also shouted slogans condemning
Iran's spiritual leader Ayatollah Khamenei.
	   The Taliban has claimed renegade soldiers, acting without
orders, murdered eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist based at
the Iranian consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif when the city fell to the
religious army on Aug. 8.
	   The Taliban, which controls at least 90 percent of Afghanistan,
has promised to track down and punish the killers. However, it
refuses to extradite any suspects to Iran, and rejected Tehran's
demands for a public apology.
	   Iran has staged military maneuvers on an unprecedented scale on
the Afghan border, amid a growing demands for vengeance by mobs of
Iranian demonstrators, egged on by the Iranian news media.
	   In bids to avert a conflict, the Taliban has returned the bodies
of seven of the murdered Iranians to Tehran, and has released 10 of
at least 50 Iranian captives held in Afghanistan.
	   Heavily Shiite Muslim Iran has accused the Taliban, mainly made
up of members of the rival Sunni Muslim sect, of massacring Shiites
in Afghanistan. Taliban leaders have denied the allegations, and
accuse Iran of supporting a northern alliance of anti-Taliban
forces that still controls a tiny portion of Afghanistan.
	   According to Kabul Radio, local tribal leaders claimed twelve
thousand volunteers were ready to defend the country. The Taliban
has said it already has 10,000 religious warriors on the Iranian
border.

At least 21 people killed in floods, mudslides
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN FERNANDO, Philippines (AP) _ A tropical storm flooded more
than 500 villages in the main northern island of Luzon, killing at
least 21 people and forcing the evacuation of thousands, officials
said Sunday.
	   A ferry carrying 430 people also sank before dawn Saturday south
of Manila after being pounded by large waves whipped up by the
storm. Rescuers on boats and helicopters have retrieved 37 bodies
in chilly waters near Manila, the coast guard said.
	   Officials said at least 305 passengers and crewmembers survived.
	   Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said more than 20,000 people
were moved out of 536 villages swamped by floods in low-lying areas
of metropolitan Manila and 10 northern provinces starting Saturday.
	   Ten people drowned and three people were eletrocuted in the
rice-growing province of Pangasinan, where two river dikes were
breached.
	   In Pampanga province, north of Manila, more than 220,000 people
evacuated on their own or were moved away aboard army trucks or
helicopters from flooded villages, he said.
	   President Joseph Estrada has declared a state of calamity in
both provinces, allowing greater government assistance.
	   Rolan Cordova, a disaster agency official, said a major river in
Tarlac overflowed, flooding several villages, including two, where
floodwaters reached a depth of 12 feet.
	   Several roads were also closed to traffic due to minor slides in
northern mountain provinces, police said.
	   Police senior superintendent Roberto Calinisan said rains
briefly abated Sunday, allowing rescue teams and relief workers to
go to far-flung villages in Pampanga and Tarlac.
	   In the Manila suburb of Marikina, police said four members of a
family were killed Saturday when their house was buried in tons of
mud loosened by the rain.
	   At the height of the floods, more than 2,600 people, mostly from
flood-prone fishing villages near Manila Bay, were evacuated to
temporary shelters in government schools in the capital, the
National Disaster Coordinating Council said.
	   Weathermen reported that tropical storm Vicki was veering away
from the country, and was located about 440 kilometers (273 miles)
northeast of Cagayan province at the northern tip of Luzon Island.
	   The storm carried gusts of up to 90 kilometers (56 miles) per
hour and was expected to exit from the Philippines Monday,
forecasters said.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Susan Barrantes, mother of the Duchess of York,
has been killed in a car accident in Argentina where she lived, the
duchess's office and her family announced Sunday.
	   The duchess, ex-wife of Queen Elizabeth II's second son, Prince
Andrew, was told the news while on holiday in Italy and was
returning to Britain immediately with her elder daughter, Princess
Eugenie, 10, her office said. She would likely fly to Argentina
Sunday night.
	   The queen and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, on a tour of
Malaysia, was told the news when she arrived in the capital, Kuala
Lumpur.
	   ``They were shocked and very saddened,'' the queen's press
secretary, Geoff Crawford, told the British Broadcasting Corp. ``I
am sure they will be in touch at some stage if they can with the
duchess and the Duke of York.''
	   Mrs. Barrantes, 60, was the widow of Hector Barrantes, an
Argentine polo player, and ex-wife of the duchess's father, Maj.
Ronald Ferguson, the queen's former polo manager.
	   The duchess, now 38, and her sister remained in Britain with
Ferguson when their parents split up. Her father also remarried.
	   Susan Ferguson, Ferguson's second wife, said the family heard
the news at about 5 a.m. (0400 GMT Sunday) and believed the
accident happened Saturday evening.
	   ``But we are still unclear as to the exact details,'' Mrs.
Ferguson was quoted as saying by the British news agency, Press
Association. ``My husband is obviously deeply upset.''
	   Press Association said Mrs. Barrantes was believed to have been
traveling with a nephew who survived the crash.
	   In a statement, the duchess's office said Eugenie would go to
Balmoral, the queen's Scottish estate, where Prince Andrew is on
holiday with the couple's younger daughter, Princess Beatrice, 8.
	   The duchess, a controversial figure regularly accused of trading
on her royal connections, married Andrew in 1986. They were
divorced 10 years later.
	   She has been spending time this summer in Italy with her latest
companion, an Italian count, Gaddo della Gherardesca.
	   The duchess has remained close to her mother, who regularly
visited Britain.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Yokozunas (grand champions) Takanohana, Wakanohana
and Akebono held a three-way tie for the lead at 7-1 as ozeki
(champion) Musashimaru suffered his second upset Sunday, the eighth
day of the 15-day Autumn Grand Sumo Tournament.
	   Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani, stayed one victory behind the
three yokozunas at 6-2 along with No. 16 maegashira (senior
wrestler) Terao.
	   Wrestling at Ryogoku Kokugikan Sumo Arena in downtown Tokyo,
Takanohana, seeking his 20th tournament victory, quickly grabbed
komusubi (junior champion second class) Dejima's belt and forced
him out, handing Dejima his fifth defeat against three victories.
	   Wakanohana, Takanohana's elder brother, charged No. 4 maegashira
Wakanosato and twisted him down with an arm throw, leaving
Wakanosato at 4-4.
	   In the day's final bout, Akebono, or Chad Rowan from Hawaii,
charged No. 3 maegashira Asahiyutaka, shoving him out easily with
hand thrusts. Asahiyutaka is 2-6.
	   Sekiwake (junior champion) Takatoriki crashed head first against
Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani, and drove him out for his fourth
victory against four defeats.
	   No. 4 maegashira Aogiyama bulldozed out ozeki Takanonami with a
series of hand thrusts at his throat. Aogiyama is 3-5 and
Takanonami 5-3.
	   Terao charged No. 9 maegashira Gojoro and thrust him down,
handing Gojoro his fifth defeat against three victories.
	   In other major bouts, No. 5 maegashira Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian
Batbayar Davaa, threw down No. 8 maegashira Mitoizumi for his
fourth victory against four defeats. Mitoizumi is 2-6.
	   In the 26-member juryo division, just below the senior makuuchi
division, No. 5-ranked Kyokutenho (4-4), or Mongolian Tsevegnyam
Nyamjav, forced out No. 3-ranked Toyonoumi (3-5).
	   No. 13-ranked Hoshitango (5-3), or Argentine Imach Marcelo
Salomon, was pushed out by No. 7-ranked Kitakachidoki (4-4).
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 12-ranked Kaishinzan,
or American Henry Armstrong Miller, slapped down No. 9-ranked
Hokutoriki for his third victory against one defeat.
	   No. 45-ranked Kitaazuma (3-1), or Brazilian Tetsuya Takeda from
Sao Paulo, toppled down No. 42-ranked Minami.
	   No. 49-ranked Yamato (3-1), or American George Kalima, forced
out No. 48-ranked Teruazuma.
	   No. 20-ranked Wakaazuma (2-2), or Yoshinobu Kuroda from Brazil,
was thrust down by No. 23-ranked Natsubori.
	   In sandanme, the second highest junior division, No. 2-ranked
Ikemori (3-1), or Brazilian Luis Go Ikemori from Sao Paulo, slapped
down No. 1-ranked Kotohikari.

Kotinda, also slapped down No. 38-ranked Tochiarashi.

Two more liberal newspapers shut down in Iran
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Two more liberal newspapers have been closed
down by Iranian authorities for stories critical of hard-liner
leaders, the Iran Daily reported Sunday.
	   The weekly newspapers Rah-e Nou and Tavana were ordered to stop
publishing last Thursday, Iran Daily said. It said a Justice
Ministry official called the papers' editors with the order and
that no reason was given.
	   Tous, a liberal daily with the second-highest circulation in
Iran, was shut down last Wednesday for publishing articles the
judiciary deemed detrimental to the country's national interests
and security.
	   The paper's editor, a publishing manager and a columnist were
arrested.
	   The Rah-e Nou weekly had angered hard-liners by publishing a
series of articles questioning the authority of Iran's supreme
leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
	   Tavana, a progressive weekly, had published a number of
interviews with people who criticized the hard-liners.
	   Last week, Khamenei _ a hard-liner himself _ called on the
judiciary to deal with what he called ``the abuse of press
freedoms'' by the country's newspapers.
	   Many new, liberal papers opened after the May 1997 election of
Mohammad Khatami, a moderate, as Iran's president.
	   Tous managing director Mohammad Mohsen Sazgara complained over
the weekend that tensions with Afghanistan have given hard-liners
an excuse to crack down on civil liberties.
	   Feelings against Afghanistan's Taliban militia have been running
high in Iran since the militia admitted killing nine Iranians.
Demonstrators, many newspapers and officials have called for
revenge.
	   The Taliban captured 11 Iranians when they overran the city of
Mazar-e-Sharif last month. Nine were killed, eight of them
diplomats and one a reporter for the official Islamic Republic News
Agency. Two escaped and made their way back to Iran.
	   Iran responded by building up its forces along the Afghan
frontier. An estimated 200,000 troops are there, with maneuvers
scheduled to begin later this month.
	   Khamenei, who is Iran's commander-in-chief, placed the military
on full alert Tuesday.
	   Tous got into trouble for questioning Khamenei's authority and
had called for a diplomatic solution to the recent standoff with
the Taliban militia.
	   Tous began publishing under the name Jameah but was closed in
July. When it changed its name to Tous and continued publishing,
authorities again ordered it to close, but then rescinded the
order.

	   BERLIN (AP) _ Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa broke the 10-year-old
world record for a marathon Sunday in Berlin, running the course in
two hours, six minutes and 5 seconds.
	   The 28-year-old bettered the old record held by Ethiopia's
Belayneh Densimo by 45 seconds while running at one of the world's
fastest courses _ a relatively flat route through the German
capital.
	   Densimo had run 2:06.50 on April 17, 1988 in Rotterdam.
	   Belgium's Marleen Renders captured the women's race in 2:25.23
on a sunny cool morning. Her time was the third fastest in Berlin
history.
	   Around 26,000 runners took part in the annual event.

Nun's kidnappers sentenced to one year imprisonment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Six gunmen who abducted a Roman
Catholic nun were sentenced to one year in prison each by an
Islamic court in Somalia's first trial of kidnappers this decade.
	   The abductors, whose names were not released, must study Islam
during their imprisonments, the court ruled Saturday.
	   It was the first time kidnappers were tried under any law in
Mogadishu since the beginning of civil strife in 1990.
	   More than 100 foreigners, including aid workers, have been
kidnapped in Somalia by militiamen eager to make easy money or to
win an argument since the country disintegrated into a fiefdom of
clans following the ouster of late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in
1991.
	   Sister Marsa was kidnapped by gunmen apparently hired by an
accountant under investigation for financial misdealings at the SOS
charity hospital where she worked, sources said. SOS officials
refused to comment.
	   The nurse, who has worked in Somalia since 1967, was released
unharmed on Sept. 12 after three days in captivity. The hospital
was open again Sunday after a weeklong protest of the kidnapping by
staff members.
	   The SOS hospital is the main provider of maternity and child
health care in Mogadishu, serving Somalis without charge. Pressure
from the mothers and children who frequented the hospital forced
clan elders to win Sister Marsa's release.
	   In the absence of central authority in Somalia, Islamic courts
have managed to curtail crime by handing down often brutal and
swift justice, such as cutting off the hands of convicted thieves.
However, banditry and abductions remain common.

Israelis head into New Year holiday divided, uneasy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ It's been a difficult year in Israel, and as
Israelis prepare to ring in the Jewish New Year, few are expecting
things to get better any time soon.
	   The two-day Rosh Hashana holiday, beginning at sundown Sunday,
finds Israel in an 18-month-old political stalemate with the
Palestinians. American mediator Dennis Ross left for Washington
Sunday after yet another inconclusive peace mission.
	   The hardline government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
managed to anger supporters and opponents alike. The right wing
charges he has conceded too much to the Palestinians, while
opponents on the left counter that he is killing the peace process.
	   ``A believing Jew is always optimistic, but I cannot hide the
concern that we have,'' said Rabbi Eliezer Waldman, head of a
rabbinical school in Kiryat Arba, a militant Jewish settlement in
the West Bank next to the city of Hebron.
	   His worry is that the Netanyahu government will carry out the
Israeli commitment to turn over more of the West Bank to the
Palestinians.
	   Waldman, who calls Palestinians ``our enemies,'' represents
ideologically driven Israeli settlers who believe that Israel must
retain all of the West Bank for religious and security reasons.
	   Most of these settlers and their supporters backed Netanyahu in
Israel's elections two years ago, but now they are disenchanted by
his stated intention to implement the Oslo accords.
	   That interim agreement with the Palestinians _ negotiated by
Israel's previous moderate government _ calls for turning over much
of the West Bank to Palestinian civilian control.
	   The opposing Israeli political camp is just as frustrated, for
the opposite reason. Israeli peace activists say Netanyahu's
commitment to negotiations is only a front, and that he has no
intention of actually arriving at any reconciliation with the
Palestinians.
	   Activists acknowledge that Israel's peace camp is paralyzed as
the Jewish New Year approaches. Though a recent rally in Tel Aviv
drew an estimated 40,000 protesters against the government's
policies, the left has not been able to wield any real political
clout.
	   Israeli newspaper columnist B. Michael, identified with the
peace camp, exhorted supporters of the left to learn lessons of
perseverence from the Palestinians.
	   ``Don't give up, don't despair, lie low, hold on to what we
have, and wait for this evil regime to pass,'' he wrote in the
Yediot Aharonot newspaper.
	   The New Year also finds Israel's society divided between
Orthodox and secular Jews, and between well-off Israelis and
growing numbers of unemployed.
	   On the eve of the New Year, Israelis crowded modern shopping
malls and traditional open-air markets, stocking up on food and
presents for the holiday. Businesses gave bonus presents to workers
ranging in value up to hundreds of dollars.
	   At the same time, more than 200,000 Israelis _ representing more
than 9 percent of the work force _ faced the New Year holiday
unemployed. Economists say Israel is in recession as the government
works to reduce inflation by cutting spending, and interest rates
remain relatively high.
	   ``Someone described the past year as `zero year,' said Israeli
songwriter and broadcaster Ehud Manor. ``If you went to sleep at
the beginning and woke up at the end, you would find that nothing
changed.''
	   Manor, who was awarded the prestigious Israel Prize this year
for his contributions to Israeli society, said the malaise began
with the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in
November 1995 by an extremist Israeli opponent of the peace proess
with the Palestinians.
	   ``There was an attempt to repress the memory and continue with
life as usual,'' said Manor, ``and this is still going on.''
	   Manor describes himself as a secular Jew, but fondly recalls
childhood visits to synagogues. However, he stopped going to
synagogue in recent years, he says, because he no longer feels
comfortable there.
	   ``Orthodox Jews have stolen the feeling of Jewishness from me,''
he complained.
	   Manor is unhappy about the passiveness of Israelis like himself.
``When we talk, we all sigh in the same places, but there is a
feeling of paralysis,'' he said.
	   But he remains optimistic, he said, because he believes most
Israelis feel as he does. The majority, he said, is ``waiting for
the right moment and the right leadership'' to bring about change.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The streets of the capital
reverberated Sunday with shouts for Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
to resign as his former heir-apparent defied police restrictions
and lead an unprecedented march during the visit of Queen Elizabeth
II.
	   Anwar Ibrahim, fighting for his freedom and political life,
appeared before more than 20,000 chanting supporters in central
Merdeka (Freedom) Square after marching at the head of a chanting
throng from the National Mosque.
	   ``We cannot allow one dictator to rule us,'' Anwar yelled
through a megaphone as the feverish crowd in the mosque chanted,
``Mahathir is foolish,'' ``Resign now,'' ``Long live Anwar.''

Criminal case still pending against controversial feminist author
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HASAN SAEED &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Controversial feminist author Taslima
Nasrin faces an uncertain future since she continues to be a
fugitive in her country, an official said Sunday.
	   Fearing threats to her life from militant Muslims, Nasrin, 36,
has been hiding since she returned home last week after living in
self-imposed exile in Europe for four years.
	   A criminal case registered in 1994 accusing her of blasphemy is
still pending in the Supreme Court and militants are pressing the
government to prosecute her, an official at the attorney-general's
office said.
	   The government has given no indication whether it plans to
pursue the old complaint against her.
	   Nasrin, a physician by profession, denies that she insulted
Islam but admits she has suggested changes in Islamic laws to give
more rights to women in predominantly Muslim Bangladesh.
	   Syed Abu Kowser Mohammed Dabirush Shan, the assistant
attorney-general, said: ``The case against her was not dismissed
and she is still a fugitive in the eyes of the law.'' If convicted,
she can be jailed up to two years.
	   According to Dhaka newspapers, Nasrin came back with her mother,
who is suffering from colon cancer.
	   Hundreds of right-wing Muslims demonstrated in the streets
Friday after her return to Bangladesh and demanded she be punished
for what they considered her anti-Islamic writings and utterances.
	   But two intellectuals, Professor Kabir Choudhury and Hasan Imam,
decried the anti-Nasrin campaign and asked the government to
protect the author.
	   ``When the nation was struggling against the worst-ever flooding
in the country, the fundamentalists were giving provocative
statements against the writer, '' they said in a joint statement
Sunday that appeared to suggest the militants had their priorities
wrong.
	   The fundamentalists already have announced 200,000 taka (dlrs
5,000) cash reward to anyone who kills her.
	   Police filed a case against the author in a magistrate's court
in June 1994 accusing her of making ``deliberate and insinuating
remarks against the holy Koran and Islamic culture.'' The court
issued an arrest warrant, but later granted her bail and exemption
from personal appearance.
	   She left for Sweden a few months later at the invitation of an
international writers association, PEN or Poets, Essayist and
Novelists.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Two more liberal newspapers have been closed
down by Iranian authorities, apparently for stories critical of
hard-liner leaders, the Iran Daily reported Sunday.
	   The weekly newspapers Rah-e Nou and Tavana were ordered to stop
publishing, the paper said. Other newspapers on Saturday said a
Justice Ministry official called the papers' editors last Thursday
with the order and that no official reason was given.

Fukabori wins ANA Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KITAHIROSHIMA, Japan (AP) _ Keiichiro Fukabori shot a
3-under-par 69 Sunday and captured his second career victory by two
strokes over Lee Janzen and overnight leader Katsumasa Miyamoto in
the 100 million yen (dlrs 746,000) ANA Open.
	   Fukabori, whose only previous win came in the Just System KSB
Open in March 1997, sank three birdies in a bogey-free trek over
the par-72 Sapporo Golf Club course, known for its deep rough and
large, slick undulating greens.
	   After scoring birdies on the par-4 fourth, par-5 fifth and par-3
eighth for a 3-under 33 on the front nine for a two-stroke lead,
Fukabori played conservatively and two-putted for par on all the
inward nine holes.
	   The round left the 29-year-old Fukabori with a 9-under 279
total, two shots ahead of the U.S. Open champion Janzen and
Miyamoto, who also was seeking his second career title after
winning the Tsuruya Open in April.
	   Janzen, who has yet to win in Japan, fired a 69, while Miyamoto
turned in a level-par 72 en route to their 7-under 281.
	   ``Following the win last year, I had been playing some good golf
but just not getting anything out of it through this summer, when I
sat out for recuperation and training,'' said a jubilant Fukabori.
	   ``The rest and training meant to have an autumn that yields well
for me,'' said the former national junior champion and a member of
the national amateur team. ``And this is one of the tournaments
that I've really wanted to win.''
	   The victory was worth 18 million yen (dlrs 135,000).
	   Janzen had an up-and-down front nine with three birdies and two
bogeys. But he hit his irons better and birdied the par-4 10th and
par-4 15th for a 34 on the back side of the round.
	   Janzen, who also played in Japan last week to place sixth in the
Suntory Open, said he plans to compete again in Japan next month,
possibly in the 120 million yen (dlrs 896,000) Bridgestone Open
Oct. 22-25.
	   First-round co-leader Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki, who is leading
this year's money earnings list, shot a 68 and placed fourth at
282. He was seeking his third victory of the season and 109th
overall.

	   Anwar, 51, was fired by Mahathir on Sept. 2 from his posts as
deputy prime minister and finance minister. Anwar alleges the only
reason is that Mahathir feared his growing popularity.
	   Mahathir said it was because of Anwar's ``low morals.''
	   Although Anwar has not been formally charged, police have said
they are investigating allegations of treason, sexual misconduct
and abuse of power. Anwar predicted he would be arrested at the end
of the Commonwealth Games on Monday or after the queen leaves
Thursday.
	   His appearance in the center of the capital, at the beginning of
the royal visit, was seen as the culmination of a week of
nationwide rallies in which he has called for Mahathir's
resignation and accused the 73-year-old leader of corruption.
	   Mahathir told reporters earlier Sunday he was not intimidated by
the words or the swelling crowds at Anwar's meetings.
	   ``I am not concerned at all,'' Mahathir said. ``But he has been
holding rallies which have been illegal.''
	   Mahathir denied he was directing the police investigation of the
man he once designated as his successor, and denied Anwar's
allegations that witnesses had been tortured into confessing they
committed sodomy with Anwar.
	   Sunday's newspapers carried banner-headlined stories containing
explicit details of the alleged offenses. Sodomy is a crime in
conservative Muslim Malaysia.
	   Before leaving the mosque, about a kilometer (a mile) away from
where the just-arrived queen was attending a church service, Anwar
called on police to refuse Mahathir's orders and protect the
people.
	   Marchers booed as police vehicles passed, but there was no
interference or violence.
	   ``I am the people's ruler'' Anwar declared, as thousands of men,
women and children chanted, ``Reform, reform.''
	   They ignored helpless police officers and crammed into the
mosque, on the opposite side of the square from St. Mary's
Cathedral where the queen and her husband, Prince Philip, were
worshipping on their first day in the country since 1989.

down by Iranian authorities, apparently for stories critical of
hard-liner leaders, the Iran Daily reported Sunday.
	   The weekly newspapers Rah-e Nou and Tavana were ordered to stop
publishing, the paper said. Other newspapers on Saturday said a

Malaysia's Mahathir denies directing Anwar investigation

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The streets of the capital
reverberated Sunday with shouts for Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
to resign as his former heir-apparent defied police restrictions
and lead an unprecedented march to central Freedom Square as Queen
Elizabeth II worshipped in a nearby church.
	   Anwar Ibrahim, fighting for his freedom and political life,
appeared before more than 20,000 chanting supporters in central
Merdeka (Freedom) Square after marching at the head of a chanting
throng from the National Mosque.
	   ``We cannot allow one dictator to rule us,'' Anwar yelled
through a megaphone as the feverish crowd in the mosque chanted,
``Mahathir is foolish,'' ``Resign now,'' ``Long live Anwar.''
	   The crowd broke through police barriers as riot officers moved
aside. Thousands of spectators, punching their fists in the air and
chanting ``Reform, reform,'' flooded the wide green lawn near the
site where Malaysian independence from Britain was declared.
	   Such public demonstrations, defying police and showing
disrespect for Mahathir, ruler for the past 17 years, are without
precedent.
	   Anwar, 51, was fired by Mahathir on Sept. 2 from his posts as
deputy prime minister and finance minister. Anwar alleges the only
reason is that Mahathir feared his growing popularity and is now
behind a conspiracy to have him jailed.
	   Mahathir said he acted because of Anwar's ``low morals.''
	   Although Anwar has not been formally charged, police have said
they are investigating allegations of treason, sexual misconduct
and abuse of power. Anwar predicted he would be arrested at the end
of the Commonwealth Games on Monday or after the queen leaves
Thursday.
	   His appearance in the center of the capital, at the beginning of
the royal visit, was seen as the culmination of a week of
nationwide rallies in which he has called for Mahathir's
resignation and accused the 73-year-old leader of corruption.
	   Mahathir told reporters earlier Sunday he was not intimidated by
the words or the swelling crowds at Anwar's meetings.
	   ``I am not concerned at all,'' Mahathir said. ``But he has been
holding rallies which have been illegal.''
	   Mahathir denied he was directing the police investigation of the
man he once designated as his successor, and denied Anwar's
allegations that witnesses had been tortured into confessing they
committed sodomy with Anwar.
	   Sunday's newspapers carried banner-headlined stories containing
explicit details of the alleged offenses, confessed in a Sessions
Court hearing on Saturday by Anwar's adopted brother and a friend.
Both men had been denied access to their relatives or lawyers
during their police detention.
	   Sodomy is a crime in conservative Muslim Malaysia, and both men
were sentenced to six months in prison.
	   Before leaving the mosque, about a kilometer (a mile) away from
where the just-arrived queen was attending church at St. Mary's
Cathedral, Anwar called on police to refuse Mahathir's orders and
protect the people.
	   Marchers booed as police vehicles passed, but there was no
interference or violence.
	   ``I am the people's ruler'' Anwar declared.

Israelis head into New Year holiday divided, uneasy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ It's been a difficult year in Israel, and as
Israelis prepare to ring in the Jewish New Year, few are expecting
things to get better any time soon.
	   The two-day Rosh Hashana holiday, beginning at sundown Sunday,
finds Israel in an 18-month-old political stalemate with the
Palestinians. American mediator Dennis Ross left for Washington
Sunday after yet another inconclusive peace mission.
	   The hardline government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
managed to anger supporters and opponents alike. The right wing
charges he has conceded too much to the Palestinians, while
opponents on the left counter that he is killing the peace process.
	   ``A believing Jew is always optimistic, but I cannot hide the
concern that we have,'' said Rabbi Eliezer Waldman, head of a
rabbinical school in Kiryat Arba, a militant Jewish settlement in
the West Bank next to the city of Hebron.
	   His worry is that the Netanyahu government will carry out the
Israeli commitment to turn over more of the West Bank to the
Palestinians.
	   Waldman, who calls Palestinians ``our enemies,'' represents
ideologically driven Israeli settlers who believe that Israel must
retain all of the West Bank for religious and security reasons.
	   Most of these settlers and their supporters backed Netanyahu in
Israel's elections two years ago, but now they are disenchanted by
his stated intention to implement the Oslo accords.
	   That interim agreement with the Palestinians _ negotiated by
Israel's previous moderate government _ calls for turning over much
of the West Bank to Palestinian civilian control.
	   The opposing Israeli political camp is just as frustrated, for
the opposite reason. Israeli peace activists say Netanyahu's
commitment to negotiations is only a front, and that he has no
intention of actually arriving at any reconciliation with the
Palestinians.
	   Activists acknowledge that Israel's peace camp is paralyzed as
the Jewish New Year approaches. Though a recent rally in Tel Aviv
drew an estimated 40,000 protesters against the government's
policies, the left has not been able to wield any real political
clout.
	   Israeli newspaper columnist B. Michael, identified with the
peace camp, exhorted supporters of the left to learn lessons of
perseverance from the Palestinians.
	   ``Don't give up, don't despair, lie low, hold on to what we
have, and wait for this evil regime to pass,'' he wrote in the
Yediot Aharonot newspaper.
	   The New Year also finds Israel's society divided between
Orthodox and secular Jews, and between well-off Israelis and
growing numbers of unemployed.
	   On the eve of the New Year, Israelis crowded modern shopping
malls and traditional open-air markets, stocking up on food and
presents for the holiday. Businesses gave bonus presents to workers
ranging in value up to hundreds of dollars.
	   At the same time, more than 200,000 Israelis _ representing more
than 9 percent of the work force _ faced the New Year holiday
unemployed. Economists say Israel is in recession as the government
works to reduce inflation by cutting spending, and interest rates
remain relatively high.
	   ``Someone described the past year as `zero year,' said Israeli
songwriter and broadcaster Ehud Manor. ``If you went to sleep at
the beginning and woke up at the end, you would find that nothing
changed.''
	   Manor, who was awarded the prestigious Israel Prize this year
for his contributions to Israeli society, said the malaise began
with the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in
November 1995 by an extremist Israeli opponent of the peace process
with the Palestinians.
	   ``There was an attempt to repress the memory and continue with
life as usual,'' said Manor, ``and this is still going on.''
	   Manor describes himself as a secular Jew, but fondly recalls
childhood visits to synagogues. However, he stopped going to
synagogue in recent years, he says, because he no longer feels
comfortable there.
	   ``Orthodox Jews have stolen the feeling of Jewishness from me,''
he complained.
	   Manor is unhappy about the passiveness of Israelis like himself.
``When we talk, we all sigh in the same places, but there is a
feeling of paralysis,'' he said.
	   But he remains optimistic, he said, because he believes most
Israelis feel as he does. The majority, he said, is ``waiting for
the right moment and the right leadership'' to bring about change.

Slovakia's Meciar clings to iron-handed rule, devoted following
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TRNAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ The chant starts suddenly, filling the
packed sports hall, when the heavyset man saunters in confidently
and strides to the podium.
	   It's the moment the crowd, now electrified, has been waiting
for.
	   ``Long live Meciar!'' the beaming spectators yell out, rising to
their feet. ``Long live Meciar!''
	   If the deafening volume is startling, so is, to outsiders, the
adoration still bestowed on Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar
(mech-YAR) by many as he seeks to retain power in parliamentary
elections this coming week.
	   A virtual one-man show in Slovakia through years of wrenching
change, he has blocked dissent, reined in the media, been censured
by foreign governments, presided over rising unemployment and
steered the country into diplomatic isolation in central Europe.
	   But all that is unimportant or overlooked by his strong core of
supporters, many from the hardscrabble farming villages and dingy
industrial towns of rural Slovakia.
	   Tough times require a tough boss, they say, and this
charismatic, no-nonsense ex-boxer, whom they revere as the father
of Slovak independence, is what they want _ and all they really
know in this decade of post-communist uncertainty.
	   ``I cannot imagine another leader of the government,'' says
pensioner Zuzana Tothova at the campaign rally in Trnava, a city of
70,000 located an hour's drive northeast of the capital,
Bratislava. ``What would we accomplish without Meciar?''
	   Rows and rows of spectators are gray-haired older Slovaks, who
nod approvingly as the 56-year-old premier reels off plain-spoken
answers to their written questions. Some have been brought from
villages in buses with photos of their esteemed leader taped to the
windshield.
	   Their backing makes Meciar's ruling Movement for a Democratic
Slovakia the favorite to top all other parties in the
Friday-Saturday election; whether it will be able to form a
majority coalition is another matter.
	   ``Meciar is a wise man,'' says Mikulas Konecny, 58, a telephone
repairman. ``We are going to be better off than the U.S. if we work
hard.''
	   ___
	   Western pariah or common man's messiah, Meciar has political and
oratorical skills that are unmatched in modern-day Slovakia.
	   ``He has the gift to persuade people, to influence them,'' says
Marian Lesko, columnist for the opposition daily Sme and author of
a book about Meciar. ``He has a talent for politics that would make
him successful in any country.''
	   Yet he only rose to prominence less than a decade ago.
	   Born July 26, 1942, in Zvolen in rural central Slovakia, Meciar
became a Communist and was educated in Russia before working at
various administrative jobs. After the Soviet invasion of
Czechoslovakia in 1968, he was deemed too progressive, ironically,
and banished to a job at a steel mill blast furnace.
	   After secretly studying law on the side, he took a lawyer's job
in 1974, where he remained until emerging as a champion of Slovak
nationalism in 1989 with the fall of communism.
	   Rising quickly, he became Slovakia's environment minister,
deputy in the Czechoslovak parliament and Slovak premier. After
founding his populist movement known as HZDS in 1991, Meciar helped
bring about the split from Czechoslovakia that won him the lifetime
support of nationalistic Slovaks.
	   Elected premier in 1992 and 1994, he has led the nation for its
entire statehood except for a brief time in opposition. But along
the way, he has increasingly displayed what critics call a contempt
for civilized politics _ an iron-fisted ``Meciarism'' that has
driven away democratic allies and repelled the West.
	   While maintaining a relatively stable economy, Meciar's ruling
HZDS has imposed harsh controls on the media and non-governmental
organizations, sold off state land at ultra-cheap prices,
overridden constitutional court rulings, thwarted a referendum on
direct presidential elections, expelled a dissenting lawmaker from
parliament and limited Hungarian-language training for Slovakia's
560,000-strong Hungarian minority _ over 10 percent of the
country's population of 5.5 million.
	   ``This is a man who has consistently and repeatedly shown that
he is not ready to accept the democratic rules of the game,'' says
Martin Butora, president of the Institute for Public Affairs, an
independent think tank funded by George Soros' Open Society
Institute.
	   ``He is obsessed with political power _ that is his primary
goal,'' the analyst says.
	   A Meciar ally maintains that the premier's strong rule is
appropriate for the times, and is misportrayed in propaganda spread
by the opposition and foreign journalists.
	   ``He understands that democracy is not just open freedom, which
could be considered open anarchy, but everyday responsibility,''
says Jaroslav Reznik, editor-in-chief of the pro-government daily
Slovenska Republika.
	   ``If the world sees the prime minister in a different way, it is
only temporary.''
	   ___
	   Meciar's Slovakia is fast becoming the hole in the doughnut in
Central Europe, nearly surrounded by westward-looking countries
that have successfully embraced democratic and free-market reforms.
	   The pristine towns of a hopelessly richer Austria are visible
across the Danube, in another world. More painfully, the
Hungarians, Poles and their ex-partners the Czechs have left the
Slovaks and a similar legacy behind and are ticketed for NATO and
the European Union as the West's new darlings.
	   Mounting evidence points to trouble ahead in the Slovak economy,
which foreign analysts claim has been kept artificially unstable in
the runup to elections. Already, unemployment tops 14 percent,
inflation has risen and investor interest has waned, due to
mistrust of Meciar.
	   Any other leader might be in mortal political danger.
	   With his rock-solid base of support _ older, rural,
less-educated voters plus industry, banks and others who benefit
from his authoritarian regime _ Meciar may be able to weather the
strong opposition challenge. But recent comments reflect his
awareness that he could be defeated if opposition forces stay
united.
	   Increasingly, he seems to see enemies at every turn.
	   This month, he told state television that ``massive Czech
propaganda'' on the eve of the partition had portrayed Slovaks as a
``fascist and anti-Semitic nation'' and that ``this reputation''
has lingered on after independence.
	   At the Trnava rally, after manly jokes about the beauty of model
Claudia Schiffer, who made a campaign appearance for him, he darkly
mentioned plots against him by unidentified opponents.
	   ``In '92 they threatened to hang me. In '94 they threatened to
arrest me,'' he said in his commanding baritone, wagging his finger
as he sat hunched over a microphone.
	   ``If they arrest me, they will have to let me go. I have nothing
to worry about,'' he declared, to strong applause.

Pope beatifies campaigner for Catholic schools

<TEXT>
	   BRESCIA, Italy (AP) _ Under a strange, sloping crucifix that had
Jesus dangling head down, Pope John Paul II on Sunday beatified a
19th-century layman who campaigned ardently for Catholic schools.
	   The towering, modernistic construction has been the subject of
intense debate in this prosperous city at the edge of the Italian
Alps, which has been preparing for the papal visit for months.
	   Thirty meters (Ninety feet) high, it curved precipitously over
the platform where John Paul, resplendent in a green robe, presided
over the beatification of local son Giuseppe Torvini.
	   Beatification is a step toward sainthood.
	   A poor boy who made good, Torvini founded Catholic schools,
newspapers, banks, insurance companies and charities at a time when
public sentiment in Italy, then a new nation, was turning against
what some saw as the church's excessive influence on society.
	   A lawyer and the father of 10 children, Torvini died in 1897,
the same year another local son, the future Pope Paul VI, was born.
John Paul's predecessor, Paul was pontiff from 1963 to 1978 and
presided over the historic reforms of the Second Vatican Council.
	   Shaded by a golden canopy, John Paul urged the 30,000
worshippers gathered at the city stadium to follow Torvini's
example.
	   ``Fervent, loyal, active in social and political life, Giuseppe
Torvini proclaimed with his life the Christian message,'' he said.
	   Torvini's beatification comes as the Roman Catholic Church is
pressing the Italian government to fund church schools.
	   Like the crucifix, created for the pope's visit by a prominent
stage designer, the campaign has provoked intense debate.
	   Some, especially on the conservative end of the spectrum, are
for it, saying church schools promote moral values. Others are
adamantly opposed, saying it would jeopardize Italy's hard-won
separation of church and state.
	   Brescia, a city of 200,000 near Lake Garda, was the second and
final stop on the pope's weekend pastoral visit to northern Italy.
The 78-year-old pontiff also visited Chiavari on the Italian
Riviera south of Genoa.

Accident investigator says Philippine ferry was carrying heavy

cargo

2nd graf.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A Philippine passenger ferry which
sank with 454 people on board was carrying heavy cargo that may
have shifted in strong waves, causing the ship to tilt and then
sink, the chief investigator said Sunday.
	   Seventeen more people were rescued Sunday after spending more
than a day in chilly storm-whipped waters, bringing the number of
survivors to at least 311, officials said. At least 39 people were
dead.
	   Rough weather continued to hamper rescue operations. A navy ship
was forced to turn back Sunday before reaching the accident area
because of powerful waves.
	   Maritime officials puzzled over why the large Princess of the
Orient began tilting in a tropical storm Friday night and then
quickly sank.
	   The ship, with a capacity of 3,900 passengers, had been hit by
strong waves and winds but should have been able to withstand much
worse weather, officials said.
	   Survivors said the ship sank in less than an hour _ highly
unusual for a vessel with no apparent damage.
	   Chief accident investigator Arnie Santiago said the ship was
carrying 15 vehicles and 66 containers of truck parts and other
heavy materials which may not have been properly secured.
	   ``The way the ship tilted indicates that the cargo moved,'' he
told The Associated Press.
	   He said some of the ship's water seals also may have been
damaged by an onboard fire in 1997. After the fire the 24-year-old
ship was repaired at a Singapore dry dock.
	   A surviving crew member, Vincente Go, said the ship began
listing to the left and did not stabilize even after the crew began
pumping ballast water to the right side. Normally, large ships
pushed one direction by heavy winds or waves naturally bob back.
	   The ship's owner, Sulpicio Lines, also owned the Dona Paz, a
ferry which collided with a tanker in 1987, killing 4,341 in the
world's worst peacetime shipping disaster. A year later, 250 people
died in the sinking of another ship owned by the company, the Dona
Marilyn.
	   Ramon Revilla Jr., governor of Cavite province, said fishermen
discovered 11 survivors Sunday morning at various places along the
Cavite coast, which faces the area where the Princess of the Orient
sank near the mouth of Manila Bay.
	   For a second day, a large group of anguished relatives waited at
a pier in Manila for the return of rescue ships.
	   They began crying as a navy patrol craft pulled up with 13
bodies, including two children, bloated from decomposition and
covered with flies.
	   ``I hope my sister isn't one of them,'' said Praxedes Coronas,
54, as she stared at the pile of bodies. ``We've been sleepless
since yesterday, not being able to confirm whether she's dead or
alive.''
	   Tropical storm Vicki was beating the northern Philippines with
75 kilometer (45 mile) per hour winds when the Princess of the
Orient left Manila at about 8 p.m. (1200 GMT) Friday for Cebu,
about a day's journey to the south.
	   A storm warning prohibited ships of less than 500 tons from
sailing but did not apply to the 13,734-ton ferry.
	   A few hours later the ship reported it was listing 25 degrees
near Fortune island off Batangas province, about 60 kilometers (40
miles) south of Manila, and then lost radio contact.
	   The company said there were 352 passengers and 102 crew aboard
the ship, revising earlier figures to account for people not listed
in the manifest, the coast guard said. No foreigners were reported
on board.

Hundreds gather in cemetery in memory of assassinated lawmaker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Hundreds of Albanians gathered peacefully
Sunday at the grave of Azem Hajdari, whose assassination last
weeked sparked riots that sent the country spiraling into political
turmoil.
	   Some 1,500 people, many holding flowers, began the procession
from Skanderbeg square in downtown Tirana, continuing calmly to the
former lawmaker's grave at the cemetery.
	   Shops along the streest remained closed and police were present,
but did not interfere.
	   Hajdari, a popular opposition figure and ally of former
President Sali Berisha, was killed on Sept. 12. Berisha has blamed
Prime Minister Fatos Nano and for Hajdari's death and demanded the
leader resign.
	   Rioting by Berisha supporters last Sunday and Monday, in which
mobs briefly seized government buildings, state television and
Nano's office, has raised fears of further unrest in the volatile
Balkans.

Poll: Most Israelis would want Palestinians expelled
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ About two-thirds of Israelis wish it were
possible to expel Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, a
poll indicated Sunday.
	   In the poll published by the Israeli newspaper Maariv, the
question was posed as a hypothetical one because of the enormous
political and military repercussions such a step would have.
	   If there were no such price to be paid, 65 percent of the
respondents said they would support expelling the Palestinians.
Twenty-six percent were opposed, and 9 percent did not express an
opinion.
	   However, a political party advocating expulsion of Palestinians
from the West Bank and Gaza won only two seats in Israel's 120-seat
parliament in the 1996 general election.
	   Maariv said respondents to the poll, conducted by Gallup, were
550 adults. It did not say whether the respondents included
Israel's minority Arab citizens, or describe the polling method.
	   The margin of error was 4.5 percentage points, it said.
	   Responding to another question, 54 percent believed that the
Arabs would not give up their dream of destroying the state of
Israel, but 34 percent said Arabs are interested in making peace
with Israel.
	   A large majority, 71 percent, expected Israel to benefit
economically if it signs peace agreements with all the Arab
nations.

Official calls for removing fuel from sunken Iraqi tanker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A Kuwaiti environmental official called Sunday for
the removal of some 30,000 barrels of fuel believed still aboard an
Iraqi tanker that sank during the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Mahmoud Abdul-Rahim, coordinator of the Kuwait-based Regional
Organization for Protection of the Marine Environment, also
disclosed for the first time that studies indicate the ship's
entire cargo of some 700,000 barrels of crude has leaked onto the
Gulf floor.
	   ``It looks like over time, the oil leaked to the bottom of the
sea,'' Abdul-Rahim told The Associated Press.
	   He said further damage to the shallow waters of the Gulf could
be prevented if the ship's fuel was recovered.
	   The Iraqi tanker Amouriya sank seven years ago just outside
Iraqi territorial waters.
	   Kuwait had repeatedly warned of a marine pollution disaster if
the Amouriya was not salvaged from the northern Gulf.
	   Abdul-Rahim said the leakage of the Amouriya's crude oil cargo
had been determined by a survey carried out about 10 months ago in
cooperation with the United Nation's International Maritime
Organization.
	   ``We hope that through regional cooperation and the cooperation
of Iraq, we will be able to remove the effects of this disaster,''
Abdul-Rahim said.
	   He added that the sunken tanker remained a menace to navigation.
	   ``If it is left there, the area around it should be surrounded
with well-lit buoys,'' he said.
	   The six Arab Gulf states, as well as Iraq and Iran, are members
of the marine protection agency. Iraq, whose occupying troops were
driven out of Kuwait in February 1991, is not invited to meetings
held here.

Queen Elizabeth II visits Malaysia during political storm

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Queen Elizabeth emerging from cathedral in tears

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A church service near Freedom
Square was the first stop for Queen Elizabeth II, who arrived
Sunday in this former British colony roiling with a sordid
political drama.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's sacked deputy, Anwar Ibrahim,
headed toward the square in a convoy, defying police restrictions,
to hold a rally at the same time the queen was attending services
at nearby St. Mary's Cathedral.
	   Many of the thousands in the streets said they were there to
catch a glimpse either of the queen, or Anwar, who has made an
unprecedented challenge to Mahathir's 17-year-rule.
	   The queen attended the half-hour service with her husband,
Prince Philip. As the queen left the church she greeted a group of
disabled members of the parish.
	   Before entering a navy blue Bently with Prince Philip the queen
began to cry and wiped a tear from her eye with a gloved finger.
	   Although it was not immediately clear why she was crying, the
queen's press secretary said she and Prince Philip had recently
been informed of the death of Susan Barrantes, mother of the
Duchess of York.
	   ``They were shocked and saddened by the news,'' said press
secretary, Geoff Crawford.
	   Barrantes was killed in a car accident in Argentina where she
lived, her family announced Sunday.
	   After a highly successful three-day visit to the tiny kingdom of
Brunei, the queen came to Malaysia mainly to preside over the
closing ceremony of the 16th Commonwealth Games on Monday. They are
the first games in Asia.
	   Just over a kilometer (just under a mile) away, about 2,000
Muslims, many wearing orange headbands and chanting, ``Reform''
gathered at the National Mosque for prayers, planning to march to
the central Merdeka Square to hear Anwar's speech.
	   It was unlikely that the queen would have been exposed to the
headlines in almost all of Malaysia's Sunday papers, declaring in
boldface type that two men had confessed to being sodomized by
Anwar.
	   Anwar said the men were coerced and that Mahathir was behind a
plot to diminish his popularity in this conservative Muslim
country, where many readers considered the newspaper articles
pornographic.
	   Most of Anwar's rallies have been attended by thousands of
cheering supporters, but police told reporters they would not allow
him to speak Sunday. They told some people to stay away but
hundreds gathered, anyway.
	   The royal couple will also attend a state banquet in their
honor, visit the tallest skyscraper in the world, an exhibition
highlighting British industry and a recording studio to meet with
Malaysian pop music stars.
	   Prince Philip, an avid environmentalist, will visit the World
Wide Fund for Nature's Education Center in a national park outside
the capital.

Chechnya releases Russian hostages and a kidnap victim
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two Russian soldiers and a kidnap victims being
held captive in the rebel republic of Chechnya have been released,
Russian television reported Sunday.
	   Vladimir Ivanenko and Alexander Dubnov, two soldiers from the
Rostov region, were captured during Russia's 1994-96 war to stop
the southern republic's drive for independence, the report said.
	   Following their release Saturday night, they were shown on
Russian national television shaking hands with Salman Raduyev, a
former Chechen field commander who reportedly brokered their
release.
	   ``By this act we call on the Russian side to meet us half way,''
Raduyev said. ``We are ready to continue the release of Russian
prisoners of war, but we expect the Russian side to do the same
with Chechen prisoners.''
	   Kazbek Dzysoyev, a North Ossetian who was kidnapped on May 31,
was also released Saturday night following the payment of a ransom,
the television report said.
	   The report said the Chechen side wanted Russia to release two
Chechen women arrested in Russia on suspicion of terrorism in
exchange for the freeing of the two Russian soldiers.
	   Raduyev claimed earlier this month that he could obtain the
release of more than 10 Russian soldiers being prisoner in
Chechnya, but only in exchange for Chechens who were taken prisoner
during the rebel republic's war with Russia.

Economy, tax reform the centerpieces of Howard's reelection hopes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Updates with poll takers saying victory is within Labor's
grasp &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia would survive the global
financial turmoil and emerge the economic ``strongman of Asia'' if
the government were reelected in Oct. 3 national elections and
allowed to implement its tax plan, Prime Minister John Howard said
Sunday.
	   Officially launching his conservative Liberal Party's election
campaign, Howard firmly pinned his reelection hopes on economic
issues by devoting most of his speech to his government's history
of economic management and his controversial tax plan.
	   With Howard's ruling coalition trailing the opposition Labor
Party in most opinion polls less than two weeks before election
day, the launch was seen as a key opportunity to inject some fire
into the campaign.
	   Overshadowed in the news by Australian sporting achievements in
the Commonwealth Games and U.S. Open tennis, campaigning by the
major parties has so far been lackluster.
	   Standing center-stage at a theater in Parramatta, in Sydney's
western suburbs, Howard outlined his vision for a future Australia
to a crowd of party faithful including senior government ministers
and his wife and children.
	   ``There is no reason that by the year 2030 the Wall Street of
the Asia-Pacific should not run slap bang through the central
business district of a major Australian city,'' said Howard,
standing beneath a party banner which read ``A stronger
Australia.''
	   In the 2 1/2 years of his government, ``Australia has become the
strongman of Asia because ... we have followed policies which have
protected the Australian people from the worst impacts of the Asian
downturn,'' he said.
	   Further reform was necessary, particularly of the tax system,
``if we are to survive the challenges of international economic
circumstances.''
	   Howard's main policy is a plan to reform the tax system,
including introduction of a broad-based consumption tax.
	   ``I have never, in 24 years of public life, been more certain
than I am today that I'm doing the right thing for Australia in
pursuing the cause of taxation reform,'' Howard said, to cheers and
applause.
	   Voters rejected such a tax in a 1993 election.
	   Leading opinion poll takers Sunday said Labor was a chance to
win the election, despite needing to win an unprecedented 27
electorates.
	   The Newspoll organization's Sol Lebovic said his latest poll
showed a more than six percent swing against the government which,
if repeated on a uniform basis on voting day, would see Labor win
enough seats to form the next government.
	   Another pollster, Jim Alexander from AC Nielsen, said he doubted
the swing would be uniform nationally.
	   ``It's moving around in contrary ways, but not so much so that
it would rule out a win for Labor,'' he said.
	   In his speech Sunday, Howard also announced new spending for
education and health, and for an expansion of Australia's
work-for-unemployment benefit scheme.
	   Mounted police watched as about 150 demonstrators jeered as
Howard and senior ministers arrived for the function. The
demonstrators were protesting the new tax, uranium mining and the
placement of a planned airport.
	   There were no arrests or violence.

Polls show German race too close to call
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ With polls showing Germany's two main parties
running virtually even a week before the national vote, Chancellor
Helmut Kohl again ruled out a post-election ``grand coalition''
between the two, while his rival Gerhard Schroeder left the door
open.
	   The respected, independent Emnid polling institute said it
appeared neither Kohl's conservative Christian Democrats nor
Schroeder's left-leaning Social Democrats would end up far enough
ahead to be able to form a workable government with the small
parties.
	   That makes a ``grand coalition'' of the two big parties _
something not seen on the federal level since 1969 _ more and more
likely.
	   Kohl has said he would step down as party leader rather than
join a coalition with the Social Democrats, and repeated his stance
on the campaign trail in his hometown of Ludwigshafen Saturday.
``I'm for a strong government and a strong opposition,'' he said.
	   Schroeder, however, told Der Spiegel newsmagazine he believed
that Kohl's party would not reject a partnership out of hand. If
election results make that the only available option, he said,
``one just has to do it.''
	   Schroeder, campaigning as a fresh face for Germany after 16
years of Kohl as chancellor, has seen his early strong lead
evaporate as the Sept. 27 election nears.
	   Several polls released over the weekend showed Kohl, seeking an
unprecedented fifth term, pulling to within about two percentage
points.
	   Polling experts said the race was now too close to call, since
the difference between the two was within the margin of error of
plus or minus three percentage points.
	   The best news for Schroeder came from a Forsa poll for Pro
Sieben television, released Saturday night, which showed the Social
Democrats leading Kohl's conservative union 42 percent to 38
percent.
	   But 37 percent of the 1,507 eligible voters surveyed said they
were still undecided.
	   Kohl expressed confidence that many of the undecided would go
his way. The Social Democrats got an early start, he told Welt am
Sonntag newspaper, but now ``the air is going out'' of their
campaign.
	   Schroeder told Der Spiegel he remained optimistic, but sounded
his first negative note as well. If the Social Democrats don't win,
he said, ``the world won't end.''

Da Costa breaks 10-year-old marathon world record

	   BERLIN (AP) _ Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa snapped the 10-year-old
world record for a marathon Sunday in Berlin, running through the
heart of the German capitol in two hours, six minutes and 5
seconds.
	   The 28-year-old bettered the old record held by Ethiopia's
Belayneh Densimo by 45 seconds while running at one of the world's
fastest courses on a cool sunny and windless morning.
	   Densimo had recorded a 2:06.50 on April 17, 1988 in Rotterdam,
The Netherlands.
	   ``I wanted to run under 2:08, but when I saw how good the
conditions were I just went for it,'' said da Costa.
	   Da Costa broke to the front of the pack at the halfway point,
then held off Josephat Kiiprono. The Kenyan also covered the 42.2
kilometers (26 miles) through a a relatively flat route in a fast
time of 2:07.26.
	   Belgium's Marleen Renders captured the women's race in 2:25.22
for the third best time in the history of the Berlin Marathon.
	   The event has grown in size in recent years and with 28,000
runners at the start is now the third largest city marathon behind
London and New York.
	   Around 4,000 more participants lined up than last year for the
event, watched by an estimated one million spectators.
	   ``We're not sure why there has been such an increase this year,
but its a welcome surprise,'' said Stephane Franke, coordinator for
the athletes.
	   Berlin has attracted some of the world's top distance runners
because of its reputation for fast times. Kenya's Sammy Lelei had
clocked the second fastest mark in history of 2:07.02 at the event
three years ago.
	   Da Costa, who stems from the town of Descoberto 200 kilometer
(120 miles) north of Rio de Janiero, will earn dlrs 200,000 for the
win.
	   But the Brazilian, who has been running since he was 17, is now
expected to command up to dlrs 250,000 in appearance money at
future marathons.
	   ``This will make him a millionaire,'' said Luis Posso, Da
Costa's manager.
	   Da Costa broke the tape at the posh downtwon shopping district
of Ku'damn, followed by three Kenyans coached by Gabriele Rosa,
whose athletes have captured a dozen top marathons in the past year
including Boston.
	   Behind Kirpono, Samson Kandie finished in 2:09.11, while Reuben
Chebutich was fourth in 2:10.39.
	   In the women's race, Kenya's Susann Chepkemei was second in
2:28.18 and a three-time winner of the event, Poland's Renata
Kokowska, followed in 2:31.53.

Anwar holds unprecedented rally in Malaysian capital

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The streets of the capital
reverberated Sunday with shouts for Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
to resign as his former heir-apparent defied police restrictions
and lead an unprecedented march to central Freedom Square while
Queen Elizabeth II worshipped in a nearby church.
	   Anwar Ibrahim, fighting for his freedom and political life,
appeared before more than 35,000 exuberant supporters in central
Merdeka (Freedom) Square after marching at the head of a chanting
throng from the National Mosque.
	   ``We cannot allow one dictator to rule us,'' Anwar yelled
through a megaphone as the feverish crowd in the mosque chanted,
``Mahathir is foolish,'' ``Resign now,'' ``Long live Anwar.''
	   Such public demonstrations, defying police and showing
disrespect for Mahathir are without precedent.
	   Anwar, 51, was fired by Mahathir on Sept. 2 from his posts as
deputy prime minister and finance minister. Anwar alleges the only
reason is that Mahathir feared his growing popularity and is now
behind a conspiracy to have him jailed.
	   Mahathir said he acted because of Anwar's ``low morals.''
	   The crowd broke through police barriers as riot officers moved
aside. Thousands of spectators, punching their fists in the air and
chanting ``Reform, reform,'' flooded the wide green lawn, the site
where Malaysian independence from Britain was declared in 1957.
	   With only a megaphone at his disposal, Mahathir stood in the
midst of the sea of people, leading chanted demands for the end of
Mahathir's 17-year-rule, while a few policemen watched from a
distance. Anwar was carried across the field and back on the
shoulders of jubilant young men, then boarded a motorcycle and went
home.
	   The crowd dispersed as the sun set.
	   Although Anwar has not been formally charged, police have said
they are investigating allegations of treason, sexual misconduct
and abuse of power. Anwar predicted he would be arrested at the end
of the Commonwealth Games on Monday or after the queen leaves
Thursday.
	   His appearance in the center of the capital, at the beginning of
the royal visit, was the culmination of a week of nationwide
rallies in which he has called for Mahathir's resignation and
accused the 73-year-old leader of corruption.
	   Mahathir told reporters earlier Sunday he was not intimidated by
the words or the swelling crowds at Anwar's meetings.
	   ``I am not concerned at all,'' Mahathir said. ``But he has been
holding rallies which have been illegal.''
	   Mahathir denied he was directing the police investigation of the
man he once designated as his successor, and denied Anwar's
allegations that witnesses had been tortured into confessing they
committed sodomy with Anwar.
	   Sunday's newspapers carried banner-headlined stories containing
explicit details of the alleged offenses, confessed in a Sessions
Court hearing on Saturday by Anwar's adopted brother and a friend.
Both men had been denied access to their relatives or lawyers
during their police detention.
	   Sodomy is a crime in conservative Muslim Malaysia, and both men
were sentenced to six months in prison.
	   Before leaving the mosque, about a kilometer (a mile) away from
where the just-arrived queen was attending church at St. Mary's
Cathedral, Anwar called on police to refuse Mahathir's orders and
protect the people.
	   Marchers booed as police vehicles passed, but there was no
interference or violence.

Obuchi leaves for New York to meet Clinton
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi left Tokyo for New York
Sunday for a three-day visit to the United States, where he is to
meet with President Bill Clinton and deliver a speech at the U.N.
General Assembly.
	   A Japanese government plane, carrying Obuchi, left Tokyo's
Haneda airport at 5:14 p.m. (0814 GMT) and is scheduled to arrive
at John F. Kennedy airport in New York at 3:30 p.m. local time
Sunday.
	   Obuchi will deliver a speech at the General Assembly Monday and
later meet with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan.
	   On Tuesday, he will meet Clinton for the first time since he
became prime minister in July, succeeding Ryutaro Hashimoto.
	   Obuchi is expected to discuss Japan's efforts to revitalize the
stagnant economy as well as world economic problems.
	   Obuchi will also likely raise Japanese security issues following
North Korea's recent firing of a rocket over the Japanese
archipelago.

Hundreds gather in cemetery in memory of assassinated lawmaker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Hundreds of Albanians gathered peacefully
Sunday at the grave of Azem Hajdari, whose assassination last
weekend sparked riots that sent the country spiraling into
political turmoil.
	   Some 1,500 people, many holding flowers, began the procession
from Skanderbeg square in downtown Tirana, continuing calmly to the
former lawmaker's grave at the cemetery more than five kilometers
(three miles) away.
	   Some shopowners quickly pulled down metal window guards as the
chanting crowd approached, but there was no violence. Police were
largely unseen.
	   Hajdari, a popular opposition figure and ally of former
President Sali Berisha, was killed on Sept. 12. Berisha has blamed
Prime Minister Fatos Nano and for Hajdari's death and demanded the
leader resign.
	   Rioting by Berisha supporters last Sunday and Monday, in which
mobs briefly seized government buildings, state television and
Nano's office, has raised fears of further unrest in the volatile
Balkans.
	   Berisha appeared at the cemetery at Hajdari's graveside, but
left again in his car without making any comment.
	   He has rejected international criticism of his party's role in
the violence and rejected negotiations with Nano's governing
Socialist Party. But the daily protests called by the Democratic
Party have drawn only a few thousand people, showing Berisha lacks
significant support in the capital.
	   A multi-national delegation traveled to Tirana Saturday to meet
with political leaders and seek answers to who was responsible for
Hajdari's killing. Western officials say they believe the shooting
death resulted from a personal feud.
	   The delegation, formed by the 52-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, met with Berisha and Nano, as
well as President Rexhep Meidani, who has been seeking a solution
to the crisis.
	   OSCE officials criticized Berisha and his party for inciting the
unrest, but also Nano, for failing to effectively fight corruption.
	   Last week's rioting brought Albania to the brink of anarchy for
the second time in 18 months.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Jerusalem court on Saturday ordered a Jewish
settler suspected in the fatal shooting of a Palestinian teen-ager
put under effective house arrest pending a decision on any formal
charges, army radio said.
	   Palestinians bitterly protested the decision and called
Thursday's shooting an unprovoked attack. Settlers defended the
suspect's action and demanded his release.
	   The settler _ Avshalom Ladani, 35, of the Dolev settlement in
the West Bank near the town of Ramallah _ was to stay in hotel
where his family would be allowed to join him. The two-day Jewish
New Year's holiday begins at sundown on Sunday.
	   The slain Palestinian youth, 17-year-old Iyad Kabasma, was
walking home from school with other teen-agers when the shooting
occurred. Another youth was wounded as well.
	   The teen-agers denied they had been throwing rocks.
	   Ladani told police he fired in the air after his car was stoned,
and that he was not aware anyone had been hit. He turned himself in
several hours after the shooting.
	   ``We are not happy when people are killed,'' said settler leader
Aharon Dompa. ``But everyone who creates a dangerous situation and
tries to kill Jews _ he is putting himself in danger.''
	   Palestinian official Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, told army radio said the handling of the case
showed the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was
giving a green light to settlers who attacked Palestinians.

Higo captures sixth career win in Yukijirushi Ladies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   INABE, Japan (AP) _ Kaori Higo shot the lowest final round of
5-under-par 67 Sunday to win her sixth career title by four strokes
in the Yukijirushi Ladies Tokai Classic.
	   Higo, who last won in the Toyo Suisan Ladies in July 1997, gave
up her one-stroke overnight lead with a bogey on the par-4 fifth
hole. But she quickly regained her swing with a birdie on the
eighth.
	   The 29-year-old Higo built on that momentum on the back nine,
scoring five birdies, including three straight from No. 11, and on
the par-5 final hole.
	   At a 9-under 207 total, Higo finished four strokes ahead of the
current money earnings leader Hattori Michiko, winner of last
week's Japan LPGA Championship, and Yuri Kawanami.
	   Hattori turned in a 70 and Kawanami, in contention for her first
career win, fired a 68 for their 5-under scores of 211.
	   Higo collected 10.8 million yen (dlrs 80,500) from a total purse
of 60 million yen (dlrs 448,000).
	   ``I thought I would lose when Kawanami took the lead from me
midway through the front nine,'' Higo recalled. Kawanami briefly
led by one stroke after her birdie on the par-4 sixth hole.
	   ``But my birdies early on the back nine turned the tide,'' she
said. ``I want to win two or three more tournaments this season to
go higher than my career best of 5th place on the money list.''
	   South Korean veteran Ku Ok-hee, Fuki Kido, Kaori Harada and
Akane Oshiro shared fourth at 4-under 213.
	   Han Hee-won, a 20-year-old former amateur star from South Korea,
shot a 72 for a share of sixth at 214 with Akiko Fukushima, the
earnings leader in the last two seasons, and four others.
	   For Han, it was her first tournament after qualifying for the
Japan tour. Before coming to Japan several years ago, Han shared a
number of amateur titles in Seoul with Pak Se-ri, the South Korean
rookie sensation on the U.S. LPGA Tour.

Jarrett breaks through for hurdles win

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ English hurdler Tony Jarrett
finally broke through for a major gold medal Sunday but was forced
to hold up his celebrations for several agonizing seconds.
	   Jarrett, the perennial bridesmaid behind missing world record
holder Colin Jackson, edged out Trindad's Steve Brown in an ugly
110-meter hurdles final at the Commonwealth Games.
	   Brown thought he had won and Jarrett had no idea. The
Englishman's big-time experience showed at the finish as his dip
stopped the clock at 13.47 seconds, .01 faster than Brown.
	   ``I'm just glad I've got a gold medal around my neck,'' said
Jarrett. ``After the finish I thought I had a chance but I told
myself, `Don't jump up and down just yet.' I did that once at the
Olympic Games when I thought I had a bronze but I was only
fourth.''
	   Jarrett was referring to the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, one of
many near misses at the top level.
	   He was second in the 1990 and 1994 Commonwealth Games, has two
seconds and a third from the past three world championships, and a
second and a third from the European titles, and fell in the
quarterfinals of the 1996 Olympics.
	   With Jackson deciding to run for money in Tokyo instead of
medals in Malaysia, Jarrett was the hot favorite.
	   He shot out of the start while everyone else was preparing for
the gun, and the nerve-wracking false start meant he decided to run
cautiously when the race finally got under way.
	   ``In finals if I win it I don't mind if I run 14 flat,'' Jarrett
said of the pedestrian time.
	   Brown admitted he paid too much attention to Jarrett.
	   ``I'd be lying if I said I didn't keep an eye on him,'' said
Brown. ``I could sense where he was, so I could have concentrated a
little bit more on what I was trying to do.''
	   South African Shaun Bownes added a hurdles bronze to the gold
medal won by compatriot Riaan Botha moments earlier in the pole
vault.
	   Botha, ranked second at home behind Okkert Brits, was well off
his best of 5.91 meters, winning with 5.60. He had the gold secured
at that height but took the bar up to 5.70 and snapped his pole on
his first attempt.
	   ``It didn't really affect me,'' said Botha, who was given
another chance but missed all three jumps. ``It's not a very good
height but it was hard because no one was pushing me.''
	   New Zealand's world champion discus thrower Beatrice Faumuina
won the gold medal by reaching 65.96 meters with her fifth attempt.
She was behind Australian silver medalist Lisa Marie Vizaniari
after three but took the lead with 62.84 on the fourth.
	   ``I had a few niggles and I was a bit sore,'' said Faumuina.
``I'm just glad it's over.''
	   Faumuina said she was happy to see the end of a season dogged by
tiredness, injury and non-stop travel.
	   England's Tony Whiteman won his 1,500-meter semifinal in 3
minutes, 45.18 seconds to qualify fastest for Monday's final.
Kenyan Laban Rotich won heat 2 in 3:46.71.
	   In Sunday morning's marathons, Heather Turland, a 38-year-old
mother of four who only started running in her early 30s, led an
Australian 1-2 in the women's event.
	   After finishing in 2 hours, 41 minutes, 24 seconds, she was
hugged by one of her sons at the finish line before the whole
family joined in the celebrations.
	   Thabiso Moqhali pulled away from the field four miles (6.4
kilometers) from home in the men's race to win Lesotho's first
Commonwealth Games gold. He finished in 2 hours, 19 minutes, 15
seconds.
	   ``I am going to celebrate by dancing. I like dancing,'' said
Moqhali.

Rocket screams into Kabul, killing civilians and spreading terror
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ A powerful rocket slammed into a
crowded Kabul neighborhood on Sunday, killing at least nine
civilians and bringing back memories of the years of civil war that
ravaged the Afghan capital.
	   Taliban soldiers working in chaotic conditions in the
northwestern Kabul neighborhood said nine civilians were known dead
and six others were wounded by the rocket.
	   Hundreds of civilians were sifting through the rubble of homes
and shops searching for more wounded, so the exact number of
causalities was not immediately known.
	   The Taliban religious militia that controls most of Afghanistan
said roughly four-meter (13-foot) long, Russian-made missile was
fired by a northern alliance of Taliban foes from about 50
kilometers (30 miles) north of Kabul.
	   It demolished three buildings and severely damaged at least four
others. A second rocket was also launched Sunday morning, but fell
in a sparsely populated area with no immediate reports of damage or
injury, the Taliban said.
	   In the Khair-Khana neighborhood of Kabul, where the rocket
struck, an estimated 2,000 to 3,000 people were in the streets,
some searching through wreckage, others crying. Private cars and
taxis careened through the streets, rushing dead and wounded
civilians to local hospitals.
	   It has been months since the last rocket strike hit civilians
areas of Kabul, a city that has slowly grown more peaceful in the
nearly two years since the hard-line Taliban seized the city and
imposed its harsh for of Islam.
	   ``There was a very strong sound when it exploded. We had
forgotten about the rockets after the Taliban came, but now we
remember ... now I remember the bad times again,'' said Mahmood, a
shopkeeper who was in his store when the blast shattered its
windows. He would only give his first name.
	   Years of rocket and artillery attacks severely damaged about
half of Kabul. The Khair-Khana neighborhood was spared in most
attacks, and was packed with civilians who moved there from
uninhabitable parts of the city.
	   The religious army now controls about 90 percent of Afghanistan,
although an alliance of anti-Taliban forces continues fighting
north of Kabul, and in the northern and central parts of the
devastated country.

Queen Elizabeth II visits Malaysia during political storm

 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATE throughout with more details of queen's visit,
nearby rally.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A white-gloved Queen Elizabeth II
attended a church service at Freedom Square on her first stop in
this former British colony roiling with a sordid political drama.
	   Just after the queen settled into the front pew at nearby St.
Mary's Anglican cathedral, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's sacked
deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, defied police restrictions and headed toward
Merdeka Square in a convoy to hold a rally at the site where
Malaysian independence was declared in 1957.
	   Many of the thousands in the streets said they were there to
catch a glimpse of either the queen, or Anwar, who has made an
unprecedented challenge to Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   In a fuchsia hat, a pink floral dress and cream-colored pumps
with a matching handbag, the queen attended the half-hour service
in the 19th-century Anglican church with her husband, Prince
Philip.
	   Just before entering a navy blue Bentley with Prince Philip, the
queen appeared to wipe a tear from her eye with a gloved finger.
	   Although it was not immediately clear if she was crying or
dabbing away perspiration from the tropical heat, the queen's press
secretary said she and her husband had been informed immediately
after landing in Kuala Lumpur of the death of Susan Barrantes,
mother of the Duchess of York.
	   ``They were shocked and saddened by the news,'' said press
secretary, Geoff Crawford.
	   Barrantes was killed in a car accident in Argentina where she
lived, her family announced Sunday.
	   As the royal couple left the church, they greeted hundreds of
beaming members of the congregation, the choir and clergy. The
queen spoke briefly with a group of disabled and orphaned members
of the parish.
	   One woman pushed through the crowd, clutching a blown-up
photograph of her husband flanked by the queen and duke on a visit
to Malacca in 1972. She asked the queen for an autograph.
	   ``Sorry I don't do that,'' the queen replied through a sweet
smile, her hands clasped in front of her.
	   Just over a kilometer (just under a mile) away, thousands of
Muslims, chanting ``Reform'' gathered at the National Mosque to
hear Anwar speech before marching to the central square in defiance
of police threats.
	   It was unlikely that the queen would have been exposed to the
headlines in almost all of Malaysia's Sunday papers, declaring in
boldface type that two men had confessed to being sodomized by
Anwar.
	   Anwar said the men were coerced and that Mahathir was behind a
plot to diminish his popularity in this conservative Muslim
country, where many readers considered the newspaper articles
pornographic.
	   The royal couple later met with gold medalists from the
Commonwealth Games, the first in Asia. The queen will preside over
the closing ceremony Monday, visit the tallest skyscraper in the
world, an exhibition highlighting British industry and a recording
studio to meet with Malaysian pop music stars.
	   Prince Philip, an avid environmentalist, will visit the World
Wide Fund for Nature's Education Center in a national park outside
the capital.

Iranian drivers released by Taliban say they were tortured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Five Iranians released by Afghanistan's
Taliban militia returned to Tehran on Sunday, and several said they
were tortured in captivity, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
	   Iran says the Taliban militia is holding at least 50 more
Iranians. Tehran claims most were drivers delivering food, medicine
and other humanitarian goods to needy Afghans.
	   The Taliban, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan, says the
Iranians were carrying weapons to its opponents in the north of the
country.
	   Also Sunday, Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri said the
Taliban were a threat to Islam and vowed that Iran would take
action it deemed necessary for its ``national security interests.''
	   State-run television also quoted Nateq-Nouri, a hard-liner, as
saying Iran ``will not cave in to the pressure exerted by any
powers.''
	   The United States and other Western countries have urged Iran to
exercise caution in dealing with the Taliban.
	   Tensions between the two sides has risen sharply since the
Taliban admitted that its militiamen killed eight Iranian diplomats
and a journalist after capturing the northern city of
Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   The Taliban returned seven of the nine bodies to Tehran last
week.
	   Iran has massed tens of thousands of troops on its border with
Afghanistan in response. Taliban leaders say they have rushed
troops to the frontier region to repulse any Iranian attack.
	   The Iranians who returned home Sunday had been held for as
little as two months and as long as three years, IRNA said.
	   One of the drivers, Behnam Alipour, a native of Tabriz, told
IRNA that he had suffered severe torture during three years of
captivity.
	   Alipour charged that in one instance, the Taliban militia
ordered him and 15 other captives to lie on the ground, then
threatened to have a tank drive over them.
	   ``You either confess that you were carrying arms or we will
flatten you under the wheels of the tank,'' he quoted the Taliban
as threatening.
	   Alipour told IRNA that he repeatedly tried to convince the
Taliban he was transporting humanitarian goods.
	   He said the Iranian drivers also were pressured by the Taliban
by being ordered to queue up with convicts about to be executed,
IRNA said.
	   Alipour said he was repeatedly beaten with a cable.
	   Another captive, a native of Zahedan whose name was not given,
said he had been held for a year and beaten repeatedly.
	   ``His feet were swollen due to cable lashes, but (he) was given
no medication,'' IRNA charged.
	   Ali Hussein Husseini, a driver from Bojnourd, was held captive
for 55 days. He said he lost 20 kilograms (44 pounds) in captivity
``due to torture, malnutrition and poor (living) conditions,'' the
news agency said.
	   Earlier this month, the Taliban released five other Iranian
drivers as a goodwill gesture.

	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Heavy alcohol and drug consumption was
blamed Sunday for the death of a young German on the opening day of
Munich's world-famous Oktoberfest beer festival.
	   The 24-year-old Munich man collapsed late Saturday after getting
off an amusement ride and died 20 minutes later in a hospital,
police said.
	   Police said he had drunk five liters (1.3 gallons) of beer
during the evening and also taken illegal drugs, although it was
not known exactly what.
	   More than 6 million people are expected to visit the beer tents,
food stands and carnival rides at the 165th annual Oktoberfest,
which runs until Oct. 4.

China plans four large hydropower projects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China plans to spend 60 billion yuan (dlrs 7.2
billion) to build five large hydropower plants by 2010, a report
said Sunday.
	   The government has said it plans to increase the use of
hydropower because coal-fired plants, which produce 70 percent of
the country's electricity, are a main source of the nation's severe
air pollution.
	   The new projects will create big demand for foreign loans,
technology, equipment and investment, Zhang Xuezhi, director of the
hydropower development department of the State Power Corp., was
quoted as saying in the Business Weekly.
	   China now gets only 24 percent of its electricity from
hydropower and uses only 15 percent of its exploitable hydro
potential, the newspaper report said.
	   It said reforms would be needed to move the monopoly power
sector toward market competition and open the way for direct
foreign investment.
	   Zhang listed the projects as the Gongboxia station, with an
installed capacity of 1.5 million kilowatts; Laxiwa station, at 3.7
million kilowatts; Longtan station, at 5.4 million kilowatts;
Xiaowan station, at 4.2 million kilowatts; and Sanbanxi station, at
1.5 million kilowatts.

Official calls for removing fuel from sunken Iraqi tanker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A Kuwaiti environmental official called Sunday for
the removal of some 30,000 barrels of fuel believed still aboard an
Iraqi tanker that sank during the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Mahmoud Abdul-Rahim, coordinator of the Kuwait-based Regional
Organization for Protection of the Marine Environment, also
disclosed for the first time that studies indicate the ship's
entire cargo of some 700,000 barrels of crude has leaked onto the
Gulf floor.
	   He said further damage to the shallow waters of the Gulf could
be prevented if the ship's fuel was recovered.
	   The Iraqi tanker Amouriya sank seven years ago just outside
Iraqi territorial waters.
	   Kuwait had repeatedly warned of a marine pollution disaster if
the Amouriya was not salvaged from the northern Gulf.
	   Abdul-Rahim said the leakage of the Amouriya's crude oil cargo
had been determined by a survey carried out about 10 months ago in
cooperation with the United Nation's International Maritime
Organization.
	   ``We hope that through regional cooperation and the cooperation
of Iraq, we will be able to remove the effects of this disaster,''
Abdul-Rahim said.
	   He added that the sunken tanker remained a menace to navigation.
	   ``If it is left there, the area around it should be surrounded
with well-lit buoys,'' he said.
	   The six Arab Gulf states, as well as Iraq and Iran, are members
of the marine protection agency. Iraq, whose occupying troops were
driven out of Kuwait in February 1991, is not invited to meetings
held here.

Explosion kills 2, injures 10 in Yemen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADEN, Yemen (AP) _ Two people were killed and 10 injured when a
bomb exploded in central Aden on Sunday, a security official said.
	   A man and a boy were killed when the bomb, made with TNT, went
off near a crowded vegetable market, said the official, speaking on
condition of anonymity. Most of the injured were women and
children.
	   The motive for the blast was not immediately known, and there
was no immediate claim of responsibility, the official said.
	   He said, however, that a man who had been selling cigarettes
from a pushcart was suspected of being behind the blast. He was
seriously injured and taken to hospital, the official said.
	   Yemen, a poor nation of 17 million people on the Arabian
peninsula, is still recovering from a 1994 civil war triggered by
secessionists in southern Yemen. The war nearly tore apart a 1990
merger of the conservative North and socialist South.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Susan Barrantes, mother of the Duchess of York,
has been killed in a head-on car crash near her ranch estate in
Argentina, her family announced Sunday.
	   The duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson and ex-wife of Queen
Elizabeth II's second son, Prince Andrew, learned the news while on
holiday in Italy and was flying back to Britain and wll leave for
Argentina Sunday night.
	   ``She is devastated,'' said spokeswoman Kate Waddington.
	   Mrs. Barrantes, 61, was killed instantly Saturday when the Land
Rover she was driving was in collision with a van on a rural road
near Tres Lomas, about 310 miles (550 kms) southwest of the
capital, Buenos Aires, police said.
	   The crash happened some 30 miles (50 kms) from her ranch, El
Pucara.
	   Her passenger, nephew by marriage Ralphy Barrantes, 25, survived
the 9.30 p.m. local time (1830 GMT) collision with minor injuries.
The driver of the other car suffered a broken ankle, said local
police commissioner Hector Dimas Molineuvo.
	   Mrs. Barrantes's body was taken to a hospital morgue in Tres
Lomas.
	   Mrs. Barrantes had lived in Argentina since marrying in 1975 an
Argentine professional polo player, Hector Barrantes.
	   She left her first husband, Maj. Ronald Ferguson, and two
teen-age daughters, Sarah and Jane, for Barrantes, who died of
cancer in 1990.
	   The 38-year-old duchess, popularly known as ``Fergie,'' was in
Italy with her younger daughter, Princess Eugenie, 8, when she
heard the news. She has spent time in Italy this summer with her
latest boyfriend, Count Gaddo della Gherardesca.
	   Eugenie would go to Balmoral, the queen's Scottish estate, where
Prince Andrew is on holiday with the couple's other child, Princess
Beatrice, 10, and the duchess would go alone to Argentina, her
spokeswoman said.
	   The queen, on a tour of Malaysia, was told the news when she
arrived in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, and was ``shocked and very
saddened,'' her press secretary, Geoff Crawford, said.
	   The Ferguson daughters stayed with their father when their
mother abruptly departed _ becoming what is known in English
upper-class circles as a ``bolter.''
	   The duchess remained close to her mother. Mrs. Barrantes would
visit Britain several times a year and they spoke on the phone
regularly.
	   The last time they were together was at a July 20 charity golf
tournament near London, her spokeswoman said, and they also had a
short holiday in France with Beatrice and Eugenie in July.
	   Ferguson, the queen's former polo manager, told reporters at his
home, Dummer Down Farm, near Basingstoke, west of London, that the
duchess rang him early Sunday.
	   ``We are all deeply shocked and extremely upset and I feel very
sorry for my two daughters Jane and Sarah and the rest of Susan's
family,'' said Ferguson.
	   The duchess, a controversial figure regularly accused of trading
on her royal connections, married Andrew in 1986. They were
divorced 10 years later.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Hurdler Tony Jarrett, for so long
used to finishing second or worse in major championships, finally
made it to gold Sunday when he triumphed in the 110-meter hurdles
at the Commonwealth Games.
	   A two-time silver and also bronze medalist at the World
Championships, runner-up twice at the last two Commonwealths and
fourth-place finisher at the Barcelona Olympics, the 30-year-old
Englishman edged Trinidad's Steve Brown by .01 to clock 13.47 in
the final.
	   ``I'm just glad I've got a gold medal around my neck,'' Jarrett
said.
	   ``After the finish I thought I had a chance but I told myself,
`Don't jump up and down just yet.' I did that once at the Olympic
Games when I thought I had a bronze but I was only fourth.''
	   On a good day for England away for the track too, boxer Audley
Harrison won the super-heavyweight gold with a first-round knockout
for the team's fourth title in 12 finals, and two more golds came
on the shooting range.
	   Jarrett's long overdue victory was one of six finals in the
stadium Sunday evening after the the marathon races in the early
morning.
	   A 38-year-old mother of four who only started running in her
early 30s, Heather Turland surprised herself by winning the
marathon.
	   She now looks forward to running for Australia at the Sydney
Olympics in 2000, when she will be 40.
	   On the day Lesotho gained its first ever medal in a major
championship when Thabiso Moqhali raced to gold in the men's
marathon, Turland gave some hope to the 30-somethings with a
convincing win in the women's race in the early morning sun in
Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``It's a dream come true. I never ever thought I'd win something
like this,'' said Turland, who notched up gold medal No. 70 for her
country at these Games.
	   ``It's really special being my last Commonwealth Games, but now
it looks like I'll have to go on to Sydney 2000.''
	   Lisa Dick came home second, 24 seconds behind, for an Australian
1-2, with Namibia's Elizabeth Monghudi taking the bronze.
	   In the men's race on the same course, Moqhali pulled away in the
final four miles (6.4 kilometers) to win the title from two
Tanzanians, Simon Bisiligitwa and Andea Suja, for an African sweep
of the medals.
	   New Zealand's world champion Beatrice Faumina, who was
Commonwealth runner-up four years ago, heaved a Games record 65.92
to win the women's discus, and South Africa's Riaan Botha also
claimed a Games mark of 5.60 to win the men's pole vault.
	   Away from Malaysia's National Stadium, Harrison's first round
knockout of Michael Macaque of Mauritius was the highlight of
England's four-gold performance in the boxing finals.
	   The powerfully built super-heavyweight unleashed a straight left
that jerked Macague's head backward and his opponent crashed to the
floor. The referee didn't finish the count but called to the
ringside doctors to make sure he was all right.
	   Courtney Fry upset Olympic quarterfinalist Troy Amos Ross of
Canada 26-21 on points in the light-heavyweight division, John
Pearce outclassed India's Jitender Kumar 25-15 at middleweight and
Chris Bessey scored a 20-15 victory over Canada's Scott MacIntosh
at light middleweight.
	   Canada won three golds medals, defending titlist Michael Strange
downing Gerry Legras of the Seychelles 16-8 at light welterweight
and Jeremy Molitor scoring a 14-9 verdict over Kenya's Absolom
Okoth at welterweight.
	   Then heavyweight Mark Simmons outpunched Roland Raforme of the
Seychelles 21-13.
	   The Kenyans, who two golds four years ago in Victoria, went home
without a medal after a disappointing performance from their 10
fighters.
	   English shooters also collected golds on the range at Langkawi
Island.
	   Michael Gault collected his fourth gold medal to go with his
title at the Games at Victoria four years ago by winning the men's
air pistol.
	   ``This is due reward for a lot of training,'' Gault said. ``I
was up against some professional shooters from India and Malaysia
and to get another gold is amazing.
	   ``I've been told if I was Malaysian I would have won four cars
and a house.''
	   Timothy Lowndes of Australia finally made it to gold after a
bronze in the pairs free rifle prone and a silver in the pairs
3-position.

Poll: Most Israelis would want Palestinians expelled
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ About two-thirds of Israelis would support the
expulsion of Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip if the
move had no consequences, a poll indicated Sunday.
	   The question posed on behalfn of by the Israeli newspaper Maariv
was hypothetical, and did not require respondents to take into
account the enormous political and military repercussions such a
step would have.
	   If there were no price to be paid, 65 percent of the respondents
said they would support expelling the Palestinians. Twenty-six
percent were opposed, and 9 percent did not express an opinion.
	   A political party advocating expulsion of Palestinians from the
West Bank and Gaza won only two seats in Israel's 120-seat
parliament in the 1996 general election.
	   Maariv said respondents to the poll, conducted by Gallup, were
550 adults. It did not say whether the respondents included
Israel's minority Arab citizens, or describe the polling method.
	   The margin of error was 4.5 percentage points, it said.
	   Responding to another question, 54 percent believed that the
Arabs would not give up their dream of destroying the state of
Israel, but 34 percent said Arabs are interested in making peace
with Israel.
	   A large majority, 71 percent, expected Israel to benefit
economically if it signs peace agreements with all the Arab
nations.

Jewish settler put under house arrest in Palestinian shooting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG LANGLOIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Jerusalem court on Sunday ordered a Jewish
settler suspected in the fatal shooting of a Palestinian teen-ager
put under effective house arrest pending a decision on any formal
charges, army radio said.
	   Palestinians bitterly protested the decision and called
Thursday's shooting an unprovoked attack. Settlers defended the
suspect's action and demanded his release.
	   The settler _ Avshalom Ladani, 35, of the Dolev settlement in
the West Bank near the town of Ramallah _ was to stay in hotel
where his family would be allowed to join him. The two-day Jewish
New Year's holiday begins at sundown on Sunday.
	   The slain Palestinian youth, 17-year-old Iyad Kabasma, was
walking home from school with other teen-agers when the shooting
occurred. Another youth was wounded as well.
	   The teen-agers denied they had been throwing rocks.
	   Ladani told police he fired in the air after his car was stoned,
and that he was not aware anyone had been hit. He turned himself in
several hours after the shooting.
	   ``We are not happy when people are killed,'' said settler leader
Aharon Dompa. ``But everyone who creates a dangerous situation and
tries to kill Jews _ he is putting himself in danger.''
	   Palestinian official Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, told army radio said the handling of the case
showed the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was
giving a green light to settlers who attacked Palestinians.

Military court opens trial of 13 militants accused of bombings

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The trial of 13 Muslim militants suspected
in a series of bombings earlier this year opened Sunday in a
military court.
	   The defendants _ including three being tried in absentia _ also
are accused of attacks on the cars of former government officials
and intelligence officers.
	   The bombs caused material damage but no casualties.
	   The prosecution charged that the 13 men were members of a
previously unknown militant group called Reform and Challenge.
	   In a charge sheet read at the two-hour hearing, the prosecution
said the group illegally produced explosives and used them in
``terrorist attacks'' in the capital Amman.
	   The suspects, who attended the hearing at Amman's heavily
guarded State Security Court, did not enter their pleas because
their defense lawyers requested time to review the cases.
	   Yousef Faouri, an army colonel who heads a three-judge panel,
adjourned the hearing until Wednesday.
	   Last March and April, a series of bombs went off at a number of
sites, including an Amman hotel and a private high school teaching
an American curriculum. The cars of a former intelligence chief and
former justice minister also were hit.
	   Police said the group confessed to carrying out the attacks.

Hurricane Georges becomes `extremely dangerous' category 4 storm
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: At 8 a.m. (1200 GMT), Georges was located at 16.1 north
latitude and 57.8 west longitude, about 245 miles (390 kilometers)
east of Guadeloupe &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) _ Rough surf and gathering clouds were
the first signs of trouble at dawn Sunday for people in the eastern
Caribbean as Hurricane Georges bore down on the islands with 150
mph (240 kmh) winds.
	   ``For the third time in four years we are facing a major
hurricane,'' Antigua Prime Minister Lester Bird said in a radio
address to the island nation. Antigua was hit by Luis in 1995 and
Bertha in 1996.
	   The National Hurricane Center in Miami warned that Georges was
``an extremely dangerous category 4 hurricane.''
	   The eye of Georges, with sustained winds of 150 mph (240 kmh)
was expected to pass over the small, eastern Caribbean islands
later Sunday before moving on to threaten the U.S. and British
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Monday.
	   Georges strengthened Saturday to a category 4 hurricane on the
Saffir-Simpson scale _ comparable to Hurricane Andrew, which
devastated parts of southern Florida in 1992, or Hurricane Hugo,
which caused severe damage in the Caribbean in 1989.
	   Hurricane warnings were extended Sunday morning as far west as
Puerto Rico, leaving all of the eastern Caribbean north of Dominica
under a warning.
	   In the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, where 3.8 million
residents waited in the path of the storm, many people began
covering windows with plywood and stocking up on supplies Saturday
even though Georges wasn't expected to arrive until Monday morning.
	   ``From the path I've seen on the news, it's coming on strong and
could really affect us,'' said San Juan resident Heriberto Cruz,
who was shopping Saturday for batteries, water and other
necessities.
	   On St. Croix, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, residents who remember
when Hurricane Hugo damaged 95 percent of the island's homes in
1989 rushed to supermarkets and waited in long lines at gas
stations.
	   ``I am totally bewildered,'' said Josiah Mercury as she
hurriedly picked up crackers and bottled water at a supermarket.
``The most I can do is prepare and take the warning seriously.''
	   Residents of the small eastern Caribbean islands, the first ones
expected to be hit Sunday, also took the hurricane seriously,
buying extra supplies and hauling boats out of the water.
	   The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency sent early response
teams to the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico before the storm.

More crosses placed near Auschwitz despite church opposition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSWIECIM, Poland (AP) _ Conservative Catholics erected four more
wooden crosses Sunday next to the former Nazi death camp at
Auschwitz despite calls by church and government officials for them
to stop.
	   The new, four-meter (13-foot) tall crosses were set up by Poles
from Chicago and New York and a group from Warsaw, bringing the
total to about 200 of various sizes, the Polish PAP news agency
reported.
	   Conservative Catholics began erecting the crosses in recent
months to protest a call from Jewish groups to remove an
eight-meter (26-foot) cross outside the former Nazi death camp.
	   The cross, used in a 1979 Mass celebrated by Pope John Paul II
near Auschwitz, marks the site where 152 Poles were shot to death
by the Nazis in 1941.
	   But Jewish groups say the large cross, which can be seen from
inside Auschwitz, disturbs the memory of the more than 1 million
Jews killed there.
	   Polish bishops and Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek's government
called in late August for conservative Catholics to stop putting up
more crosses while the question of who controls the property is
sorted out.

Estrada, employees hope for compromise to avert airline closure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada and
Philippine Airline employees urged the airline's management and
unions Sunday to reach a compromise to prevent the scheduled
closure of Asia's oldest commercial airline.
	   About 100 flight attendants, ground personnel and officials of
the flag carrier held a mass at a PAL gymnasium to pray for the
airline, many hugging each other in tears.
	   ``We're praying for a miracle,'' said Dennis Salonga, who has
worked for PAL for 16 years. He said he hoped airline officials
would reconsider a decision to close PAL on Wednesday after 57
years of service.
	   The cash-strapped airline announced on Thursday a decision to
close after leaders of its largest union rejected a management
offer of 20 percent of the company's stock and three seats on its
board for its employees in exchange for a 10-year suspension of
their collective bargaining agreement.
	   PAL has been devastated by a series of strikes and by Asia's
currency crisis, which hit just as the airline was launching an
ambitious dlrs 4 billion expansion and refleeting plan.
	   It owes dlrs 2.1 billion to creditors, who reportedly are
insisting on guarantees of labor harmony before they approve a
restructuring plan.
	   Officials of all three of its unions say the 10-year suspension
of their collective bargaining agreements is unacceptable.
	   An aide said Estrada was continuing efforts Sunday to avoid
PAL's closure despite the failure of his initial talks with labor
and management.
	   Estrada acknowledged that hope is dwindling after PAL chairman
and chief stockholder Lucio Tan declined to meet with him Friday.
On Friday, PAL's largest union also sent Estrada a letter refusing
to hold a referendum among its members on whether to accept the
rescue plan offered by PAL officials.
	   Estrada has warned that PAL's closure would hurt millions of
Filipinos. Tourism officials also warned that the closure could
severely hurt the country's tourism industry.
	   ``I am appealing to the union to think not only of themselves
but of the whole country as well,'' Estrada said.
	   The country has four smaller airlines, all of which have
recently failed safety audits. One, Air Philippines, was grounded
by regulators on Friday; another, Grand Air, canceled its flights
Friday after failing to pay insurance and fuel bills, employees
said.
	   Estrada has said the government cannot afford to take over the
airline.

Military court opens trial of 13 militants accused of bombings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo AMM-101 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The trial of 13 Muslim militants suspected
in a series of bombings earlier this year opened Sunday in a
military court.
	   The defendants _ including three being tried in absentia _ also
are accused of attacks on the cars of former government officials
and intelligence officers.
	   The bombs caused material damage but no casualties.
	   The prosecution charged that the 13 men were members of a
previously unknown militant group called Reform and Challenge.
	   In a charge sheet read at the two-hour hearing, the prosecution
said the group illegally produced explosives and used them in
``terrorist attacks'' in the capital Amman.
	   The suspects, who attended the hearing at Amman's heavily
guarded State Security Court, did not enter their pleas because
their defense lawyers requested time to review the cases.
	   Yousef Faouri, an army colonel who heads a three-judge panel,
adjourned the hearing until Wednesday.
	   Last March and April, a series of bombs went off at a number of
sites, including an Amman hotel and a private high school teaching
an American curriculum. The cars of a former intelligence chief and
former justice minister also were hit.
	   Police said the group confessed to carrying out the attacks.

	   GENEVA, Switzerland (AP) _ World No. 1 Martina Hingis defeated
Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario on Sunday to give Switzerland a 2-1 lead
over Spain in the Fed Cup world group final.
	   Hingis dominated Sanchez-Vicario 7-6 (7-5) 6-3, increasing her
record over the Spaniard to seven consective wins, her winning
streak dating back to almost two and half years.
	   Though Sanchez-Vicario displayed her famous resolution and grit,
fighting for every single point, in the end the Swiss teenager was
simply too strong.
	   In the later reverse singles match, Conchita Martinez took on
ninth-ranked Patty Schnyder, winner of five title this season.
	   After that, the two veteran Spaniards were scheduled to face the
two Swiss teenagers in doubles.

Former prime minister calls for release of aide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALMATY, Kazakstan (AP) _ Former Prime Minister Akezhan
Kazhegeldin on Sunday demanded the immediate release of an adviser
who was detained while attempting to deliver documents to President
Nursultan Nazarbayev.
	   Mikhail Vasilienko was detained on Friday by men ``wearing
police uniforms'' in the new Kazak capital Astana, Kazhegeldin said
in a statement to the press.
	   He was on his way from Astana's airport to deliver documents to
Nazarbayev, the parliament and government officials. The documents
contained proposed amendments to the constitution and the rules for
elections, the statement said.
	   ``This new act carried out by the authorities is in the same
line as the recent severe beating of my former press secretary
Amirshan Kozanov,'' who was attacked in August and had to be
hospitalized, Kazhegeldin said.
	   Vasilienko called Kazhegeldin several hours after he was
detained, and said he was being held in the regional Department of
Internal Affairs, the statement said. Local authorities have denied
Vasilienko was under arrest.
	   Kazhegeldin, who resigned last October for health reasons, is
widely believed to be preparing to run for the presidency in the
next elections in 2000.

Jarrett breaks through for hurdles win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kenyan woman's 10,000 triumph, men's jump,
women's high jump &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ English hurdler Tony Jarrett
finally broke through for a major gold medal Sunday but was forced
to hold up his celebrations for several agonizing seconds.
	   Jarrett, the perennial bridesmaid behind missing world record
holder Colin Jackson, edged out Trindad's Steve Brown in an ugly
110-meter hurdles final at the Commonwealth Games.
	   Brown thought he had won and Jarrett had no idea. The
Englishman's big-time experience showed at the finish as his dip
stopped the clock at 13.47 seconds, .01 faster than Brown.
	   ``I'm just glad I've got a gold medal around my neck,'' said
Jarrett. ``After the finish I thought I had a chance but I told
myself, `Don't jump up and down just yet.' I did that once at the
Olympic Games when I thought I had a bronze but I was only
fourth.''
	   Jarrett was referring to the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, one of
many near misses at the top level.
	   He was second in the 1990 and 1994 Commonwealth Games, has two
seconds and a third from the past three world championships, and a
second and a third from the European titles, and fell in the
quarterfinals of the 1996 Olympics.
	   With Jackson deciding to run for money in Tokyo instead of
medals in Malaysia, Jarrett was the hot favorite.
	   He shot out of the start while everyone else was preparing for
the gun, and the nerve-wracking false start meant he decided to run
cautiously when the race finally got under way.
	   ``In finals if I win it I don't mind if I run 14 flat,'' Jarrett
said of the pedestrian time.
	   Brown admitted he paid too much attention to Jarrett.
	   ``I'd be lying if I said I didn't keep an eye on him,'' said
Brown. ``I could sense where he was, so I could have concentrated a
little bit more on what I was trying to do.''
	   While Jarrett celebrated his gold, Kenya's Ester Wanjiru
maintained her country's amazing record on the track by winning the
10,000 meters.
	   Wanjiru overtook Australia's Kylie Risk with 300 meters to go to
cross the line in 33 minutes 40.13 seconds. Risk took silver and
fellow Australian Clair Fearnley the bronze but Wanjiru added her
gold to the Kenyan triumphs in the men's 800, 5,000, 10,000 meters
and 3,000 steeplechase.
	   South Africa gained golds in the men's pole vault and women's
high jump.
	   Botha, ranked second at home behind Okkert Brits, was well off
his best of 5.91 meters, winning with 5.60. He had the gold secured
at that height but took the bar up to 5.70 and snapped his pole on
his first attempt.
	   ``It didn't really affect me,'' said Botha, who was given
another chance but missed all three jumps. ``It's not a very good
height but it was hard because no one was pushing me.''
	   Hestrie Storbeck cleared 1.91 meters to win the high jump ahead
of England's Joanne Jennings, who made the same height but lost in
a jump off which took place because both had the same number of
failures. Storbeck went clear at 1.89 again but Jennings failed.
Alison Inverarity of Australia took the bronze with 1.88.
	   The men's long jump also had a tie for first place with Peter
Burge and fellow Australian Jai Taurima both leaping 8.22 meters.
Burge was awarded the gold because of a better next best jump but
Taurima missed the last three rounds because of a groin injury.
	   New Zealand's world champion discus thrower Beatrice Faumuina
won the gold medal by reaching 65.96 meters with her fifth attempt.
She was behind Australian silver medalist Lisa Marie Vizaniari
after three but took the lead with 62.84 on the fourth.
	   ``I had a few niggles and I was a bit sore,'' said Faumuina.
``I'm just glad it's over.''
	   Faumuina said she was happy to see the end of a season dogged by
tiredness, injury and non-stop travel.
	   England's Tony Whiteman won his 1,500-meter semifinal in 3
minutes, 45.18 seconds to qualify fastest for Monday's final.
Kenyan Laban Rotich won heat 2 in 3:46.71.
	   In Sunday morning's marathons, Heather Turland, a 38-year-old
mother of four who only started running in her early 30s, led an
Australian 1-2 in the women's event.
	   After finishing in 2 hours, 41 minutes, 24 seconds, she was
hugged by one of her sons at the finish line before the whole
family joined in the celebrations.
	   Thabiso Moqhali pulled away from the field four miles (6.4
kilometers) from home in the men's race to win Lesotho's first
Commonwealth Games gold. He finished in 2 hours, 19 minutes, 15
seconds.
	   ``I am going to celebrate by dancing. I like dancing,'' said
Moqhali.

German auto racer killed at Nuerburgring track
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NUERBURGRING, Germany (AP) _ One week before the final Formula
One event of the season to be held there, a German amateur driver
was killed Saturday at the Nuerburgring track.
	   Wolfgang Scholz, manager of an insurance company in Hannover,
died on the way to the hospital after his Volkswagen Golf rammed
into a wall at the track's North Loop during a local German race.
	   Onlookers said Scholz was traveling at 150 kph (90 mph) when his
auto struck the wall after a collision with another auto. The
second driver wasn't injured.
	   The cause for the German driver losing control of his vehicle
wasn't immediately known.

Australia takes two golds in stadium cycling, New Zealand wins one
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Woozy from dehydration, Australian
cyclist Alayna Burns struggled to stay on the track but prevailed
for the gold Sunday in the women's 24-kilometer points race at the
Commonwealth Games.
	   Australia's four-man cycling team also won a gold, putting the
pressure on England from the outset to prevail in the 4-kilometer
team pursuit.
	   New Zealand prevented an Australian gold sweep at the track when
Glen Thomson won the men's 40-kilometer point race, with a score of
35. England's Robert Hayles was second with 27 points, and another
New Zealander, Greg Henderson, was third with 24.
	   Burns, who said she drank water and other liquids all day,
started to fade about halfway through the race in the nighttime
tropical heat.
	   ``I started getting all wonky and I couldn't see properly,''
said an exhausted Burns after the race. ``The track was sort of
moving. It was like double vision.''
	   She said that each time she went to the front of the pack, she
had trouble keeping a straight line and some of the cyclists behind
her yelled: ``What are you doing?''
	   Still, Burns' start was so strong that she ended with 34 points,
three more than silver medalist Sarah Ulmer of New Zealand. Annie
Gariepy of Canada was third.
	   Burns said she had suffered similiar cases of dehydration for
which she was hospitalized, but was determined to preserve her lead
and finish the race in a Kuala Lumpur velodrome.
	   ``I couldn't even celebrate or put my arms in the air, and do
things that people who win normally do,'' she said.
	   In the men's team pursuit, the Australian team of Michael
Rogers, Brad McGee, Timothy Lyons and Brett Lancaster raced fast in
low gear and opened up an early time lead over the English.
	   Australia finished in 4 minutes, 13.405 seconds, England took
the silver in 4:14.298 and New Zealand won the bronze with a time
of 4:17.933.
	   ``It was awesome,'' said a euphoric Lancaster.

Polls show German race too close to call
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new Kohl quote &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ With polls showing Germany's two main parties
running virtually even a week before the national vote, Chancellor
Helmut Kohl again ruled out a post-election ``grand coalition''
between the two, while his rival Gerhard Schroeder left the door
open.
	   The respected, independent Emnid polling institute said it
appeared neither Kohl's conservative Christian Democrats nor
Schroeder's left-leaning Social Democrats would end up far enough
ahead to be able to form a workable government with the small
parties.
	   That makes a ``grand coalition'' of the two big parties _
something not seen on the federal level since 1969 _ more and more
likely, the institute said.
	   But Kohl, who has said he would step down as party leader rather
than join a coalition with the Social Democrats, insisted it
wouldn't come to that.
	   ``I don't believe that the voters will deliver a result that
will end up forcing us into a grand coalition,'' he said in an
interview to appear in Monday's Die Welt newspaper.
	   Schroeder, however, told this week's Der Spiegel newsmagazine he
believed Kohl's party would not reject a partnership out of hand.
If election results make that the only available option, he said,
``one just has to do it.''
	   Schroeder, campaigning as a fresh face for Germany after 16
years of Kohl as chancellor, has seen his early strong lead
evaporate as the Sept. 27 election nears.
	   Several polls released over the weekend showed Kohl, seeking an
unprecedented fifth term, pulling to within about two percentage
points.
	   Polling experts said the race was now too close to call, since
the difference between the two was within the margin of error of
plus or minus three percentage points.
	   The best news for Schroeder came from a Forsa poll for Pro
Sieben television, released Saturday night, which showed the Social
Democrats leading Kohl's conservative union 42 percent to 38
percent.
	   But 37 percent of the 1,507 eligible voters surveyed said they
were still undecided.
	   Kohl expressed confidence that many of the undecided would go
his way. The Social Democrats got an early start, he told Welt am
Sonntag newspaper, but now ``the air is going out'' of their
campaign.
	   Schroeder told Der Spiegel he remained optimistic, but sounded a
cautious note as well. If the Social Democrats don't win, he said,
``the world won't end.''

Iranian drivers released by Taliban say they were tortured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Five Iranians released by Afghanistan's
Taliban militia returned to Tehran on Sunday, and several said they
were tortured in captivity, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported, a charge likely to further stoke tensions between
the neighboring countries.
	   Iran says the Taliban militia is holding at least 50 more
Iranians _ most, drivers delivering food, medicine and other
humanitarian goods to needy Afghans.
	   The Taliban, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan, says the
Iranians were carrying weapons to its opponents in the north of the
country. Earlier this month, the Taliban released another five
Iranian drivers as a goodwill gesture.
	   Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri said Sunday that the
Taliban were a threat to Islam and vowed that Iran would take
action it deemed necessary for its ``national security interests.''
	   State-run television also quoted Nateq-Nouri, a hard-liner, as
saying Iran ``will not cave in to the pressure exerted by any
powers.''
	   The United States and other Western countries have urged Iran to
exercise caution in dealing with the Taliban.
	   Tensions between the two sides has risen sharply since the
Taliban admitted that its militiamen killed eight Iranian diplomats
and a journalist after capturing the northern city of
Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   The Taliban returned seven of the nine bodies to Tehran last
week.
	   Iran has massed tens of thousands of troops on its border with
Afghanistan in response. Taliban leaders say they have rushed
troops to the frontier region to repulse any Iranian attack.

Da Costa runs fastest marathon in history at Berlin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: CHANGES to world best, instead of world record throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By ROY KAMMERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa completed the fastest
marathon in history Sunday, snapping a 10-year-old mark by running
through the heart of Berlin in two hours, six minutes and 5
seconds.
	   The 28-year-old bettered the old world best held by Ethiopia's
Belayneh Densimo by 45 seconds while running at one of the world's
fastest courses on a cool sunny and windless morning.
	   Densimo had recorded a 2:06.50 on April 17, 1988 in Rotterdam,
The Netherlands.
	   ``I wanted to run under 2:08, but when I saw how good the
conditions were I just went for it,'' said da Costa.
	   Da Costa broke to the front of the pack at the halfway point,
then held off Josephat Kiiprono. The Kenyan also covered the 42.2
kilometers (26 miles) through a a relatively flat route in a fast
time of 2:07.26.
	   Belgium's Marleen Renders captured the women's race in 2:25.22
for the third best time in the history of the Berlin Marathon.
	   The Berlin event has grown in size in recent years and with
28,000 runners at the start is now the third largest city marathon
behind London and New York.
	   Around 4,000 more participants lined up than last year for the
event, watched by an estimated one million spectators.
	   ``We're not sure why there has been such an increase this year,
but its a welcome surprise,'' said Stephane Franke, coordinator for
the athletes.
	   Berlin has attracted some of the world's top distance runners
because of its reputation for fast times. Kenya's Sammy Lelei had
clocked the second fastest mark in history of 2:07.02 at the event
three years ago.
	   Da Costa, who stems from the town of Descoberto 200 kilometer
(120 miles) north of Rio de Janiero, will earn dlrs 200,000 for the
win.
	   But the Brazilian, who has been running since he was 17, is now
expected to command up to dlrs 250,000 in appearance money at
future marathons after his world best.
	   ``This will make him a millionaire,'' said Luis Posso, Da
Costa's manager.
	   Da Costa broke the tape at the posh downtwon shopping district
of Ku'damn, followed by three Kenyans coached by Gabriele Rosa,
whose athletes have captured a dozen top marathons in the past year
including Boston.
	   Behind Kirpono, Samson Kandie finished in 2:09.11, while Reuben
Chebutich was fourth in 2:10.39.
	   In the women's race, Kenya's Susann Chepkemei was second in
2:28.18 and a three-time winner of the event, Poland's Renata
Kokowska, followed in 2:31.53.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two British charity workers have been released
after being held in breakaway Chechnya for 14 months, British
officials said Sunday.
	   Camilla Carr and John James were kidnapped in July 1997 while on
a charitable mission in Chechnya for a Quaker relief organization.
	   The Foreign Office in London confirmed that the two Britons have
been released and ``are understood to be in good health.''
	   Their release ``shows the benefits of co-operation between our
government and the Russian government,'' said the spokesman,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.

Jewish settler put under house arrest in Palestinian shooting

 &UR; By GREG LANGLOIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Jerusalem court on Sunday ordered a Jewish
settler suspected in the fatal shooting of a Palestinian teen-ager
put under effective house arrest pending a decision on any formal
charges.
	   Palestinians bitterly protested the decision and called
Thursday's shooting an unprovoked attack. Settlers defended the
suspect's action and demanded his release.
	   The settler _ Avshalom Ladani, 35, of the Dolev settlement in
the West Bank near the town of Ramallah _ was to stay in a
Jerusalem hostel, where his family would be allowed to join him,
for at least a week.
	   The two-day Jewish New Year's holiday begins at sundown on
Sunday.
	   Ladani posted 5,000 shekels (dlrs 1,350) bond and was ordered
not to discuss the case with anyone else involved in it, on either
side.
	   The slain Palestinian youth, 17-year-old Iyad Kabasma, was
walking home from school with other teen-agers when the shooting
occurred. Another youth was wounded as well.
	   The teen-agers denied they had been throwing rocks.
	   Ladani told police he fired in the air after his car was stoned,
and that he was not aware anyone had been hit. He turned himself in
several hours after the shooting.
	   Israeli radios said tests found that the bullet that killed
Kabasma had come from Ladani's hand gun.
	   ``We are not happy when people are killed,'' said settler leader
Aharon Domb. ``But everyone who creates a dangerous situation and
tries to kill Jews _ he is putting himself in danger.''
	   Palestinian official Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, told army radio said the handling of the case
showed the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was
giving a green light to settlers who attacked Palestinians.

Canada's Stirton wins all-around rhythmic gymnastics gold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Canada's Erika-Leigh Stirton, the
only competitor to gain scores above 9.5 for all four specialties,
won the all-around gold medal Sunday in Commonwealth Games rhythmic
gymnastics.
	   Stirton received a total of 38.207 points _ 9.541 for the rope
competition, 9.525 for the hoop, 9.558 for the clubs and 9.583 for
the ribbon.
	   Australians won the silver and bronze. Leigh Marning had a total
of 37.865, including one score above 9.5 _ a 9.516 for the ribbon.
Shaneez Johnston had 37.673, and also had her best score for the
ribbon _ 9.483.
	   Thye Chee Kiat, heroine of Malaysia's team gold medal triumph
Saturday, finished fourth with 37.239, a result that led to strong
booing for the judges at the end of the competition.
	   Malaysia edged defending champion Canada for the team title, but
in that competition too Stirton, an 18-year-old high school
student, had outscored Thye.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A Philippine passenger ferry which
sank with 454 people on board was carrying heavy cargo that may
have shifted in strong waves, causing the ship to tilt and then
sink, the chief investigator said Sunday.
	   Seventeen more people were rescued Sunday after spending more
than a day in chilly, storm-whipped waters, bringing the number of
survivors from the Princess of the Orient to at least 311,
officials said. At least 39 people were dead.
	   Maritime officials said several other ships had also reported
difficulties Friday night in tropical storm Vicki, including some
injured passengers. But they said the Princess of the Orient, one
of the Philippines' largest inter-island ferries, should have been
able to withstand much worse weather.
	   Survivors said the ship began tilting to the left in heavy waves
and sank in less than an hour.
	   Chief accident investigator Arnie Santiago said the ship was
carrying 15 vehicles and 66 containers of truck parts and other
heavy materials which may not have been properly secured.
	   ``The way the ship tilted indicates that the cargo moved,'' he
told The Associated Press.
	   He said the sinking was unusually rapid, and some of the ship's
water seals may have been damaged by an onboard fire in 1997. After
the fire the 24-year-old ship was repaired at a Singapore dry dock.
	   Carlos Go, chief executive officer of Sulpicio Lines, the ship's
owner, insisted it was seaworthy despite the fire.
	   Sulpicio Lines also owned the Dona Paz, a ferry which collided
with a tanker in 1987, killing 4,341 in the world's worst peacetime
shipping disaster. A year later, 250 people died in the sinking of
another ship owned by the company, the Dona Marilyn.
	   Ramon Revilla Jr., governor of Cavite province, said fishermen
discovered 11 survivors Sunday morning at various places along the
Cavite coast, which faces the area where the Princess of the Orient
sank near the mouth of Manila Bay. Many were covered with oil from
the ship.
	   Separately, fishermen recovered 11 bodies floating near an
island resort off the coast, many still wrapped in life jackets, he
said.
	   For a second day Sunday, anguished relatives waited at a pier in
Manila for the return of rescue ships.
	   Many burst into tears as a navy patrol craft arrived with 13
bodies, including two children, bloated from decomposition and
covered with flies.
	   ``I hope my sister isn't one of them,'' sighed Praxedes Coronas,
54, as she stared at the pile of bodies. ``We've been sleepless
since yesterday, not being able to confirm whether she's dead or
alive.''
	   Lydia Maranan also waited for word of her sister, who was
traveling to Cebu city to take tuition money to Lydia's son so he
could take a high school exam.
	   ``It's painful,'' she said, pounding her chest. ``But we'll wait
until she turns up. We want to take her home.''
	   The Princess of the Orient left Manila at about 8 p.m. Friday
for Cebu, about a day's journey to the south.
	   A few hours later it reported it was listing near Fortune island
off Batangas province, about 60 kilometers (40 miles) south of
Manila, and then lost radio contact.
	   The company said there were 352 passengers and 102 crew aboard
the ship, revising earlier figures to account for people not listed
in the manifest, the coast guard said. No foreigners were reported
on board.

Primakov meets with business and economic leaders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with six new grafs of Primakov comments, calls for
restoration of confidence in leadership. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov told business and
banking leaders Sunday that restoring global confidence in Russia
and its leadership was a priority goal of his government.
	   Primakov told a meeting of the Russian Union of Industrialists
and Entrepreneurs that the government was already working on a plan
to lead the country out of its economic crisis.
	   ``Restoration of confidence in the country's leadership as well
as confidence in Russia throughout the world is a priority task of
the new Russian government,'' Primakov said, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The economy has been at a near-standstill after the events of
the past month, during which the nation's currency has been
devalued, the country has defaulted on its loans and has changed
governments.
	   Primakov, who was confirmed by parliament on Sept. 11, said his
government was working on reforms ``that instead of harming people,
would make them better off.''
	   He admitted that the government does not have enough cash to
immediately tackle all of the country's economic problems, but that
priority will be given to the payment of pensions and back wages.
	   The new prime minister said that even though he has not yet
named his entire Cabinet, the government has been working for the
past six days on a recovery plan.
	   ``Active work on this program is underway,'' he told the leaders
of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs.
	   Primakov has sought to assure foreign investors that Moscow will
meet its obligations. At the same time, he urged western lenders to
fulfill their promises of aid to Russia.
	   The International Monetary Fund, which put together a dlrs 22.6
billion aid package to Russia this summer, has said the next
infusion of money would be postponed until the government resumes
market reforms.
	   The chief of Russia's Auditing Chamber charged that billions of
dollars of Western loans were either misused or stolen, BBC
television reported Sunday.
	   Venyuamin Sokolov, chief auditor of parliament's Auditing
Chamber, said he warned the IMF not to extend any more loans to
Russia until efficient controls are in place, the BBC report said.
	   Russia's top financial officials have rejected the allegations
of misuse of foreign aid as groundless.
	   Although the new government's economic program is still being
worked out, according to officials' statements so far, the program
will include the imposition of some Soviet-style controls over the
economy.
	   Primakov told the industrialists that reforms will not succeed
without their support. ``The plan will be incomplete without
proposals from industrialists and employers,'' Primakov said.
	   Part of the economic recovery plan is expected to involve the
printing of billions of new rubles, which almost certainly will
contribute to inflation. Consumer prices have already begun to soar
after being kept under control for more than a year.
	   Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party, said at at its
annual plenum on Saturday that his supporters would demand that the
new government support Russian industry and set an official minimum
standard of living.
	   The Communists concentrated at their plenum on fine-tuning plans
for a national day of protest scheduled for Oct. 7.
	   According to the Interfax news agency, a discussion of the day
of protest was on Primakov's agenda for the meeting with
industrialists.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Jerusalem court on Sunday ordered a Jewish
settler suspected in the fatal shooting of a Palestinian teen-ager
put under effective house arrest pending a decision on any formal
charges.
	   Palestinians bitterly protested the decision and called
Thursday's shooting an unprovoked attack. Settlers defended the
suspect's action and demanded his release.
	   The settler _ Avshalom Ladani, 35, of the Dolev settlement in
the West Bank near the town of Ramallah _ was to stay in a
Jerusalem hostel, where his family would be allowed to join him,
for at least a week.
	   The two-day Jewish New Year's holiday begins at sundown on
Sunday.
	   Ladani posted 5,000 shekels (dlrs 1,350) bond and was ordered
not to discuss the case.
	   The slain Palestinian youth, 17-year-old Iyad Kabasma, was
walking home from school with other teen-agers when the shooting
occurred. Another youth was wounded as well.
	   The teen-agers denied they had been throwing rocks.
	   Ladani told police he fired in the air after his car was stoned,
and that he was not aware anyone had been hit. He turned himself in
several hours after the shooting.
	   Israeli radio said tests found that the bullet that killed
Kabasma had come from Ladani's gun.
	   ``We are not happy when people are killed,'' said settler leader
Aharon Domb. ``But everyone who creates a dangerous situation and
tries to kill Jews _ he is putting himself in danger.''
	   Palestinian official Ahmed Tibi, an adviser to Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, told army radio said the handling of the case
showed the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was
giving a green light to settlers who attacked Palestinians.

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Bahrain International Bank E.C. announced
Sunday that it sold Sarah Michaels Inc., a bath products company in
the United States, in a deal worth dlrs 185 million.
	   Sara Michaels, based in Stoughton, Massachusetts, was sold to
Dial Corp., a leading American consumer products company, the bank
said in a statement.
	   BIB had acquired Sarah Michaels in May last year.
	   Sarah Michaels' sales revenue has grown from less than dlrs 10
million in 1991 to dlrs 72 million last year. The company
distributes its bath products mainly through American supermarket
chains.
	   Established in 1982, BIB is an offshore investment bank listed
on the Bahrain Stock Exchange. It specializes in taking majority
holdings in companies with growth potential. In 1996, the bank
bought Carrols Corp., the world's largest Burger King franchisee.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The Kuwait-based United Arab Shipping Co. said
Sunday it will take delivery of the last of its 10 new container
ships before the end of the year.
	   The vessel Deira is scheduled to be launched Monday in Kawaski,
Japan, a company statement said. Two more, Nowf and Al-Mutanabi,
will be delivered in the following two months, it said.
	   UASC signed a dlrs 660 million deal with a Japanese consortium
for the ships. They will raise its fleet to 56 ships, allowing UASC
to increase transport between Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
	   The company is owned by the governments of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia,
Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan is seeking joint travel packages
with Saudi Arabia to attract more religious tourism to Muslim holy
shrines in the two countries, the state-run Petra news agency
reported on Sunday.
	   It said Majdi Sabri, a deputy director-general of Royal
Jordanian, the national carrier, left for Saudi Arabia to explore a
doubling of the six weekly flights to the Gulf state.
	   Sabri also will discuss ``consolidating cooperation, especially
in joint advertisement of religious tourism to the area,'' Petra
added.
	   Jordan _ which boasts biblical and historic sites, including
several holy to Shiite Muslims _ wants to increase tourism to earn
foreign exchange. Saudi Arabia is home to Islam's two holiest
sites, Mecca and Medina.
	   Last year, Jordan's tourism revenues were estimated at dlrs 600
million. But Jordan says the figure will more than double in the
next century because of joint tourism packages with neighboring
Israel, Egypt and the Palestinians.
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A conference on ways to fight unemployment
opened in Amman on Sunday with calls for regulating the flow of
foreign labor and encouraging investment.
	   Crown Prince Hassan told the opening session of the three-day
conference that ``adequate solutions'' were needed to cure
unemployment, which has risen to 14.4 percent of the 950,000-strong
labor force.
	   Saleh Tarawneh, secretary-general of the Labor Ministry, said
that more than half of the 300,000 foreign workers have no work
permits. Most are Egyptians.
	   Tarawneh cited a labor ministry study in 1997 which showed that
unemployment was highest among Jordanians under 30 and among women.
	   The government is trying to replace foreign workers with
Jordanians. But it complains that Jordanians are not eager to take
jobs in construction and agriculture, which rely heavily on foreign
labor.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon and Kuwait have signed a trade
agreement that would eliminate customs duties on industrial goods
over a four-year period, newspapers reported Sunday.
	   The agreement was signed here Saturday by Lebanese Economy and
Trade Minister Yassin Jaber and Abdul-Aziz al-Dakheel, Kuwait's
minister of commerce and industry.
	   Customs duties on specific goods produced by the two countries
will be eliminated as of Jan. 1, 1999, while tariffs on other
commodities will be lowed by 25 percent a year over the next four
years.
	   ``We hope that this will be an important step in boosting Arab
economic integration,'' Jaber was quoted by Ad-Diyar daily as
saying.
 &UR; ___
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran was the world's largest producer of
dates last year with output of 876,000 tons of date, or about 21
percent of the world total, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
	   It quoted Masood Fazel, managing director of Arg Jadid free
trade zone, as saying that 400 types of dates are obtained from
palms in Iran.
	   Fazel said that about 5,200 tons of dates were exported in the
March-June quarter.
 &UR; ___
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran this year will produce 220,000 vehicles
of different kinds, Akbar Torkan, head of the Industrial
Development and Renovation Organization said Sunday.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Torkan as
saying this year's total would be 60,000 vehicles higher than last
year.
	   He said the country's annual car production capacity was
expected to reach 500,000 vehicles in the next three years.
 &UR; ___
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syria has signed a dlrs 720,000 contract
with Iraq to export 1,000 tons of detergent, the Tishrin daily
reported Sunday.
	   The contract _ signed with Syria's Sar chemical company _ falls
within the framework of the U.N. oil-for-food program, which allows
Iraq to sell limited quantities of oil to buy necessities. The
program is an exception from trade sanctions imposed after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The deal, which is subject to U.N. approval, is that latest in a
series of moves indicating a warming of relations between the two
countries after an 18-year gap.
	   Earlier this month, Syria reopened its trade center in the Iraqi
capital Baghdad, and Farouk al-Obeidi, a top official in Iraq's
Trade Ministry was to open an Iraqi trade center here later Sunday.

Hingis beats Sanchez-Vicario to give Switzerland 2-1 over Spain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS, ADDS detail, background &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA, Switzerland (AP) _ World No. 1 Martina Hingis continued
her enduring domination of Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario on Sunday to
give Switzerland a 2-1 lead over Spain in the Fed Cup world group
final.
	   Hingis dispatched Sanchez-Vicario 7-6 (7-5) 6-3, increasing her
record over the Spaniard to seven consective wins.
Sanchez-Vicario's last win over the Swiss teenager dates back two
and a half years ago, when Hingis was only 15.
	   Though Sanchez-Vicario displayed her famous resolution and grit,
fighting for every single point, in the end the Swiss teenager was
simply too strong.
	   Lifted by the support of 12,000 hysterical spectators, Hingis
opened play scoring seven consecutive points before Sanchez-Vicario
could comeback with the next four. While the Spaniard was able to
hold serve, it was only after being pushed to deuce twice.
	   Hingis monopolized the next nine points to break Sanchez-Vicario
and jump to a 3-1 lead.
	   Sanchez-Vicario broke back but the remainder of the set was a
battle for the 26-year-old. The Spanish player barely saved a set
point at 5-4, and was pushed to deuce three times.
	   A gutsy effort in the tie-break proved insufficient.
	   Hingis opened the second set breaking Sanchez-Vicario's serve,
then held her own to go up 2-0.
	   A valiant Sanchez-Vicario then saved a massive five break points
in an exciting, gut-clenching exchange, before finally yeilding her
serve to Hingis, allowing the Swiss player to jump ahead 4-1.
	   The next game was just as agonizing, going to deuce three times.
	   But Sanchez-Vicario was unable to convert on her triple break
points, despite the fact Hingis was suffering from leg cramps.
	   At 5-2, after an injury-break for Hingis, who had her legs
massaged, Sanchez-Vicario broke the Swiss player's serve to narrow
the gap to 5-3.
	   But Hingis broke back immediately, to wrap up the match.
	   In the later reverse singles match, Conchita Martinez, seventh
in the world, took on ninth-ranked Patty Schnyder, winner of five
title this season.
	   After that, the two veteran Spaniards were scheduled to face
Schnyder and Hingis in doubles.
	   It would not be to Switzerland's advantage to have the tie
decided in the doubles.
	   Paired up, Sanchez-Vicario and Martinez have won 16 of their
last Fed Cup doubles matches, including the last seven. Though
Schnyder and Hingis have won all of the Fed Cup doubles matches
they have played together, that only amounts to three.
	   On Saturday, Hingis started off strong in her singles match
against Martinez, rolling past the Spaniard 6-4, 6-4.
	   In the other singles match Saturday, Sanchez-Vicario downed
Schnyder 6-2, 3-6, 6-2.
	   Sanchez-Vicario and Martinez have figured in all four of Spain's
titles in 1991, 1993, 1994 and 1995. The pair also led Spain to the
finals seven times in the last eight years.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Five Iranians released by Afghanistan's
Taliban militia returned to Tehran on Sunday, and several said they
were tortured in captivity, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
	   Iran says the Taliban militia is holding at least 50 more
Iranians. Tehran claims most were drivers delivering food, medicine
and other humanitarian goods to needy Afghans.
	   The Taliban, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan, says the
Iranians were carrying weapons to its opponents in the north of the
country.
	   Also Sunday, Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri said the
Taliban were a threat to Islam and vowed that Iran would take
action it deemed necessary for its ``national security interests.''
	   State-run television also quoted Nateq-Nouri, a hard-liner, as
saying Iran ``will not cave in to the pressure exerted by any
powers.''
	   The United States and other Western countries have urged Iran to
exercise caution in dealing with the Taliban.
	   Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, in comments published
Sunday, said he does not foresee a war with Iran. He also told
Al-Khaleej newspaper in the United Arab Emirates that the Taliban
hopes for good ties with Iran.

	   ENTEBBE, Uganda (AP) _ Authorities are closing in on suspects
wanted for allegedly planning attacks on American targets
worldwide, with arrests in Uganda and Germany and charges planned
against two suspects in Tanzania.
	   German officials on Sunday said Mamdouh Mahmoud Salim, 40, of
Sudan, was arrested on a U.S. warrant charging him with conspiracy
to kill U.S. citizens and conspiracy to use weapons of mass
destruction.
	   Justice officials in the German state of Bavaria said Salim is a
close associate of Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, who is wanted
by U.S. officials for the Aug. 7 bombings of the U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania.
	   The attacks killed 258 people, including 12 Americans, and
injured more than 5,500.
	   German officials said Salim denies any involvement in terrorist
activities. They said he would be extradited to the United States
in the next few weeks.
	   Salim was arrested Wednesday at a used-car lot in Grueneck, near
Munich, said Heinz Haumer, a high-ranking German police official.
	   He told police he had flown to Stuttgart from Majorca three days
earlier and came to Germany to buy several used cars. Police said
they doubted his story because he did not have enough cash for that
with him.
	   Police declined to say what Salim gave as his profession, or to
disclose where he was being held ``for security reasons.''
	   Interior Minister Guenther Beckstein said Germany German
officials acted at the request of U.S. authorities.
	   In Uganda, police have arrested 18 people suspected of planning
attacks on American and other foreign diplomatic missions as well
as Ugandan government installations, a senior official said
Saturday.
	   ``They wanted to hit key installations, not only American but of
the Ugandan government. We have all the documentary material on
their operations,'' said David Pulkol, director of internal
security.
	   Among those arrested in Uganda was businessman Ahamed Mandela,
financial secretary of the Express Football Club. Pulkol said most
of the arrests were made in the capital, Kampala, during the past
15 days. He would not provide further details.
	   Five diplomatic missions in the Ugandan capital of Kampala,
including the U.S. Embassy and the British High Commission, were
closed at the beginning of the week following a series of
threatening telephone calls.
	   In Tanzania, two suspects being held in connection with the
bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam will be charged in a
local court next week, the daily Mtanzania newspaper reported
Saturday. They were expected to be charged with murder, conspiracy
and bombing.
	   Omar Mahita, head of the Tanzanian police, would only identify
the suspects as a Tanzanian from Zanzibar and a foreigner, the
newspaper said.
	   Two suspects were in custody in New York, charged with the
murder of the 12 Americans who died in the Nairobi bombing.

Albanians propose interim solution amid violence in Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian leaders released
details of their proposal for an interim solution for Serbia's
troubled Kosovo province Sunday, amid reports of fresh fighting in
the last rebel stronghold.
	   The Albanian daily Koha Ditore published 16 suggestions from a
proposal drafted by Albanian leaders, envisaging Kosovo's future
status as ``temporarily part of Yugoslavia, as an independent
entity equal to the other two republics in the federation.''
Yugoslavia is comprised of two republics _ Montenegro and dominate
Serbia, of which Kosovo is a province.
	   A member of Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova's negotiating team,
Ilijaz Kurteshi, confirmed the authenticity of the published plan,
but added it had yet to be fine-tuned.
	   ``This is a phase of reconciling different opinions and I expect
the American side will uphold our proposals in future
negotiations,'' Kurteshi told The Associated Press Sunday.
	   A Western diplomat close to negotiations, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, applauded the Albanian proposal as a sign
of progress from the Albanian team.
	   ``This shows some resolve on their part, but it's only a step in
the process,'' he said. ``None of this is the final word. The Serbs
will come up with their proposal and counter-proposals and then
we'll have a real negotiation process going.''
	   Last week, the Americans released details of their own proposal
for a three-year interim solution to the Kosovo crisis. The U.S.
draft, while falling short of full independence, restored the
autonomy enjoyed by Kosovo Albanians until 1989.
	   On Friday Rugova, who favors independence but opposes armed
struggle for it, gave his backing for the U.S.-sponsored plan
calling it the best starting ground for peace in war-torn Kosovo.
	   According to the diplomat, the Serb side could come up with
their suggestions as early as Monday, when U.S. envoy Christopher
Hill is scheduled to visit Belgrade.
	   In the Albanian proposal, Kosovo would have its own parliament,
government and courts, as well as its own police and an independent
Central Bank, but would share the market and a common economy with
the rest of Yugoslavia. It indicated control of Kosovo's borders
could remain in the hands of the Yugoslav army and federal customs
authorities.
	   The proposal said if Belgrade and Kosovo fail to negotiate a
lasting solution to the province's status during a three-year
interim period, Kosovo's residents would vote on it in a referendum
_ something Belgrade adamantly rejects.
	   Also Sunday, the Kosovo Information Center, close to the
Albanian leadership, claimed Serb forces launched a new offensive
early Sunday on two villages in the central Drenica region, about
30 kilometers (19 miles) northwest of Pristina, one of the largest
and last rebel strongholds.
	   No information from the Serb side was immediately available and
the report could not be independently confirmed.
	   The center also reported five Albanian civilians were killed in
clashes between Podujevo and Mitrovica in northern Kosovo, where
fighting broke out last Wednesday. The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army
also issued a statement saying five members died in battles in the
north.
	   More than 600 people have been killed and upwards of 275,000
made homeless since Serb forces launched an armed crackdown in the
province in late February.

Australia wins women's field hockey gold medal

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australia's Nikki Mott scored
twice in an 8-1 field hockey victory over England for a
Commonwealth Games gold medal Sunday.
	   Mott produced her best when it mattered most as Australia took
the first gold ever for field hockey, a sport new to the
Commonwealth Games.
	   Prolific goal scorer Alyson Annan scored one, as did Katrina
Powell, captain Rechelle Hawkes, Kristen Towers, Juliet Haslam and
Michelle Andrews.
	   Australia started slowly against a tenacious England side that
failed to capitalize on an overall dominance in the opening 15
minutes.
	   Then, sparked by Annan, Australia exploded with two goals in
five minutes to gain an advantage it never relinquished. The
Olympic champion led 3-0 at halftime and scored two more shortly
after the break to clinch the match.
	   New Zealand defeated India 3-0 to take the bronze medal.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Five Iranians released by Afghanistan's
Taliban militia returned to Tehran on Sunday, and several said they
were tortured in captivity, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported, a charge likely to further stoke tensions between
the neighboring countries.
	   Iran says the Taliban militia is holding at least 50 more
Iranians _ most, drivers delivering food, medicine and other
humanitarian goods to needy Afghans.
	   The Taliban, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan, says the
Iranians were carrying weapons to its opponents in the north of the
country. Earlier this month, the Taliban released another five
Iranian drivers as a goodwill gesture.
	   Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri said Sunday that the
Taliban were a threat to Islam and vowed that Iran would take
action it deemed necessary for its ``national security interests.''
	   State-run television also quoted Nateq-Nouri, a hard-liner, as
saying Iran ``will not cave in to the pressure exerted by any
powers.''
	   The United States and other Western countries have urged Iran to
exercise caution in dealing with the Taliban.
	   Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, in comments published
Sunday, said he does not foresee a war with Iran. He also told the
Al-Khaleej newspaper in the United Arab Emirates that the Taliban
hopes for good ties with Iran.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two British charity workers have been released
after being held in breakaway Chechnya for 14 months, British
officials said Sunday.
	   Camilla Carr and Jon James were kidnapped in July 1997 while on
a charitable mission in Chechnya for a Quaker relief organization,
the Center for Peacemaking and Community Development.
	   The Foreign Office in London confirmed that the two Britons have
been released and ``are understood to be in good health.''
	   Their release ``shows the benefits of co-operation between our
government and the Russian government,'' said the spokesman,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Britain's ambassador to Moscow, Sir Andrew Andrew Wood, spoke
with Carr and James before they boarded a plane flying from the
southern Russian republic of Ingushetia to Moscow on Sunday
afternoon. He reported that they were ``absolutely elated and very
happy to be on their way home to see their families,'' an embassy
spokeswoman said.
	   Last week, renegade Chechen warlord Salman Raduyev had said that
Carr and James would be released shortly. The two appeared tired
but healthy in a two-minute videotape dated Aug. 24 and shown
earlier this month by the British Broadcasting Corporation.
	   Camilla Carr's sister Alexandra Little said on Sunday: ``It's
absolutely wonderful. We're ecstatic. We're in a state of shock and
disbelief. It's just such fantastic news.
	   ``I could not believe it when the Foreign Office phoned us. We
have heard so many rumors over the past months, that I had to get
him to repeat it several times. It has only just sunk in. I'm so
happy. I can't wait to hug them and see them in the flesh. I'm
absolutely overjoyed.''

	   The violence occurred more than two hours after a rally at the
capital's central Merdaka (Freedom) Square, where Anwar Ibrahim had
lead 35,000 people in chanting demands for Mahathir's resignation
after 17 years in office.
	   At the front gate of Mahathir's official residence,
demonstrators were within several feet of police, who were wearing
riot shields and masks when they fired tear gas bombs and water
cannon. Smoke filled the highway in front of Mahathir's official
residence as the police fired at least three volleys.

wrapped their faces in cloths and tried to get back to the center

Ukraine's central bank chief reports compromise with foreign
</HEADLINE>
investors &QL; 
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's government has reached a
compromise with its largest foreign investors over converting
domestic treasury bills into longer-term paper, a news agency
reported Sunday.
	   Viktor Yushchenko, chairman of the National Bank, declined to
provide details of the deal, said to involve some 20 investors, but
was optimistic about prospects for Ukrainian economy and the shaken
hryvna currency.
	   ``We can already say that we've regulated relations with
non-residents, and that these relations would not be a factor
affecting currency reserves through the end of the year,''
Yushchenko said in comments carried by the Interfax news agency.
	   Ukraine's currency and financial system have been badly thrashed
by the turmoil in neighboring Russia. Ukraine's budget revenues are
insufficient to cover all debt obligations, and the restructuring
plan was meant to postpone at least some of the debt payments.
	   Although details of the plan were not made public, bankers said
foreigners were offered a 20 percent redemption of their Ukrainian
bonds immediately and change the rest into Eurobonds with a 20
percent annual interest rate. The new bonds are to be redeemed in
September and December 2000.
	   Foreign investors are estimated to be holding 1.8 billion hryvna
(dlrs 600 million at the current exchange rate) in Ukrainian bonds,
originally slated to mature by August 1999. They have largely
dismissed an earlier conversion plan involving longer-term bonds
denominated in hryvnas.
	   Separately, the government has been negotiating debt conversion
terms with domestic banks. Earlier this week, the banks protested
against what they saw as a forced conversion plan, and the
government issued assurances that all such deals would be
voluntary.
	   Yushchenko said there were no grounds to speak of a further
devaluation of the hryvna and to link it to the debt issue.
	   The Russian crisis pushed the currency down from 2.1 to the U.S.
dollar in mid-August to 2.99 last Friday and the government has
expanded its currency fluctuation band, setting the limit at 3.5
hryvna to the dollar.
	   ``We devalued the hryvna in order to balance the influence of
the Russian crisis,'' said Yushchenko.
	   Ukrainian bankers, however, say they have many unfulfilled
requests to buy dollars for their clients _ and they widely expect
the pressure on the hryvna to stay on and the fluctuation band
limit to be reached within days.
	   Yushchenko also reported a 10 percent drop in trade with Russia
in the first half of 1998. Russia is Ukraine's main trade partner,
accounting for a third of its total foreign exports.
	   Following Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma's visit to Moscow
during the weekend, Russia's new Central Bank chief Viktor
Gerashchenko is to visit Kiev in October to discuss ``all aspects''
of financial relations between the two countries, Yushchenko said.

German finance minister says privatizations can help finance tax
</HEADLINE>
cut &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Insisting again there were no tax hikes
planned, Finance Minister Theo Waigel said the government would
finance its promised 30 billion mark (dlrs 17 billion) tax cut
partly through new privatizations.
	   After failing to get his tax reform package passed in the last
parliamentary session, Chancellor Helmut Kohl has made pushing it
through a main plank in his re-election campaign.
	   The opposition Social Democrats charge the package would lead to
less revenue and force cuts in welfare programs. The debate gained
steam last week when one of Kohl's own ministers hinted the
government planned to raise Germany's value-added sales tax to make
up for cuts elsewhere.
	   Kohl denied he was planning to raise taxes after the Sept. 27
election, and the minister said she had made a mistake.
	   In an interview with this week's Focus newsmagazine, Waigel said
a third of the tax cut would be ``secured'' through the
self-financing effect of reforming Germany's cumbersome tax system.
	   In addition, ``we'll naturally continue our successful
privatization policy,'' he said.
	   With all that plus added revenue due to economic growth, ``we're
in a position to do without shifting direct and indirect taxes
around,'' he said.
	   The German government has raised billions in recent years by
selling stakes in the Deutsche Telekom phone system, Lufthansa
airlines and other firms.

Harrison knocks out Mauritian to cap English dominance at boxing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIJAY JOSHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Fighting angrily with ill-fitting
gloves, Audley Harrison knocked out Michael Macque of Mauritius in
the first round Sunday, capping a day of four boxing gold medals
for England at the Commonwealth Games.
	   Harrison needed only 65 seconds to end the super-heavyweight
fight with a powerful left straight that left Macque on his knees,
unable to get up.
	   Canada, meanwhile, came out of the finals in 12 weight divisions
with three gold medals and three silvers.
	   Just before the 190-centimeter (6-foot-3), 114-kilogram
(251-pound) Harrison went into the ring, the judges ordered him to
discard his personal gloves and wear a new pair provided by the
games. The gloves were too tight and Harrison said he couldn't make
a proper fist for the bout, the day's last.
	   ``That really got me more angry ... but it worked to my
advantage because I went looking for it with bad intentions,'' he
said.
	   With Macque still down, Harrison already was draped in England's
flag and had taken off his headgear to reveal close-cropped hair
dyed in yellow tiger stripes.
	   As the public address system played ``Top of the World'' after
the medal ceremony, Harrison declared that he is the greatest
super-heavyweight boxer England has produced. He said he will turn
professional after the 2000 Olympics.
	   ``I will definintely turn professional,'' said the London-born
Harrison, whose parents migrated to England from Jamaica.
	   ``I would like to stay around and do the Olympics. I will win an
Olympic gold without a doubt (and) if I turn professional, I will
win the world title without a doubt.''
	   ``I will turn pro late. I will still be moving, I will still
have the power, I will still have the strength, still have the
skills. I will still have my senses,'' said the 26-year-old
Harrison, who won this year's Amateur Boxing Association
super-heavyweight title.
	   England's boxing gold haul is its best ever at the Commonwealth
Games, and it also won two bronzes.
	   ``I said we would win six medals. But I didn't expect four
golds,'' said national coach Ian Irwin.
	   The other English gold winners were Courtney Fry, who defeated
Troy Amos Ross of Canada at light heavyweight; John Pearce, who
beat Jitender Kumar of India at middleweight, and Chris Bessey, who
beat Scott McIntosh of Canada at light middleweight.
	   ``Definitely it is very satisfying to break Canada's
stranglehold,'' said Irwin. Canada sent in six finalists, a
Commonwealth record for the country, including defending champion
Michael Strange at light welterweight.
	   Strange defeated Gerry Legras of the Seychelles and immediately
declared that free beer will be served to all customers for an hour
at the bar he owns in Niagara Falls. The happy hour was to begin
the moment Canadian television broadcast tape of his victory later
Sunday.
	   ``You never get used to going to the top of the podium and
taking the flag with you and being No. 1,'' said Strange, who won
the title at the 1994 Victoria games as well.
	   History was also made by Raymond Narh of Ghana and Biki Sapok of
Malaysia, who won the first boxing golds ever for their countries
in a major international event.
	   Narh defeated Asghar Ali of Pakistan in a grueling 30-27 bout in
the lightweight category.
	   Ali ``will need a good massage tonight ... and I am going to
jubilate,'' said Narh, 20, adding that he promised his mother he
would come back with a gold.
	   His gold was also the first boxing medal for Ghana at a world
tournament since the legendary Azuma Nelson won the Olympic silver
in featherweight.
	   But the biggest cheers from a packed stadium of 8,000 fans were
heard at the first bout when Sapok, a bombardier in the Malaysian
army, defeated Moses Kinyua of Kenya at light flyweight.
	   After winning, Sapok ran to his corner and unrolled a picture of
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who was watching from the stands.
	   ``I am the king of the ring,'' Sapok declared, as his parents
wept with joy in the stands.

	   When they were within several meters (feet) of riot police, with
shields and masks, the officers fired three volleys of tear gas,
and a water cannon into the crowd of men, women, children and
babies.
	   Thousands pressed clothes to their faces while running back
toward town coughing and crying. A fire truck then pulled up and
aimed a water hose at those who were trying to get away.
	   Meanwhile, the special police squad entered Anwar's home, and
ordered television news cameramen to leave. Fifty helmeted riot
police with wooden batons and submachine guns surrounded Anwar's
house pushing back hundreds of supporters, who stood singing and
praying, ``May God almighty have control.''

Kohl says public interest in Clinton scandal makes him sick
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl says he's outraged at the
world's obsession with the sex scandal surrounding U.S. President
Bill Clinton, saying ``it's enough to make one throw up.''
	   In an interview to appear in Monday's Die Welt newspaper, Kohl
said he had no judgment to make about Clinton's private life.
``That's his business,'' Kohl said.
	   ``But the way the world public is following in the Internet here
the most private incidents with a hypocritical greed, that is for
me, and I don't use this expression lightly, it's enough to make
one throw up,'' he said.
	   Kohl said he hoped and expected that Clinton would remain in
office and that Americans would soon be able to concentrate on
other topics again.
	   ``It's bad that the most important power in the world is
affording itself a domestic discussion as if nothing else dramatic
is happening in the world,'' he said, pointing to crises in
financial markets and fighting in Kosovo and central Africa.

Festive-minded but nervous, Israelis mark New Year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Shoppers swarmed and sellers shouted. Children
scooted underfoot while green-clad soldiers made their constant
swivel-eyed surveys of the bustling market scene.
	   Israel was set to usher in the New Year _ 5759, by the Jewish
calendar _ beginning at sundown Sunday.
	   ``Sweet challah bread for a sweet new year!'' bakery workers
called, pointing to shining-fresh piles of braided loaves. Shoppers
filled baskets with apples and honey, fish heads and dates,
vegetables and spices.
	   At Jerusalem's busiest open-air market, Pnina Tel-Dan, who lives
in the West Bank settlement of Maale Adumim, was one of thousands
of people scurrying to make last-minute buys.
	   ``For me, buying spices is like buying jewelry _ all these
beautiful colors!'' she said, waving at powdery heaps of red, green
and yellow.
	   The two-day Rosh Hashana holiday is marked by special prayers
and readings in synagogues and the blowing of a shofar, or ram's
horn. Most businesses in Israel were closing for the holiday, and
buses stopped running as well.
	   Israelis were mainly spending the holiday with family at home or
heading out for vacations at spots like the Sea of Galilee or
Egypt's Sinai peninsula.
	   Stores were filled all week with shoppers buying holiday
presents, and on Sunday, it seemed that every other person hurrying
past was toting a big bouquet or a cellophane-wrapped gift basket.
	   Israeli merchants, not normally noted for effusiveness,
constantly called out ``Shana tova!'' _ Happy New Year! _ to
customers and passers-by.
	   The celebrations, though, took place in the shadow of tension
over Israel's continuing deadlock with the Palestinians. American
mediator Dennis Ross left Israel before dawn after yet another
failed attempt to revive negotiations.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat blamed one another for the impasse.
	   Holiday security was tight in Israel, even though the
Palestinian lands were sealed off, with residents of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip forbidden to enter.
	   Following the killings of two of its top fugitives, the Islamic
group Hamas had threatened bombings and kidnappings of Israeli
soldiers during the holidays.
	   The covered Mahane Yehuda market, scene of festive holiday
shopping sprees, was itself the target of a suicide bombing in July
1997 that killed 15 people and injured dozens.
	   Roland Redrash, a 44-year-old computer engineer, was
concentrating on the list of ingredients his wife had given him for
a traditional meal: apples for dipping in honey, challah, fish
heads _ ``so we can be at the head (of the year) and not the
tail,'' he said.
	   Fruit merchant Menahem Mizrahi stopped selling bananas long
enough for a burst of bravado.
	   ``Who's afraid?'' he said. ``The people of Israel are alive and

Bohn earns fourth title of the year in Japan Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Parker Bohn III took a big step toward player of
the year honors on the Professional Bowlers Association Tour by
winning the 14th annual Oronamin C Japan Cup at Tokyo Port Bowl
Sunday.
	   Bohn, of Jackson, New Jersey, beat Steve Jaros in the title
match, 238-226, to win his fourth title of the year and the dlrs
50,000 first-place check.
	   As the 1992 Japan Cup champion, Bohn joins Amleto Monacelli and
Pete Weber as the only players to have won this event twice.
	   ``I don't know if this second win is sweeter than the first,''
said Bohn. ``But it means a lot to me this year because my mother
(Jean) was with me and because it gets me that much closer to PBA
Player of the Year honors.''
	   The title match between Jaros, of Bolingbrook, Illinois, and
Bohn, who had qualified as the top seed was decided in the final
frame.
	   Bohn struck in every frame except the fifth, eighth and on his
first shot in the 10th and converted single-pin spares in each of
those frames.
	   Jaros started with spares in four of his first five frames
before stringing together four consecutive strikes in frames sixth
through nine.
	   Bohn, finishing first, was unable to shut Jaros out, so Jaros
got up in his 10th frame needing two strikes and one pin for his
first victory since 1993.
	   Jaros threw the ball in the pocket, but left a solid 10-pin and
had to settle for the second-place check for dlrs 25,500.
	   ``I never even expected to have a chance in the 10th frame
because I though Parker would shut me out,'' said Jaros. ``It's
been a long time since I was up in the 10th frame with a chance to
win a title, but I threw the shot I wanted to, it just didn't
strike.''
	   ``The scores were really high this week and the last thing I
wanted to do was give Steve a chance to throw two strikes to beat
me,'' said Bohn. ``I feel very fortunate to be sitting here as the
winner.''
	   The earlier matches saw a pair of first-time Japan Cup
qualifiers in match one as sixth-seeded Brian Himmler beat
fifth-seeded Tommy Delutz Jr., 255-233.
	   Himmler then lost to defending champion Doug Kent, 237-188, in
match two.
	   Kent's bid to become the first player to successfully defend a
Japan Cup title was foiled by Jaros in match three, 237-214.
	   Jaros also spoiled Walter Ray Williams Jr's attempt to win his
second Japan Cup when he beat the reigning PBA Player of the Year,
238-194, in the semifinal match.
	   Delutz, of Flushing, New York, collected dlrs 7,000 for sixth
place. Himmler, of Cincinnati, Ohio, earned dlrs 8,500 for fifth.
Kent, who resides in Canandaigua, New York, took home dlrs 11,000
for fourth, while Williams, from Orlando, Florida, garnered dlrs
14,000 for third.
	   The four-day event, an invitational all match play tournament,
featured the top 16 players each from the U.S. association and its
Japanese counterpart.
	   None of the Japanese bowlers advanced to the championship round.

Albanians propose interim solution amid violence in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new numbers of Albanians killed in grafs 14-15.
No pickup. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian leaders released
details of their proposal for an interim solution for Serbia's
troubled Kosovo province Sunday, amid reports of fresh fighting in
the last rebel stronghold.
	   The Albanian daily Koha Ditore published 16 suggestions from a
proposal drafted by Albanian leaders, envisaging Kosovo's future
status as ``temporarily part of Yugoslavia, as an independent
entity equal to the other two republics in the federation.''
Yugoslavia is comprised of two republics _ Montenegro and dominate
Serbia, of which Kosovo is a province.
	   A member of Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova's negotiating team,
Ilijaz Kurteshi, confirmed the authenticity of the published plan,
but added it had yet to be fine-tuned.
	   ``This is a phase of reconciling different opinions and I expect
the American side will uphold our proposals in future
negotiations,'' Kurteshi told The Associated Press Sunday.
	   A Western diplomat close to negotiations, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, applauded the Albanian proposal as a sign
of progress from the Albanian team.
	   ``This shows some resolve on their part, but it's only a step in
the process,'' he said. ``None of this is the final word. The Serbs
will come up with their proposal and counter-proposals and then
we'll have a real negotiation process going.''
	   Last week, the Americans released details of their own proposal
for a three-year interim solution to the Kosovo crisis. The U.S.
draft, while falling short of full independence, restored the
autonomy enjoyed by Kosovo Albanians until 1989.
	   On Friday Rugova, who favors independence but opposes armed
struggle for it, gave his backing for the U.S.-sponsored plan
calling it the best starting ground for peace in war-torn Kosovo.
	   According to the diplomat, the Serb side could come up with
their suggestions as early as Monday, when U.S. envoy Christopher
Hill is scheduled to visit Belgrade.
	   In the Albanian proposal, Kosovo would have its own parliament,
government and courts, as well as its own police and an independent
Central Bank, but would share the market and a common economy with
the rest of Yugoslavia. It indicated control of Kosovo's borders
could remain in the hands of the Yugoslav army and federal customs
authorities.
	   The proposal said if Belgrade and Kosovo fail to negotiate a
lasting solution to the province's status during a three-year
interim period, Kosovo's residents would vote on it in a referendum
_ something Belgrade adamantly rejects.
	   Also Sunday, the Kosovo Information Center, close to the
Albanian leadership, claimed Serb forces launched a new offensive
early Sunday on two villages in the central Drenica region, about
30 kilometers (19 miles) northwest of Pristina, one of the largest
and last rebel strongholds.
	   No information from the Serb side was immediately available and
the report could not be independently confirmed.
	   The center also reported eleven Albanian civilians were killed
in clashes between Podujevo and Mitrovica in northern Kosovo, where
fighting broke out last Wednesday. Six of the bodies were found
completely charred in Albanian homes, it said.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army also issued a statement saying
five members died in battles in the area, raising the death toll in
this week's northern Serb offensive to 24, according to Albanian
sources.
	   More than 600 people have been killed and upwards of 275,000
made homeless since Serb forces launched an armed crackdown in the
province in late February.

Formula One boss admits links with European soccer Super League
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Formula One auto racing boss Bernie Ecclestone has
admitted he is involved in a move to create a Eureopan soccer Super
League.
	   Eccleston said ``yes I am involved'' in plans to form a
breakaway European Super League embracing clubs like Manchester
United, Arsenal, Juventus, Inter and AC Milan, Barcelona, Real
Madrid and Bayern Munich.
	   He was also linked Sunday with a 700-million-pound (dlrs 1.18
billion) bid for Manchester United to rival the 623-million-pound
(dlrs 1 billion) takeover of Britain's biggest club by Rupert
Murdoch's satellite broadcaster BSkyB.
	   The Sunday Mirror and News of the World reported the 67-year-old
businessman was the ``secret'' client who asked American investment
Salomon Smith Barney to investigate a takeover of Manchester
United.
	   The BSkyB takeover is currently being investigated by the
British Office of Fair Trading.
	   Eccleston on Sunday confirmed his association with Media
Partners, the Milan-based marketing company behind plans to create
the rebel Super League.
	   The concept has been opposed by UEFA, soccer's European
governing body, which controls existing European competition.
	   ``My interest is getting this whole thing off the ground. I am
involved but only a little bit at the moment. I do not know what my
involvement will be in the future,'' he was quoted saying in the
Mirror.
	   ``I think a Super League is a great idea. I don't know much
about football _ at least not as much as I know about motor racing
_ but I think this is necessary and I do think it would work.
	   ``This is something that would satisfy everybody. I like good
ideas and this is a good one.''
	   Eccleston owned a successful car dealership in England before
establishing the Brabham Formula One racing team in 1970. He is now
in charge of the Formula One Constructor's Association, an umbrella
organization for all Formula One teams, and is No. 2 official in
the sport's world governing body, FIA.
	   He controls television coverage of the sport through his digital
television broadcasting company, which he could also be used to
screen pay-per-view soccer matches throughout Europe.
	   Meanwhile, opposition to BSkyB's takeover of Manchester United
continues to grow.
	   The Independent Manchester United Supporters Association and the
Football Supporters Association sending anti-BSkyB literature to
more than one million soccer supporters in England.
	   The groups have also called for fans to boycott subscriptions to
Sky TV.

Sudanese president says U.S. threatened to strike Sudan again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Photos expected
 &UR; By MOHAMAD OSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ President Omar el-Bashir said Sunday that
Washington has threatened to launch another strike against Sudan if
U.S embassies are attacked again.
	   He said the threat was made in an unsigned letter he received
from the U.S. administration.
	   He gave no details, but warned that his government would
respond.
	   U.S. officials were not available for comment.
	   A Sudanese parliamentary official said the alleged written
threat from Washington was handed to el-Bashir by ``a former senior
Sudanese official.''
	   He did not say when the message was received.
	   ``Welcome to a second and third strike. But next time we will
not go to the Security Council ... We will reserve the right to
respond and our response will be very painful,'' el-Bashir told a
rally of thousands of people marking one month since a U.S. missile
strike against a factory in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum.
	   Washington claimed the plant produced chemical weapons agents.
	   But Sudan, which insisted the factory produced only
pharmaceuticals, called for a U.N. Security Council investigation.
	   Mohammed el-Hassan Amin, head of the political section of the
ruling National Congress party, told reporters Saturday that the
alleged U.S. message also accused Khartoum of hosting groups loyal
to Saudi dissident Osama Bin Laden.
	   Washington also attacked what it called Bin Laden's training
camp in Afghanistan, accusing the Saudi dissident of being behind
the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7.
	   El-Bashir pledged at Sunday's rally that the destroyed plant
would remain untouched as a reminder of the ``American
aggression.''
	   Protesters burned a U.S. flag as verses from the Muslim holy
book of Koran were read over loudspeakers.
	   A poster pasted to a truck depicted a donkey with a face of U.S.
President Bill Clinton with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky mounted on its back. Lewinsky is at the center of a sex
scandal with Clinton.
	   Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who attended the
rally, apologized for the U.S. missile strike and urged the United
Nations to send an inspection team to determine whether the plant
produced chemical weapons agents.

	   As a white van drove away with Anwar inside, hundreds of
supporters ran alongside, yelling, ``Reform, reform,'' and police
pulled them away.
	   At least 500 police officers, with helmets and assault rifles,
surrounded Anwar's house, blocked all nearby roads and kept back
the angry supporters who sang religious songs and prayed.
	   Anwar, fired by Mahathir on Sept. 2 from his posts of deputy
prime minister and finance minister, had lead 35,000 people earlier
Sunday in chanting demands for the prime minister's resignation.
	   After the rally ended peacefully, Anwar had returned home, while
thousands of people began marching along the highway toward
Mahathir's gated residence.

Albanians propose interim solution amid violence in Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian leaders released
details of their proposal for an interim solution for Serbia's
troubled Kosovo province Sunday, calling for a three-year period of
autonomy followed by a referendum if Kosovo's final status has not
been determined.
	   The release of the proposal came amid reports of fresh fighting
in the last ethnic Albanian rebel stronghold.
	   The ethnic Albanian daily Koha Ditore published 16 suggestions
from a proposal drafted by Albanian leaders, envisaging Kosovo's
future status as ``temporarily part of Yugoslavia, as an
independent entity equal to the other two republics in the
federation.''
	   Yugoslavia is comprised of two republics _ smaller Montenegro
and dominant Serbia, of which Kosovo is a province.
	   A member of Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova's negotiating team,
Ilijaz Kurteshi, confirmed the authenticity of the published plan,
but added it has yet to be fine-tuned.
	   ``This is a phase of reconciling different opinions and I expect
the American side will uphold our proposals in future
negotiations,'' Kurteshi told The Associated Press on Sunday.
	   A Western diplomat close to negotiations, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, applauded the Albanian proposal as a sign
of progress from the Albanian team.
	   ``This shows some resolve on their part, but it's only a step in
the process,'' he said. ``None of this is the final word. The Serbs
will come up with their proposal and counter-proposals and then
we'll have a real negotiation process going.''
	   Last week, the Americans released details of their own proposal
for a three-year interim solution to the Kosovo crisis. The U.S.
draft would give ethnic Albanians control over local affairs but
keep them part of Serbia.
	   On Friday Rugova, who favors independence but opposes the armed
struggle, gave his backing for the U.S.-sponsored plan, calling it
the best starting ground for peace.
	   According to the diplomat, the Serb side could come up with
their suggestions as early as Monday, when U.S. envoy Christopher
Hill is scheduled to visit the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade.
	   In the Albanian proposal, Kosovo would have its own parliament,
government and courts, as well as its own police and an independent
Central Bank, but would be part of a common market with the rest of
Yugoslavia. Kosovo's borders could remain in the hands of the
Yugoslav army and federal customs authorities.
	   The proposal said if Belgrade and Kosovo fail to negotiate a
lasting solution to the province's status during a three-year
interim period, Kosovo's residents would vote on final status in a
referendum _ something Serbia adamantly rejects.
	   Also Sunday, the Kosovo Information Center, which is close to
the Albanian leadership, claimed Serb forces launched a new
offensive early Sunday on two villages in the central Drenica
region, about 30 kilometers (19 miles) northwest of Pristina, one
of the largest and last rebel strongholds.
	   No information from the Serb side was immediately available and
the report could not be independently confirmed.
	   The center also reported eleven Albanian civilians were killed
in clashes between Podujevo and Mitrovica in northern Kosovo, where
fighting broke out last Wednesday. Six of the bodies were found
burned in Albanian homes, it said.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army also issued a statement saying
five members died in battles in the area, raising the death toll in
this week's northern Serb offensive to 24, according to Albanian
sources.
	   More than 600 people have been killed and more than 275,000 made
homeless since Serb forces launched an armed crackdown in the
province in late February.

Australia wins men's hockey gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's passionate men's field
hockey campaign was abruptly ended as a clinical Australian team
won the Commonwealth Games gold medal playoff 4-0 Sunday.
	   The Malaysians rode emotional crowd support to arrive at the
final with a controversial victory over Canada and a remarkable
golden goal win over India. But they were swamped by Australia's
defense and killed on the counterattack Sunday.
	   Forward Michael Brennan scored twice, while Adam Commens and
Stephen Davies got one each as Australia took the first gold medal
in hockey's games debut.
	   Malaysia's scrambling defense allowed it to advance with a
surprise 1-0 semifinal win over India but it cracked too early
Sunday.
	   Australia had one penalty corner turned away but from the
second, in just the third minute, the ball was pushed in to
Commens, who found the target for a 1-0 lead.
	   The early goal did more than open up the game _ it almost turned
the crowd against the hosts.
	   Far from giving their team an advantage, the capacity crowd put
heavy pressure on them in the first half, jeering them every time
they played a cautious ball.
	   Kuhan Shanmuganathan was causing trouble down the right flank
but Australian captain Michael York was in commanding form. When
the Australian defense was caught out at 18 minutes, a cross found
Chairil Anuar unmarked in front of an open goal but he shot weakly.
	   While the Malaysians ran hard at a composed Australian defense,
the favorites were prepared to wait for the counter. Their second
and third goals both came within a minute of Malaysian penalty
corners.
	   Brennan, whose golden goal gave Australia its 3-2 semifinal
victory over England, scored the second after James Elmer ran down
the right and cut a pass back to Brennan at the top of the goal
circle.
	   Nor Saiful Zaini went close with a penalty corner but York led
Australia quickly out of defense, feeding Brennan, who set up a
long-range goal from Stephen Davies.
	   Malaysian captain Mirnawan Nawawi, who scored the goal that put
his team into the final, had a quiet match after being its best
player through the tournament.
	   The Australians led 3-0 at the break and scored another from a
fast break when Brennan turned in his second from close range with
a sharp reverse stick shot.
	   Malaysian goalkeeper Roslan Jamaluddin was again oustanding and
prevented a worse scoreline.
	   Australia revamped its aging squad for the Commonwealth Games
after the world's No. 4-ranked team failed to win a medal at the
World Cup in May.
	   England won the bronze medal playoff in a penalty shootout, 4-2,
against India earlier Sunday. They finished 1-1 at fulltime and
failed to score a golden goal.

Aussie mum wins women's marathon, Lesotho gains first medal

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Hurdler Tony Jarrett, for so long
used to finishing second or worse in major championships, finally
made it to gold Sunday when he triumphed in the 110-meter hurdles
at the Commonwealth Games.
	   A two-time silver and also bronze medalist at the World
Championships, runner-up twice at the last two Commonwealths and
fourth-place finisher at the Barcelona Olympics, the 30-year-old
Englishman edged Trinidad's Steve Brown by .01 to clock 13.47 in
the final.
	   ``I'm just glad I've got a gold medal around my neck,'' Jarrett
said.
	   ``After the finish I thought I had a chance but I told myself,
`Don't jump up and down just yet.' I did that once at the Olympic
Games when I thought I had a bronze but I was only fourth.''
	   On a good day for England away from the track too, boxer Audley
Harrison won the super-heavyweight gold with a first-round knockout
for the team's fourth title in 12 finals, and two more golds came
on the shooting range.
	   Without a gold or silver in the boxing arena, Australia,
meanwhile, remained rampant elsewhere, winning both men's and
women's hockey finals as well as two track gold medals
	   The men's hockey team silenced the home fans with a 4-0 victory
over Malaysia and the women crushed England 8-1.
	   Jarrett's long overdue victory was one of six finals in the
stadium Sunday evening after the the marathon races in the early
morning.
	   A 38-year-old mother of four who only started running in her
early 30s, Heather Turland surprised herself by winning the
marathon.
	   She now looks forward to running for Australia at the Sydney
Olympics in 2000, when she will be 40.
	   ``It's a dream come true. I never ever thought I'd win something
like this,'' said Turland. ``It's really special being my last
Commonwealth Games, but now it looks like I'll have to go on to
Sydney 2000.''
	   In the men's race on the same course, Thabiso Moqhali pulled
away in the final four miles (6.4 kilometers) to won Lesotho's
first medal at any major championships. Two Tanzanians, Simon
Bisiligitwa and Andea Suja, completed an African sweep of the
medals.
	   Kenya's Ester Wanjiru maintained her country's amazing record on
the track by winning the 10,000 meters, adding her gold to the
Kenyan triumphs in the men's 800, 5,000, 10,000 meters and 3,000
steeplechase.
	   New Zealand's world champion Beatrice Faumina, who was
Commonwealth runner-up four years ago, heaved a Games record 65.92
to win the women's discus, and South Africa's Riaan Botha also
claimed a Games mark of 5.60 to win the men's pole vault.
	   The men's long jump and women's high jump both wound up tied on
scores.
	   Australians Peter Burge and Jai Taurima both leaped 8.22 meters
and Burge was awarded the gold because of a better next best jump.
Sadly for Taurima, he missed the last three rounds because of a
groin injury.
	   South Africa's Hestrie Storbeck cleared 1.91 meters to win the
high jump ahead of England's Joanne Jennings, who made the same
height. The English jumper lost in a jump off which took place
because both had the same number of failures. Storbeck went clear
at 1.89 again but Jennings failed.
	   Away from Malaysia's National Stadium, Harrison's first round
knockout of Michael Macque of Mauritius was the highlight of
England's four-gold performance in the boxing finals.
	   The powerfully built super-heavyweight unleashed a straight left
that jerked Macque's head backward and his opponent crashed to the
floor. The referee didn't finish the count but called to the
ringside doctors to make sure he was all right.
	   Courtney Fry upset Olympic quarterfinalist Troy Amos Ross of
Canada 26-21 on points in the light-heavyweight division, John
Pearce outclassed India's Jitender Kumar 25-15 at middleweight and
Chris Bessey scored a 20-15 victory over Canada's Scott MacIntosh
at light middleweight.
	   Canada won three golds medals, defending titlist Michael Strange
downing Gerry Legras of the Seychelles 16-8 at light welterweight
and Jeremy Molitor scoring a 14-9 verdict over Kenya's Absolom
Okoth at welterweight.
	   Then heavyweight Mark Simmons outpunched Roland Raforme of the
Seychelles 21-13.
	   The Kenyans, who two golds four years ago in Victoria, went home
without a medal after a disappointing performance from their 10
fighters.
	   English shooters also collected golds on the range at Langkawi
Island.
	   Michael Gault collected his fourth gold medal to go with his
title at the Games at Victoria four years ago by winning the men's
air pistol.
	   ``This is due reward for a lot of training,'' Gault said. ``I
was up against some professional shooters from India and Malaysia
and to get another gold is amazing.
	   ``I've been told if I was Malaysian I would have won four cars
and a house.''
	   Timothy Lowndes of Australia finally made it to gold after a
bronze in the pairs free rifle prone and a silver in the pairs
3-position.
	   In the velodrome, New Zealand's Glen Thomson won the
40-kilometer points race, Alayna Burns of Australia won the women's
equivalent and the Australians triumphed in the 4-kilometer team
pursuit.
	   Canada won both titles in the diving pool, Alexandre Despatie
taking gold in the men's platform and Eryn Bulmer finishing top in
the women's 3-meter springboard.

Gunmen open fire on Muslim worshippers; four killed, eight wounded
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Gunmen on motorcycles opened fire on a
crowd of Shiite Muslim worshippers in Punjab province Sunday,
killing four and wounding at least eight, some of them critically,
a militant Shiite organization said.
	   Four men on two motorcycles fired into the crowd with automatic
weapons as worshippers gathered to hear prayers in the town of
Kotaddu, about 260 kilometers (160 miles) south of Lahore, the
provincial capital of Punjab, said the group Tehrik-e-Jafria.
	   Police had no immediate suspects.
	   In recent months, scores of people have been killed throughout
the country in an ongoing feud between militant members of Sunni
and Shiite Muslim groups.
	   On Thursday, a prominent Shiite Muslim leader was gunned down in
eastern Punjab. Agha Wajeeb Abbas Naqvi, a leader of
Tehrik-e-Jafria, was shot by two men on a motorcycle.
	   Last Sunday, a militant Sunni leader, Shoaib Nadeem, and three
other members of the Sunni Sipah-e-Sahaba group were killed by four
gunmen on a highway near Islamabad. The killing set off widespread
demonstrations, including militants setting fire to a Shiite
mosque.

Report: China upping pressure on Taiwan as key visit nears
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ China is stepping up efforts to isolate
Taiwan diplomatically and force it into reunification talks in the
run up to a watershed meeting between negotiators from the two
sides, newspapers reported Sunday.
	   Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan plans to hold private
talks in New York this week with the foreign ministers of Costa
Rica and Panama, two of the just 27 countries that recognize the
Nationalist government in Taipei, the United Daily News reported.
	   Such contacts make Taiwan extremely nervous because China often
uses them to wring concessions from the island's allies. In a break
with past years, Costa Rica and Panama did not sign on to sponsor a
proposal to add discussion of Taiwan's lack of United Nations
representation at the world body earlier this month, possibly due
to pressure from China.
	   Tang's visit to the United Nations in New York comes less than a
month before the leaders of the two sides' semiofficial negotiating
bodies meet in the highest level contact between the sides since
China broke off talks between them in 1995.
	   Taiwan's main negotiator, Shi Hwei-yow, will travel to China on
Tuesday to make further arrangements for the visit of Koo Chen-fu,
chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation, the foundation said.
	   Taiwan hopes the visit will help get negotiations back on track,
but increased diplomatic pressure from China could dampen the mood
for talks.
	   In a separate report, the paper said Chinese officials in
Beijing are calling for a timetable to be set down for Taiwan's
return to Beijing's control.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin hopes to make a major breakthrough
on relations with Taiwan during his term as president, the paper
said, quoting unidentified Chinese officials.
	   China hopes to pressure Taiwan into discussing political issues
relating to reunification in order to redirect attitudes on the
island, which remain largely unfriendly towards joining with China.
	   China, which considers Taiwan a breakaway province, suspended
talks between the sides in anger over Taiwan's efforts to assert
itself internationally. The sides separated politically during the
Chinese civil war in 1949.

Pope beatifies campaigner for Catholic schools
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS spelling of Tovini throughout
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By CANDICE HUGHES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRESCIA, Italy (AP) _ Under a strange, sloping crucifix that had
Jesus dangling head down, Pope John Paul II on Sunday beatified a
19th-century layman who campaigned ardently for Catholic schools.
	   The towering, modernistic construction has been the subject of
intense debate in this prosperous city at the edge of the Italian
Alps, which has been preparing for the papal visit for months.
	   Thirty meters (Ninety feet) high, it curved precipitously over
the platform where John Paul, resplendent in a green robe, presided
over the beatification of local son Giuseppe Tovini.
	   Beatification is a step toward sainthood.
	   A poor boy who made good, Tovini founded Catholic schools,
newspapers, banks, insurance companies and charities at a time when
public sentiment in Italy, then a new nation, was turning against
what some saw as the church's excessive influence on society.
	   A lawyer and the father of 10 children, Tovini died in 1897, the
same year another local son, the future Pope Paul VI, was born.
John Paul's predecessor, Paul was pontiff from 1963 to 1978 and
presided over the historic reforms of the Second Vatican Council.
	   Shaded by a golden canopy, John Paul urged the 30,000
worshippers gathered at the city stadium to follow Tovini's
example.
	   ``Fervent, loyal, active in social and political life, Giuseppe
Tovini proclaimed with his life the Christian message,'' he said.
	   Tovini's beatification comes as the Roman Catholic Church is
pressing the Italian government to fund church schools.
	   Like the crucifix, created for the pope's visit by a prominent
stage designer, the campaign has provoked intense debate.
	   Some, especially on the conservative end of the spectrum, are
for it, saying church schools promote moral values. Others are
adamantly opposed, saying it would jeopardize Italy's hard-won
separation of church and state.
	   Brescia, a city of 200,000 near Lake Garda, was the second and
final stop on the pope's weekend pastoral visit to northern Italy.
The 78-year-old pontiff also visited Chiavari on the Italian
Riviera south of Genoa.

Provincial Dutch Reformed branch considers secession over racial
</HEADLINE>
integration &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A provincial branch of the
Dutch Reformed Church is considering secession from the national
church to protest plans for racial integration, a Sunday newspaper
reported.
	   Citing unnamed sources, the Afrikaans-language newspaper Rapport
reported that the 164,000-member Free State branch is considering
breaking away because they object to worshipping with blacks and
people of mixed race.
	   The issue is to be discussed at a special synod on October,
Rapport said.
	   The Dutch Reformed Church is the main religious denomination of
Afrikaners, the Dutch-descended white settlers of South Africa.
	   During the apartheid era, when the Afrikaner-led National Party
governed the country, the church told members that apartheid was
ordained by biblical teachings.
	   Starting in 1982, it has gradually renounced its position.
	   But it kept separate branches for blacks and mixed-race
congregants. In 1994, the black and mixed-race branches merged to
become the United Reformed Church in Southern Africa.
	   Now the national church is considering a merger with the URC.
	   Last year, a Dutch Reformed Church official reaffirmed its
contrition over its racist teachings.
	   ``We have indeed taught our people wrongly with regard to
apartheid as a biblical instruction,'' Dutch Reformed Church
moderator Freek Swanepoel told the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission.
	   The admission was hailed by panel chairman Desmond Tutu as a
great contribution to ``the process of healing in our land.''

scooted underfoot while soldiers made constant swivel-eyed surveys
of the bustling market scene as Israel prepared to usher in the New
Year _ 5759 by the Jewish calendar _ beginning at sundown Sunday.
	   Celebrations of the two-day Rosh Hashana holiday, though, were
shadowed by Israel's continuing deadlock with the Palestinians.
Security was tight, with Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza
Strip banned from entering Israel.
	   The militant Islamic group Hamas threatened bombings and
kidnappings of Israeli soldiers during the holidays following the
killing of two top fugitives by Israeli troops.
	   Jerusalem's covered Mahane Yehuda market, scene of festive
holiday shopping sprees on Sunday, was itself the target of a
suicide bombing in July 1997 that killed 15 people and injured
dozens. Holiday shoppers, though, put those memories aside.
	   ``Sweet challah bread for a sweet new year!'' bakery workers at
the market called, pointing to shining, fresh piles of braided
loaves. Shoppers filled baskets with apples and honey, fish heads
and dates, vegetables and spices.
	   Pnina Tel-Dan, who lives in the West Bank settlement of Maale
Adumim, was one of thousands of people scurrying to make
last-minute buys at Jerusalem's busiest market.
	   ``For me, buying spices is like buying jewelry _ all these
beautiful colors!'' she said, waving at powdery heaps of red, green
and yellow.
	   The two-day Rosh Hashana holiday is marked by special prayers
and readings in synagogues and the blowing of a shofar, or ram's
horn. Most businesses in Israel were closing for the holiday, and
buses stopped running as well.
	   Israelis were mainly spending the holiday with family at home or
heading out for vacations at spots like the Sea of Galilee or
Egypt's Sinai Peninsula.
	   Stores were filled all week with shoppers buying holiday
presents, and on Sunday, it seemed that every other person hurrying
past was toting a big bouquet or a cellophane-wrapped gift basket.
	   Israeli merchants, not normally noted for effusiveness,
constantly called out ``Shana tova!'' _ Happy New Year! _ to
customers and passers-by.
	   Roland Redrash, a 44-year-old computer engineer, was
concentrating on the list of ingredients his wife had given him for
a traditional meal: apples for dipping in honey, challah, fish
heads _ ``so we can be at the head (of the year) and not the
tail,'' he said.
	   Fruit merchant Menahem Mizrahi stopped selling bananas long
enough for a burst of bravado despite rising tensions with
Palestinians.
	   ``Who's afraid?'' he said. ``The people of Israel are alive and
well.''
	   Tal Yaakov, a 46-year-old Jerusalemite, dispatched one of his
children to pick up one last bag of vegetables. His New Year's
wish?
	   ``Peace,'' he said. ``And maybe a new government.''

Anwar holds unprecedented rally in Malaysian capital

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's sacked deputy prime
minister was arrested late Sunday after thousands of his supporters
marched to the prime minister's house, provoking riot police to
fire tear gas into the crowd.
	   Anwar Ibrahim was led away by police carrying assault rifles and
pushed into a van.
	   Hundreds of his angry supporters shouted, ``God is great,'' and
``Long live Anwar,'' shaking their fists as police lead Anwar out
of the house where he has conducted almost two weeks of protest
rallies against the 17-year-rule of Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   Hundreds of riot police blocked off roads in the well-heeled
neighborhood to prevent his supporters from marching after the van.
	   The violence occurred more than two hours after an unprecedented
rally at the capital's central Merdeka (Freedom) Square, where
Anwar Ibrahim had lead 35,000 people in chanting demands for
Mahathir's resignation.
	   The demonstrators then marched to the front gate of the prime
minister's official residence. They were met by riot police wearing
riot shields and masks who fired tear gas bombs and water cannon.
	   Smoke filled the highway in front of the residence as the police
fired at least three volleys. Thousands of people, many screaming,
``What is it?'' wrapped their faces in cloths and tried to get back
to the center of town.
	   Anwar, 51, was fired by Mahathir on Sept. 2 from his posts as
deputy prime minister and finance minister.
	   He was arrested, according to one of Anwar's attorneys, under a
law banning sodomy. Three attorneys were allowed to accompany him
and they expect him to be charged Monday.
	   Police have said they were investigating allegations against
Anwar of treason, sexual misconduct and abuse of power. Anwar had
predicted he would be arrested at the end of the Commonwealth
Games, which close Monday.
	   Sunday's newspapers carried banner-headlined stories containing
explicit details of the alleged offenses, confessed in a Sessions
Court hearing on Saturday by Anwar's adopted brother and a friend.
Both men had been denied access to their relatives or lawyers
during their police detention.
	   Sodomy is a crime in this conservative Muslim country, and both
men were sentenced to six months in prison.
	   Anwar has vehemently denied the charges and said they have been
cooked up by Mahathir, who fears his growing popularity and the
challenge to his rule.
	   The violence has sullied the state visit of Queen Elizabeth II,
who was worshiping at a nearby church during the rally at Merdeka
Square, the site where Malaysian independence from Britain was
declared in 1957.
	   She was due to meet with Mahathir Monday.
	   Anwar's appearance in the center of the capital, at the
beginning of the royal visit, was the culmination of a week of
nationwide rallies in which he has called for Mahathir's
resignation and accused the 72-year-old leader of corruption.
	   Mahathir told reporters earlier Sunday he was not intimidated by
the words or the swelling crowds at Anwar's meetings.
	   ``I am not concerned at all,'' Mahathir said. ``But he has been
holding rallies which have been illegal.''
	   Mahathir denied he was directing the police investigation of the
man he once designated as his successor, and denied Anwar's
allegations that witnesses had been tortured into confessing they
committed sodomy with Anwar.
	   Anwar, fighting for his freedom and political life, appeared
before more than 35,000 exuberant supporters in Merdeka Square
after marching at the head of a chanting throng from the National
Mosque.
	   Such public demonstrations, defying police and showing
disrespect for Mahathir are without precedent. Opposition parties
have routinely been denied permission to hold rallies.
	   ``I am here for justice. I will remain with him until there is
justice,'' said Hasny Zai, 21, a student of Kuala Lumpur's Islamic
University over cries of ``Reformasi.''
	   The word, meaning ``Reform,'' was worn on thousands of headbands
and T-shirts in the style of student activists in Indonesia who led
a campaign that culminated in the ouster President Suharto, once
Asia's longest-serving leader.
	   ``Malaysians have waited a long time. We have given Dr. Mahathir
enough time. Enough is enough,'' Anwar screamed.
	   Before leaving the mosque, about a kilometer (a mile) away from
where the just-arrived queen was attending church at St. Mary's
Cathedral, Anwar called on police to refuse Mahathir's orders and
protect the people.
	   Marchers booed as police vehicles passed, but there was no
interference or violence.
	   The political developments have distracted media attention from
the ongoing Commonwealth Games. Many of the 2,000 reporters and
broadcasters left the Games venues Sunday to focus on Anwar.
	   But local television stations ignored Anwar's mammoth rally in
their evening newscasts.

Hurricane Georges becomes `extremely dangerous' category 4 storm
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES hurricane position; UPDATES with first effects felt in
eastern islands; EDITS throughout. At 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT),
Georges was centered at 16.3 north latitude and 58.5 west
longitude, about 195 miles (310 kilometers) east of Guadeloupe &QL;

	   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) _ Rough surf and gathering clouds were
the first signs of trouble at dawn Sunday for residents of the
eastern Caribbean as Hurricane Georges bore down on the islands
with ferocious 150 mph (240 kph) winds.
	   ``This hurricane is now being described as one of the most
dangerous to visit the Leeward Islands in many years,'' warned
Prime Minister Denzil Douglas in the twin-island nation of St.
Kitts and Nevis. ``It is likely the full force of Hurricane Georges
will be felt late Sunday afternoon and evening.''
	   The weather began deteriorating Sunday morning in the eastern
islands.
	   ``The first effects of the hurricane were noticeable at 9 in the
morning,'' said Jean Fedini, the French governor in Guadeloupe,
where a curfew was put into effect.
	   A few squalls were also reported over the islands of Antigua and
Dominica as the outer edge of the hurricane began to brush land.
	   The eye of Georges, with sustained winds of 150 mph (240 kph)
was expected to pass over the small, eastern Caribbean islands
later Sunday before moving on to threaten the U.S. and British
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Monday, according to the National
Hurricane Center in Miami.
	   At 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT) Sunday, Georges was centered near 16.3
degrees north latitude and 58.5 degrees west longitude, or about
195 miles (310 kilometers) east of Guadeloupe in the Lesser
Antilles.
	   Georges' clearly defined eye was moving almost due west at 17
mph (27 kph) and was projected to head west-northwest during the
day. Hurricane-force winds extended 85 miles (135 kilometers) from
the center.
	   Georges strengthened Saturday to a category 4 hurricane on the
Saffir-Simpson scale _ comparable to Hurricane Andrew, which
devastated parts of southern Florida in 1992, or Hurricane Hugo,
which caused severe damage in the Caribbean in 1989.
	   Hurricane warnings were extended Sunday morning as far west as
Puerto Rico, leaving all of the eastern Caribbean north of Dominica
under a warning.
	   In the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, where 3.8 million
residents waited in the path of the storm, many people began
covering windows with plywood and stocking up on supplies Saturday
even though Georges wasn't expected to arrive until Monday morning.
	   ``From the path I've seen on the news, it's coming on strong and
could really affect us,'' said San Juan resident Heriberto Cruz,
who was shopping Saturday for batteries, water and other
necessities.
	   On St. Croix, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, residents who remember
when Hurricane Hugo damaged 95 percent of the island's homes in
1989 rushed to supermarkets and waited in long lines at gas
stations.
	   ``I am totally bewildered,'' said Josiah Mercury as she
hurriedly picked up crackers and bottled water at a supermarket.
``The most I can do is prepare and take the warning seriously.''
	   Jean-Jack Queyranne, the French minister of overseas
departments, sent 40 public service officers each to Martinique and
Guadeloupe to prepare for the hurricane.
	   The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency sent Early Response
Teams, which include health care workers, engineers, firefighters
and other professionals, to the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico
ahead of the storm.
	   The Hurricane Center said storm surge flooding of five to 10
feet (1.5 to 3 meters) above normal tide levels should be expected
along with five to eight inches (13 to 20 centimeters) of rain,
with heavier rainfall possible in some areas.

Pope beatifies campaigner for Catholic schools

<TEXT>
	   BRESCIA, Italy (AP) _ Under a strange, sloping crucifix that had
Jesus dangling head down, Pope John Paul II on Sunday beatified a
19th-century layman who campaigned ardently for Catholic schools.
	   The towering, modernistic construction has been the subject of
intense debate in this prosperous city at the edge of the Italian
Alps, which has been preparing for the papal visit for months.
	   Thirty meters (Ninety feet) high, it curved precipitously over
the platform where John Paul, resplendent in a green robe, presided
over the beatification of local son Giuseppe Tovini.
	   Beatification is a step toward sainthood.
	   A poor boy who made good, Tovini founded Catholic schools,
newspapers, banks, insurance companies and charities at a time when
public sentiment in Italy, then a new nation, was turning against
what some saw as the church's excessive influence on society.
	   Among the banks Tovini founded was Banco Ambrosiano, which grew
to be Italy's largest private bank until it collapsed in 1982,
creating a huge financial scandal for the Vatican, which owned part
of the bank.
	   A lawyer and the father of 10 children, Tovini died in 1897, the
same year another local son, the future Pope Paul VI, was born.
John Paul's predecessor, Paul was pontiff from 1963 to 1978 and
presided over the historic reforms of the Second Vatican Council.
	   Shaded by a golden canopy, John Paul urged the 30,000
worshippers gathered at the city stadium to follow Tovini's
example.
	   ``Fervent, loyal, active in social and political life, Giuseppe
Tovini proclaimed with his life the Christian message,'' he said.
	   Tovini's beatification comes as the Roman Catholic Church is
pressing the Italian government to fund church schools.
	   Like the crucifix, created for the pope's visit by a prominent
stage designer, the campaign has provoked intense debate.
	   Some, especially on the conservative end of the spectrum, are
for it, saying church schools promote moral values. Others are
adamantly opposed, saying it would jeopardize Italy's hard-won
separation of church and state.
	   Brescia, a city of 200,000 near Lake Garda, was the second and
final stop on the pope's weekend pastoral visit to northern Italy.
The 78-year-old pontiff also visited Chiavari on the Italian
Riviera south of Genoa.

	   SAINT-NOM-LA-BRETECHE, France (AP) _ Miguel Angel Jimenez
chipped a spectacular 25-yard putt on the 18th to win the pounds
133,330 (dlrs 209,000) first prize at the Lancome Trophy Sunday,
just after American rivals Mark O'Meara and David Duval dropped
shots at the same hole.
	   The Spaniard ended the tournament 11-under par, two shots ahead
of Duval, O'Meara, Jarmo Sandelin of Sweden and New Zealand's Greg
Turner.
	   Duval, the biggest money winner of the year, looked well placed
to win his first European tournament, but double-bogeyed the par-3
18th after hitting his tee shot into the water.
	   O'Meara, the defending champion here and Duval's playing
partner, also bogeyed on the last hole before Jimenez's spectacular
putt.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ With a wail of sunset sirens and prayerful
pilgrimages to the Western Wall, Israel on Sunday ushered in the
New Year _ 5759 by the Jewish calendar.
	   In the hours before the start of the two-day Rosh Hashana
holiday, preparations were festive but frantic, and some people's
nerves were on edge over threats from Islamic militants.
	   On streets and in markets, shoppers swarmed and sellers shouted.
Children scooted underfoot while Israeli soldiers made constant
swivel-eyed surveys of the scene.
	   Security was tight, with Palestinians from the West Bank and
Gaza Strip banned from entering Israel. The militant Islamic group
Hamas had threatened bombings and kidnappings of Israeli soldiers
during the holidays after two of its fugitives were killed earlier
this month by Israeli troops.
	   Jerusalem's covered Mahane Yehuda market, scene of last-minute
shopping sprees on Sunday, was itself the target of a suicide
bombing in July 1997 that killed 15 people and injured dozens.
Holiday shoppers, though, put those memories aside.
	   ``Sweet challah bread for a sweet new year!'' bakery workers
called, pointing to shining, fresh piles of braided loaves.
Shoppers filled baskets with apples and honey, fish heads and
dates, vegetables and spices.
	   Pnina Tel-Dan, who lives in the West Bank settlement of Maale
Adumim, was one of thousands of people scurrying to shop for the
makings of holiday meals.
	   ``For me, buying spices is like buying jewelry _ all these
beautiful colors!'' she said, waving at powdery heaps of red, green
and yellow.
	   Rosh Hashana is marked by special prayers and readings in
synagogues and the blowing of a shofar, or ram's horn. Many
observant Jews go to the Western Wall in the old city, Judaism's
holiest site, to pray.
	   Most businesses in Israel closed for the holiday, and public
transportation stopped running as well.
	   Israelis were mainly spending the holiday with family at home or
heading out for vacations at spots like the Sea of Galilee or
Egypt's Sinai peninsula.
	   The continuing deadlock with the Palestinians put a damper on
celebrations for some. American mediator Dennis Ross left Israel
before dawn Sunday after yet another failed attempt to revive
negotiations.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat blamed one another for the impasse.
	   Israeli stores were filled all week with shoppers buying holiday
presents, and on Sunday, it seemed that every other person hurrying
past was toting a big bouquet or a cellophane-wrapped gift basket.
	   Israeli merchants, not normally noted for effusiveness,
constantly called out ``Shana tova!'' _ Happy New Year! _ to
customers and passers-by.
	   Roland Redrash, a 44-year-old computer engineer, was
concentrating on the list of ingredients his wife had given him for
a traditional meal: apples for dipping in honey, challah, fish
heads _ ``so we can be at the head (of the year) and not the
tail,'' he said.
	   Fruit merchant Menahem Mizrahi stopped selling bananas long
enough for a burst of bravado.
	   ``Who's afraid?'' he said. ``The people of Israel are alive and
well.''
	   Marina Koshmer, who immigrated from the former Soviet republic
of Moldova six months ago. She hadn't heard of the Hamas warnings,
but like so many immigrants, she had her own worries about
adjusting to life here.
	   ``I want to find work. I'm a music teacher, and I don't have a
job,'' she said.
	   Tal Yaakov, a 46-year-old Jerusalemite, dispatched one of his
children to pick up one last bag of vegetables. His New Year's
wish?
	   ``Peace,'' he said. ``And maybe a new government.''

Yannick Noah wins Compaq Senior tournament in Paris
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Yannick Noah won his first worldwide senior
tournament this year, defeating Guy Forget 7-6 (3), 6-2 in an
all-French final Sunday in the Compaq Senior tournament.
	   ``I have to thank Guy for having practiced with me last week.
That enabled me to beat him today,'' Noah said after the game.
	   Noah had not won a title on the worldwide senior circuit since
October 1996 in Pesaro, Italy.
	   ``Yannick played a fantastic match,'' said Forget, who was
playing just his second senior's event.
	   Defending champion John McEnroe finished third by defeating
Guillermo Vilas of Argentina 6-2, 6-0 to move to No. 2 on the
Nuveen Masters Point standing, 175 points behind Jimmy Connors.
	   The Compaq Senior is the fourth stop on the Delta Airlines ATP
Senior Tour of Champions.

Effenberg's threat to quit adds to Germany's soccer crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Midfielder Stefan Effenberg, hailed as a
savior one month ago, deepened the German soccer crisis Saturday
with the surprise announcement he wants to quit the troubled
national team.
	   The red-headed Bayern Munich player had been called back to
international duty after a wave of soul-searching swept the country
over the state of German soccer following the recent World Cup.
	   After years of success, three-time World Cup winner Germany made
an ignomious early quarterfinal exit for the second straight time
in France.
	   ``We've fallen way behind Holland, France and Spain. We're out
of step. If we don't watch out, we'll be on the same level as
Albania,'' warned German soccer legend Franz Beckenbauer on ARD
television.
	   Effenberg, kicked off the squad at the 1994 World Cup in France
for making an obscene gesture at a spectator, was supposed to play
a key role in the aging team's rebuilding effort.
	   Effenberg, 30, is one of the country's few creative playmakers
and creativity was among the missing ingredients when three-time
World Cup winner Germany was shocked 3-0 by underdog Croatia in
France.
	   Effenberg told new national team coach Erich Ribbeck he may want
to quit again to concentrate on Bayern Munich and spent time with
his family.
	   ``He didn't make a final decision and asked for time to think it
over until Wednesday,'' said Ribbeck.
	   Effenberg had turned in mediocre performances during his debut
in two friendlies a few weeks ago. The new-look national team
struggled to a 2-1 win over soccer weakling Malta and a lucky 1-1
draw against Romania.
	   The midfielder's plans to quit apparently were influenced by the
matches on Malta. From the start, Effenberg had been leery of the
expectations surrounding him by the country's desperate fans and
soccer officials.
	   ``I'm not the savior of German soccer,'' said Effenberg at the
time. ``I know if things hadn't been so bad at the World Cup, there
wouldn't be any Effenberg, national team player.''
	   Berti Vogts, forced to resign under pressure after the two
friendlies, repeatedly swore he would never allow the controversial
redhead back onto the team as long as he was coach.
	   But Vogts, who kicked Effenberg off the team at the 1994 World
Cup, did just that in hopes of saving his job with promising
performances at Malta.
	   Ribbeck had planned to build his new team around Bayern Munich
players, led by Effenberg, along with goalie Oliver Kahn and aging
libero Lothar Matthaeus.
	   Inter Milan forward Oliver Bierhoff, the team captain, had been
the other major player in Ribbeck's plans.
	   The turmoil in German soccer continued Friday with a shakeup of
the Bundesliga's governing committee. Only two of the 12 members
were voted back.
	   The head of German soccer, Egidius Braun, has also come under
fire.
	   But no one in Germany has offered concrete solutions how to
overcome the national team player's tactical and ball-handling
deficits exposed in France.
	   During the friendlies on Malta, Vogts attempted to abandon the
system used by Germany for 25 years and dropped the libero
position. But the players rebelled.
	   Effenberg's announcement quickly drew criticism, including words
from Germany's new assistant coach, Ulli Stielike.
	   ``Two weeks ago, he celebrated his comeback, now he wants to end
his international career again. I can't understand it,'' said
Stielike. ``But as a player he will be a loss for us.''

Despatie, age 13, wins gold for Canada
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Scoring a perfect 10.00 from the
Malaysian judge for his reverse 1 1/2 somersault, 13-year-old
Alexandre Despatie won the Commonwealth Games men's platform diving
gold medal for Canada by a huge margin Sunday.
	   With only one comparative failure in round three, Despatie
strung together a series of consistent scores for a total of
652.110 points to take the gold.
	   Robert Newbery of Australia totaled 605.610 for the silver, just
ahead of England's Leon Taylor, who had 603.540.
	   Canada also triumphed on the women's 3-meter springboard with
Eryn Bulmer edging Chantelle Michell of Australia and another
Canadian, Myriam Boileau, taking the bronze.
	   Bulmer totaled 515.880 after her five dives, with Michell
scoring 506.520 and Boileau 480.570.
	   They were Canada's only two golds of the diving competition
compared with Australia's three and one for Zimbabwe.
	   Australia's gold-winning Shannon Roy reported his medal stolen
Sunday and believed it had been taken just hours after he had won
the 3-meter springboard title Saturday.
	   ``It's only a material thing and the title is still mine,'' he
said. ``I'm in the history books but it's just the fact that
someone would take something so special.''

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ With a wail of sirens at sunset and prayerful
pilgrimages to the Western Wall, Israel on Sunday ushered in the
New Year _ 5759 by the Jewish calendar.
	   In the hours before the start of the two-day Rosh Hashana
holiday, preparations were festive but frantic, and some people's
nerves were on edge over threats from Islamic militants.
	   On streets and in markets, shoppers swarmed and sellers shouted.
Children scooted underfoot while Israeli soldiers surveyed of the
scene.
	   Security was tight, with Palestinians from the West Bank and
Gaza Strip banned from entering Israel. The militant Islamic group
Hamas had threatened bombings and kidnappings of Israeli soldiers
during the holidays after two of its fugitives were killed earlier
this month by Israeli troops.
	   Jerusalem's covered Mahane Yehuda market, scene of last-minute
shopping sprees on Sunday, was itself the target of a suicide
bombing in July 1997 that killed 15 people and injured dozens.
Holiday shoppers, though, put those memories aside.
	   ``Sweet challah bread for a sweet new year!'' bakery workers
called, pointing to shining, fresh piles of braided loaves.
Shoppers filled baskets with apples and honey, fish heads and
dates, vegetables and spices.
	   Pnina Tel-Dan, who lives in the West Bank settlement of Maale
Adumim, was one of thousands of people scurrying to shop for
ingredients for holiday meals.
	   ``For me, buying spices is like buying jewelry _ all these
beautiful colors!'' she said, waving at powdery heaps of red, green
and yellow.
	   Rosh Hashana is marked by special prayers and readings in
synagogues and the blowing of a shofar, or ram's horn. Many
observant Jews pray at the Western Wall in Jerusalem's old city,
Judaism's holiest site.
	   Most businesses in Israel closed for the holiday, and public
transportation stopped running as well.
	   Israelis were mainly spending the holiday with family at home or
heading out for vacations at spots like the Sea of Galilee or
Egypt's Sinai peninsula.
	   The continuing deadlock with the Palestinians put a damper on
celebrations for some. American mediator Dennis Ross left Israel
before dawn Sunday after yet another failed attempt to revive
negotiations.
	   Israeli stores were filled all week with shoppers buying holiday
presents, and on Sunday, it seemed that every other person hurrying
past was toting a big bouquet or a cellophane-wrapped gift basket.
	   Israeli merchants, not normally noted for effusiveness,
constantly called out ``Shana tova!'' _ Happy New Year! _ to
customers and passers-by.
	   Roland Redrash, a 44-year-old computer engineer, was
concentrating on the list of ingredients his wife had given him for
a traditional meal: apples for dipping in honey, challah, fish
heads _ ``so we can be at the head (of the year) and not the
tail,'' he said.
	   Fruit merchant Menahem Mizrahi stopped selling bananas long
enough for a burst of bravado despite the continuing tensions with
Palestinians.
	   ``Who's afraid?'' he said. ``The people of Israel are alive and
well.''
	   Tal Yaakov, a 46-year-old Jerusalemite, dispatched one of his
children to pick up one last bag of vegetables. His New Year's
wish?
	   ``Peace,'' he said. ``And maybe a new government.''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Kelly Morgan of Wales beat India's
Aparna Popat 13-10, 11-5 Sunday for the women's badminton singles

and Choong Tan Fook beat England's Simon Archer and Christopher
Hunt 15-13, 15-11. In the day's only three-game match, Cheah Soon

Albanians propose interim solution amid violence in Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian leaders released
details of their proposal for an interim solution for Serbia's
troubled Kosovo province Sunday, calling for a three-year period of
autonomy followed by a referendum if Kosovo's final status has not
been determined.
	   The release of the proposal came amid reports of fresh fighting
in the last ethnic Albanian rebel stronghold.
	   The ethnic Albanian daily Koha Ditore published 16 suggestions
from a proposal drafted by Albanian leaders, envisaging Kosovo's
future status as ``temporarily part of Yugoslavia, as an
independent entity equal to the other two republics in the
federation.''
	   Yugoslavia is comprised of two republics _ tiny Montenegro and
dominant Serbia, of which Kosovo is a province.
	   A member of Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova's negotiating team,
Ilijaz Kurteshi, confirmed the authenticity of the published plan,
but added it has yet to be fine-tuned.
	   ``This is a phase of reconciling different opinions and I expect
the American side will uphold our proposals in future
negotiations,'' Kurteshi told The Associated Press on Sunday.
	   A Western diplomat close to negotiations, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, applauded the Albanian proposal as a sign
of progress from the Albanian team.
	   ``This shows some resolve on their part, but it's only a step in
the process,'' he said. ``None of this is the final word. The Serbs
will come up with their proposal and counter-proposals and then
we'll have a real negotiation process going.''
	   Last week, the Americans released details of their own proposal
for a three-year interim solution to the Kosovo crisis. The U.S.
draft would give ethnic Albanians control over local affairs but
keep them part of Serbia.
	   On Friday Rugova, who favors independence but opposes the armed
struggle, gave his backing for the U.S.-sponsored plan, calling it
the best starting ground for peace.
	   According to the diplomat, the Serb side could come up with
their suggestions as early as Monday, when U.S. envoy Christopher
Hill is scheduled to visit the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade.
	   In the Albanian proposal, Kosovo would have its own parliament,
government and courts, as well as its own police and an independent
Central Bank, but would be part of a common market with the rest of
Yugoslavia. Kosovo's borders could remain in the hands of the
Yugoslav army and federal customs authorities.
	   The proposal said if Belgrade and Kosovo fail to negotiate a
lasting solution to the province's status during a three-year
interim period, Kosovo's residents would vote on final status in a
referendum _ something Serbia adamantly rejects.
	   Also Sunday, the Kosovo Information Center, which is close to
the Albanian leadership, claimed Serb forces launched a new
offensive early Sunday on two villages in the central Drenica
region, about 30 kilometers (19 miles) west of Pristina, one of the
largest and last rebel strongholds.
	   No information from the Serb side was immediately available and
the report could not be independently confirmed.
	   The center also reported a total of eleven Albanian civilians
were killed in clashes between Podujevo and Mitrovica in northern
Kosovo, where fighting broke out last Wednesday. AP photographers
saw six of the bodies, all of them male and charred beyond
recognition, that had been burned in three different Albanian
houses in the village of Dobratim, 35 kilometers (21 miles)
northwest of Pristina.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army also issued a statement saying
five members died in battles in the area, raising the death toll in
this week's northern Serb offensive to 24, according to Albanian
sources.
	   More than 600 people have been killed and more than 275,000 made
homeless since Serb forces launched an armed crackdown in the
province in late February.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two British charity workers arrived in Moscow on
Sunday after Chechen kidnappers released them from their 14-month
captivity.
	   Camilla Carr and Jon James were kidnapped in July 1997 while on
a charitable mission in Chechnya for a Quaker relief organization,
the Center for Peacemaking and Community Development.
	   Their release ``shows the benefits of co-operation between our
government and the Russian government,'' said a spokesman for
Britain's Foreign Office, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   Britain's ambassador to Moscow, Sir Andrew Wood, met Carr and
James at a private airport near Moscow's Sheremetyevo International
Airport. He thanked Russian financier and regional trouble-shooter
Boris Berezovsky for helping win the hostages' release, and said no
ransom had been paid.
	   Berezovsky refused to speak with reporters at the airport, and
he quickly ushered two Russian soldiers who had also been released
into his limousine.
	   Vladimir Ivanenko and Alexander Dubnov, both from the southern
Rostov region, had been captured during Russia's 1994-96 war to
stop the Chechens' drive for independence, Russian television
reported Sunday. They were shown on television shaking hands with
Salman Raduyev, a former Chechen field commander who reportedly
brokered their release.
	   ``By this act we call on the Russian side to meet us half way,''
Raduyev said. ``We are ready to continue the release of Russian
prisoners of war, but we expect the Russian side to do the same
with Chechen prisoners.''
	   The Chechen side has been pressing Russia to release two Chechen
women arrested in Russia on suspicion of terrorism.
	   Kazbek Dzysoyev, an inhabitant of the North Ossetia region that
borders on Chechnya, was also freed Saturday night after nearly
four months in captivity. A ransom was paid for his release, the
television report said.
	   Wood, the British ambassador, spoke with Carr and James by
telephone before they boarded a plane flying from the southern
Russian republic of Ingushetia to Moscow on Sunday afternoon. He
reported that they were ``absolutely elated and very happy to be on
their way home to see their families,'' an embassy spokeswoman
said.
	   Camilla Carr's sister Alexandra Little said on Sunday: ``It's
absolutely wonderful. We're ecstatic. We're in a state of shock and
disbelief. It's just such fantastic news.
	   ``I could not believe it when the Foreign Office phoned us. We
have heard so many rumors over the past months, that I had to get
him to repeat it several times. It has only just sunk in.''
	   Carr and James, both medics, had traveled to Chechnya to
establish a center for helping children recover from the trauma of
war.

Hurricane Georges becomes `extremely dangerous' category 4 storm
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES hurricane position; UPDATES with first effects felt in
eastern islands; EDITS throughout. At 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT),
Georges was centered at 16.3 north latitude and 58.5 west
longitude, about 195 miles (310 kilometers) east of Guadeloupe &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT HOFFMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) _ Rough surf and gathering clouds at
dawn Sunday were the first signs of trouble for residents of the
eastern Caribbean as Hurricane Georges bore down on the islands
with ferocious 150 mph (240 kph) winds.
	   ``This hurricane is now being described as one of the most
dangerous to visit the Leeward Islands in many years,'' warned
Prime Minister Denzil Douglas of the twin-island nation of St.
Kitts and Nevis. ``It is likely the full force of Hurricane Georges
will be felt late Sunday afternoon and evening.''
	   ``The first effects of the hurricane were noticeable at nine in
the morning,'' said Jean Fedini, governor of the French island of
Guadeloupe, where a curfew was put into effect.
	   A few squalls were also reported over the islands of Antigua and
Dominica as the outer edge of the hurricane began to brush land.
	   The eye of Georges was expected to pass over the small, eastern
Caribbean islands later Sunday before moving on to threaten the
U.S. and British Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Monday,
according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
	   At 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT) Sunday, Georges was centered near 16.3
degrees north latitude and 58.5 degrees west longitude, or about
195 miles (310 kilometers) east of Guadeloupe in the Lesser
Antilles.
	   Georges' clearly defined eye was moving almost due west at 17
mph (27 kph) and was projected to head west-northwest during the
day. Hurricane-force winds extended 85 miles (135 kilometers) from
the center.
	   Georges strengthened Saturday to a category 4 hurricane on the
Saffir-Simpson scale _ comparable to Hurricane Andrew, which
devastated parts of southern Florida in 1992, or Hurricane Hugo,
which caused severe damage in the Caribbean in 1989.
	   Hurricane warnings were extended Sunday morning as far west as
Puerto Rico, leaving all of the eastern Caribbean north of Dominica
under a warning.
	   In the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, where 3.8 million
residents waited in the path of the storm, many people began
covering windows with plywood and stocking up on supplies on
Saturday.
	   ``From the path I've seen on the news, it's coming on strong and
could really affect us,'' said San Juan resident Heriberto Cruz,
who was shopping Saturday for batteries, water and other
necessities.
	   On St. Croix, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, residents who remember
when 1989's Hurricane Hugo damaged 95 percent of the island's homes
rushed to supermarkets and waited in long lines at gas stations.
	   ``I am totally bewildered,'' said Josiah Mercury as she
hurriedly picked up crackers and bottled water at a supermarket.
``The most I can do is prepare and take the warning seriously.''
	   Jean-Jack Queyranne, the French minister of overseas
departments, sent 40 public service officers each to Martinique and
Guadeloupe to prepare for the hurricane.
	   The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency sent Early Response
Teams, which include health care workers, engineers, firefighters
and other professionals, to the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico
ahead of the storm.
	   The Hurricane Center said storm surge flooding of five to 10
feet (1.5 to 3 meters) above normal tide levels should be expected
along with five to eight inches (13 to 20 centimeters) of rain,
with heavier rainfall possible in some areas.

Far Right, Socialists battle for parliamentary seat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Voters went out in small numbers Sunday to cast
ballots in a French parliamentary by-election called after the
Socialist victory over a far right candidate was annulled.
	   The vote was expected to be close, and results were not expected
before late Sunday night at the earliest. Voter turnout at midday
was just over 20 percent.
	   The far right National Front is battling to keep its only seat
in parliament in the election in the southern French port of
Toulon.
	   In May, Socialist Odette Casanova won just 33 more votes than
her National Front opponent, Cendrine Le Chevallier, but it was
enough to deliver the far right an unexpected electoral setback.
	   The vote, however, was annulled later that month after the
National Front protested the count.
	   It was the third time that voters in Toulon were being asked to
choose a representative in the National Assembly, or parliament.
	   France's highest constitutional authority in February annulled
the election of Le Chevallier's husband, Jean-Marie, a National
Front deputy, for breaking campaign financing rules.
	   The National Front, which has won about 15 percent in recent
regional elections, blames immigrants, especially from North
Africa, for high unemployment and rising urban violence. It has
also been accused of anti-Semitism and racism.
	   The vote came on the same day the National Front was holding its
annual two-day celebration in Paris.

over his will, police officials said Sunday.
	   Fawakih Ibrahim Abdel-Latif killed her husband, Sayed Ahmed _
who weighed 55 kilograms (121 pounds) _ Saturday after discovering
he had left more land in his will for his four children from his
first wife than the three he had with her.
	   Islam allows men to have up to four wives at the same time.
	   Abdel-Latif, 62, pushed her 84-year-old husband to the ground
and, with his face down, sat on his head until he died, said the
officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Police arrested Abdel-Latif, who confessed to killing her
husband. She could face the death penalty if convicted.
	   The incident occurred in the town of Tamiya, about 75 kilometers
(47 miles) south of the capital, Cairo.

Mandela asking for bias ruling against rugby judge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela has
appealed a court ruling on rugby that accused him of being
insolent, charging the judge was biased, his lawyer said Sunday.
	   The Sept. 11 appeal asked the Constitutional Court to overturn a
lower court ruling that dismissed Mandela's appointment of a
judicial commission to investigate racism and mismanagement in the
South Africa Rugby Football Union, Fink Haysom told The Associated
Press.
	   ``The bias charge is ... one very small leg of a comprehensive
criticism'' of the judgment, Haysom said.
	   Last month, Judge William de Villiers released a 1,159-page
formal report explaining his April ruling against Mandela's
commission. He wrote that Mandela's credibility was subject to
serious doubt, and some of his replies were far fetched.
	   Such public criticism was highly unusual for Mandela, who is
regarded as the hero of the anti-apartheid struggle and beyond
reproach.
	   The rugby union went to court to block the government's
investigation, dragging the president to the witness stand. That
enraged many blacks and some whites, who felt it had gone too far
and was trying to humiliate Mandela.
	   Haysom said De Villiers' findings provoked a perception that the
judge was biased, a standard used in South African law to measure a
judge's impartiality.
	   The judge also backed up the union's allegation that the
president rubber stamped the sports ministry's selection of panel
members to investigate rugby. The rugby union said Mandela should
have conducted an investigation before allowing the investigative
panel to be formed.
	   ``(It's) a strange proposition that the president should conduct
an inquiry before he decides to conduct an inquiry,'' Haysom said.
``That is not consonant with our legal principles.''
	   Events overtook the need for the rugby investigation when the
man behind the court challenge, union president Louis Luyt,
resigned and a new leadership apologized to Mandela.
	   Earlier this month, the rugby union elected its first black
president to replace Luyt.
	   Long a bastion of Afrikaners, the white descendants of Dutch
settlers who ruled during decades of apartheid, rugby was hated by
the majority of blacks.
	   But Mandela was determined to use sports to bridge the racial
divide, and in 1995 donned the famous green and yellow national
team rugby jersey after the World Cup victory at Ellis Park.
	   De Villiers' judgment drew fire from Mandela's ruling African
National Congress, which accused the judge of showing ``deep-seated
feelings of discontent with our new democracy.''
	   De Villiers was appointed a judge under the apartheid regime
that ended with 1994's first all-race election of Mandela as
president.

Harrison knocks out Mauritian to cap English dominance at boxing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS name to Macaque throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By VIJAY JOSHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Fighting angrily with ill-fitting
gloves, Audley Harrison knocked out Michael Macaque of Mauritius in
the first round Sunday, capping a day of four boxing gold medals
for England at the Commonwealth Games.
	   Harrison needed only 65 seconds to end the super-heavyweight
fight with a powerful left straight that left Macaque on his knees,
unable to get up.
	   Canada, meanwhile, came out of the finals in 12 weight divisions
with three gold medals and three silvers.
	   Just before the 190-centimeter (6-foot-3), 114-kilogram
(251-pound) Harrison went into the ring, the judges ordered him to
discard his personal gloves and wear a new pair provided by the
games. The gloves were too tight and Harrison said he couldn't make
a proper fist for the bout, the day's last.
	   ``That really got me more angry ... but it worked to my
advantage because I went looking for it with bad intentions,'' he
said.
	   With Macaque still down, Harrison already was draped in
England's flag and had taken off his headgear to reveal
close-cropped hair dyed in yellow tiger stripes.
	   As the public address system played ``Top of the World'' after
the medal ceremony, Harrison declared that he is the greatest
super-heavyweight boxer England has produced. He said he will turn
professional after the 2000 Olympics.
	   ``I will definintely turn professional,'' said the London-born
Harrison, whose parents migrated to England from Jamaica.
	   ``I would like to stay around and do the Olympics. I will win an
Olympic gold without a doubt (and) if I turn professional, I will
win the world title without a doubt.''
	   ``I will turn pro late. I will still be moving, I will still
have the power, I will still have the strength, still have the
skills. I will still have my senses,'' said the 26-year-old
Harrison, who won this year's Amateur Boxing Association
super-heavyweight title.
	   England's boxing gold haul is its best ever at the Commonwealth
Games, and it also won two bronzes.
	   ``I said we would win six medals. But I didn't expect four
golds,'' said national coach Ian Irwin.
	   The other English gold winners were Courtney Fry, who defeated
Troy Amos Ross of Canada at light heavyweight; John Pearce, who
beat Jitender Kumar of India at middleweight, and Chris Bessey, who
beat Scott McIntosh of Canada at light middleweight.
	   ``Definitely it is very satisfying to break Canada's
stranglehold,'' said Irwin. Canada sent in six finalists, a
Commonwealth record for the country, including defending champion
Michael Strange at light welterweight.
	   Strange defeated Gerry Legras of the Seychelles and immediately
declared that free beer will be served to all customers for an hour
at the bar he owns in Niagara Falls. The happy hour was to begin
the moment Canadian television broadcast tape of his victory later
Sunday.
	   ``You never get used to going to the top of the podium and
taking the flag with you and being No. 1,'' said Strange, who won
the title at the 1994 Victoria games as well.
	   History was also made by Raymond Narh of Ghana and Biki Sapok of
Malaysia, who won the first boxing golds ever for their countries
in a major international event.
	   Narh defeated Asghar Ali of Pakistan in a grueling 30-27 bout in
the lightweight category.
	   Ali ``will need a good massage tonight ... and I am going to
jubilate,'' said Narh, 20, adding that he promised his mother he
would come back with a gold.
	   His gold was also the first boxing medal for Ghana at a world
tournament since the legendary Azuma Nelson won the Olympic silver
in featherweight.
	   But the biggest cheers from a packed stadium of 8,000 fans were
heard at the first bout when Sapok, a bombardier in the Malaysian
army, defeated Moses Kinyua of Kenya at light flyweight.
	   After winning, Sapok ran to his corner and unrolled a picture of
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who was watching from the stands.
	   ``I am the king of the ring,'' Sapok declared, as his parents
wept with joy in the stands.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Susan Barrantes, mother of the Duchess of York,
has been killed in a car crash in Argentina, dealing the former
Sarah Ferguson another cruel blow just a year after her onetime
sister-in-law Princess Diana died in a Paris crash.
	   The duchess, or ``Fergie,'' ex-wife of Queen Elizabeth II's
second son, Prince Andrew, heard the news early Sunday while on
vacation in Italy.
	   She was flying back to Britain and will leave Sunday night for
Argentina, where Mrs. Barrantes settled in 1975 with her second
husband, Argentine professional polo player the late Hector
Barrantes.
	   ``She is devastated,'' said spokeswoman Kate Waddington.
	   Mrs. Barrantes, 61, was killed instantly Saturday night when the
Land Rover she was driving was in collision with a van on a rural
road near Tres Lomas, about 310 miles (550 kms) southwest of the
capital, Buenos Aires, police said.
	   Mrs. Barrantes was decapitated in the crash, Tres Lomas Police
Commissioner Hector Dimas Moleneuvo told The Associated Press in
Buenos Aires.
	   The collision on the Argentine pampas was near the ranch, El
Pucara, where she raised polo ponies. She also had a TV station in
Buenos Aires.
	   The Land Rover was left a heap of twisted metal, shattered glass
and plastic. However, Mrs. Barrantes's passenger, nephew by
marriage Rafael Barrantes, 25, escaped with minor injuries.
	   The driver of the other car, Jose Maria Rodriguez, suffered a
broken ankle, police said.
	   Mrs. Barrantes abruptly left Maj. Ronald Ferguson, the queen's
former polo manager, and their two daughters, then teen-agers, for
Barrantes _ becoming in the parlance of the English upper-classes
``a bolter.''
	   However, the duchess, now 38, remained close to her mother and
stepfather. She visited Hector Barrantes at the ranch shortly
before his death from cancer in 1990.
	   The duchess's sister, Jane Luedecke, who lives in Australia, was
flying separately to Buenos Aires.
	   Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced. But Ms.
Waddington said Mrs. Barrantes would be buried alongside her second
husband near Buenos Aires.
	   The queen, on a tour of Malaysia, was ``shocked and very
saddened,'' her press secretary, Geoff Crawford, said.
	   The duchess was in Italy with her younger daughter, Princess
Eugenie, 8, when the news broke. Aides said Eugenie will remain at
Sunninghill, the mansion west of London where Andrew and Fergie
have separate quarters. Their elder child, Princess Beatrice, 10,
who was with Andrew, will be there too.
	   Initially the duchess's spokeswoman said Eugenie would go to
Balmoral, the queen's Scottish estate.
	   The blow came as life seemed to be picking up for the
high-spending, controversial Fergie, oft-accused of trading on her
royal connections to help repay huge debts.
	   This summer, the duchess spent time in Italy with her latest
boyfriend, Count Gaddo della Gherardesca, and the queen recently
bought her a 1.5 million pound (dlrs 2.4 million) mansion near
Sunninghill.
	   Diana and Fergie, both divorced from the queen's sons, were
confidantes and Diana was a favorite aunt of the young princesses.
	   Mrs. Barrantes would visit Britain several times a year and she
and Fergie spoke on the phone regularly. They were last together at
a charity golf tournament near London July 20.
	   Despite Fergie's divorce from Andrew in 1996, Mrs. Barrantes
remained on good terms with the royal family.
	   But she would never, she said recently, return to live in
Britain.
	   ``I'm here making my own life, and it has simply nothing to do
with where I come from,'' she said.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A four story building under construction
collapsed Sunday, killing 10 laborers who were working on the site
and injuring seven others, domestic news agencies reported.
	   Fifteen construction workers are feared trapped under the debris
of the building located in Ghaziabad, 25 kilometers (14 miles) east
of New Delhi, the Press Trust of India reported.
	   Dozens of policemen and firefighters were sifting through the
concrete and iron rods to locate survivors. At least 30 laborers
were working when the building collapsed.
	   ``The toll is likely to go up as at least 15 laborers are still
feared trapped,'' said a police official who was supervising rescue
efforts.

Aussie mum wins women's marathon, Lesotho gains first medal

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Hurdler Tony Jarrett, for so long
used to finishing second or worse in major championships, finally
made it to gold Sunday when he triumphed in the 110-meter hurdles
at the Commonwealth Games.
	   A two-time silver and also bronze medalist at the World
Championships, runner-up twice at the last two Commonwealths and
fourth-place finisher at the Barcelona Olympics, the 30-year-old
Englishman edged Trinidad's Steve Brown by .01 to clock 13.47 in
the final.
	   ``I'm just glad I've got a gold medal around my neck,'' Jarrett
said.
	   ``After the finish I thought I had a chance but I told myself,
`Don't jump up and down just yet.' I did that once at the Olympic
Games when I thought I had a bronze but I was only fourth.''
	   On a good day for England away from the track too, boxer Audley
Harrison won the super-heavyweight gold with a first-round knockout
for the team's fourth title in 12 finals, and two more golds came
on the shooting range.
	   Without a gold or silver in the boxing arena, Australia,
meanwhile, remained rampant elsewhere, winning both men's and
women's hockey finals as well as two track gold medals
	   The men's hockey team silenced the home fans with a 4-0 victory
over Malaysia and the women crushed England 8-1.
	   Jarrett's long overdue victory was one of six finals in the
stadium Sunday evening after the the marathon races in the early
morning.
	   A 38-year-old mother of four who only started running in her
early 30s, Heather Turland surprised herself by winning the
marathon.
	   She now looks forward to running for Australia at the Sydney
Olympics in 2000, when she will be 40.
	   ``It's a dream come true. I never ever thought I'd win something
like this,'' said Turland. ``It's really special being my last
Commonwealth Games, but now it looks like I'll have to go on to
Sydney 2000.''
	   In the men's race on the same course, Thabiso Moqhali pulled
away in the final four miles (6.4 kilometers) to won Lesotho's
first medal at any major championships. Two Tanzanians, Simon
Bisiligitwa and Andea Suja, completed an African sweep of the
medals.
	   Kenya's Ester Wanjiru maintained her country's amazing record on
the track by winning the 10,000 meters, adding her gold to the
Kenyan triumphs in the men's 800, 5,000, 10,000 meters and 3,000
steeplechase.
	   New Zealand's world champion Beatrice Faumina, who was
Commonwealth runner-up four years ago, heaved a Games record 65.92
to win the women's discus, and South Africa's Riaan Botha also
claimed a Games mark of 5.60 to win the men's pole vault.
	   The men's long jump and women's high jump both wound up tied on
scores.
	   Australians Peter Burge and Jai Taurima both leaped 8.22 meters
and Burge was awarded the gold because of a better next best jump.
Sadly for Taurima, he missed the last three rounds because of a
groin injury.
	   South Africa's Hestrie Storbeck cleared 1.91 meters to win the
high jump ahead of England's Joanne Jennings, who made the same
height. The English jumper lost in a jump off which took place
because both had the same number of failures. Storbeck went clear
at 1.89 again but Jennings failed.
	   Away from Malaysia's National Stadium, Harrison's first round
knockout of Michael Macaque of Mauritius was the highlight of
England's four-gold performance in the boxing finals.
	   The powerfully built super-heavyweight unleashed a straight left
that jerked Macaque's head backward and his opponent crashed to the
floor. The referee didn't finish the count but called to the
ringside doctors to make sure he was all right.
	   Courtney Fry upset Olympic quarterfinalist Troy Amos Ross of
Canada 26-21 on points in the light-heavyweight division, John
Pearce outclassed India's Jitender Kumar 25-15 at middleweight and
Chris Bessey scored a 20-15 victory over Canada's Scott MacIntosh
at light middleweight.
	   Canada won three golds medals, defending titlist Michael Strange
downing Gerry Legras of the Seychelles 16-8 at light welterweight
and Jeremy Molitor scoring a 14-9 verdict over Kenya's Absolom
Okoth at welterweight.
	   Then heavyweight Mark Simmons outpunched Roland Raforme of the
Seychelles 21-13.
	   The Kenyans, who two golds four years ago in Victoria, went home
without a medal after a disappointing performance from their 10
fighters.
	   English shooters also collected golds on the range at Langkawi
Island.
	   Michael Gault collected his fourth gold medal to go with his
title at the Games at Victoria four years ago by winning the men's
air pistol.
	   ``This is due reward for a lot of training,'' Gault said. ``I
was up against some professional shooters from India and Malaysia
and to get another gold is amazing.
	   ``I've been told if I was Malaysian I would have won four cars
and a house.''
	   Timothy Lowndes of Australia finally made it to gold after a
bronze in the pairs free rifle prone and a silver in the pairs
3-position.
	   In the velodrome, New Zealand's Glen Thomson won the
40-kilometer points race, Alayna Burns of Australia won the women's
equivalent and the Australians triumphed in the 4-kilometer team
pursuit.
	   Canada won both titles in the diving pool, Alexandre Despatie
taking gold in the men's platform and Eryn Bulmer finishing top in
the women's 3-meter springboard.

since a U.S. missile strike against a factory in the Sudanese
capital, Khartoum, the president said the threat was made in an
unsigned letter he received from the U.S. administration. He gave
no details, but warned that his government would respond.
	   U.S. officials were not immediately available for comment.
	   A Sudanese parliamentary official said the alleged written
threat from Washington was handed to el-Bashir by a former senior
Sudanese official. The official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, did not say when the message was received.
	   ``Welcome to a second and third strike. But next time we will
not go to the Security Council ... We will reserve the right to
respond and our response will be very painful,'' el-Bashir told the
rally.
	   Washington claimed the plant produced chemical weapons agents.
Sudan, which insisted the factory produced only pharmaceuticals,
called for a U.N. Security Council investigation.
	   Mohammed el-Hassan Amin, head of the political section of the
ruling National Congress party, said Saturday that the alleged U.S.
message also accused Khartoum of hosting groups loyal to Saudi
dissident Osama Bin Laden.
	   Washington also attacked what it called Bin Laden's training
camp in Afghanistan, accusing the Saudi dissident of being behind
the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7.
	   El-Bashir pledged the destroyed plant would remain untouched as
a reminder of the ``American aggression.''
	   Protesters burned a U.S. flag as verses from the Muslim holy
book of Koran were read over loudspeakers.
	   A poster pasted to a truck depicted a donkey with a face of
President Bill Clinton with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky mounted on its back. Lewinsky is at the center of a sex
scandal with Clinton.
	   Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who attended the
rally, apologized for the U.S. missile strike and urged the United
Nations to send an inspection team to determine whether the plant
produced chemical weapons agents.

	   SAINT-NOM-LA-BRETECHE, France (AP) _ Miguel Angel Jimenez
birdied the 18th with a spectacular 30-yard chip over a bunker to
win the Lancome Trophy Sunday, after Americans Mark O'Meara and
David Duval dropped shots at the same hole.
	   The Spaniard, who wins pounds 133,330 (dlrs 209,000), ended the
tournament on 273, 11-under par, two shots ahead of Duval, O'Meara,
Jarmo Sandelin of Sweden and New Zealand's Greg Turner.
	   Jimenez's birdie on the 3-par, 209-yard 18th clinched the win.
	   ``At the last, I was just trying to make three, but I hit a very
solid chip just the way I wanted,'' he said. ``When it bounced on
the green, I saw the line and thought to myself `Oh my God it is
going in.' This really is the most dramatic victory of my career.''
	   Duval, the biggest money winner of the year, looked well-placed
for his first European victory, but double-bogeyed the 18th after
hitting his tee shot into the water.
	   O'Meara, the defending champion here and Duval's playing
partner, also bogeyed on the last hole after hitting grandstand
hoardings.
	   Jimenez, O'Meara and Duval were locked in a three-way battle for
first place for most of the final round.
	   But with the three leaders struggling to make par on the final
holes, a five-way playoff with Sandelin and Turner, looked on the
cards.
	   Jimenez, the overnight leader at the pounds 800,000 (dlrs 1.32
million) tournament, bogeyed the 1st and 3rd, before posting
birdies on the 4th and 5th and an eagle on the 6th to get back to
the top of the leader board.
	   His topsy-turvy round continued with bogeys on the 10th, 14th
and 17th and birdies on the 11th, 12th, 13th and 18th.
	   On the 17th, the tension showed on Jimenez's face as he missed a
six-footer.
	   Ranked 88 in the world, Jimenez had won dlrs 504,000 in 21
events up until his success at the Lancome, his fourth win on the
European tour.

Australian athletes ordered back to village after Anwar arrest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australia's Commonwealth Games
athletes were ordered back to the village Sunday as a safety
precaution following the arrest of Malaysia's former deputy prime
minister, Anwar Ibrahim.
	   ``It may be an over-reaction but we decided it was better to be
safe than sorry,'' Australian team spokesman Ian Hanson told The
Associated Press.
	   ``When we heard the news tonight of the arrest our headquarters
staff decided we should contact sectional managers and have them
ensure all the athletes are back in the village. They are our
responsibility and we don't want to take chances.''
	   Hanson said the men's hockey team, which beat Malaysia in
Sunday's final, had been told to celebrate inside the games
village.
	   Police arrested Anwar at his Kuala Lumpur home Sunday after he
led thousands of demonstrators through the streets of the capital
calling on Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad to resign.
	   Protesters stormed Mahathir's official residence and riot police
fired tear gas and water cannons to disperse them.
	   Australian team chef de mission Don Stockins said section
managers had been advised to tell athletes not to go into the city.
	   ``My section managers have been advised not to let athletes go
into the city. We have reports that there is conflict but it is
peaceful at this point.
	   ``We already have athletes in the city but we can do nothing
about that.''

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's sacked deputy prime
minister was arrested late Sunday after thousands of his supporters
marched to the prime minister's house, provoking riot police to
fire tear gas into the crowd.
	   Anwar Ibrahim was led away by police carrying assault rifles and
pushed into a van.
	   Hundreds of his angry supporters shouted, ``God is great,'' and
``Long live Anwar,'' shaking their fists as police lead Anwar out
of the house where he has conducted almost two weeks of protest
rallies against the 17-year-rule of Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   Helmeted special reserve police, armed with assault rifles,
parked jeeps in front of Anwar's house and blocked off roads in the
well-heeled neighborhood to prevent his supporters from marching
after the van.
	   Also arrested was Roslan Kassim, a northern state youth wing
leader from the ruling party, who was in the house where Anwar was
holding a news conference.
	   Matthew Moore, a journalist with The Sydney Morning Herald of
Australia, said when police came through the door, ``They jumped on
me, screamed at me and knocked me down.'' He said they demanded his
tape recorder and notebook at gunpoint.
	   The violence occurred more than two hours after an unprecedented
rally at the capital's central Merdeka (Freedom) Square, where
Anwar Ibrahim had lead 35,000 people in chanting demands for
Mahathir's resignation.
	   Such public demonstrations, defying police and showing
disrespect for Mahathir are without precedent. Opposition parties
have routinely been denied permission to hold rallies.
	   The demonstrators then marched to the front gate of the prime
minister's official residence. They were met by police wearing riot
shields and face-shields who fired tear gas bombs and water cannon.
	   Smoke filled the highway in front of the residence as the police
fired at least three volleys. Thousands of people wrapped their
faces in cloths and tried to get back to the center of town.
	   Anwar, 51, was fired by Mahathir on Sept. 2 from his posts as
deputy prime minister and finance minister.
	   According to one of Anwar's attorneys, he was arrested under a
law banning sodomy. Three attorneys were allowed to accompany him
and they expected him to be charged Monday.
	   Sunday's newspapers carried banner-headlined stories containing
explicit details of the alleged sodomy offenses, revealed in a
Sessions Court hearing on Saturday by Anwar's adopted brother and a
friend. Both had been denied access to their relatives or lawyers
during their police detention.
	   Sodomy is a crime in this conservative Muslim country, and both
men were sentenced to six months in prison.
	   Anwar has vehemently denied the charges and said they have been
cooked up by Mahathir, who fears his growing popularity and the
challenge to his rule.
	   Kuala Lumpur Police Chief Kamarudin Ali told the national news
agency Bernama late Sunday that Anwar was being detained to aid
police investigations into several crimes. Those included public
disturbance, illegal assembly, criminal use of force and rioting.
He said Roslan had been arrested in connection with the rally at
Merdeka Square.
	   ``Police have taken action to restore order and the situation is
under control and has returned to normal,'' Kamarudin said.
	   Many Malaysians were puzzled why Mahathir had not acted more
swiftly against Anwar and his supporters. It could have been a
tactic to find out who was on Anwar's side. Investigations have
begun against ruling party members who appeared with Anwar or
helped him, other opposition leaders are worried about mass arrests
and possibly a declaration of emergency to deal with
dissatisfaction over the country's deep economic problems.
	   The violence has sullied the state visit of Queen Elizabeth II,
who was worshiping at a nearby church during the rally at Merdeka
Square, the site where Malaysian independence from Britain was
declared in 1957.
	   She was due to meet with Mahathir Monday.
	   Mahathir told reporters earlier Sunday he was not intimidated by
the words or the swelling crowds at Anwar's meetings.
	   ``I am not concerned at all,'' Mahathir said. ``But he has been
holding rallies which have been illegal.''
	   Mahathir denied he was directing the police investigation of the
man he once designated as his successor, and denied Anwar's
allegations that witnesses had been tortured into confessing they
committed sodomy with Anwar.
	   Hasny Zai, 21, a student of Kuala Lumpur's Islamic University,
said he attended Anwar's rally because, ``I am here for justice. I
will remain with him until there is justice.''

Top strikers lead Juve, Milan, Fiorentina into tie for first
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ On a day when goals were hard to come by in Serie A,
even from the penalty spot, three top strikers hit the target to
keep their clubs tied for first place.
	   Filippo Inzaghi scored after eight minutes to lift defending
champion Juventus of Turin past Cagliari 1-0, AC Milan's German
forward Oliver Bierhoff netted a second-half header as AC Milan
edged Salernitana 2-1, and Argentine star Gabriel Batistuta had a
goal and an assist for Fiorentina in its 2-1 win at Vicenza in
Sunday's second round.
	   Those are the only teams that have opened the season with two
wins.
	   AS Roma had a chance to join that trio, but settled for a 0-0
draw at Empoli when Luigi Di Biagio _ whose missed penalty against
France sent Italy out of the World Cup at the quarterfinal stage _
failed to connect from the spot with five minutes left.
	   Sampdoria of Genoa also had to be content with a draw, because
Vicenzo Montella sent a penalty kick wide of the net in the 72nd
minute with the score 1-1 against Perugia.
	   Elsewhere, AC Parma, a club many thought would challenge for the
title, drew 0-0 at promoted Venezia. Parma has gone three games,
including a UEFA Cup match last week, without scoring. And Lazio of
Rome's highly-touted striker duo of Christian Vieri and Chile's
Marcelo Salas was shut out for the second straight week in a
scoreless draw against Bari.
	   Brazil's Marcio Amoroso registered the lone two-goal game, tying
Bierhoff for the league lead with three goals, in Udinese's 3-1
victory at 10-man Bologna.
	   Only 13 goals were scored in the afternoon's games, the lowest
output since there were a total of eight in Week 8 of the 1991-92
season.
	   Internazionale of Milan hosted Piacenza in the night match.

Tables turned as Sandelin accused of cheating
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Sports-Golf-Lancome Trophy

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT-NOM-LA-BRETECHE, France (AP) _ Jarmo Sandelin was at the
center of controversy for the second straight year at the Lancome
Trophy Sunday, after Lee Westwood, Europe's top golfer, accused him
of cheating in the pounds 800,000 (dlrs 1.32 million) tournament.
	   At last year's Lancome Trophy runnerup Sandelin, 31, accused
winner Mark O'Meara of re-spotting a ball closer to the hole on the
final round 15th. O'Meara denied the claim and tour organizers took
no action.
	   This year, the tables are turned.
	   England's Lee Westwood, currently European No. 1, accused
Sandelin of hitting a moving ball with his putter Saturday.
	   Sandelin, who played a brilliant 8-under par round Sunday to
finish a joint second, admits the ball moved before he struck it
but said no contact was made.
	   ``I insisted that I didn't ground the putter and thought that
was the end of the story,'' an emotional Sandelin told reporters
Sunday. ``But I got a call on my mobile last night and we had a
meeting with the organizers.''
	   ``I was very stressed. If I had been disqualified it would have
been terrible as I am innocent,'' Sandelin said.
	   The Swede was cleared to play only one hour before teeing off
Sunday and responded with a superb 63, the best round of the week
and only one shy of the course record, to end the tournament two
shots behind winner Miguel Angel Jimenez.
	   His round included a smart 35-foot putt to eagle the par-5 16th.
	   ``This morning I felt low, I thought the organizers would
believe Westwood,'' Sandelin said. ``But when they said it was OK,
that put some fighting spirit into me.''
	   Still, signs are that acrimony remains between the two players.
	   ``I looked Westwood in the eye and he still said that I did it.
I don't appreciate it when one player doesn't trust another.''
	   Westwood was not available for comment.

Ugandan president expects end to Congolese conflict
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said
Sunday he was optimistic that regional leaders would soon end the
conflict in Congo, despite many failed attempts.
	   ``They cannot allow themselves to squander resources for such
futile conflicts,'' Museveni said on the British Broadcasting
Corp.'s International Question Time, monitored in Nairobi. ``I am
sure they will find a solution.''
	   Rebels launched a movement Aug. 2 to oust Congo's President
Laurent Kabila.
	   Museveni and his counterparts from Zambia and Tanzania agreed
Saturday that there must be a cease-fire in Congo and foreign
troops should withdraw. Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe are fighting
for Kabila.
	   Kabila accuses Uganda and Rwanda of backing rebels who are
trying to topple him. Both countries have repeatedly denied the
charge, although Museveni has acknowleged deploying troops across
the border to fight Ugandan rebels.
	   Museveni said again Sunday he will keep troops in Congo as long
as necessary to ensure his country's security.
	   ``We shall maintain the troops there just long enough to have a
regional solution, and then we will pull them out,'' he said. ``We
have no interest in staying there.''
	   Pressed for when Ugandan troops would withdraw, Museveni said,
``It should be soon, even tomorrow, if the region comes out with a
solution to the internal problems of Congo, but also for the
problem of security for neighbors.''
	   Ugandan, Rwandan and Burundian rebels operate in eastern Congo.
	   Museveni also denied that Uganda, along with Rwanda, helped
Kabila rise to power last year, ousting late dictator Mobutu Sese
Seko.
	   ``There is no truth in that, and even last year our troops were
never really involved in that fighting. It is true that we took
some action against Mobutu because Mobutu was threatening our
security.''
	   But Museveni said his intention was not to help Kabila.
	   Museveni also was asked his opinion of U.S. President Bill
Clinton's sexual relations with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
	   ``Mr. Clinton's (unintelligible) affairs are his affairs, and
American affairs are American affairs, and I have nothing to say
about that,'' Museveni replied. ``I've got my own work to do.''

	   ENTEBBE, Uganda (AP) _ Authorities are closing in on suspects
wanted for allegedly planning attacks on American targets
worldwide, with arrests in Uganda and Germany and charges planned
against two suspects in Tanzania.
	   German officials on Sunday said Mamdouh Mahmoud Salim, 40, of
Sudan, was arrested on a U.S. warrant charging him with conspiracy
to kill U.S. citizens and conspiracy to use weapons of mass
destruction.
	   Justice officials in the German state of Bavaria said Salim is
suspected of being a close associate of Saudi dissident Osama bin
Laden, who is wanted by U.S. officials for the Aug. 7 bombings of
the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   The attacks killed 258 people, including 12 Americans, and
injured more than 5,500.
	   German officials said Salim admitted knowing bin Laden, but
denies any involvement in terrorist activities. They said he would
be extradited to the United States in the next few weeks.

Iranian soccer hooligans trash 80 buses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hundreds of hooligans trashed 80 buses after
a soccer match in Tehran, Iranian television reported Sunday.
	   It put the damage at more than 70 million rials (dlrs 33,000).
	   Friday's incident occurred after a soccer game between Tehran's
Esteqlal team and San'at-e Naft of the southern port city of Abadan
at the Azadi Stadium in Tehran.
	   Angry Estaqlal fans went out of control when the match ended in
a draw. Hundreds began trashing the buses which had been waiting
outside the stadium to transport them home.
	   It was not clear if police made any arrests.
	   The television quoted an official of the state-owned Vahed bus
company as saying that the hooligans smashed the windows of the
buses and caused serious damage to the seats.
	   ``For every bus that is taken out of the network, more than
1,000 people suffer in their search for transport,'' the official
was quoted as saying.
	   He said 200 buses and minibuses had been sent to the stadium to
transport the spectators.
	   The match reportedly attracted a crowd of 35,000, said the TV
report which was monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation.
	   Soccer hooliganism is rare in Iran.

Flooding in Central Africa kills 18

	   BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) _ Heavy rains battering
the Central African Republic's capital of Bangui have killed at
least 18 people and destroyed hundreds of homes, state radio
reported Sunday.
	   At least three victims _ all children _ were washed away in
flash flood waters over the weekend near the airport on the north
side of Bangui, the report said.
	   Flooding from sudden storms over the past week has also damaged
or destroyed as many as 500 homes in the capital and elsewhere in
the country.
	   Officials say the toll from the rains could climb if the rains
continue.
	   Outside of Bangui, hundreds of hectares (acres) or farmland has
been swamped and road access to the northern towns of N'Dele and
Birao has been severed by flood waters.
	   Rainy season in Central Africa usually begins at the start of
September.

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso criticized the group of seven industrialized
nations, known as G-7, and said it should be expanded to include
developing countries, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   ``G-7 is now demonstrating that it can't function as a world
directorate because it does not have the strength to do so'',
Cardoso told the O Globo newspaper.
	   Emerging nations like Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, India and China
should be included in the group, the president was quoted as
saying.
	   Cardoso said the G-7 should support more international funds
being sent to protect countries from speculative attacks.
	   ``The International Monetary Fund needs more resources because
those it has are scant in the face of the world's challenges,''
Cardoso was quoted as saying.
	   G-7 members are the United States, the United Kingdom, France,
Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan.

South African vintners sour on EU port, sherry label ruling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South African government
officials and wine producers are protesting demands by the European
Union that they stop using the names ``port'' or ``sherry.''
	   The European Union on Friday said only Spain can produce wines
called sherry and only wines from the Portuguese city of Oporto can
be labeled as port, dashing hopes for a trade settlement after four
years of negotiations.
	   The Stellenbosch Farmers' Winery says its Sedgwick's Old Brown
Sherry label is more than 100 years old.
	   ``One can't just pull the carpet from under a brand like that,''
spokesman Benny Howard was quoted by the Sunday Times of
Johannesburg as saying.
	   South Africa has also been producing a fortified port wine for
three centuries.
	   The EU refused to discuss opening its markets to a number of
South African agricultural products, including dairy products, cut
flowers, fresh and canned fruits, until South Africa gave in on the
label issue, according to Elias Links, South Africa's ambassador to
the EU and chief negotiator.
	   Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin accused the EU of bad
negotiating practice, the newspaper said. ``It is unacceptable that
links ... are being made at this stage,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Theo Pegel, an official at KWV, South Africa largest wine
exporter, said about 13 percent of its 750 million rand (dlrs 123
million) production of port and sherry is exported.
	   About 7,000 farm workers produce the two products.
	   Spain's ambassador to South Africa, Miguel Carriedo, said he did
not think the dispute would end negotiations.
	   ``I understand South Africa has been producing wine under these
names for decades, even centuries, but this is the name of the
game,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   The free trade deal was to cover roughly 90 percent of EU-South
Africa trade, worth a total 17 billion European currency units
(dlrs 19 million).

Ethics conference debates international council for complaints
</HEADLINE>
against press &QL; 
 &UR; By HARMONIE TOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Leaders of a group representing press
councils in a number of countries argued Sunday for creation of an
international media council to deal with complaints about
journalists, pointing to the United States as one country that
might benefit.
	   The World Association of Press Councils has drawn opposition
from a number of other journalism groups for its proposal, debated
on the second day of its three-day media ethics conference in
Istanbul.
	   David Flint, the Australian serving as chairman of the
association, said the organization must not be created by
governments or international institutions such as the United
Nations, ``but by journalists, by editors, by newspapers, by
broadcasters and by their organizations,'' such as the
International Press Institute and the World Press Freedom
Committee.
	   But Ronald Koven, European representative of the World Press
Freedom Committee and one of the staunchest opponents of the
proposal, said that while he believed it was full of good
intentions, ``we all know what the road to hell is paved with.''
	   ``The free press itself is one of the most marvelous
self-correcting mechanisms ever created,'' Koven said, adding that
``an international press council would be a standing invitation for
proposals to make its ruling mandatory under international law.''
	   The proposal to create such an organization is linked to another
proposal championed by conference's organizers of establishing an
international code of ethics for the media. Debated Saturday, the
code found adamant opponents and equally ardent supporters.
	   Both adhering to the code and participating in the organization
would be voluntary, Flint stressed.
	   Rosemary Righter, assistant editor of The Times of London,
warned that governments would try to use such an institution.
	   ``With bodies of this kind, politicians find it very difficult
to keep their hands off it,'' she said.
	   During Sunday's session, some participants also responded to
criticism by the American Society of Newspaper Editors, which _
although not attending the conference _ faulted the proposals as
appearing to ``devise yet another collar for the press.''
	   ``Hearing or reading their comments, you would imagine that we
are a bunch of government-sponsored hacks trying to restrict press
freedom,'' said Haluk Sahin, news coordinator of Turkey's Channel D
television.
	   ``The fact is _ and I have to disappoint the eminent U.S. body _
that no part of the proposal is malignant,'' said Flint,
questioning whether the United States itself would not benefit from
the creation of an American press council.
	   ``Does the First Amendment as interpreted in the last few
decades by the Supreme Court work, particularly in ensuring the
American public is fully enlightened? Does the marketplace of ideas
work perfectly in the United States? Sadly, it doesn't,'' Flint
added.
	   The former director of the International Press Institute, Peter
Galliner, said a working committee of three experts should be set
up to examine the controversial question.
	   Established in New Delhi in 1992, the World Association of Press
Councils has 16 news councils in various countries to deal with
local complaints about the news media.

	   GENEVA, Switzerland (AP) _ Conchita Martinez saved Spain from
elimination, posting a three set win over Switzerland's Patty
Schnyder on Sunday, evening the score to 2-2 in the best-of-five
Fed Cup final.
	   Over 12,000 frantic spectators packing the Palexpo watched
anxiously throughout the 3 hour, 18 minute marathon as the two
duelled relentlessly, with Martinez finally overcoming Schnyder
6-3, 2-6, 9-7.
	   The 2-2 draw set the stage for a high-tension showdown in the
doubles match.
	   Paired up, Sanchez-Vicario and Martinez have won 16 of their
last 19 Fed Cup doubles matches, including the last seven.
	   Though the pair have less experience as a doubles team, Hingis
and Schnyder have won all three of their Fed Cup doubles matches
together.
	   It was widely expected, however, that substitute Emmanuelle
Gagliardi would replace Schnyder, exhausted after her defeat to
Martinez.
	   But whoever is partnered with Hingis, the Swiss still have a
winning chance, the 17-year-old winning all four Grand Slam doubles
titles this year.

Le Pen's wife will run if far right leader declared ineligible

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen told
supporters on Sunday his wife would run in his place in European
elections if he is declared ineligible.
	   Jany Le Pen had said earlier this month she was ready to become
a standard-bearer for the National Front if her husband were barred
from running.
	   Le Pen himself put an end to any ambiguity that it would be
National Front No. 2 Bruno Megret who would be at the head of the
party's list for the European vote if the Front leader can't run.
	   ``Jany Le Pen would, if the need be, crystallize the indignation
of the French and lead our list to a great victory,'' Le Pen told
supporters at the National Front's annual Blue-White-Red
festivities, named in honor of the colors of the French flag.
	   Le Pen also reminded his supporters at the Paris gathering of
the Fron'ts opposition to the new European single currency, and as
usual, he demanded an end to immigration to France, which he said
led to higher unemployment.
	   Le Pen may be ineligible for the June 1999 European Parliament
vote if his conviction for assaulting a fellow candidate during a
campaign trip is upheld.
	   A court has convicted Le Pen for physically attacking candidate
Annette Peulvast-Bergeal on May 30, 1997, in the working class town
of Mantes-La-Jolie, west of Paris, where she was campaigning for a
seat in the French National Assembly. Le Pen was lending his
daughter, Marie-Caroline, support in her bid for a seat.
	   Le Pen has appealed the decision, but the court has yet to rule.

<TEXT>
	   BRESCIA, Italy (AP) _ Under a strange, sloping crucifix that had
Jesus dangling head down, Pope John Paul II on Sunday beatified a
19th-century layman who campaigned ardently for Catholic schools.
	   The towering, modernistic construction has been the subject of
intense debate in this prosperous city at the edge of the Italian
Alps, which had prepared for the papal visit for months.
	   Thirty meters (Ninety feet) high, it curved precipitously over
the platform where John Paul, resplendent in a green robe, presided
over the beatification of local son Giuseppe Tovini.
	   A poor boy who made good, Tovini founded Catholic schools,
newspapers, banks, insurance companies and charities at a time when
public sentiment in Italy, then a new nation, was turning against
what some saw as the church's excessive influence on society.
	   Among the banks Tovini founded was Banco Ambrosiano, which grew
to be Italy's largest private bank until it collapsed in 1982,
creating a huge financial scandal for the Vatican, which owned part
of the bank.
	   A lawyer and the father of 10 children, Tovini died in 1897, the
same year another local son, the future Pope Paul VI, was born.
John Paul's predecessor, Paul was pontiff from 1963 to 1978 and
presided over the historic reforms of the Second Vatican Council.
	   Shaded by a golden canopy, John Paul urged the 30,000
worshippers gathered at the city stadium to follow Tovini's
example.
	   ``Fervent, loyal, active in social and political life, Giuseppe
Tovini proclaimed with his life the Christian message,'' he said.
	   Tovini's beatification _ a step toward sainthhood _ comes as the
Roman Catholic Church is pressing the Italian government to fund
church schools.
	   Like the crucifix, created for the pope's visit by a prominent
stage designer, the campaign has provoked fervent debate.
	   Some, especially on the conservative end of the spectrum, are
for it, saying church schools promote moral values. Others are
adamantly opposed, saying it would jeopardize Italy's hard-won
separation of church and state.
	   Brescia, a city of 200,000 near Lake Garda, was the second and
final stop on the pope's weekend pastoral visit to northern Italy.
The 78-year-old pontiff also visited Chiavari on the Italian
Riviera south of Genoa.
	   In his last event before returning to Rome, John Paul met with
more than 2,000 people in the cathedral, reminding them of the
church's opposition to divorce, birth control and abortion and of
the importance of an education that teaches morals.

Monday following the arrest of Malaysia's former deputy prime
minister, Anwar Ibrahim.
	   But England general team manager Ann Hogbin said team officials
saw no cause for alarm and would discuss the situation further at a
team meeting at 9 a.m. (0100 GMT).
	   ``It may be an over-reaction but we decided it was better to be
safe than sorry,'' Australian team spokesman Ian Hanson told The
Associated Press.
	   ``When we heard the news tonight of the arrest, our headquarters
staff decided we should contact sectional managers and have them
ensure all the athletes are back in the village. They are our
responsibility and we don't want to take chances.''
	   Canadian spokeswoman Teresa Moore said the team was in the
process of counting heads and directing everyone back to the Games
village.
	   ``We would like to ensure all our people are back at the
village,'' Moore said. ``We're not in a panic but we'd like to be
safe.''
	   Hanson said the Australian men's hockey team, which beat
Malaysia in Sunday's final, had been told to celebrate inside the
games village.
	   Police arrested Anwar at his Kuala Lumpur home Sunday after he
led thousands of demonstrators through the streets of the capital
calling on Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad to resign.
	   Protesters stormed Mahathir's official residence and riot police
fired tear gas and water cannons to disperse them.
	   Anwar, 51, was fired by Mahathir on Sept. 2 from his posts as
deputy prime minister and finance minister.
	   Australian team chef de mission Don Stockins said section
managers had been advised to tell athletes not to go into the city.
	   ``We have reports that there is conflict but it is peaceful at
this point,'' said Stockins. ``We already have athletes in the city
but we can do nothing about that.''

A big British talking day in New York _ but no Monica
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair will address the United
Nations on Monday, and also share a platform with U.S. President
Clinton at New York University on left-of-center policies, called
``The Third Way.''
	   And the one thing he won't be talking about is Monica Lewinsky,
aides said Sunday.
	   ``Mr. Blair is not a fair-weather friend to anybody,'' Jack
Straw, Home Secretary in Blair's 22-member Cabinet, said in a
British Broadcasting Corp. television interview.
	   ``We need to bear in mind his (Clinton's) great success in
public things that he's done in terms of the way the American
economy has very significantly improved, and back home his great
contribution in Northern Ireland _ that's very important,'' added
Straw.
	   In a busy day, Blair is due to address the U.N. General Assembly
in New York, speak at the New York stock exchange about the world
economic crisis, met Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and speak about
politics at the university.
	   The visit coincides with the release of video tape of Clinton's
Grand Jury testimony about his relations with the former White
House intern.

Queen Elizabeth II visits Malaysia during political storm

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A white-gloved Queen Elizabeth II
attended a church service at Freedom Square on her first stop in
this former British colony roiling with a sordid political drama.
	   Just after the queen settled into the front pew at nearby St.
Mary's Anglican cathedral, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's sacked
deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, defied police restrictions and held a
massive rally of some 35,000 people at the square. Several hours
later, Anwar was arrested at his home, charged with sexual
indecency.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook decided to stay on with the
queen because of the political upheaval. He had intended to leave
Monday night to fly to New York for a meeting of the U.N. General
Assembly, but will now remain until Thursday.
	   ``Having heard there was a planned rally at the first event on
the queen's visit, Mr. Cook decided his priority was to be with the
queen for the rest of the tour,'' said a Foreign Office spokesman.
``This is the right place to be.''
	   The spokesman stressed that Cook, who was due to meet Mahathir
for bilateral talks Monday, would make no comment on the political
turmoil.
	   Anwar told reporters that, ``I don't think Malaysians would want
to embarrass the queen in any way ... this is purely a domestic
matter.''
	   In a fuchsia hat, a pink floral dress and cream-colored pumps
with a matching handbag, the queen attended the half-hour service
in the 19th-century Anglican church with her husband, Prince
Philip.
	   The queen's press secretary said she and her husband had been
informed immediately after landing in Kuala Lumpur of the death in
Argentina of Susan Barrantes, mother of the Duchess of York.
	   ``They were shocked and saddened by the news,'' said press
secretary, Geoff Crawford.
	   As the royal couple left the church, they greeted hundreds of
beaming members of the congregation, the choir and clergy. The
queen spoke briefly with a group of disabled and orphaned members
of the parish.
	   One woman pushed through the crowd, clutching a blown-up
photograph of her husband flanked by the queen and duke on a visit
to Malacca in 1972. She asked the queen for an autograph.
	   ``Sorry I don't do that,'' the queen replied with a smile.
	   Just over a kilometer (mile) away, tens of thousands of Muslims,
chanting ``Reform'' gathered at the National Mosque to hear Anwar
speak before marching to the central square in defiance of police
threats.
	   The royal couple later met with gold medalists from the 16th
Commonwealth Games. The games are being held in Kuala Lumpur, the
first time they have been staged in Asia. The queen will preside
over the closing ceremony Monday, visit the tallest skyscraper in
the world and a recording studio to meet with Malaysian pop stars.
	   Prince Philip, an avid environmentalist, will visit the World
Wide Fund for Nature's Education Center in a national park outside
the capital.

ROME: night match.

<TEXT>
	   At Turin, Inzaghi _ the league's leading scorer two years ago
with Atalanta of Bergamo _ slipped through a napping defense to
collect midfielder Alessio Tacchinardi's pass and slide the ball
past charging Cagliari 'keeper Alessio Scarpi. The Juventus
defense, which gave up three goals to promoted Perugia last week,
was solid as the club rebounded from a lackluster 2-2 draw against
Turkey's Galatasaray in Champion League play. Cagliari is 0-1-1.
 &UR; Milan 2, Salernitana 1 &QC; 
	   At Salerno, Bierhoff sent a firm header into the upper corner of
the net in the 67th minute to give Milan a 1-0 lead. The German set
up the second goal, in the 86th, with a cross that glanced off
Brazilian substitute Leonardo on its way in. Midfielder Roberto
Breda curled in a 20-meter (yard) free kick with two minutes left
for Salernitana (0-0-2).
 &UR; Fiorentina 2, Vicenza 1 &QC; 
	   At Vicenza, Batistuta headed home a corner kick one minute into
the match and then, after Vicenza (0-1-1) had tied the score on an
own-goal in the 68th minute, fed Belgian striker Luis Oliveira for
a close-range goal in the 71st.
 &UR; Empoli 0, Roma 0 &QC; 
	   At Empoli, 'keeper Matteo Sereni dove to his left to block Di
Biagio's penalty kick, awarded when forward Carmine Gautieri was
fouled. Empoli (0-1-1) wasted its own golden opportunity to win
when defender Giorgio Lucenti, left one-on-one with Roma 'keeper
Antonio Chimenti on a breakaway in the 67th minute, sent his shot
off the mark.
 &UR; Sampdoria 1, Perugia 1 &QC; 
	   At Genoa, French midfielder Pierre Laigle finished a nice
exchange with Argentine playmaker Ariel Ortega by scoring in the
21st minute to give Sampdoria (0-2-0) the lead. After Perugia
(0-1-1) equalized in the 49th on Renato Olive's first career Serie
A goal, Ortega earned the penalty kick that Montella struck
poorly.
 &UR; Venezia 0, Parma 0 &QC; 
	   At Venice, Parma (0-2-0) protested in the dying seconds when
Croat midfielder Mario Stanic was brought down in the penalty area
_ but no foul was called. Venezia is 0-1-1.
 &UR; Lazio 0, Bari 0 &QC; 
	   At Rome, Lazio (0-2-0) never managed to take control of the
action and produced its third straight disappointing performance.
The Roman club drew 1-1 with Piacenza last Sunday and played to the
same score against unheralded Swiss club Lausanne in UEFA Cup
action Wednesday.
 &UR; Udinese 3, Bologna 1 &QC; 
	   At Bologna, Amoroso scored off a header in the 14th minute and
from the penalty spot in the 44th to pace Udinese (1-1-0). Bologna
(0-0-2), which had defender Amedeo Mangone sent off on the stroke
of halftime, cut its deficit on Russian striker Igor Kolyvanov's
penalty kick in the 63rd. But with a chance to pull even, another
Russian, Igor Simutenkov, missed a penalty in the 83rd. Udinese
wrapped up the win two minutes later on a goal by Belgian
midfielder Johan Walem.

German finance minister says privatizations can help finance tax
</HEADLINE>
cut &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Schroeder accusing Kohl of breaking his word &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Insisting again there were no tax hikes
planned, Finance Minister Theo Waigel said the government would
finance its promised 30 billion mark (dlrs 17 billion) tax cut
partly through new privatizations.
	   After failing to get his tax reform package passed in the last
parliamentary session, Chancellor Helmut Kohl has made pushing it
through a main plank in his re-election campaign.
	   The opposition Social Democrats charge the package would lead to
less revenue and force cuts in welfare programs. The debate gained
steam last week when one of Kohl's own Cabinet ministers hinted the
government planned to raise Germany's value-added sales tax to make
up for cuts elsewhere.
	   Kohl denied he was planning to raise taxes after the Sept. 27
election, and Family Minister Claudia Nolte said she had made a
mistake.
	   But on the campaign trail Sunday, Kohl challenger Gerhard
Schroeder accused Kohl of ``breaking his word'' over taxes. Nolte
``simply told the truth,'' Schroeder said.
	   In an interview with this week's Focus newsmagazine, Waigel said
a third of the tax cut would be ``secured'' through the
self-financing effect of reforming Germany's cumbersome tax system.
	   In addition, ``we'll naturally continue our successful
privatization policy,'' he said.
	   With all that plus added revenue due to economic growth, ``we're
in a position to do without shifting direct and indirect taxes
around,'' he said.
	   The German government has raised billions in recent years by
selling stakes in the Deutsche Telekom phone system, Lufthansa
airlines and other firms.

Henman captures President's Cup for second consecutive time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) _ Second-seeded Tim Henman of Great
Britain defeated top-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia to capture
the President's Cup on Sunday in the final match of the dlrs
500,000 President's Cup tournament on the ATP tour.
	   ``I was rooting for Yevgeny, but frankly speaking, Tim was
stronger today,'' President Islam Karimov said at the ceremony.
	   Defending champion Henman broke Kafelnikov in two sets _ 7-5,
6-4 _ to win the cup for the second consecutive year.
	   ``I was playing for the second time in this tournament and I
will definitely return here for a third time,'' Henman said.
	   The former French Open winner, Kafelnikov was fighting for his
17th career title. In the first set he broke Henman's serve in the
seventh game but double faulted four times in the 10th to let the
Briton equalize and close the set with an overhead smash in the
12th.
	   ``The 10th set was a turning point of the match, when Kafelnikov
committed two double faults,'' Henman told reporters.
	   ``This victory is very important for me, because I've lost many
tournaments this year,'' said Henman, the 24-year-old Wimbledon
semifinalist.
	   Henman still has a chance to earn a berth at the ATP
Championship in Hannover, Germany this year. Marcelo Rios, Pete
Sampras and Patrick Rafter have already collected enough points to
qualify.
	   Henman took home dlrs 66,400 for the title, while Kafelnikov
earned 39,300.
	   The finals drew 4,500 spectators at the hard-courts of Yunusobod
Tennis Stadium in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan.

Liberian capital tense after weekend gun battles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead to RAISE reference to Johnson being accused of
treason; ADDS quote from Information Minister. Edits to conform, no
pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ One day after pitched battles in the
Liberia capital, the government on Sunday accused former rebel
warlord Roosevelt Johnson of plotting against President Charles
Taylor.
	   Information Minister Joe Mulbah speaking on state radio said
Johnson had been training a force to subvert the government.
	   ``The government prays that Roosevelt Johnson and his
collaborators be arrested for treason,'' Mulbah said.
	   Moves to nab Johnson and his supporters on Saturday, however,
triggered day-long firefights in downtown Monrovia, leaving at
least 33 people dead.
	   Volunteers on Sunday began the grim task of collecting dead
bodies from Monrovia's streets. Relative calm had returned to the
city, but few people ventured outside for fear the fighting could
flare up again.
	   Dozens of people were wounded by stray bullets during the
fighting which centered around Johnson's home around the Camp
Johnson Road district.
	   Explosions from rocket and mortar rounds echoed through the
streets for much of Saturday.
	   Government troops captured Johnson's residence after issuing an
order for his arrest. Johnson fled his home on Saturday and was
reportedly hiding out in the U.S. Embassy.
	   Embassy officials refused to comment on the claim, but Taylor
issued a warning to the United States not to help Johnson and his
allies.
	   ``The Liberian government will not react lightly to any attempt
by the U.S. government to evacuate those individuals,'' Taylor said
in an earlier radio address.
	   Johnson is a former foe of Taylor's, but the two were among a
number of warlords who signed a fragile truce in 1996.
	   Johnson returned from exile to become Liberia's rural
development minister after Taylor won last July's presidential
elections. He has become distanced from Taylor's administration in
recent months and his future in the government is unclear.
	   Tensions between Taylor and Johnson have persisted and forces
loyal to both sides have clashed several times in recent months.
	   In one instance, Taylor's personal security unit clashed with
Johnson's supporters, who accused the president of trying to kidnap
and assassinate their leader.
	   Many Liberians have vivid memories of the country's seven-year
civil war that left 150,000 people dead and prompted countless
thousands more to flee their homes.

Hundreds gather in cemetery in memory of assassinated lawmaker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report of radio director arrested &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Hundreds of Albanians gathered peacefully
Sunday at the grave of Azem Hajdari, whose assassination last
weekend sparked riots that sent the country spiraling into
political turmoil.
	   Some 1,500 people, many holding flowers, began the procession
from Skanderbeg square in downtown Tirana, continuing calmly to the
former lawmaker's grave at the cemetery more than five kilometers
(three miles) away.
	   Some shop owners quickly pulled down metal window guards as the
chanting crowd approached, but there was no violence. Police were
largely unseen.
	   Hajdari, a popular opposition figure and ally of former
President Sali Berisha, was killed on Sept. 12. Berisha has blamed
Prime Minister Fatos Nano and for Hajdari's death and demanded the
leader resign.
	   Rioting by Berisha supporters last Sunday and Monday, in which
mobs briefly seized government buildings, state television and
Nano's office, has raised fears of further unrest in the volatile
Balkans.
	   Berisha appeared at the cemetery at Hajdari's graveside, but
left again in his car without making any comment.
	   He has rejected international criticism of his party's role in
the violence and rejected negotiations with Nano's governing
Socialist Party. But the daily protests called by the Democratic
Party have drawn only a few thousand people, showing Berisha lacks
significant support in the capital.
	   A multi-national delegation traveled to Tirana Saturday to meet
with political leaders and seek answers to who was responsible for
Hajdari's killing. Western officials say they believe the shooting
death resulted from a personal feud.
	   The delegation, formed by the 52-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, met with Berisha and Nano, as
well as President Rexhep Meidani, who has been seeking a solution
to the crisis.
	   OSCE officials criticized Berisha and his party for inciting the
unrest, but also Nano, for failing to effectively fight corruption.
	   Also Sunday, an independent radio close to the Democratic Party
said in a statement that police had arrested its director, Alfons
Zeneli. The report could not immediately be independently
confirmed.
	   The statement issued by independent radio Contact said that the
arrest showed the government's ``violation of free speech in
Albania.''
	   Last week's rioting brought Albania to the brink of anarchy for
the second time in 18 months.

Violence comes to sleepy port city as drug trade moves south
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos planned &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK STEVENSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ENSENADA, Mexico (AP) _ Relatives of the 18-member extended
family killed outside this sleepy port in a drug-related payback
say they saw the trouble coming several years ago.
	   Suddenly, young men with no visible means of support in this
Baja California community began tooling around town in fancy, new
trucks. Small airplane traffic increased. Fishermen were rumored to
be hauling in more than sardines at night.
	   As authorities turned up the heat on the Arellano Felix drug
trafficking gang in Tijuana, the smuggling activity and violence so
common in their adopted hometown of Tijuana gradually began moving
south.
	   And with that move came dangers never seen before in Ensenada, a
Pacific port in northern Mexico long known for tourism and fishing.
	   ``We told him to get out of there,'' Ignacio Liera said of his
brother Luis Jaime Liera, who was slain at the family compound in
the nearby community of El Sauzal. ``But he didn't move, because he
didn't have enough money.''
	   Luis Jaime Liera was not believed to be involved with drugs, but
several others living there were, including the apparent target of
the Thursday attack, brother-in-law Fermin Castro. Castro survived
and remained in a coma on Sunday.
	   Ignacio Liera and others on Saturday buried seven family members
at a funeral attended by hundreds of people, simultaneously
mourning the loss of their loved ones and the quiet community they
once knew.
	   There were two tiny caskets: one for a 1-year-old boy and
another, still smaller, for an 8-month-old fetus killed early
Thursday. The gunmen, clad in black, dragged the victims from their
beds, herded them to an outdoors patio and sprayed them with
automatic rifle fire.
	   Authorities believe Castro headed one of a growing number of
small independent smuggling bands that popped up in the region as
the Arellano Felix brothers were forced to adopt a lower profile.
	   Experts believe that even before the gang's top enforcer, Ramon
Arellano Felix, was placed on the FBI's Most Wanted List and
indicted on U.S. federal drug charges in the fall of 1997, members
of Mexico's fastest-growing narcotics organization were moving
underground for survival.
	   Lieutenants in the Arellano Felix organization, one of Mexico's
largest and most violent drug gangs, soon began charging smaller
groups for the right to move drugs through the region.
	   While the small groups had indirect contact with the Arellano
Felix organization, they never became part of its structure,
authorities say.
	   ``As the Arellano Felix brothers went on the run, smaller bands
were told to pay a transit fee for trafficking drugs,'' said Gen.
Jose Luis Chavez, the representative of the Attorney General's
Office in Baja California state.
	   Ensenada's geography made it a perfect drug shipment point for
U.S.-bound drugs: Miles (Kilometers) of deserted coast on the
Pacific and Gulf of California, and hundreds of square miles
(kilometers) of desert for clandestine landing strips.
	   ``This is an efficient corridor. Sometimes they come up through
the Gulf and ship over dirt roads to the Pacific, or from the
Pacific to the Gulf. They land drugs in planes. They stand offshore
in ships and small boats bring the drugs into shore,'' Chavez said.
	   The quick cash offered by smugglers was attractive, especially
following the 1994 devaluation of the Mexican peso and subsequent
recession that threw many out of work.
	   ``Some people are employed to wait for small aircraft, unload
them and transport drugs in vehicles with hidden compartments to
Tijuana and Mexicali,'' he said.
	   Ensenada residents blame the trouble on outsiders: the
Colombians who ship the drugs to Mexico, traffickers from the
nearby Pacific coast state of Sinaloa who ship the drugs across the
Gulf of California to the Baja peninsula.
	   All of the massacre victims were local residents. Castro is a
Pai Pai Indian from the mountains farther south on the coast.
	   Two young survivors of the massacre _ a 12 year-old boy and his
15-year-old cousin _ said the killers ``didn't sound any different
than people around here,'' said state police commander Felipe Perez
Cruz.
	   But others had their own ideas about where the trouble came
from.
	   ``Tijuana started getting too hot, so they came here,'' said
Gerardo Liera, a cousin of the victims. He has no doubt who killed
his relatives. ``It was the Arellano Felix,'' he said.

Spain draws level 2-2 in Fed Cup final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with detail, background, CHANGES throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA, Switzerland (AP) _ Conchita Martinez saved Spain from
elimination, posting a three set win over Switzerland's Patty
Schnyder on Sunday, evening the score to 2-2 in the best-of-five
Fed Cup final.
	   Over 12,000 frantic spectators packing the Palexpo watched
anxiously throughout the 3 hour, 18 minute marathon as the two
duelled relentlessly, with Martinez finally overcoming Schnyder
6-3, 2-6, 9-7.
	   The 2-2 draw set the stage for a high-tension tie-breaking
doubles match, the 10th in the history of the Fed Cup.
	   The last Fed Cup title decided by the doubles was in 1991, when
Spain defeated the United States 2-1 to collect the country's first
title.
	   Paired up, Sanchez-Vicario and Martinez have won 16 of their
last 19 Fed Cup doubles matches, including the last seven.
	   Though the pair have less experience as a doubles team, Hingis
and Schnyder have won all three of their Fed Cup doubles matches
together.
	   It was widely expected, however, that substitute Emmanuelle
Gagliardi would replace Schnyder, exhausted after her match against
Martinez.
	   Regardless who is chosen to partner Hingis, the Swiss still have
a winning chance, the 17-year-old winning all four Grand Slam
doubles titles this year.
	   After taking the first set in convincing fashion, the tables
appeared to turn on Martinez.
	   In the second set, Schnyder jumped to a 2-0 lead, breaking the
Spaniard's opening serve with two break points to spare.
	   The Swiss player broke again to jump ahead 4-1, and needed only
to hold her own serves to even the sets.
	   Unperturbed by the set-back, a determined Martinez jumped to a
3-0 lead in the final set. Lifted by the frenzied home crowd,
Schnyder came back into the game, breaking back to narrow the gap
to 3-2. The Swiss player then saved three break points to hold
serve and even the score 3-3.
	   The two traded breaks to remain on serve at 4-4, then each held
serve _ often with great difficulty _ to go 7-7.
	   Martinez held to lead 8-7, then overcame Schnyder's serve with a
break point to spare, to even the tie.
	   Earlier Sunday, Hingis dispatched Sanchez-Vicario 7-6 (7-5) 6-3,
increasing her record over the Spaniard to seven consective wins.
Sanchez-Vicario's last win over the Swiss teenager dates back two
and a half years ago, when Hingis was only 15.
	   Spurred on by the hysterical home crowd, Hingis opened play
scoring seven consecutive points before Sanchez-Vicario could
comeback with the next four. While the Spaniard was able to hold
serve, it was only after being pushed to deuce twice.
	   Hingis monopolized the next nine points to break Sanchez-Vicario
and jump to a 3-1 lead.
	   Sanchez-Vicario broke back but the remainder of the set was a
battle for the 26-year-old. The Spanish player barely saved a set
point at 5-4, and was pushed to deuce three times.
	   A gutsy effort in the tie-break proved insufficient.
	   Hingis opened the second set breaking Sanchez-Vicario's serve,
then held her own to go up 2-0.
	   A valiant Sanchez-Vicario then saved a massive five break points
in an gut-clenching exchange, before finally yeilding her serve to
Hingis, who jumped ahead 4-1.
	   Sanchez-Vicario failed to convert three break points in the next
game despite the fact Hingis was suffering from leg cramps.
	   At 5-2, after an injury-break for Hingis, Sanchez-Vicario broke
the Swiss player's serve to narrow the gap to 5-3.
	   But Hingis broke back immediately, to wrap up the match and give
Switzerland a 2-1 lead.

Top strikers lead Juve, Milan, Fiorentina into tie for first

Inter-Piacenza late match, scheduled to start at 1830 GMT. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ On a day when goals were hard to come by in Serie A,
even from the penalty spot, three top strikers hit the target to
keep their clubs tied for first place.
	   Filippo Inzaghi scored after eight minutes to lift two-time
defending champion Juventus of Turin past Cagliari 1-0, AC Milan's
German forward Oliver Bierhoff netted a second-half header as AC
Milan edged Salernitana 2-1, and Argentine star Gabriel Batistuta
had a goal and an assist for Fiorentina in its 2-1 win at Vicenza
in Sunday's second round.
	   Juventus, Fiorentina and Milan _ the former powerhouse coming
off back-to-back poor seasons _ are the only teams that have opened
with two wins.
	   AS Roma had a chance to join that trio, but settled for a 0-0
draw at Empoli when Luigi Di Biagio _ whose missed penalty against
France sent Italy out of the World Cup at the quarterfinal stage _
failed to connect from the spot with five minutes left.
	   Sampdoria of Genoa also had to be content with a draw, because
Vicenzo Montella sent a penalty kick wide of the net in the 72nd
minute with the score 1-1 against Perugia.
	   Elsewhere, AC Parma, a club many thought would challenge for the
title, continued to struggle on offense and drew 0-0 at promoted
Venezia. Parma has gone three games, including a UEFA Cup match
last week, without scoring. And Lazio of Rome's highly-touted
striker duo of Christian Vieri and Chile's Marcelo Salas was shut
out for the second straight week in a scoreless draw against Bari.
	   Brazil's Marcio Amoroso registered the lone two-goal game, tying
Bierhoff for the league lead with three goals, in Udinese's 3-1
victory at 10-man Bologna.
	   Only 13 goals were scored in the afternoon's games, the lowest
output since there were a total of eight in Week 8 of the 1991-92
season.
	   Internazionale of Milan hosted Piacenza in the night match.
	   At Turin, Inzaghi _ the league's leading scorer two years ago
with Atalanta of Bergamo _ slipped through a napping defense to
collect midfielder Alessio Tacchinardi's pass and slide the ball
past charging Cagliari 'keeper Alessio Scarpi. The Juventus
defense, which gave up three goals to promoted Perugia last week,
was solid as the club rebounded from a lackluster 2-2 draw against
Turkey's Galatasaray in Champion League play. Cagliari is 0-1-1.
 &UR; Milan 2, Salernitana 1 &QC; 
	   At Salerno, Bierhoff sent a firm header into the upper corner of
the net in the 67th minute to give Milan a 1-0 lead. The German set
up the second goal, in the 86th, with a cross that glanced off
Brazilian substitute Leonardo on its way in. Midfielder Roberto
Breda curled in a 20-meter (yard) free kick with two minutes left
for Salernitana (0-0-2).
 &UR; Fiorentina 2, Vicenza 1 &QC; 
	   At Vicenza, Batistuta headed home a corner kick one minute into
the match and then, after Vicenza (0-1-1) had tied the score on an
own-goal in the 68th minute, fed Belgian striker Luis Oliveira for
a close-range goal in the 71st.
 &UR; Empoli 0, Roma 0 &QC; 
	   At Empoli, 'keeper Matteo Sereni dove to his left to block Di
Biagio's penalty kick, awarded when forward Carmine Gautieri was
fouled. Empoli (0-1-1) wasted its own golden opportunity to win
when defender Giorgio Lucenti, left one-on-one with Roma 'keeper
Antonio Chimenti on a breakaway in the 67th minute, sent his shot
off the mark.
 &UR; Sampdoria 1, Perugia 1 &QC; 
	   At Genoa, French midfielder Pierre Laigle finished a nice
exchange with Argentine playmaker Ariel Ortega by scoring in the
21st minute to give Sampdoria (0-2-0) the lead. After Perugia
(0-1-1) equalized in the 49th on Renato Olive's first career Serie
A goal, Ortega earned the penalty kick that Montella struck
poorly.
 &UR; Venezia 0, Parma 0 &QC; 
	   At Venice, Parma (0-2-0) protested in the dying seconds when
Croat midfielder Mario Stanic was brought down in the penalty area
_ but no foul was called. Venezia is 0-1-1.
 &UR; Lazio 0, Bari 0 &QC; 
	   At Rome, Lazio (0-2-0) never managed to take control of the
action and produced its third straight disappointing performance.
The Roman club drew 1-1 with Piacenza last Sunday and played to the
same score against unheralded Swiss club Lausanne in UEFA Cup
action Wednesday.
 &UR; Udinese 3, Bologna 1 &QC; 
	   At Bologna, Amoroso scored off a header in the 14th minute and
from the penalty spot in the 44th to pace Udinese (1-1-0). Bologna
(0-0-2), which had defender Amedeo Mangone sent off on the stroke
of halftime, cut its deficit on Russian striker Igor Kolyvanov's
penalty kick in the 63rd. But with a chance to pull even, another
Russian, Igor Simutenkov, missed a penalty in the 83rd. Udinese
wrapped up the win two minutes later on a goal by Belgian
midfielder Johan Walem.

elimination in the Fed Cup on Sunday, posting a three set win over
Switzerland's Patty Schnyder on Sunday to tie the score at 2-2 in
the best-of-five final.

	   The 2-2 draw sets the stage for a high-tension showdown in the

	   The Spanish doubles team of Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario and Martinez
have won 16 of their last 19 Fed Cup doubles matches.
	   For the Swiss team, it was widely expected that substitute

Sanchez-Vicario's last win over the Swiss teen-ager dates back 2
1/2 years, when Hingis was only 15.
	   Though Sanchez-Vicario displayed her famous resolution and grit,
in the end Hingis was simply too strong.
	   Hingis opened play by scoring seven consecutive points before

	   At 5-2, Sanchez-Vicario broke Hingis' serve to narrow the gap to
5-3.
	   But Hingis broke back immediately to wrap up the match.

Libya expresses reservations about proposed trial site
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Libya (AP) _ Libya expressed reservations Sunday about
holding the trial of two suspects in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing at
an air base in the Netherlands.
	   It said it wants to inspect the Camp Zeist site at the
Soesterberg air base before agreeing to holding the trial there,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency said.
	   It did not elaborate.
	   The Dutch and British governments on Friday signed an agreement
to use Camp Seist, about 32 kilometers (20 miles) southeast of
Amsterdam, for the proposed trial of the two Libyan suspects.
Soesterberg was a U.S. Air Force base from 1954 to 1993.
	   ``Such an arrangement does not ensure a fair trial... or provide
a suitable atmosphere for the suspects' appearances before the
court,'' MENA quoted an unnamed Libyan foreign ministry official as
saying.
	   The official did not explain why the site is not appropriate for
trial.
	   He also complained that Libya had not been formally informed of
the venue of the trial.
	   ``Libya retains the right to express its reservations,'' said
the official.
	   Libya has accepted a U.S.-British compromise to try the suspects
in the Netherlands by Scottish judges under Scottish law, but
demands assurances for the safety and handling of the two men.
	   Britain and the United States have rejected the Libyan demands.
	   The 1988 bombing of the Pan Am passenger plane over Lockerbie,
Scotland, killed 270 people.

Primakov meets with business and economic leaders

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov conferred with
business and banking leaders Sunday over policies to combat
Russia's economic crisis, while the nation awaited results of the
government's steps late last week to revive the paralyzed banking
system.
	   The economy has been at a near-standstill after the events of
the past month, during which the nation's currency has been
devalued, the country has defaulted on its loans and has changed
governments. The virtual shutdown of the country's banks has meant
a moratorium on payments of all kinds, from salaries to the
purchase of goods and services, and left depositors cut off from
their savings.
	   On Friday, the Central Bank began helping banks clear their
debts to one another by a so-called debt swap system _ allowing
them to use reserves stored in the Central Bank to pay their
liabilities.
	   The Central Bank has also promised to buy government bonds held
by the commercial banks at prices much higher than their actual
market value. The move is intended to allow banks to begin paying
debts and getting money circulating again.
	   The debt swap is expected to involve the printing of billions of
new rubles, which almost certainly will contribute to inflation.
Consumer prices have already begun to soar after being kept under
control for more than a year.
	   This coming week, ``the mechanism of the banking payment system
will be restored and will start working, which, in turn, will help
solve the problem of accurate payment of wages,'' Primakov told
reporters Sunday.
	   One banker told the prime minister that he would be willing to
give the state a majority stake in his bank in order to save the
banking system, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Other ``big banks are prepared to give their key stakes to the
state, too,'' essentially offering to be nationalized, Vladimir
Vinogradov, president of the Inkombank, was quoted as saying.
	   He added that the Central Bank should act quickly to save the
banking system, warning that ``in another week or two, a number of
major Russian banks will be beyond reanimation.''
	   At his meeting Sunday with close to 80 members of the Russian
Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, Primakov pledged to
place top priority on the payment of salaries and pensions, some of
which have been unpaid for months. In an interview Sunday with the
NTV station, Dmitry Lvov, an economist at the Academy of Sciences,
put the total owed in salaries at 80 billion rubles (about dlrs 5
billion).
	   Primakov said he wanted to tap opinion in business circles about
``how to protect every family and every person, how to place the
reform on the path of social transformations that can promote a
growth in living standards,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Among the other priorities Primakov has laid out since being
confirmed by parliament on Sept. 11 is honesty and accountability
in government. Financial officials in former Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko's government have been forced increasingly frequently to
answer accusations that they misused international aid funds.
	   The chief of Russia's Auditing Chamber charged that billions of
dollars of Western loans were either misused or stolen, BBC
television reported Sunday.
	   Venyamin Sokolov, chief auditor of parliament's Auditing
Chamber, said he had warned the IMF not to extend any more loans to
Russia until efficient controls are in place, the BBC report said.
	   In an interview on Saturday with Ekho Moskvy radio, former
Central Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin refuted accusations by Russian
Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov that the bank had misused IMF
loans.
	   Such accusations ``are totally groundless and simply
irresponsible,'' Dubinin said.

Arsenal scores record win over Manchester United
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Swedish international Fredrik Ljungberg scored his
maiden Premier League goal on debut Sunday to give Arsenal a 3-0
win over Manchester United at Highbury.
	   The defending F.A. Cup and League-double titlist led 2-0 when
Ljungberg, a second-half substitute, scored in the 84th minute to
ensure the result.
	   Arsenal became the first team in Premier League history to beat
Manchester United in three successive league matches.
	   The Gunners stretching the winning sequence against Manchester
United to four, including the 3-0 Charity Shield win at Wembley in
August.
	   Manchester United midfielder Nicky Butt left his team one-man
short for the second time in as many matches when he was red-carded
for a serious foul in the 51st minute.
	   Butt, who was sent-off in United's 3-3 tie with Barcelona in the
European Champions League opener at Old Trafford on Wednesday, made
an illegal tackle on Patrick Vieira in the penalty area.
	   He conceded a penalty in front of goal, which Arsenal missed to
extend its lead to three, and left last season's runners-up with 10
men for 30 minutes.
	   Gunners' captain Tony Adams opened the scoring with a well-timed
header from a David Hughes penalty kick in the 14th minute. It was
Arsenal's fourth goal of the league campaign but one of its most
valuable.
	   Hughes, deputizing for the injured Emmanuel Petit, fired in the
pass from the right side and Adams outjumped Jaap Stam for a gentle
header past Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel.
	   United's England midfielder David Beckham went close to
equalizing when a 25-meter shot hit the inside of the post and
bounced across in front of the Arsenal goal.
	   Sustained attack from both sides led to Arsenal's second goal in
the 44th minute, giving the homeside a 2-0 halftime advantage.
	   Nicolas Anelka received a long-range pass from Marc Overmars and
although Schmeichel stopped his first attempt off the right foot,
the young Frenchman swooped onto a rebound and made no mistake with
his second shot off his left foot.
	   Beckham had another penalty attempt on halftime but failed to
reproduced the accuracy which netted him a brilliant goal in the
Champions League clash against Barcelona.
	   In the only Division One match on Sunday, West Bromwich Albion
slumped to its third defeat in four matches, losing 2-0 to
Bradford.
	   Lee Mills, a 1 million-pound (dlrs 1.68 million) transfer from
Port Vale last month, scored both goals to give Bradford its first
away win of the season.
	   In Scottish Premier Division matches Sunday, Hearts escaped with
a 1-1 tie with Dunfermline. The match between defending titlist
Celtic and Rangers was due to kick-off at 6 p.m. local time.
	   In Premier League matches Saturday, Newcastle finally delivered
the ``sexy football'' promised by new coach Ruud Guillit, with Alan
Shearer scoring twice as the Tynesiders thrashed Coventry 5-1.
	   The England captain has scored five goals in his last three
league games to silence the critics claiming he is past his best as
a top-flight striker.
	   Derby scored a 2-0 win over Leicester to move into second place
in the league standings with 12 points, two behind league-leaders
Aston Villa.
	   Villa had to settle for a 0-0 tie against Leeds United as
neither team showed the kind of firepower they'll need to make them
convincing challengers for the title.
	   At Anfield, Liverpool had a disappointing 3-3 tie with newly
promoted Charlton despite the two-goal return of Robbie Fowler.
	   The former England international scored twice, giving Liverpool
a 3-2 advantage with his second, but Charlton hit back in the dying
minutes to score the equalizer. Liverpool fell from second place in
the league to share third place with Wimbledon on 11 points.
	   Wimbledon scored a 2-1 home victory over Sheffield Wednesday,
the 'Dons best start in six seasons.
	   At the bottom of the standings there was good news for
Southampton, which picked up it first point of the season with a
1-1 draw against Tottenham.
	   In other Premier League games Saturday, Middlesbrough and
Everton had a 2-2 tie, while Nottingham Forest and West Ham had a
scoreless tie.
	   In Scottish Premier Division Saturday, Kilmarnock and Motherwell
drew 0-0 to stay tied for second with nine points each. St.
Johnstone defeated Aberdeen 2-0. St, moving equal on eight points
with Celtic and Aberdeen.
	   On Monday, Chelsea travels to Blackburn in the remaining Premier
League match.

Hundreds gather in cemetery in memory of assassinated lawmaker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Hundreds of Albanians gathered peacefully
Sunday at the grave of Azem Hajdari, whose assassination last
weekend sparked riots that sent the country spiraling into
political turmoil.
	   Some 1,500 people, many holding flowers, began the procession
from Skanderbeg Square in downtown Tirana, continuing calmly to the
former lawmaker's grave at the cemetery more than five kilometers
(three miles) away.
	   Some shop owners quickly pulled down metal window guards as the
chanting crowd approached, but there was no violence. Police were
largely unseen.
	   Hajdari, a popular opposition figure and ally of former
President Sali Berisha, was killed on Sept. 12. Berisha has blamed
Prime Minister Fatos Nano for Hajdari's death and demanded he
resign.
	   Also Sunday, an independent radio station close to Berisha's
Democratic Party said that police had arrested its director, Alfons
Zeneli. The report could not immediately be independently
confirmed.
	   Rioting by Berisha supporters last week, in which mobs briefly
seized government buildings, state television and Nano's office,
has raised fears of further unrest in the volatile Balkans.
	   Berisha appeared at Hajdari's grave, but left without making any
comment.
	   He has dismissed international criticism of his party's role in
the violence and rejected negotiations with Nano's governing
Socialist Party. But the daily protests called by the Democratic
Party have drawn only a few thousand people, showing Berisha lacks
significant support in the capital.
	   A multi-national delegation traveled to the Albanian capital
Tirana on Saturday to meet with political leaders and investigate
who was responsible for Hajdari's killing. Western officials say
they believe the shooting death resulted from a personal feud.
	   The delegation, formed by the 52-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, met with Berisha and Nano, as
well as President Rexhep Meidani, who has been seeking a solution
to the crisis.
	   OSCE officials criticized Berisha and his party for inciting the
unrest, but also Nano for failing to effectively fight corruption.

Lee: No civil unrest in Malaysia following Anwar's arrest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JASMINA KUZMANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Malaysia will not erupt in civil disorder
following the arrest of Malaysia's ousted deputy premier Anwar
Ibrahim, Singapore's senior statesman said Sunday.
	   ``I'm not saying that Anwar doesn't have a following,'' Senior
Minister Lee Kuan Yew told journalists. ``But institutional checks
and balances in the system will not allow civil order to be
upset.''
	   Lee, who was prime minister for 31 years and who still wields
enormous influence, was promoting his newly published memoirs at a
gathering organized by the Foreign Correspondents' Association in
Singapore.
	   The book, which describes how Singapore and Malaysia fell out in
1965 after a brief merger, has been criticized by neighboring
Malaysia as poisonous and racist. The two countries have feuded
over a number of issues, including the location of a border post,
competition over ports and the purchase of water from Malaysia.
	   The relations reached a new low last week, when Malaysia forbade
Singapore's military jets to use its air space, breaking several
long-standing defense arrangements.
	   Lee declined to comment on the future of the ountries'
relations. Singapore is predominantly ethnic Chinese, while Malays
make up the majority in Malaysia _ but the two are linked by
economic, communication and family ties.
	   ``I'm in the center of the barrage. Whatever I say would be
discounted,'' Lee said, adding the best would be ``to hold an
umbrella and let all those eggs and tomatoes fall on the
umbrella.''
	   Lee said he felt ``sad'' to see the breakup of Malaysia's Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad and his former heir apparent Anwar.
	   Lee said much will depend on what charges Anwar was arrested.
Last week a close aide and an adopted brother of Anwar were charged
with having sexual relations with Anwar, a crime under Malaysian
laws.
	   ``Anwar Ibrahim does not have an organization. He has, or had,
mass appeal, but I'm not sure what impact these allegations would
have,'' Lee said.
	   If Anwar is brought to court with ``evidence of his unnatural
acts,'' then it could be quite damaging within Malaysia's Muslim
community, Lee said, adding that ``Muslims don't believe in gay
rights.''

Libya expresses reservations about proposed trial site
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Libya (AP) _ Libya expressed reservations Sunday about
holding the trial of two suspects in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing at
a former U.S. Air Force base in the Netherlands.
	   Libya said it wants to inspect the Camp Zeist site at the
Soesterberg air base before agreeing to holding the trial there,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency said.
	   The Dutch and British governments on Friday signed an agreement
to use Camp Seist, about 32 kilometers (20 miles) southeast of
Amsterdam, for the proposed trial of the two Libyan suspects.
Soesterberg was a U.S. base from 1954 to 1993.
	   ``Such an arrangement does not ensure a fair trial... or provide
a suitable atmosphere for the suspects' appearances before the
court,'' MENA quoted an unnamed Libyan foreign ministry official as
saying.
	   The official did not explain why the site is not appropriate for
trial.
	   He also complained that Libya had not been formally informed of
the venue of the trial.
	   ``Libya retains the right to express its reservations,'' said
the official.
	   Libya has accepted a U.S.-British compromise to try the suspects
in the Netherlands by Scottish judges under Scottish law, but
demands assurances for the safety and handling of the two men.
	   Britain and the United States have rejected the Libyan demands.
	   The 1988 bombing of the Pan Am passenger plane over Lockerbie,
Scotland, killed 270 people.

21 die after drinking contaminated liquor in eastern India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ At least 21 people, most of them truck
drivers, died when they drank contaminated liquor sold by a vendor
in small town in eastern India, domestic news agencies reported.
	   Dozens others fell violently ill and complained of nausea and
vomiting after they consumed the liquor, the United News of India
said. At least 100 people are reported to have bought the alcohol
from a shop owner in Katihar in the eastern state of Bihar.
	   Police banned the sale of home made liquor in the area and were
carrying out raids in the neighborhood to see if tainted alcohol
was being sold.

 &UR; Iraq reopens trade center in Syria

<TEXT>
	   DAMSACUS, Syria (AP) _ Iraq reopened its trade center in Syria
Sunday, 18 years after closing it.
	   The center, which was opened in a brief ceremony at the Damascus
International Fairgrounds by Iraqi Trade Minister Farouk al-Obaidi,
comes nearly two weeks after Damascus opened its own trade office
in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, on Sept. 3.
	   The two Arab neighbors have traded dlrs 150 million worth of
goods since they resumed cross-border trade last year. But they
have not restored diplomatic ties which were severed after Damascus
sided with Tehran during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
	   Iraqi leather and household items were among the goods exhibited
at the Iraqi center in Damascus.

Albanians propose interim solution amid violence in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with Albanian sources reporting seven Serb
policemen killed; fresh numbers from fighting in the north &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian leaders released a
peace proposal Sunday for Kosovo that would give the troubled
province its own legislature and make it equal to Yugoslavia's two
republics.
	   The plan, published in the Kosovo daily Koha Ditore, was
released amid reports that the government had launched a fresh
offensive against a rebel stronghold in the southern Serbian
province.
	   The plan envisions Kosovo as ``temporarily part of Yugoslavia''
and an ``independent entity equal'' to Serbia and Montenegro,
Yugoslavia's two republics, the newspaper said. The plan also calls
for a separate parliament.
	   Ilijaz Kurteshi, a member of the negotiating team, said the plan
still had to be fine-tuned.
	   ``This is a phase of reconciling different opinions and I expect
the American side will uphold our proposals in future
negotiations,'' Kurteshi told The Associated Press on Sunday.
	   The Serb side could come up with their suggestions as early as
Monday, when U.S. envoy Christopher Hill is scheduled to visit
Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital.
	   Last week, the Americans released details of their own proposal
for a three-year interim solution to bring peace to Kosovo, where
ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-1.
	   While that plan does not call for full independence for Kosovo,
it would restore the autonomy enjoyed by Kosovo Albanians until it
was revoked in 1989 by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, who favors independence
but opposes an armed struggle to achieve it, on Friday backed the
U.S.-sponsored plan, calling it the best starting ground for peace.
	   The Albanians' plan is similar to the U.S. proposal in that both
are looking at a three-year interim solution before trying to
settle the question of Kosovo's status.
	   In it, Kosovo would have its own courts, police and an
independent central bank, but would share a common economy with the
rest of Yugoslavia. Control of Kosovo's borders would remain in the
hands of the Yugoslav army and federal customs authorities.
	   The proposal also says that if Belgrade and Kosovo fail to
negotiate a lasting solution to the province's status during a
three-year period, Kosovo residents would vote on it in a
referendum. Belgrade has already rejected that idea.
	   Meanwhile, the Kosovo Information Center, which is close to the
Albanian leadership, claimed Serb forces launched a new offensive
early Sunday on two villages in the central Drenica region, about
19 miles (30 kilometers) west of Pristina, one of the largest and
last rebel strongholds.
	   The center said seven Serb policemen were killed in a rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army attack on a police check point in Drenica on
Saturday. No information from the Serb side was immediately
available and the reports could not be independently confirmed.
	   The center also reported a total of 12 Albanian civilians have
been killed in clashes between Podujevo and Mitrovica in northern
Kosovo, since fighting broke out last Wednesday. The charred bodies
of six men were seen in the village of Dobratim, 21 miles (35
kilometers) northwest of Pristina.
	   More than 600 people have been killed and more than 275,000 made
homeless since Serb forces launched an armed crackdown in the
province in late February.

Mantilla wins back-to-back titles at Bournemouth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOURNEMOUTH, England (AP) _ Felix Mantilla made it back-to-back
titles at the clay-court Samsung Open on Sunday with a 6-3, 7-5 win
over fellow Spaniard Albert Costa.
	   The No. 3 seed took just 88 minutes to beat Costa, the No. 2
seed and 1996 champion. It was his first win over Costa in five
matches.
	   Mantilla, ranked No. 22 in the World, has not won a tournament
on the ATP tour since his win over Carlos Moya in this event at
West Hants Club last year.
	   The 24-year-old broke Costa's serve in the first and ninth games
to take the opening set 6-3.
	   He broke serve again early in the second set for a 3-1 lead but
Costa broke back immediately to make it 3-2. Mantilla sealed the
final when he broke Costa's serve for the second time in the set in
the 12th game.
	   Mantilla said he would like to return next year in a bid to win
his third consecutive title and continue the Spanish domination of
the event.
	   ``You never know what is going to happen next year but I like
the court and the people here and hope I can come back to try and
complete the hat trick of titles,'' he said Sunday.
	   ``I spoke with my coach and we decided I must serve very
aggressively and hit the ball harder with my forehand. I am very
happy with the result.''
	   In the doubles final, No. 2 seeds Neil Broad of Britain and
Kevin Ullyett of South Africa scored a 7-6 (7-3), 6-3 win over No.
4 seeds Wayne Arthurs of Australia and Berasategui.

 &UR; Iraq reopens trade center in Syria
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS in 2nd graf that Obaidi is Iraqi trade ministry
official. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DAMSACUS, Syria (AP) _ Iraq reopened its trade center in Syria
Sunday, 18 years after closing it.
	   The center, which was opened in a brief ceremony at the Damascus
International Fairgrounds by Iraqi Trade Minister Farouk al-Obaidi,
comes nearly two weeks after Damascus opened its own trade office
in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, on Sept. 3.
	   The two Arab neighbors have traded dlrs 150 million worth of
goods since they resumed cross-border trade last year. But they
have not restored diplomatic ties which were severed after Damascus
sided with Tehran during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
	   Iraqi leather and household items were among the goods exhibited
at the Iraqi center in Damascus.

Auto component workers continue South African strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Mediation talks failed on
Sunday to settle a strike by the National Union of Metalworkers
that affects spare part makers and other branches of auto industry.
	   Sunday's breakdown followed five hours of talks. The strike
began Sept. 1.
	   The country's seven auto manufacturers settled a strike of their
own earlier this month, but have been nearly shut down because of a
shortage of components caused by the metalworkers strike, the South
African Press Association reported.
	   NUMSA spokesman Dumisa Ntuli said no further negotiations with
the South African Motor Industry Employers Association were
planned.
	   Ntuli said that he expected a one-day sympathy strike by about
170,000 NUMSA members to reinforce the ongoing strike by 60,000
workers, but did not specify a date of the additional strike.
	   NUMSA is demanding a 12 to 18 percent wage increase, while
employers have raised their initial 4.5 percent offer to between 8
and 10 percent.
	   NUMSA is also demanding a 5 rand (dlrs 0.83) an hour minimum
wage for gas station attendants.

	   The exit poll, released moments after voting closed, showed the
governing Social Democrats getting only 35.4 percent of the vote, a
substantial slump from the 45 percent they got four years ago. But
the Left Party surged to 13.3 percent and the Greens got another
4.9 percent.
	   Together that would give the parties enough to block the four
non-socialist parties taking power. But a Social
Democrats-Left-Greens alliance, even if it would not be a formal
governing coalition, makes for an awkward contellation.

Thousands of opposition supporters call for prisoners to be freed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Thousands of opposition supporters
rallied Sunday against the government and for the release of 57 of
their number who were arrested earlier this month after clashes
with police.
	   Up to 50,000 people marched in the capital Baku during a rally
organized to call for a democratic vote on Oct. 11, when Azeris are
to elect a president. Incumbent Geidar Aliyev is expected to win by
a large margin, in part because opposition leaders have called for
a boycott of the election.
	   The participants in the opposition rally on Sunday called for
the police and justice ministers, as well as the head of Azeri
state television, to be sacked. They also demanded freedom for 57
opposition supporters who were detained on Sept. 12 after police
broke up an unauthorized opposition rally.
	   The rally Sunday, which was led by former President Abulfaz
Elcibey, was peaceful.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Taliban news agency saying scores dead in fresh
rocket attacks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban-run news agency reported
Sunday that scores were killed when rockets blasted residential
areas of Kabul. Other sources reported lower casualty figures.
	   The second of two rocket assaults occurred late in the day and
an evening curfew in Kabul made it difficult to get details on the
casualties.
	   The Taliban-run Bakhtiar News Agency described the second attack
as the deadlier, saying ``scores of people have been killed. We
don't know how many yet.'' It said dozens were wounded.
	   Radio Shariat, the Taliban-run radio, said that rockets killed
16 people.
	   After the earlier attack, Taliban troops said that nine had died
and six were wounded.
	   The Taliban defense ministry issued an immediate warning to its
northern-based opposition, whom it blamed for the attacks:
	   ``If the opposition attacks residential areas of Kabul city, the
Afghanistan Islamic Emirate Air force will bomb their bases in
Jebul Siraj, Panjshir Valley, Parwan and Kapisa'' provinces,
according to the radio broadcast.
	   No one took immediate responsibility for the rocket assault, but
anti-Taliban alliance soldiers arrayed north of the Afghan capital
are within rocket range of the city.
	   Previously the opposition has fired rockets at the combined
military and civilian airport on the northeastern edge of Kabul.
	   After the first attack in the Khair-Khana neighborhood of Kabul,
soldiers of the Taliban religious militia that controls most of
Afghanistan joined hundreds of civilians working in chaotic
conditions, sifting through the rubble of homes and shops searching
for more wounded.
	   Private cars and taxis careened through the streets, rushing
dead and wounded civilians to local hospitals.
	   The Taliban said a roughly four-meter (13-foot) long,
Russian-made missile was fired by a northern alliance of Taliban
foes from about 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of Kabul.
	   It demolished three buildings and severely damaged at least four
others.
	   It has been months since the last rocket strike hit civilians
areas of Kabul, a city that has slowly grown more peaceful in the
nearly two years since the hard-line Taliban seized the city and
imposed its harsh for of Islam.
	   ``There was a very strong sound when it exploded. We had
forgotten about the rockets after the Taliban came, but now we
remember ... now I remember the bad times again,'' said Mahmood, a
shopkeeper who was in his store when the blast shattered its
windows. He would only give his first name.
	   Years of rocket and artillery attacks severely damaged about
half of Kabul. The Khair-Khana neighborhood was spared in most
attacks, and was packed with civilians who moved there from
uninhabitable parts of the city.
	   The religious army now controls about 90 percent of Afghanistan,
although an alliance of anti-Taliban forces continues fighting
north of Kabul, and in the northern and central parts of the
devastated country.

De Boer twins back at Arena but Ajax has to settle for a point
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Ajax Amsterdam wasted countless
chances Sunday and could do no more than tie 1-1 with De Graafschap
Doetinchem.
	   Ajax now lies joint second with FC Utrecht, which drew 1-1 with
Fortuna Sittard, and a point behind Feyenoord, which has the
maximum 12 points from its four games.
	   Feyenoord can extend its league lead if it wins at PSV Eindhoven
Tuesday night. The top-of-the-table clash was postponed from Sunday
because of fears of clashes between rival fans.
	   The Ajax game was the first at home for the De Boer twins,
returning from a two-month lay-off during which both refused to
play for the club because they were denied transfers.
	   The 45,000 Arena crowd greeted the brothers' first touches with
a chorus of whistles, but gradually warmed to the pair, who have
been the mainstay of the successful Ajax teams of recent years.
	   Tijani Babangida missed three clear-cut chances for Ajax in the
first half and an uncharacteristic goalkeeping error from Edwin van
der Sar gave De Graafschap an undreamed-of 1-0 lead on 21 minutes.
	   Robert Fuchs launched a weak and speculative shot from distance
and the ball bounced just in front of Van der Sar and past the
off-balance goalie.
	   It took just five minutes for Ajax to tie the score. Frank de
Boer's quickly-taken free kick produced a first-touch center from
Georgi Kinkladze and a Jari Litmanen tap-in.
	   Ajax stepped up the pressure during the entire second half but
looked too nervous in the penalty area to score.
	   MVV Maastricht gained its first points of the season Saturday
and climbed off the bottom of the table in spectacular fashion,
upsetting championship hopeful Vitesse Arnhem 4-2.

	   The campaign centered on economic issues, with the
non-socialists arguing that Sweden's taxes _ currently the world's
highest _ doom the country to irrelevancy in a rapidly globalizing
economy.
	   The Social Democrats said that Sweden was inching its way back
to a strong economy after suffering in the early part of the decade
while the country tried to dig itself out from under a crushing
debt.
	   Many statistics supported the Social Democrats' argument:
unemployment, although uncomfortably high at 7.3 percent, has
consistently fallen over the past two years; inflation is
negligible and the country expects to run a small budget suprlus
this year.
	   Prime Minister Goeran Persson has said he would not seek a
coalition with the Left Party, which resists his party's economic
pragmatism and favors Sweden's withdrawal from the European Union,
as do the Greens.

Libya expresses reservations about proposed trial site
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with more details. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Libya (AP) _ Libya expressed reservations Sunday about
holding the trial of two suspects in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing at
a former U.S. air base in the Netherlands.
	   It said it was astonished at the choice of Camp Zeist site at
the Soesterberg air base and wants to inspect it before agreeing to
holding the trial there, according to Libya's official JANA news
agency.
	   The Dutch and British governments on Friday signed an agreement
to use Camp Seist, about 32 kilometers (20 miles) southeast of
Amsterdam, for the proposed trial of the two Libyans. Soesterberg
was a U.S. Air Force base from 1954 to 1993.
	   Libya was ``astonished that the two countries could not find
anywhere else to hold the trial in the Netherlands except in a camp
near an air base,'' JANA quoted a Libyan Foreign Ministry official
as saying.
	   He said the site would impede a fair trial because it would deny
the defense team a ``calm and serene atmosphere'' to work in.
	   He also complained that Libya had not been formally informed of
the venue of the trial.
	   ``Libya retains the right to express its reservations,'' said
the official.
	   Libya has accepted a U.S.-British compromise to try the suspects
in the Netherlands by Scottish judges under Scottish law, but
demands assurances for the safety and handling of the two men.
	   Britain and the United States have rejected the Libyan demands.
	   The 1988 bombing of the Pan Am passenger plane over Lockerbie,
Scotland, killed 270 people.

previous titles in 1991, 1993, 1994 and 1995. The pair have led
Spain to the finals seven times in the last eight years.
	   Conchita Martinez averted her team's defeat earlier Sunday,
posting a three set win over Schnyder, evening the score to 2-2.
	   The victory slightly made up for the drubbing Hingis handed
fourth-ranked Sanchez-Vicario in the day's opening match, when the
Swiss teenager had dispatched the Spaniard 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 to give
Switzerland a 2-1 lead.

Iranian soccer hooligans trash 80 buses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hundreds of hooligans trashed 80 buses after
a soccer match in Tehran, Iranian television reported Sunday.
	   Friday's incident occurred after a game between Tehran's
Esteqlal team and San'at-e Naft of the southern port city of Abadan
at the Azadi Stadium in Tehran.
	   Angry Estaqlal fans began trashing the buses which had been
waiting outside the stadium to transport them home after the match
ended in a draw.
	   It was not clear if police made any arrests.
	   The television quoted an official of the state-owned Vahed bus
company as saying that the hooligans smashed the windows of the
buses and caused serious damage to the seats.
	   The damage was estimated at more than 70 million rials (dlrs
33,000).
	   The match reportedly attracted a crowd of 35,000, said the TV
report which was monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation.

Right fails to get majority in Swedish elections

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Non-socialist parties fell short Sunday
in their bid to get a majority of seats in Sweden's parliament,
according to an exit poll by Swedish national televison.
	   The exit poll, released moments after voting closed, showed the
governing Social Democrats getting only 35.4 percent of the vote, a
substantial slump from the 45 percent they got four years ago. But
the Left Party surged to 13.3 percent and the Greens got another
4.9 percent.
	   Together that would give the parties enough to block the four
non-socialist parties taking power. But a Social
Democrats-Left-Greens alliance, even if it would not be a formal
governing coalition, makes for an awkward constellation.
	   The major conservative party, the Moderates of former Prime
Minister Carl Bildt, attracted just 21.8 percent of the votes,
according to the exit poll conducted by SVT television. The
Christian Democrats more than doubled their current representation
with 10.5 percent of the vote, while the Center and Liberal parties
got 6.0 and 5.6 percent respectively, SVT said.
	   The remainder of the vote went to fringe parties. A party must
get 4 percent of the national vote to get one of the 349 seats in
the Riksdag parliament. 288 intj sto stoj stod stoa nat
	   The campaign centered on economic issues, with the
non-socialists arguing that Sweden's taxes _ currently the world's
highest _ doom the country to irrelevancy in a rapidly globalizing
economy.
	   The Social Democrats said that Sweden was inching its way back
to a strong economy after suffering in the early part of the decade
while the country tried to dig itself out from under a crushing
debt.
	   Many statistics supported the Social Democrats' argument:
unemployment, although uncomfortably high at 7.3 percent, has
consistently fallen over the past two years; inflation is
negligible and the country expects to run a small budget suprlus
this year.
	   Prime Minister Goeran Persson has said he would not seek a
coalition with the Left Party, which resists his party's economic
pragmatism and favors Sweden's withdrawal from the European Union,
as do the Greens.

Malaysia echoes unrest that toppled Indonesia's Suharto
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Malaysia-Politics &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Protesters shout `Reform!'' and
angrily demand that their longtime leader quit. Police break up the
street crowd with tear gas. The backdrop is a stagnant economy and
growing charges of corruption in government.
	   The tumultuous scene in the Malaysian capital Sunday was
reminiscent of the unrest that convulsed neighboring Indonesia
earlier this year and forced the ouster of autocratic President
Suharto after 32 years in power.
	   Indonesia's student protests surged in size and vigor over
several months, even without high-profile leaders.
	   But the fledgling movement against Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad of Malaysia may rely on one man: his sacked deputy, Anwar
Ibrahim.
	   It remains to be seen whether the arrest of Anwar on Sunday will
galvanize the deputy's supporters or mute them.
	   Mahathir has led Malaysia for 17 years, and like Suharto at the
peak of his authority, shows little interest in relinquishing power
soon. And much like the Indonesian leader, he has imposed tight
curbs on the opposition in a nominally democratic system.
	   So the arrest of Anwar, once Mahathir's handpicked successor and
now his principal foe, appears to be an attempt to thwart the kind
of groundswell of protest that dislodged 77-year-old Suharto.
	   Mahathir, 72, became Asia's longest-serving leader when Suharto
was forced out.
	   Anwar's arrest coincided with a march by his supporters toward
Mahathir's house in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital. Police
dispersed the demonstrators with tear gas canisters and water
cannons.
	   Anwar, 51, was fired by Mahathir on Sept. 2 and since then had
been traveling the country, rallying opposition in stadiums and
mosques. He had become more strident, calling openly for the
Malaysian leader to quit.
	   Anwar is keenly aware of the parallel with Indonesia, where
students staged almost daily rallies against what they said was
endemic corruption practiced by Suharto and his family. Malaysia's
government is sensitive to similar charges.
	   ``The fall of Suharto had to do with corruption,'' Anwar said
recently. ``That's why the paranoia about the terms cronyism,
nepotism and corruption.''
	   Mahathir has bristled at comparisons between his rule and that
of the former leader of Indonesia. He has vehemently denied charges
that graft is rampant in his administration.
	   Indonesian opposition leader Amien Rais, who was at the
forefront of the campaign to oust Suharto, has said corruption in
Malaysia is not as deep-rooted as in Indonesia.
	   Still, as economic hardship mushrooms, discontent in normally
placid Malaysia is growing.
	   Undermined by the Asian financial crisis, the Malaysian economy
contracted by almost 7 percent in the second quarter of 1998,
pushing it into full-blown recession.
	   Indonesia's less-developed economy is in far worse shape. It is
expected to contract by as much as 15 percent this year and tens of
millions of people have slid below the poverty line.
	   The unrest that toppled Suharto reached its height in May, a
week before he stepped down, when as many as 1,200 people died in
riots across the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. Much of the mob fury
was over spiraling prices of rice, gasoline and other necessities.
	   Malaysia's relative wealth makes it unlikely that such violence
would rock the Southeast Asian nation.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ King Hussein, speaking from his hospital
bed in the United States, assured Jordanians Sunday that his health
is improving and his morale is high.
	   ``My treatment is going well and the results are encouraging,''
Hussein, 63, told Jordan Television in a telephone interview from
the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. The interview was broadcast
nationally.
	   Hussein, who is suffering from lymphatic cancer, arrived was
admitted to the clinic in July.
	   ``Everything is perfectly well and my morale is high,'' he said,
adding that he has to complete three more phases of chemotherapy _
each lasting three weeks.
	   His doctors and government officials have said that they expect
the king to be completely cured before he returns home in late
November.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Libya (AP) _ Libya expressed reservations Sunday about
holding the trial of two suspects in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing at
a former U.S. air base in the Netherlands.
	   It said it was astonished at the choice of Camp Zeist site at
the Soesterberg air base and wants to inspect it before agreeing to
holding the trial there, according to Libya's official JANA news
agency.
	   The Dutch and British governments on Friday signed an agreement
to use Camp Zeist, about 32 kilometers (20 miles) southeast of
Amsterdam, for the proposed trial of the two Libyans. Soesterberg
was a U.S. Air Force base from 1954 to 1993.
	   Libya was ``astonished that the two countries could not find
anywhere else to hold the trial in the Netherlands except in a camp
near an air base,'' JANA quoted a Libyan Foreign Ministry official
as saying.
	   He said the site would impede a fair trial because it would deny
the defense team a ``calm and serene atmosphere'' to work in.
	   He also complained that Libya had not been formally informed of
the venue of the trial.
	   ``Libya retains the right to express its reservations,'' said
the official.
	   Libya has accepted a U.S.-British compromise to try the suspects
in the Netherlands by Scottish judges under Scottish law, but
demands assurances for the safety and handling of the two men.
	   Britain and the United States have rejected the Libyan demands.
	   The 1988 bombing of the Pan Am passenger plane over Lockerbie,
Scotland, killed 270 people.

Britain recruited mole in Germany's central bank, report said
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A former British spy has claimed Britain recruited
a high-level mole inside Germany's central bank to betray his
country's economic secrets, The Sunday Times reported.
	   Richard Tomlinson claimed the German was a senior officer in the
Bundesbank, and was recruited in 1986 to pass financial secrets to
Britain's spy agency, the newspaper said.
	   Tomlinson said the German official, code-named Orcada, disclosed
Germany's negotiating position during talks on the 1992 Maastricht
treaty on European unity, the newspaper said. The German official
also gave details about Germany's interest-rate movements, the
newspaper quoted Tomlinson as saying.
	   The Sunday Times said Tomlinson makes these allegations in a
letter to a British Parliament intelligence and security committee.
Tomlinson's claims were also published on the Internet by
journalists in Switzerland, where Tomlinson may seek political
asylum, the newspaper said.
	   Tomlinson, 35, left Britain two months ago after spending four
months in jail for trying to sell his memoirs in breach of
Britain's Official Secrets Act. He has been an outspoken critic of
his former employer, accusing the MI-6 security service of being
inefficient and unaccountable.
	   But Tomlinson was widely criticized last month after meeting
privately with the judge investigating the crash that killed
Princess Diana last year, and allegedly claiming the MI-6 played a
role. The Sunday Times said that Tomlinson insists his remarks to
the judge had been ``misrepresented.''
	   In these latest allegations, the newspaper quotes Tomlinson as
saying the German spy was considered ``among the best paid and most
important of any MI-6 agents.''
	   The newspaper said Germany's financial secrets would have been
``invaluable'' to British officials because the German bank had
been the interest-rate setting body for Europe for the past two
decades, and it played a key role in decisions about a single
European currency.
	   Norman Lamont, the British chancellor from 1990 to 1993, told
The Sunday Times that he had no knowledge of a spying campaign
aimed at Germany's central bank. He told the newspaper it would
have been ''highly improper and utterly pointless.''
	   The Sunday Times also said Tomlinson claimed that Britain's spy
agency had targeted France, Spain, Italy and Switzerland in
addition to Germany, although he did not offer details.
	   British newspapers have been blocked from reporting many of
Tomlinson's previous claims because of a sweeping injunction
granted to MI-6. However, The Sunday Times argued this latest claim
did not fall under that injunction because much of it had already
been published on the Internet.
	   Tomlinson's allegations follow separate claims by a former
British security officer, David Shayler, who is being held in
France pending extradition to Britain. Shayler claims the MI-6 was
involved in plans to assassinate Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. The
Foreign Office denies those claims.

Benefit match raises money for injured French policeman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KEHL AM RHEIN, Germany (AP) _ A benefit match featuring former
international stars from Germany and France Saturday raised 1
million marks (dlrs 600,000) for Daniel Nivel, the policeman beaten
by hooligans at the World Cup
	   Under the motto ``Yes to soccer without violence,'' former
national team players from the two countries, including Rudi
Voeller and Michele Hidalgo, played in front of 4,000 spectators in
this southern German city.
	   Soccer stars like Aime Jacquet, who led France to its recent
World Cup triumph, also attended the relaxed match, in which
retired players from both countries played together on teams simply
called green and white.
	   ``The least I can do is set an example with my presence,'' said
Jacquet, now a technical director for France's soccer organization.
	   German hooligans brutally attacked Nivel with an iron bar on the
streets of Lenz on June 21 before Germany's match against
Yugoslavia in pictures caught by cameras and flashed around the
world.
	   The 44-year-old policeman lay in a coma for six weeks, but after
rehabilitation is now able to walk a few steps.
	   Six of the hooligans are being held in German jails and two more
in France.
	   ``It's a very moving occasion for me, what's being organized.
This was an excellent idea,'' said Claude Simonet, president of the
French Soccer Organization.
	   The money, handed to a French policeman at halftime, was raised
from sources ranging from German police unions to the listener
contributions collected by radio stations.
	   The Green team, with former German international Horst Hrubesch
scoring four goals, edged the white team 5-4, which was led by Jose
Toure's two scores.
	   But the match wasn't taken seriously by either side, with the
first half of 40 minutes being chopped by two minutes to give the
retired stars a breather.
	   The greens' leader was Felix Magath, a former German World Cup
player, and the whites was Hidalgo, a member of France's 1984
European championship side.
	   The soccer organizations of both countries had originally
planned to hold the match in Paris during the World Cup, but it was
canceled since Germany's fans went home after their team was ousted
in the quarterfinals.
	   ``This is a clear signal against hooliganism _ violence has
nothing to do with soccer,'' said Sepp Blatter, president of FIFA,
the sport's international governing body.

Georges begins whipping Caribbean islands

<TEXT>
	   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) _ Families huddled in basements and
businesses barricaded their entrances with sandbags as Hurricane
Georges began lashing the easternmost islands of the Caribbean
Sunday.
	   Winds were gusting at 50 mph (80 kph) in Antigua by 2 p.m. (1800
GMT) Sunday, with forecasters predicting the arrival of the
hurricane's full 135 mph (220 kph) fury by Sunday evening.
	   Many government officials warned Georges could cause the worst
damage in decades. Residents on Guadeloupe and Dominica, fearing
the hurricane would peel roofs off homes, moved beds into their
basements or headed to hurricane shelters set up in schools.
	   Many church congregations cut Sunday services short in order to
convert their sanctuaries into shelters.
	   At 2 p.m. (1800 GMT), a hurricane hunter airplane had located
Georges' center near 16.4 degrees north, 59.2 degrees west, or
about 150 miles (240 kilometers) east of Guadaloupe. It had slowed
slightly to 16 mph (26 kph) and was forecast to sweep through the
Lesser Antilles, threatening Puerto Rico and the British and U.S.
Virgin Islands on Monday.
	   On Antigua, workers at the island's cable television company
took down its satellite dishes, while others removed aluminum light
poles from the parking lot of the island's Woods Centre shopping
center. Rain began at noon and was growing more intense by the
hour.
	   Officials in Dominica compared the storm to 1979's Hurricane
David, which flattened neighborhoods and devastated the island's
banana industry.
	   Farther west, residents in Puerto Rico rushed to stores for
plywood, water and canned food. Many stores reported they were sold
out of ice, as residents prepared for power outages.
	   ``Hurricanes come every year here, but this one looks like it's
serious,'' said Jose Firpi as he boarded up windows in his San Juan
home.
	   Gov. Pedro Rossello announced a ban on liquor sales beginning
Sunday night, activated the island's national guard and ordered
officials to begin preparing more than 300 shelters. He also
suspended a small-business protection law that limits sales of
``non-essential'' household items on Sundays.
	   American Airlines _ the island's chief link to the U.S. mainland
_ announced it was cancelling all flights into Puerto Rico on
Monday.
	   Georges is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale,
meaning it is comparable to Hurricane Andrew, which tore through
parts of southern Florida in 1992, or 1989's Hurricane Hugo, which
spread destruction throughout the Caribbean.
	   On St. Croix, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, residents who remember
when Hugo damaged 95 percent of the island's homes withdrew money
from bank machines and waited in long lines at gas stations.
	   ``I am totally bewildered,'' said Josiah Mercury as she
hurriedly picked up crackers and bottled water at a supermarket.
``The most I can do is prepare and take the warning seriously.''
	   Jean-Jack Queyranne, the French minister of overseas
departments, sent 40 public service officers each to Martinique and
Guadeloupe to prepare for the hurricane.
	   The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency sent Early Response
Teams, which include health care workers, engineers, firefighters
and other professionals, to the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico
ahead of the storm.
	   The Hurricane Center said storm surge flooding of five to 10
feet (1.5 to 3 meters) above normal tide levels should be expected
in islands within the 85-mile (140-kilometer) hurricane-wind radius
along with five to eight inches (13 to 20 centimeters) of rain,
with heavier rainfall possible in some areas.

`Iran belongs to every Iranian,' Khatami tells Iranian-Americans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iranian Americans who fled their native
land's Islamic revolution still have a stake in the Islamic
Republic, its President said Sunday _ regardless of their political
beliefs.
	   Mohammad Khatami galvanized hundreds of Iranians who had left
during his predecessors' rule, striding into the packed hall clad
in the brown flowing gown of a Shiite Muslim cleric and a black
turban that signifies his descent from Islam's 7th century prophet,
Mohammed.
	   ``Iran belongs to you as much as to any other Iranian,'' the
moderate cleric told the 800 Iranian-Americans invited to hear him
speak at a U.N. conference hall amid tight security.
	   He is in New York to address this year's opening session of the
U.N. General Assmbly on Monday. Many other world leaders, including
U.S. President Bill Clinton, are also due to address the assembly.
	   Many in the audience _ who gave Khatami a standing ovation _
left Iran after the 1979 Islamic revolution brought a hard-line
religious government to power.
	   Khatami, who has been trying to introduce political and social
reforms, has given new hope to many Iranians who would like to
return, or just to visit, their homeland.
	   ``Your country is your identity. You cannot escape from that
unless you escape from yourself ... Nationhood is not a piece of
land. It's in your blood,'' Khatami told the crowd, many among them
women wearing head scarves or long overcoats in deference to Iran's
Islamic dress code for women.
	   He called on Iranian experts and scientists living abroad,
whatever their political beliefs, to return home and help in the
reconstruction of the country.
	   He went on to answer questions ranging from problems faced by
Iranians abroad in obtaining the necessary paper work to visit
home, to his concept of law and freedom and women's rights.
	   Khatami said that Iran wanted a peaceful solution to the current
stand-off with the Afghan Taliban militia, but added it was ready
to defend itself against ``aggression.''
	   ``We are putting all our efforts into preventing a war. We hope
that the international community puts pressure on the Taliban to
end this tragedy,'' Khatami said.
	   ``This man is a man of the hearts, not a man of war,'' said
Nasser Saebi, an inventor who came from Arizona to hear Khatami,
whose speech was carried live on the Internet. Questions, delivered
through the World Wide Web, came from around the world.
	   Shortly after he became president, Khatami called for a
``dialogue of civilizations'' with the whole world, including the
United States.
	   In a country whose Islamic government has long called the United
States ``The Great Satan'' and thumbed its nose at all things
Western, Khatami said that there was much to learn from Western
civilization.
	   His emphasis on freedom of speech and the rule of law has earned
Khatami great popularity in his country _ but it has also riled
powerful hard-line political opponents.
	   Over the past week, they have closed down three liberal
newspapers, jailing several senior editors and publishers for their
outspoken political views and opposition to a possible war with the
Taliban.

Wasim Akram bows out as Lancashire finish runners-up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Wasim Akram ended his 10-year association with
Lancashire on Sunday by leading it to second place in the English
County Championship with a 161-run win over Hampshire at Old
Trafford.
	   The former Pakistan captain, who resigned from international
cricket last week to fight match-fixing allegations, had already
steered Lancashire to two limited-overs titles this season.
	   However, he failed in his bid to secure Lancashire's third title
when Leicestershire beat Surrey by an innings and 221 runs at the
Oval on Saturday.
	   Going into the final round, Leicestershire, Surrey and
Lancashire were all battling for first place.
	   But Leicestershire's demolition of Surrey put the championship
beyond doubt and gave Leicestershire its second county championship
in three years.
	   Lancashire leap-frogged Surrey into second place in the
standings with its comprehensive win over Hampshire.
	   Surrey dropped from second to fifth, with Hampshire finishing
sixth. Yorkshire snared third place with a last-round 10-wicket win
over Sussex.
	   Akram resigned as Lancashire's international player earlier in
the season when he announced he wanted to concentrate on Pakistan's
1999 World Cup campaign.
	   Lancashire subsequently signed Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah
Muralitharan, on Akram's recommendation, just days before the
32-year-old all-rounder resigned from international cricket and
asked for his job back.
	   However, Lancashire had agreed terms with Muralitharan, meaning
Akram can either find a new county or sit-out the next English
domestic season.
	   ``I am thrilled, happy and yet sad to be going. All of that I
feel after such a great season and 10 years when we have worked so
hard and achieved so much,'' Akram said Sunday.
	   He played a major role in Lancashire's win by sparking
Hampshire's first innings collapse, taking 4-37 as the visitors
were dismmissed for 172 in reply to Lancashire's 185.
	   Lancashire declared at 449 for four in its second innings, with
John Crawley scoring 239, and then bowled Hampshire out for 301 to
seal the result early Sunday.

Spain beats Switzerland 3-2 in Fed Cup final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS detail, background, CHANGES throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA, Switzerland (AP) _ Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario and Conchita
Martinez won their doubles match in striaght sets Sunday to lift
Spain to a 3-2 victory over Switzerland and collect the nation's
fifth Fed Cup crown.
	   The two veterans, who led Spain to its five titles, defeated
world No. 1 Martina Hingis and Patty Schnyder 6-0, 6-2, in the
tie-breaking doubles match that took under an hour.
	   Sanchez-Vicario and Martinez figured in all four of Spain's
previous titles in 1991, 1993, 1994 and 1995. The pair have led
Spain to the finals seven times in the last eight years.
	   ``This was probably one of the best wons of all,'' said
Sanchez-Vicario, still breathing hard from the effort. ``We played
one of the best teams and worked so hard to get the victory.
	   ``Viva Espagna! I'm so happy!''
	   Spain steamrolled over Hingis and an exhausted Schnyder in the
first set in just 24 minutes.
	   The second didn't take much longer, though the Swiss tandem
seemed to gather some strength from their desperate position.
	   The Swiss held serve until the fifth game when they failed to
save two break points, allowing the Spanish duo to leap ahead 4-2.
Leading 5-2 Spain failed to convert on their first match point, but
made the most of their second, breaking the Swiss for the title.
	   Paired up, Sanchez-Vicario and Martinez have won 17 of their
last 20 Fed Cup doubles matches, including the last eight.
	   The last Fed Cup title decided by the doubles was in 1991, when
Spain defeated the United States 2-1 to collect the country's first
title.
	   The victory slightly made up for the drubbing Hingis handed
fourth-ranked Sanchez-Vicario in the day's opening match, when the
Swiss teenager had extended her enduring domination of Spanish
player, winning 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 to give Switzerland a 2-1 lead.
	   Conchita Martinez averted her team's defeat, posting a three set
win over Schnyder, evening the score to 2-2 in the best-of-five
final.
	   The draw set the stage for the tie-breaking doubles match, the
10th in the history of the Fed Cup.
	   Over 12,000 frantic spectators packing the Palexpo watched
anxiously throughout the 3 hour, 18 minute marathon as Martinez and
Schnyder duelled relentlessly, with the Spaniard finally prevailing
6-3, 2-6, 9-7.
	   Martinez took the first set in convincing fashion, before losing
her opening serve in the second.
	   The Swiss player broke again to jump ahead 4-1, then held her
serves to even the sets.
	   Martinez jumped to a 3-0 lead in the final set, but lifted by
the frenzied home crowd, Schnyder broke back to narrow the gap to
3-2, then saved three break points to hold serve and even the score
3-3.
	   The two traded breaks to remain on serve at 4-4, then each held
serve _ often with great difficulty _ to 7-7.
	   Martinez held to lead 8-7, then overcame Schnyder's serve with a
break point to spare.
	   Hingis extended her winning streak over Sanchez-Vicario to
seven, with the Spaniard's last victory over the Swiss teenager
dating back two and a half years ago, when Hingis was only 15.
	   Spurred on by a hysterical home crowd, Hingis opened play
scoring seven consecutive points. While the Spaniard managed to
hold her first serve, Hingis monopolized the next nine points to
break Sanchez-Vicario's second and jump to a 3-1 lead.
	   Sanchez-Vicario broke back but the remainder of the set was a
struggle, and a gutsy effort in the tie-break proved insufficient.
	   Hingis then broke Sanchez-Vicario's opening serve in the second
set.
	   A valiant Sanchez-Vicario saved a massive five break points in a
gut-clenching exchange, before finally yeilding her serve to
Hingis, who jumped ahead 4-1.
	   With Hingis suffering from leg cramps, Sanchez-Vicario broke the
Swiss player's serve to narrow the gap to 5-3, only to have Hingis
break back immediately.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The scandal surrounding U.S. President Bill
Clinton is depriving the world of U.S. leadership and could prolong
the Asian economic crisis, .Singapore's elder statesman Lee Kuan
Yew said Sunday .
	   ``I wish it hasn't happened because I think it's no good for
us,'' Lee said about the sex and lies scandal that could lead to
Clinton's impeachment.
	   A founder of modern Singapore, Lee was speaking to the Foreign
Correspondent Association in Singapore. Singapore, small and
wealthy, is one of key U.S. allies in the region.
	   Lee compared Clinton's need to rally a worldwide effort to
address the financial crisis to the effort former U.S. President
George Bush made to gather international support for Operation
Desert Storm.
	   ``I think Clinton's present difficulties will make it more
difficult to achieve that kind of coordination,'' Lee said.
	   ``I'm disappointed that events turned out this way. It's not
going to be good for Asia. It's not going to be good for the
world.''
	   If a similar scandal happened in Singapore, ``the man would
quietly resign,'' said Lee, a creator of porn-free Singapore and a
dedicated family man. And he added: ``And then we would give him a
very good farewell dinner, a farewell drink, and send the girl with
him.''

Socialists head for narrow win over right in Sweden
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with early results &QL;

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The Social Democrats and the Left Party
on Sunday blocked non-socialist parties from winning a majority of
parliament seats in national elections, according to early results.
	   With about 5 percent of the vote counted, the governing Social
Democrats had only 34.8 percent of the vote _ the worst-ever
showing for the party that has governed Sweden for most of the past
seven decades. But many of the votes they lost apparently went to
the ex-Communist Left Party, which surged to 16 percent.
	   Although Prime Minister Goeran Persson has said he would not
form a government with the Left, he can count on its support on
most measures because the Left has no other likely allies.
	   The main conservative opposition, the Moderates of former Prime
Minister Carl Bildt, dove to just 13 percent, according to the
early results, lower than the Christian Democrats who nearly
quadrupled their current representation to 15.8 percent.
	   The Center Party _ which follows an idiosyncratic program of
conservative economics and staunch environmentalism had 11.5
percent in the early results. Two parties currently in parliament,
the Liberals and the Greens, were below the 4-percent cutoff point
for getting representation in the 349-seat Riksdag.
	   The campaign centered on economic issues, with the
non-socialists arguing that Sweden's taxes _ currently the world's
highest _ doom the country to irrelevancy in a rapidly globalizing
economy.
	   The Social Democrats said that Sweden was inching its way back
to a strong economy after suffering in the early part of the decade
while the country tried to dig itself out from under a crushing
debt.
	   Many statistics supported the Social Democrats' argument:
unemployment, although uncomfortably high at 7.3 percent, has
consistently fallen over the past two years; inflation is
negligible and the country expects to run a small budget suprlus
this year.
	   Persson opposes a coalition with the Left because they resist
his party's economic pragmatism and favor Sweden's withdrawal from
the European Union.

Benefit match raises money for injured French policeman
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: SUBS third graf to clarify Jacquet was French coach &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KEHL AM RHEIN, Germany (AP) _ A benefit match featuring former
international stars from Germany and France Saturday raised 1
million marks (dlrs 600,000) for Daniel Nivel, the policeman beaten
by hooligans at the World Cup
	   Under the motto ``Yes to soccer without violence,'' former
national team players from the two countries, including Rudi
Voeller and Michele Hidalgo, played in front of 4,000 spectators in
this southern German city.
	   Top officials like Aime Jacquet, who coached France to its
recent World Cup triumph, also attended the relaxed match, in which
retired players from both countries played together on teams simply
called green and white.
	   ``The least I can do is set an example with my presence,'' said
Jacquet, now a technical director for France's soccer organization.
	   German hooligans brutally attacked Nivel with an iron bar on the
streets of Lenz on June 21 before Germany's match against
Yugoslavia in pictures caught by cameras and flashed around the
world.
	   The 44-year-old policeman lay in a coma for six weeks, but after
rehabilitation is now able to walk a few steps.
	   Six of the hooligans are being held in German jails and two more
in France.
	   ``It's a very moving occasion for me, what's being organized.
This was an excellent idea,'' said Claude Simonet, president of the
French Soccer Organization.
	   The money, handed to a French policeman at halftime, was raised
from sources ranging from German police unions to the listener
contributions collected by radio stations.
	   The Green team, with former German international Horst Hrubesch
scoring four goals, edged the white team 5-4, which was led by Jose
Toure's two scores.
	   But the match wasn't taken seriously by either side, with the
first half of 40 minutes being chopped by two minutes to give the
retired stars a breather.
	   The greens' leader was Felix Magath, a former German World Cup
player, and the whites was Hidalgo, a member of France's 1984
European championship side.
	   The soccer organizations of both countries had originally
planned to hold the match in Paris during the World Cup, but it was
canceled since Germany's fans went home after their team was ousted
in the quarterfinals.
	   ``This is a clear signal against hooliganism _ violence has
nothing to do with soccer,'' said Sepp Blatter, president of FIFA,
the sport's international governing body.

Spain beats Switzerland 3-2 in Fed Cup final

	   GENEVA, Switzerland (AP) _ Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario and Conchita
Martinez won their doubles match in straight sets Sunday to lift
Spain to a 3-2 victory over Switzerland and collect Spain's fifth
Fed Cup crown.
	   Sanchez-Vicario and Martinez defeated world No. 1 Martina Hingis
and Patty Schnyder 6-0, 6-2, in the tie-breaking doubles match that
took under an hour.
	   The two veterans figured in all four of Spain's previous titles
in 1991, 1993, 1994 and 1995. The pair have led Spain to the finals
seven times in the last eight years.
	   ``This was probably one of the best wins of all,'' said
Sanchez-Vicario, still breathing hard from the effort. ``We played
one of the best teams and worked so hard to get the victory.
	   ``Viva Espagna! I'm so happy!''
	   The two steamrolled over Hingis and an exhausted Schnyder in the
first set in just 24 minutes.
	   The second didn't take much longer.
	   The Swiss held serve until the fifth game when they failed to
save two break points, allowing the Spanish duo to leap ahead 4-2.
Leading 5-2, Spain failed to convert on their first match point,
but made the most of their second, breaking the Swiss for the
title.
	   The last Fed Cup title decided by the doubles was in 1991, when
Spain defeated the United States 2-1.
	   Earlier in the day, Hingis handed fourth-ranked Sanchez-Vicario
a drubbing in the opening match, defeating the Spanish player 7-6
(7-5) 6-3 to give Switzerland a 2-1 lead.
	   Conchita Martinez saved her team, posting a 6-3, 2-6, 9-7
victory over Schnyder, evening the score at 2-2 in the best-of-five
final.
	   Martinez took the first set in convincing fashion, before losing
her opening serve in the second.
	   The Swiss player broke again to jump ahead 4-1, then held her
serves to even the sets.
	   Martinez jumped to a 3-0 lead in the final set, but lifted by
the frenzied home crowd, Schnyder broke back to narrow the gap to
3-2, then saved three break points to hold serve and even the score
3-3.
	   The two traded breaks to remain on serve at 4-4, then each held
serve _ often with great difficulty _ to 7-7.
	   Martinez held to lead 8-7, then overcame Schnyder's serve with a
break point to spare.
	   Hingis extended her winning streak over Sanchez-Vicario to
seven, with the Spaniard's last victory over the Swiss teen-ager
dating back 2 1/2 years ago, when Hingis was only 15.
	   Hingis opened by scoring seven consecutive points. While the
Spaniard managed to hold her first serve, Hingis monopolized the
next nine points to break Sanchez-Vicario's second and jump to a
3-1 lead.
	   Sanchez-Vicario broke back but the remainder of the set was a
struggle, and a gutsy effort in the tie-break proved insufficient.
	   Hingis then broke Sanchez-Vicario's opening serve in the second
set.
	   With Hingis suffering from leg cramps, Sanchez-Vicario broke the
Swiss player's serve to narrow the gap to 5-3, only to have Hingis
break back immediately.

King says his health is improving, morale high
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ King Hussein, speaking from his hospital
bed in the United States, assured Jordanians on Sunday that his
health is improving and his morale is high.
	   ``My treatment is going well and the results are encouraging,''
Hussein, 63, told Jordan Television in a telephone interview from
the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. The interview was
broadcast nationally.
	   Hussein, who is suffering from lymphatic cancer, was admitted to
the clinic in July.
	   ``Everything is perfectly well and my morale is high,'' he said,
adding that he has to complete three more phases of chemotherapy _
each lasting three weeks.
	   His doctors and government officials have said that they expect
the king to be completely cured before he returns home in late
November.

Liberian capital tense after weekend gun battles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout to ADD color from Monrovia, quotes,
background on Johnson. ADDs byline. No pickup.
 &UR; By TIM SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ One day after battles left parts of the
Liberian capital littered with corpses and the wreckage of war, the
government on Sunday accused former rebel warlord Roosevelt Johnson
of plotting against President Charles Taylor.
	   Information Minister Joe Mulbah, speaking on state radio, said
Johnson had been training a force to subvert the government.
	   ``The government prays that Roosevelt Johnson and his
collaborators be arrested for treason,'' Mulbah said.
	   Moves to nab Johnson and his supporters on Saturday, however,
triggered day-long firefights in downtown Monrovia, leaving at
least 33 people dead.
	   Volunteers on Sunday performed the grim task of collecting dead
bodies from Monrovia's streets. Calm returned to the city, but many
people stayed home for fear the fighting could flare up again.
	   Hundreds of soldiers watched over the streets, stopping cars at
checkpoints throughout the city.
	   Dozens of people were wounded by stray bullets during the
fighting, which centered around Johnson's home in the Camp Johnson
Road district. On Sunday, dozens of camouflage-wearing soldiers
patrolled the streets of that neighborhood, stopping cars and
chasing away pedestrians.
	   Tanks, with helmeted men sticking their heads out of the turret
hatches, occasionally rumbled past.
	   A half-dozen soldiers lounged in front of Johnson's ramshackle
concrete house, marked by the wreckage of a 4-door Mazda that had
been torn apart by gunfire.
	   Next door, an armored car, it's tires blown out, it's windows
pocked by gunfire, sat crippled. Witnesses said dozens of people
had been forced from their homes in the neighborhood, a stronghold
of Johnson supporters.
	   On Saturday, explosions from rocket and mortar rounds echoed
through the streets.
	   The city's residents, who saw combat flare repeatedly in
Monrovia during Liberia's seven-year war, were hoping this round of
fighting was over.
	   ``We can't take much more of this,'' said Thomas Nelson.
	   Government troops captured Johnson's residence after issuing an
order for his arrest. Johnson fled his home on Saturday and was
reportedly hiding out in the U.S. Embassy.
	   Embassy officials refused to comment on the claim, but Taylor
issued a warning to the United States not to help Johnson and his
allies.
	   ``The Liberian government will not react lightly to any attempt
by the U.S. government to evacuate those individuals,'' Taylor said
in an earlier radio address.
	   Johnson is a longtime rival of the president's.
	   Taylor's attempt to arrest him in 1996 touched off months of
brutal fighting that left hundreds of people in Monrovia dead and
the city a burned-out, looted wreck. Johnson eventually fled to
Ghana _ after taking shelter in the U.S. embassy and then flying
out of the country in an American helicopter.
	   He and Taylor eventually reached a tenuous peace.
	   Johnson returned from exile to become Liberia's rural
development minister after Taylor won last July's presidential
elections. He has become distanced from Taylor's administration in
recent months and his future in the government is unclear.
	   Tensions between Taylor and Johnson have persisted and forces
loyal to both sides have clashed several times in recent months.
	   In one instance, Taylor's personal security unit clashed with
Johnson's supporters, who accused the president of trying to kidnap
and assassinate their leader.
	   Liberians have vivid memories of their country's civil war,
which left 150,000 people dead and prompted countless thousands
more to flee their homes before it ended in 1996.

Libya expresses reservations about proposed trial site
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS dateline. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya expressed reservations Sunday about
holding the trial of two suspects in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing at
a former U.S. air base in the Netherlands.
	   It said it was astonished at the choice of Camp Zeist site at
the Soesterberg air base and wants to inspect it before agreeing to
holding the trial there, according to Libya's official JANA news
agency.
	   The Dutch and British governments on Friday signed an agreement
to use Camp Zeist, about 32 kilometers (20 miles) southeast of
Amsterdam, for the proposed trial of the two Libyans. Soesterberg
was a U.S. Air Force base from 1954 to 1993.
	   Libya was ``astonished that the two countries could not find
anywhere else to hold the trial in the Netherlands except in a camp

Socialists head for narrow win over right in Sweden

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The Social Democrats, who built
Sweden's high-tax welfare state, and the Left Party on Sunday
blocked non-socialist parties from winning a majority of parliament
seats in national elections, according to early results.
	   With about 36 percent of the vote counted, the governing Social
Democrats had 39 percent of the vote _ one of the worst-ever
showing for the party that has governed Sweden for most of the past
seven decades. But many of the votes they lost apparently went to
the ex-Communist Left Party, which surged to 12.7 percent.
	   Although Prime Minister Goeran Persson has said he would not
form a government with the Left, he can count on its support on
most measures because the Left has no other likely allies.
	   The main conservative opposition, the Moderates of former Prime
Minister Carl Bildt, slipped to just 18.1 percent, according to the
early results, lower than the Christian Democrats who tripled their
current representation to 12.7 percent.
	   The Center Party _ which follows an idiosyncratic program of
conservative economics and staunch environmentalism had 7.4 percent
in the early results. The Greens, with 4.3 percent, were hovering
on the verge of being out of Parliament because a party must get 4
percent of the vote in order to get into the 349-seat Riksdag. The
Liberals, currently in parliament, were below the cutoff point.
	   The campaign centered on economic issues, with the
non-socialists arguing that Sweden's taxes _ currently the world's
highest _ doom the country to irrelevancy in a rapidly globalizing
economy.
	   The Social Democrats said that Sweden was inching its way back
to a strong economy after suffering in the early part of the decade
while the country tried to dig itself out from under a crushing
debt.
	   Many statistics supported the Social Democrats' argument:
unemployment, although uncomfortably high at 7.3 percent, has
consistently fallen over the past two years; inflation is
negligible and the country expects to run a small budget suprlus
this year.
	   Persson opposes a coalition with the Left because they resist
his party's economic pragmatism and favor Sweden's withdrawal from
the European Union.

Arsenal scores record win over Manchester United, 1st Ld-Writethru

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Swedish international Fredrik Ljungberg scored his
maiden Premier League goal on debut Sunday to give Arsenal a 3-0
win over Manchester United at Highbury.
	   The defending F.A. Cup and League-double titlist led 2-0 when
Ljungberg, a second-half substitute, scored in the 84th minute to
ensure the result.
	   Arsenal became the first team in Premier League history to beat
Manchester United in three successive league matches.
	   The Gunners stretched their winning sequence against Manchester
United to four, including the 3-0 Charity Shield win at Wembley in
August.
	   Arsenal moved into fifth place in the standings with two wins
and four draws from six matches.
	   Manchester United midfielder Nicky Butt left his team one-man
short for the second time in as many matches when he was red-carded
for a serious foul on Patick Vieira near the penalty box in the
51st minute.
	   Butt was also sent-off in United's 3-3 tie with Barcelona in the
European Champions League opener at Old Trafford on Wednesday.
	   He conceded a penalty in front of goal Sunday, which Arsenal
missed to extend its lead to three, and left last season's
runners-up with 10 men for 30 minutes.
	   Gunners' captain Tony Adams opened the scoring with a well-timed
header from a David Hughes penalty kick in the 14th minute. It was
Arsenal's fourth goal of the league campaign but one of its most
valuable.
	   Hughes, deputizing for the injured Emmanuel Petit, fired in the
pass from the right side and Adams outjumped Jaap Stam for a gentle
header past Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel.
	   United's England midfielder David Beckham went close to
equalizing when a 25-meter shot hit the inside of the post and
bounced across in front of the Arsenal goal.
	   Sustained attack from both sides led to Arsenal's second goal in
the 44th minute, giving the homeside a 2-0 halftime advantage.
	   Nicolas Anelka received a long-range pass from Marc Overmars and
although Schmeichel stopped his first attempt off the right foot,
the young Frenchman swooped onto a rebound and made no mistake with
his second shot off his left foot.
	   Beckham had another penalty attempt on halftime but failed to
reproduced the accuracy which netted him a brilliant goal in the
Champions League clash against Barcelona.
	   Llungberg replaced Anelka in the 79th minute and scored within
five minutes when he lobbed over Schmeichel into the vacant net.
	   The Swedish striker transfered from Halmstad to Highbury in a 3
million pound (dlrs 4.95 million) deal last week.
	   In the only Division One match on Sunday, West Bromwich Albion
slumped to its third defeat in four matches, losing 2-0 to
Bradford.
	   Lee Mills, a 1 million-pound (dlrs 1.68 million) transfer from
Port Vale last month, scored both goals to give Bradford its first
away win of the season.
	   In Scottish Premier Division matches Sunday, Rangers maintained
its place at the top of the table with a 0-0 tie against defending
champion Celtic at Ibrox and Hearts escaped with a 1-1 tie with
Dunfermline.
	   Celtic finished strongly, firing shot after shot at the Rangers
goal but Lionel Charbonnier made spectacular saves to ensure
Rangers four year unbeaten in ``old firm'' matches against Celtic
at Ibrox.
	   Celtic moved into second place in the standings, equal with
Kilmarnock and Motherwell on nine points
	   In Premier League matches Saturday, Newcastle finally delivered
the ``sexy football'' promised by new coach Ruud Guillit, with Alan
Shearer scoring twice as the Tynesiders thrashed Coventry 5-1.
	   The England captain has scored five goals in his last three
league games to silence the critics claiming he is past his best as
a top-flight striker.
	   Derby scored a 2-0 win over Leicester to move into second place
in the league standings with 12 points, two behind league-leaders
Aston Villa.
	   Villa had to settle for a 0-0 tie against Leeds United as
neither team showed the kind of firepower they'll need to make them
convincing challengers for the title.
	   At Anfield, Liverpool had a disappointing 3-3 tie with newly
promoted Charlton despite the two-goal return of Robbie Fowler.
	   The former England international scored twice, giving Liverpool
a 3-2 advantage with his second, but Charlton hit back in the dying
minutes to score the equalizer. Liverpool fell from second place in
the league to share third place with Wimbledon on 11 points.
	   Wimbledon scored a 2-1 home victory over Sheffield Wednesday,
the 'Dons best start in six seasons.
	   At the bottom of the standings there was good news for
Southampton, which picked up it first point of the season with a
1-1 draw against Tottenham.
	   In other Premier League games Saturday, Middlesbrough and
Everton had a 2-2 tie, while Nottingham Forest and West Ham had a
scoreless tie.
	   In Scottish Premier Division Saturday, Kilmarnock and Motherwell
drew 0-0 to stay tied for second with nine points each. St.
Johnstone defeated Aberdeen 2-0. St, moving equal on eight points
with Celtic and Aberdeen.
	   On Monday, Chelsea travels to Blackburn in the remaining Premier
League match.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya expressed reservations Sunday about
holding the trial of two suspects in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing at
a former U.S. air base in the Netherlands.
	   The government said it was astonished at the choice of Camp
Zeist at the Soesterberg air base and wants to inspect it before
agreeing to holding the trial there, according to Libya's official
JANA news agency.
	   The Dutch and British governments on Friday signed an agreement
to use Camp Zeist, 20 miles (32 kilometers) southeast of Amsterdam,
for the proposed trial of the two Libyans. Soesterberg was a U.S.
Air Force base from 1954 to 1993.
	   Libya was ``astonished that the two countries could not find
anywhere else to hold the trial in the Netherlands except in a camp
near an air base,'' JANA quoted a Libyan Foreign Ministry official
as saying.
	   He said the site would impede a fair trial because it would deny
the defense team a ``calm and serene atmosphere'' to work in.
	   He also complained that Libya had not been formally informed of
the venue of the trial.
	   ``Libya retains the right to express its reservations,'' said
the official.
	   Libya has accepted a U.S.-British compromise to try the suspects
in the Netherlands by Scottish judges under Scottish law, but
demands assurances for the safety and handling of the two men.
	   Britain and the United States have rejected the Libyan demands.

Scotland, killed 270 people.

the worst-ever showing for the party that has governed Sweden for

	   The main conservative opposition, the Moderates of former Prime

results, while the Christian Democrats more than doubled their
current support to 11.9 percent.
	   The Center Party _ which follows an idiosyncratic program of
conservative economics and staunch environmentalism had 6.3
percent. The Greens and the Liberals were hovering near the
4-percent threshhold for getting seats in the 349-seat Riksdag. The

to a strong economy after suffering in the early part of the decade
while the country tried to dig itself out from under a crushing
debt.
	   Many statistics supported the Social Democrats' argument:
unemployment, although uncomfortably high at 7.3 percent, has
consistently fallen over the past two years; inflation is
negligible and the country expects to run a small budget suprlus
this year.
	   Persson opposes a coalition with the Left because they resist
his party's economic pragmatism and favor Sweden's withdrawal from
the European Union.

British representatives of Lockerbie families say trial will
</HEADLINE>
happen &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The two Libyans accused of the Lockerbie bombing
could be handed over for trial in the Netherlands ``within weeks,''
said a representative of British families who lost relatives in the
1988 bombing.
	   ``I am totally confident that this trial is going to take
place,'' Jim Swire, spokesman for U.K. Families Flight 103, told
the Press Association, a British news agency, after meeting with
Libyan foreign and justice ministers in the Libyan capital on
Sunday.
	   Swire and Robert Black, a law professor at Edinburgh University
in Scotland, are in Tripoli to urge the Libyan government to fully
accept the proposal from the United States and Britain to try the
suspects in the Netherlands by Scottish judges under Scottish law.
	   Libya has accepted the proposal but continues to argue about
specifics.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi wants details of the proceedings
and the treatment the suspects would receive once they are in Dutch
custody, as well as assurances that the suspects will have the
right of appeal. Libya also expressed concerns on Sunday about the
choice of a former U.S. air base in the Netherlands as the location
for the trial, according to Libya's official JANA news agency.
	   Britain and the United States have rejected the Libyan demands
for guarantees before the suspects are turned over.
	   Swire, whose daughter Flora was on Pan Am flight 103 that
exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, said Libyan officials also
expressed concerns about how the Libyan defense team would gather
evidence and at what point UN sanctions would be lifted.
	   Swire told the Press Association that he gave the Libyans a
letter from Scotland's Lord Advocate, Lord Hardie, to try to
assuage some of their concerns.
	   It contained an assurance that once the two suspects were handed
over for trial, they would not be transferred to Scotland until all
judicial processes had been exhausted _ the initial procedural
hearing, the trial itself, and, if they were found guilty, any
subsequent appeal.
	   Swire and Black hope to have a meeting with Gadhafi before
flying back to Britain later this week.
	   The 1988 bombing of the Pan Am passenger plane over Lockerbie,
Scotland, killed 270 people.

President Pastrana: Political battle with U.S. hurting chances for
</HEADLINE>
peace &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANK BAJAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Threats by Republicans in the U.S.
Congress to cut anti-narcotics aid to Colombia are hurting chances
for establishing peace talks with leftist rebels, President Andres
Pastrana said Sunday.
	   The political battle in Washington over the drug war ``is the
worst thing that could have happened in the past four years,''
Pastrana told a news conference before departing on a trip to New
York and Washington.
	   An amendment to a bill passed by the U.S. House of
Representatives last week stipulated that anti-drug aid, currently
some dlrs 100 million annually, would be suspended if Colombia's
government halts aerial drug eradication in a sparsely populated
southern area.
	   Pastrana has agreed to demilitarize the zone by Nov. 7 in order
to facilitate peace talks with the country's largest guerrilla
group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
	   The U.S. Senate has not yet considered the amendment, but the
vote Wednesday caused considerable dismay in the nearly
two-month-old Pastrana administration, which has made peace a
priority.
	   Pastrana wants to secure international funding to introduce crop
substitution programs that could wean Colombian peasants off the
cultivation of coca, the raw material of cocaine, and opium poppy,
the basis for heroin.
	   ``The (U.S.) Democratic Party backs the policy of alternative
crops, because you can't just talk of repression, fumigation and
eradication,'' Pastrana said, while the Republicans ``maintain the
simple theory of a head-on war against drug trafficking.''
	   To explain his intentions, Pastrana is scheduled to meet in
Washington on Thursday with leading Republicans expected to Gilman.
	   Pastrana has agreed to demilitarize a 42,000-square-kilometer
(160-square-mile) swath of southern Colombia in order to facilitate
peace talks with the FARC, which has been fighting the state for
nearly four decades.
	   About 14 percent of the 79,500 hectares (310 square miles) of
Colombia's coca crop are located in the zone, according to the
national police.
	   Defense Minister Rodrigo Lloreda, who is accompanying Pastrana
on his U.S. trip, said last week that Colombia's government has no
intention of suspending aerial spraying of Colombia's drug crops
with herbicides.
	   Other Colombian officials note that current aerial eradication
efforts, which are all paid for by the U.S. State Department, are
already concentrated outside the demilitarized zone.
	   ``We've got plenty of other places where we can spray,'' the
national police director, Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano, told The
Associated Press in a recent interview.

Socialists head for narrow win over right in Sweden
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with results from about 70 percent of the districts &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The Social Democrats and the Left Party
on Sunday blocked non-socialist parties from winning a majority of
parliament seats in national elections, according to early results.
	   With votes counted from nearly 70 percent of the districts, the
governing Social Democrats, who built Sweden's high-tax welfare
state, had 38.4 percent of the vote _ one of the worst-ever
showings for the party that has governed Sweden for most of the
past seven decades.
	   But many of the votes they lost apparently went to the
ex-Communist Left Party, which surged to 12.4 percent.
	   Although Prime Minister Goeran Persson has said he would not
form a government with the Left, he can count on its support on
most measures because the Left has no other likely allies.
	   The main conservative opposition, the Moderates of former Prime
Minister Carl Bildt, slipped to just 19.9 percent, according to the
results, while the Christian Democrats more than doubled their
current support to 11.9 percent.
	   The Center Party _ which follows an idiosyncratic program of
conservative economics and staunch environmentalism had 6.3
percent. The Greens and the Liberals were hovering near the
4-percent threshold for getting seats in the 349-seat Riksdag. The
Liberals, currently in parliament, were below the cutoff point.
	   The campaign centered on economic issues, with the
non-socialists arguing that Sweden's taxes _ currently the world's
highest _ doom the country to irrelevancy in a rapidly globalizing
economy.
	   The Social Democrats said that Sweden was inching its way back
to a strong economy after suffering in the early part of the decade
while the country tried to dig itself out from under a crushing
debt.
	   Many statistics supported the Social Democrats' argument that
unemployment, although uncomfortably high at 7.3 percent, has
consistently fallen over the past two years; inflation is
negligible and the country expects to run a small budget suprlus
this year.

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS in 2nd graf that Obaidi is Iraqi trade ministry
official.

<TEXT>
	   DAMSACUS, Syria (AP) _ Iraq reopened its trade center in Syria
Sunday, 18 years after closing it.
	   The center, which was opened in a brief ceremony at the Damascus
International Fairgrounds by Iraqi Trade Ministry official Farouk
al-Obaidi, comes nearly two weeks after Damascus opened its own
trade office in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, on Sept. 3.
	   The two Arab neighbors have traded dlrs 150 million worth of
goods since they resumed cross-border trade last year. But they
have not restored diplomatic ties which were severed after Damascus
sided with Tehran during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
	   Iraqi leather and household items were among the goods exhibited
at the Iraqi center in Damascus.

Spain beats Switzerland 3-2 in Fed Cup final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS quotes, CHANGES throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA, Switzerland (AP) _ Veterans Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario and
Conchita Martinez won their doubles match in straight sets Sunday
to lift Spain to a 3-2 victory over Switzerland and collect the
nation's fifth Fed Cup crown.
	   The Fed Cup hardened duo, who led Spain to its five titles,
disposed of Swiss teenagers world No. 1 Martina Hingis and Patty
Schnyder 6-0, 6-2, in the tie-breaking doubles match in under an
hour.
	   Sanchez-Vicario and Martinez, who led Spain to the finals seven
times in the last eight years, also figured in all of Spain's
previous titles in 1991, 1993, 1994 and 1995.
	   ``This was probably one of the best victories,'' said French
Open champion Sanchez-Vicario. ``We played one of the best teams
and worked so hard to win.
	   ``We had everything against us, the home crowd, the court, the
World No. 1,'' she said. ``It makes the trophy worth that much
more.''
	   Spain steamrolled over Hingis and an exhausted Schnyder
clinching the first set in just 24 minutes.
	   The second didn't take much longer, though the Swiss tandem
seemed to gather strength from their desperate position.
	   The Swiss held serve until the fifth game when the Spanish duo
converted a second break point to leap ahead 4-2. Leading 5-2 Spain
failed to convert on their first match point, but made the most of
their second, breaking the Swiss for the title.
	   ``It's very disappointing, especially in front of your home
crowd,'' said Hingis, winner of all four Grand Slam doubles titles
this year. ``But Spain is a very tough, experienced team. They've
been playing forever.
	   ``Patty just finished playing over three hours against Conchita,
and I wasn't in much better shape after my morning match against
Arantxa.''
	   For Schnyder, who lost all her matches, the defeat was crushing.
	   ``I gave all I had,'' said Schnyder, close to tears. ``I tried
everything. Martina won her matches but in the doubles we weren't
able to win.''
	   Paired up, Sanchez-Vicario and Martinez have won 17 of their
last 20 Fed Cup doubles matches, including the last eight.
	   Spain won the last tie-breaking doubles match in a Fed Cup also,
defeating the United States in 1991 to collect the country's first
title.
	   The victory made up slightly for the drubbing Hingis handed
fourth-ranked Sanchez-Vicario in the day's opening match, when the
Swiss teenager prolonged her enduring domination over Spanish
player, winning 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 to give Switzerland a 2-1 lead.
	   Martinez averted her team's defeat, posting a three set win over
Schnyder, evening the score to 2-2 in the best-of-five final.
	   Over 12,000 frantic spectators packing the Palexpo watched
anxiously throughout the 3 hour, 18 minute marathon as Martinez and
Schnyder duelled relentlessly, with the Spaniard finally prevailing
6-3, 2-6, 9-7.
	   Martinez took the first set in convincing fashion, before losing
her opening serve in the second. Schnyder broke again to jump ahead
4-1, then held to even the sets.
	   Martinez jumped to a 3-0 lead in the third, but Schnyder broke
back, then saved three break points to hold serve and even the
score.
	   The two traded breaks to remain on serve at 4-4, then remained
on serve to 7-7.
	   Martinez held to lead 8-7, then overcame Schnyder's serve with a
break point to spare.
	   The draw set the stage for the doubles tie-breaker, the 10th in
the history of the Fed Cup.
	   Hingis extended her winning streak over Sanchez-Vicario to
seven. The Spaniard's last victory over the Swiss teenager dating
back two and a half years ago when Hingis was only 15.
	   Hingis opened play scoring seven consecutive points. While the
Spaniard held her first serve, Hingis took the next nine points to
break her second.
	   Sanchez-Vicario managed to break back, but her gutsy effort in
the tie-break proved insufficient.
	   The Spaniard was then broken twice in the second.
	   With Hingis suffering from leg cramps, Sanchez-Vicario broke
back once, only to have Hingis break back immediately.

Shy costar in new 'Antony and Cleopatra' returns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ One of Helen Mirren's pivotal co-stars in the
Royal National Theater's new staging of Shakespeare's ``Antony and
Cleopatra'' will get his chance in the spotlight after all.
	   Cedric the snake slithered off two weeks ago, rather than
participate in the climactic scene in which Mirren commits suicide
by pressing a snake to her bosom to administer a fatal bite.
	   But the Californian King snake _ said to be quite convincing as
an Egyptian asp _ made a surprise reappearance on Saturday when it
was caught sliding across the floor of the theater's costume room.
	   Now Cedric is back in his box in the theater's offices, ready
for the play's opening, a theater spokesman said Sunday.
	   ``Anthony and Cleopatra,'' which also stars Alan Rickman, opens
on Oct. 20.

Olympiakos beats OFI, shares lead

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ With three first-half goals, Olympiakos
Piraeus beat OFI Crete 3-0 at home Sunday to share the lead in the
Greek first division soccer league.
	   After four rounds, the defending champions share the prime
position with AEK Athens with 10 points each.
	   AEK beat Verria in Athens 2-0 on goals from Christos Maladenis
in the 37th and Demis Nikolaidis in the 48th minutes.
	   Four days after its 2-1 victory over Dynamo Kiev for the
Champions League, Panathinaikos Athens suffered a 2-0 defeat at the
hands of PAOK in Salonica to drop to third place with nine points.
	   The victory over OFI was an easy affair for Olympiakos.
	   The defending champions controlled the match, and with constant
attacks particularly in the first half, they managed to score three
goals in seven minutes.
	   Alecos Alexandris opened the scoring in the 17th off a center
from Grigoris Georgatos.
	   Two minutes later, Vassilis Karapialis beat OFI Albanian keeper
Arian Beqai with a well-aimed lob from the edge of the area for the
2-0.
	   Serbian striker Sinisa Gogic exploited a mistake between
defender Pavlos Adamou and Beqaj, to mark his team's third goal.
	   Gogic netted Olympiakos' equalizer against Portugal's Porto in
the 2-2 game for the Champions League Wednesday,
	   The second half saw OFI more aggressive but its players never
threatened goalie Dimitris Eleftheropoulos.
	   Panathinaikos appeared tired and were unable to organize attacks
against PAOK' goalmouth.
	   The hosts' tight pressing at midfield was instrumental in the
final result.
	   PAOK lost a good scoring opportunity in the 10th when a shot by
Costas Frantzeskos went just wide from Polish goalie Jozef
Wandzik's right bar.
	   PAOK opened the scoring in the 10th with a shot from inside the
are by Tassos Katsambis.
	   Wandzik made a spectacular save to a blistering shot by
Frantzeskos in the 50th. But Wandzik couldn't avert PAOK's second
goal which came in the 80th after a free kick by Frantzeskos from
outside the area.
	   Panathinaikos tried hard in the last 10 minutes to score, but
its players were out of focus.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The Social Democrats, who have governed
Sweden for most of the past seven decades and built its high-tax
welfare state, got their lowest support ever in national elections
but were likely to retain power.
	   With votes counted from 93 percent of the districts, the Social
Democrats had just 36.9 percent of the vote, a steep plunge for the
45 percent they got four years ago and far short of the majority
needed to govern without support from other parties.
	   That support is likely to come from the ex-Communist Left Party,
which nearly doubled its representation with 12 percent of the vote
_ a surge that apparently came at the expense of the Social
Democrats.
	   Because a party has to get 4 percent of the national vote in
order to get into the 349-seat Riksdag parliament, the 2.7 percent
of ballots that went to fringe parties or left blank could mean
that the Social Democrats and the Left could total a hairsbreadth
majority.
	   The Greens, with 4.4 percent of the vote, could also be expected
to support the Social Democrats, but the prospect worries governing
party leaders.
	   ``This is not a good situation. It will be difficult to find a
solid base for the government,'' Social Democrats general secretary
Ingela Thalen said.
	   The main conservative opposition, the Moderates of former Prime
Minister Carl Bildt, got 22.3 percent while the Christian Democrats
more than doubled their current support to 11.7 percent.
	   The Center Party _ which follows an idiosyncratic program of
conservative economics and staunch environmentalism and is
unwilling to enter a coalition government headed by Bildt _ had 5.2
percent. The Liberals were at 4.6 percent.
	   The campaign centered on economic issues, with the
non-socialists arguing that Sweden's taxes _ currently the world's
highest _ doom the country to irrelevancy in a rapidly globalizing
economy.
	   The Social Democrats said that Sweden was inching its way back
to a strong economy after suffering in the early part of the decade
while the country tried to dig itself out from under a crushing
debt.
	   Many statistics supported the Social Democrats' argument:
unemployment, although uncomfortably high at 7.3 percent, has
consistently fallen over the past two years; inflation is
negligible and the country expects to run a small budget suprlus
this year.
	   Persson opposes a coalition with the Left because they resist
his party's economic pragmatism and favor Sweden's withdrawal from
the European Union.

	   GENEVA, Switzerland (AP) _ Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario and Conchita
Martinez won their doubles match in straight sets Sunday to lift
Spain to a 3-2 victory over Switzerland and collect Spain's fifth
Fed Cup crown.
	   Sanchez-Vicario and Martinez defeated world No. 1 Martina Hingis
and Patty Schnyder 6-0, 6-2, in a tie-breaking doubles match that
took under an hour.
	   The two veterans figured in all four of Spain's previous titles
in 1991, 1993, 1994 and 1995. The pair have led Spain to the finals
seven times in the last eight years.
	   ``This was probably one of the best wins of all,'' said
Sanchez-Vicario, still breathing hard from the effort. ``We played
one of the best teams and worked so hard to get the victory.
	   ``Viva Espagna! I'm so happy!''
	   The two steamrolled over Hingis and an exhausted Schnyder in the
first set in just 24 minutes.
	   The second didn't take much longer.
	   The Swiss held serve until the fifth game when they failed to
save two break points, allowing the Spanish duo to leap ahead 4-2.
Leading 5-2, Spain failed to convert on their first match point,
but made the most of their second, breaking the Swiss for the
title.
	   ``It's very disappointing, especially in front of your home
crowd,'' said Hingis, winner of all four Grand Slam doubles titles
this year. ``But Spain is a very tough, experienced team. They've
been playing forever.
	   ``Patty just finished playing over three hours against Conchita,
and I wasn't in much better shape after my morning match against
Arantxa.''
	   Schnyder, close to tears, said, ``I gave all I had. I tried
everything.''

Olympiakos beats OFI, shares lead

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ With three first-half goals, Olympiakos
Piraeus beat OFI Crete 3-0 at home Sunday to share the lead in the
Greek first division soccer league.
	   After four rounds, the defending champions share first spot with
AEK Athens with 10 points each.
	   AEK beat Verria in Athens 2-0 on goals from Christos Maladenis
in the 37th and Demis Nikolaidis in the 48th minutes.
	   Four days after its 2-1 victory over Dynamo Kiev for the
Champions League, Panathinaikos Athens suffered a 2-0 defeat at the
hands of PAOK in Salonica to drop to third place with nine points.
	   The victory over OFI was an easy affair for Olympiakos.
	   The defending champions controlled the match, and with constant
attacks, particularly in the first half, they managed to score
three goals in seven minutes.
	   Alecos Alexandris opened the scoring in the 17th minute off a
center from Grigoris Georgatos.
	   Two minutes later, Vassilis Karapialis beat OFI's Albanian
keeper, Arian Beqai, with a well-aimed lob from the edge of the
area to make it 2-0.
	   Serbian striker Sinisa Gogic exploited a mistake between
defender Pavlos Adamou and Beqaj, to mark his team's third goal.
	   The second half saw OFI play more aggressively but its players
never threatened goalie Dimitris Eleftheropoulos.

	   Wandzik made a spectacular save to a blistering shot by

goal which came in the 80th after a free kick by Frantzeskos from
outside the area.

Socialists head for narrow win over right in Sweden

 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes, background, Persson saying he intends to stay on

 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The Social Democrats, who have governed
Sweden for most of the past seven decades and built its high-tax
welfare state, got their lowest support ever in national elections
but were likely to retain power.
	   With votes counted from 93 percent of the districts, the Social
Democrats had just 36.9 percent of the vote, a steep plunge for the
45 percent they got four years ago and far short of the majority
needed to govern without support from other parties.
	   That support is likely to come from the ex-Communist Left Party,
which nearly doubled its representation with 12 percent of the vote
_ a surge that apparently came at the expense of the Social
Democrats.
	   Because a party has to get 4 percent of the national vote in
order to get into the 349-seat Riksdag parliament, the 2.7 percent
of ballots that went to fringe parties or left blank meant the
Social Democrats and the Left totaled a hairsbreadth majority with
175 seats.
	   The Greens, with 4.4 percent of the vote, could also be expected
to support the Social Democrats, but the prospect worries governing
party leaders.
	   ``This is not a good situation. It will be difficult to find a
solid base for the government,'' Social Democrats general secretary
Ingela Thalen said.
	   Nevertheless, Prime Minister Goeran Persson said late Sunday
that he intends to remain in government. That means the only way to
unseat the Social Democrats would be to call a vote of confidence
in the government, with the Lefts or the Greens joining the
non-socialist parties or abstaining from the vote.
	   ``We rule on!'' the usually phlegmatic Persson said jubilantly
at the Social Democrats' election-night festivities in Stockholm.
``We have taken the country out of crisis. We have fought.''
	   Persson opposes a formal coalition with the Left and the Greens
because they resist his party's economic pragmatism and favor
Sweden's withdrawal from the European Union.
	   The main conservative opposition, the Moderates of former Prime
Minister Carl Bildt, got 22.3 percent while the Christian Democrats
more than doubled their current support to 11.7 percent.
	   The Center Party _ which follows an idiosyncratic program of
conservative economics and staunch environmentalism and is
unwilling to enter a coalition government headed by Bildt _ had 5.2
percent. The Liberals were at 4.6 percent.
	   The campaign centered on economic issues, with the
non-socialists arguing that Sweden's taxes _ currently the world's
highest _ doom the country to irrelevancy in a rapidly globalizing
economy.
	   The Social Democrats said that Sweden was inching its way back
to a strong economy after suffering in the early part of the decade
while the country tried to dig itself out from under a crushing
debt.
	   Many statistics supported the Social Democrats' argument:
unemployment, although uncomfortably high at 7.3 percent, has
consistently fallen over the past two years; inflation is
negligible and the country expects to run a small budget surplus
this year.
	   Turnout was surprisingly low by the standards of Sweden's
usually diligent voters _ just 79 percent of the electorate of 6.7
million. Analysts said voters were discouraged by the country's
struggles of the past decade.
	   ``Now we have the opportunity to win their confidence back,''
Persson said.

Bordeaux grabs late equalizer at Marseille
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Kaba Diawara grabbed a late equalizer Sunday as
Bordeaux snatched a 2-2 at Marseille.
	   Diawara opened the scoring in the 42nd minute for Bordeaux, but
Fabrizio Ravanelli equalized just before half time.
	   In the second half Eric Roy put the home team ahead but Diawara
struck in the last minute to make it 2-2.
	   Bordeaux had won all five matches before Sunday and stays top of
the standings.
	   Marseille moves into third place after the draw.
	   Paris Saint-Germain beat Monaco 1-0 in Sunday's other match.

Top strikers lead Juve, Milan, Fiorentina into tie for first

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ On a day when scoring was scarce in Serie A, even
from the penalty spot, Ronaldo tallied his first goal since the
disastrous World Cup final.
	   The Brazilian striker, who sat out last week's opener because of
suspension, connected on a penalty kick in the second half Sunday
night to lead Internazionale of Milan past Piacenza 1-0 for its
first victory of the Italian League season.
	   Closely marked throughout the game by Pietro Vierchowod, at 39
the Italian League's oldest player, Ronaldo still showed signs of
rust from the month-long vacation Inter owner Massimo Moratti
granted the star after the World Cup. But the two-time FIFA player
of the year was perfect from 11 meters (yards) when he had to be,
after teammate Andrea Pirlo was dragged down in the penalty area by
Piacenza defender Stefano Sacchetti in the 66th minute.
	   Earlier, three other top strikers hit the target to keep their
clubs tied for first place.
	   Filippo Inzaghi scored after eight minutes to lift two-time
defending champion Juventus of Turin past Cagliari 1-0, AC Milan's
German forward Oliver Bierhoff netted a second-half header as AC
Milan edged Salernitana 2-1, and Argentine star Gabriel Batistuta
had a goal and an assist for Fiorentina in its 2-1 win at Vicenza.
	   Juventus, Fiorentina and Milan _ the former powerhouse coming
off back-to-back poor seasons _ are the only teams that have opened
with two wins.
	   AS Roma had a chance to join that trio, but settled for a 0-0
draw at Empoli when Luigi Di Biagio _ whose missed penalty against
France sent Italy out of the World Cup at the quarterfinal stage _
failed to connect from the spot with five minutes left.
	   Sampdoria of Genoa also had to be content with a draw, because
Vicenzo Montella sent a penalty kick wide of the net in the 72nd
minute with the score 1-1 against Perugia.
	   Elsewhere, AC Parma, a club many thought would challenge for the
title, continued to struggle on offense and drew 0-0 at promoted
Venezia. Parma has gone three games, including a UEFA Cup match
last week, without scoring. And Lazio of Rome's highly-touted
striker duo of Christian Vieri and Chile's Marcelo Salas was shut
out for the second straight week in a scoreless draw against Bari.
	   Brazil's Marcio Amoroso registered the lone two-goal game, tying
Bierhoff for the league lead with three goals, in Udinese's 3-1
victory at 10-man Bologna. Udinese, Roma, Inter and, surprisingly,
Bari are tied for fourth with 1-1-0 records.
	   At Milan, 60,000 spectators saw Inter 'keeper Gianluca Pagliuca
keep the hosts in the game with several brilliant saves until the
club's high-priced attack finally came through. Ronaldo and veteran
Roberto Baggio were never fully in sync, and the goal did not
arrive until six minutes after Pirlo substituted Baggio.
	   ``Everyone wants to win and we showed (tonight) that we really
are a squad. One player goes out, someone else comes in and nothing
changes,'' Ronaldo said. ``Juventus is still strong, but we're only
at the (season's) start. We'll see how it all ends.''
 &UR; Juventus 1, Cagliari 0 &QC; 
	   At Turin, Inzaghi _ the league's leading scorer two years ago
with Atalanta of Bergamo _ slipped through a napping defense to
collect midfielder Alessio Tacchinardi's pass and slide the ball
past charging Cagliari 'keeper Alessio Scarpi. The Juventus
defense, which gave up three goals to promoted Perugia last week,
was solid as the club rebounded from a lackluster 2-2 draw against
Turkey's Galatasaray in Champion League play. Cagliari is 0-1-1.
 &UR; Milan 2, Salernitana 1 &QC; 
	   At Salerno, Bierhoff sent a firm header into the upper corner of
the net in the 67th minute set up Brazilian Leonardo's goal in the
86th. Roberto Breda curled in a 20-meter (yard) free kick with two
minutes left for Salernitana (0-0-2).
 &UR; Fiorentina 2, Vicenza 1 &QC; 
	   At Vicenza, Batistuta headed home a corner kick one minute into
the match and then, after Vicenza (0-1-1) had tied the score on an
own-goal in the 68th minute, fed Belgian striker Luis Oliveira for
a close-range goal in the 71st.
 &UR; Empoli 0, Roma 0 &QC; 
	   At Empoli, 'keeper Matteo Sereni dove to his left to block Di
Biagio's penalty kick, awarded when forward Carmine Gautieri was
fouled. Empoli is 0-1-1.
 &UR; Sampdoria 1, Perugia 1 &QC; 
	   At Genoa, French midfielder Pierre Laigle finished a nice
exchange with Argentine playmaker Ariel Ortega by scoring in the
21st minute to give Sampdoria (0-2-0) the lead. After Perugia
(0-1-1) equalized in the 49th on Renato Olive's first career Serie
A goal, Ortega earned the penalty kick that Montella struck
poorly.
 &UR; Venezia 0, Parma 0 &QC; 
	   At Venice, Parma (0-2-0) protested in the dying seconds when
Croat midfielder Mario Stanic was brought down in the penalty area
_ but no foul was called. Venezia is 0-1-1.
 &UR; Lazio 0, Bari 0 &QC; 
	   At Rome, Lazio (0-2-0) never managed to take control of the
action and produced its third straight disappointing performance.
 &UR; Udinese 3, Bologna 1 &QC; 
	   At Bologna, Amoroso scored off a header in the 14th minute and
from the penalty spot in the 44th to pace Udinese (1-1-0). Bologna
(0-0-2), which had defender Amedeo Mangone sent off on the stroke
of halftime, cut its deficit on Russian striker Igor Kolyvanov's
penalty kick in the 63rd. But with a chance to pull even, another
Russian, Igor Simutenkov, missed a penalty in the 83rd. Udinese
wrapped up the win two minutes later on a goal by Belgian
midfielder Johan Walem.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Susan Barrantes, mother of the Duchess of York,
has been killed in a car crash in Argentina, dealing the former
Sarah Ferguson another cruel blow just a year after her onetime
sister-in-law Princess Diana died in a Paris crash.
	   The duchess, or ``Fergie,'' ex-wife of Queen Elizabeth II's
second son, Prince Andrew, heard the news early Sunday while on
vacation in Italy.
	   She flew into London's Gatwick Airport late Sunday afternoon and
spent two hours at Sunninghill Park, the mansion she shares with
her former husband, before returning to Gatwick Sunday night to
continue on to Argentina. The duchess's mother settled in Argentina
in 1975 with her second husband, Argentine professional polo player
the late Hector Barrantes.
	   ``She is devastated,'' spokeswoman Kate Waddington said of the
duchess.
	   Mrs. Barrantes, 61, was killed instantly Saturday night when the
Rover she was driving was in collision with a van on a rural road
near Tres Lomas, about 310 miles (550 kms) southwest of the
capital, Buenos Aires, police said.
	   Mrs. Barrantes was decapitated in the crash, Tres Lomas Police
Commissioner Hector Dimas Moleneuvo told The Associated Press in
Buenos Aires.
	   The collision on the Argentine pampas was near the ranch, El
Pucara, where she raised polo ponies. She also had a TV station in
Buenos Aires.
	   The Rover was left a heap of twisted metal, shattered glass and
plastic. However, Mrs. Barrantes's passenger, nephew by marriage
Rafael Barrantes, 25, escaped with minor injuries.
	   The driver of the other car, Jose Maria Rodriguez, suffered a
broken ankle, police said.
	   Mrs. Barrantes abruptly left Maj. Ronald Ferguson, the queen's
former polo manager, and their two daughters, then teen-agers, for
Barrantes _ becoming in the parlance of the English upper-classes
``a bolter.''
	   However, the duchess, now 38, remained close to her mother and
stepfather. She visited Hector Barrantes at the ranch shortly
before his death from cancer in 1990.
	   Mrs. Barrantes would also visit Britain several times a year and
she and Fergie spoke on the phone regularly. They were last
together at a charity golf tournament near London July 20.
	   Although Mrs. Barrantes made clear she had no plans to return to
England.
	   ``I'm here making my own life, and it has simply nothing to do
with where I come from,'' she said recently.
	   The duchess's sister, Jane Luedecke, who lives in Australia, was
flying separately to Buenos Aires.
	   Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced. But Ms.
Waddington said Mrs. Barrantes would be buried alongside her second
husband near Buenos Aires.
	   The queen, on a tour of Malaysia, was ``shocked and very
saddened,'' her press secretary, Geoff Crawford, said.
	   The duchess was in Italy with her younger daughter, Princess
Eugenie, 8, when the news broke. Aides said Eugenie will remain at
Sunninghill, the mansion west of London where Andrew and Fergie
have separate quarters. Their elder child, Princess Beatrice, 10,
who was with Andrew, will be there too.
	   The blow came as life seemed to be picking up for the
high-spending, controversial Fergie, oft-accused of trading on her
royal connections to help repay huge debts.
	   This summer, the duchess spent time in Italy with her latest
boyfriend, Count Gaddo della Gherardesca, and the queen recently
bought her a 1.5 million pound (dlrs 2.4 million) mansion near
Sunninghill.
	   The duchess was also planning to travel to the United States
this week as part of a four-city tour with Weight Watchers
International, but the tour was canceled Sunday after her mother's
death.

Arafat will seek support for state, regardless of peace talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Yasser Arafat will use the upcoming U.N.
General Assembly to seek support for a declaraton of Palestinian
statehood, regardless of whether there is progress in talks with
Israel on a West Bank withdrawal by then, an aide said Sunday.
	   However, Arafat may drop demands to convene an Arab summit _
which would likely ostracize Israel further in the Arab world _ if
there is a breakthrough in the negotiations by the time he delivers
his speech Sept. 28, said his adviser, Nabil Abourdeneh.
	   Coinciding with the start of the U.N. General Assembly in New
York this week, the United States will try again to wrap up an
elusive agreement on an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is likely to hold
separate talks with Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
	   Abourdeneh said Israeli-Palestinians contacts might also be
possible in New York, but would not elaborate.
	   Netanyahu is flying to New York after the Jewish New Year's
which ends Tuesday, and Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath,
a member of the negotiating team, is already in the city.
	   Abourdeneh said no preparations had been made for an
Arafat-Netanyahu meeting and that a summit would only be possible
once there was a breakthrough.
	   Talks have remained deadlocked for months, and an 11-day mission
by U.S. envoy Dennis Ross ended Saturday without progress.
	   Abourdeneh said Sunday that Ross failed to bring the two sides
closer on any of the disputed points.
	   On the table is a U.S. plan calling for an Israeli troop
pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank and a blueprint for a
Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   During his mission, Ross went over the different positions and
proposed compromises that were all rejected, either by Israel or
the Palestinians, Abourdeneh said.
	   Netanyahu's aides could not immediately be reached for comment
Sunday evening because of the New Year's holiday.
	   In his speech to the United Nations, Arafat will characterize
the talks with Israel, Abourdeneh said.
	   ``If there is a continued deadlock, President Arafat will ask
the world to support a Palestinain state and the Arab world to hold
an Arab summit to study the situation,'' Abourdeneh said.
	   ``But all this depends on the developments,'' Abourdeneh said.
	   Arafat has said repeatedly that he would unilaterally declare a
state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on May 4, 1999, the date the
interim five-year period of Palestinian automony ends.
	   Israel is trying to prevent such a move and has threatened to
take countermeasures, possibly the annexation of some of the
disputed land or an extended closure of the Palestinian areas.
	   Senior Palestinian officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Sunday that Arafat was determined to go ahead with
the declaration, regardless of possible negative consequences.

Socialists head for narrow win over right in Sweden

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The Social Democrats, who have governed
Sweden for most of the past seven decades and built its high-tax
welfare state, got their lowest support ever in national elections
but were likely to retain power.
	   With votes counted from 93 percent of the districts, the Social
Democrats had just 36.9 percent of the vote, a steep plunge for the
45 percent they got four years ago and far short of the majority
needed to govern without support from other parties.
	   That support is likely to come from the ex-Communist Left Party,
which nearly doubled its representation with 12 percent of the vote
_ a surge that apparently came at the expense of the Social
Democrats.
	   Because a party has to get 4 percent of the national vote in
order to get into the 349-seat Riksdag parliament, the 2.7 percent
of ballots that went to fringe parties or left blank meant the
Social Democrats and the Left totaled a hairsbreadth majority with
175 seats.
	   The Greens, with 4.4 percent of the vote, could also be expected
to support the Social Democrats, but the prospect worries governing
party leaders.
	   ``This is not a good situation. It will be difficult to find a
solid base for the government,'' Social Democrats general secretary
Ingela Thalen said.
	   Nevertheless, Prime Minister Goeran Persson said late Sunday
that he intends to remain in government. That means the only way to
unseat the Social Democrats would be to call a vote of confidence
in the government, with the Lefts or the Greens joining the
non-socialist parties or abstaining from the vote.
	   ``We rule on!'' the usually phlegmatic Persson said jubilantly
at the Social Democrats' election-night festivities in Stockholm.
``We have taken the country out of crisis. We have fought.''
	   Persson opposes a formal coalition with the Left and the Greens
because they resist his party's economic pragmatism and favor
Sweden's withdrawal from the European Union.
	   The main conservative opposition, the Moderates of former Prime
Minister Carl Bildt, got 22.3 percent while the Christian Democrats
more than doubled their current support to 11.7 percent.
	   The Center Party _ which follows an idiosyncratic program of
conservative economics and staunch environmentalism and is
unwilling to enter a coalition government headed by Bildt _ had 5.2
percent. The Liberals were at 4.6 percent.
	   The campaign centered on economic issues, with the
non-socialists arguing that Sweden's taxes _ currently the world's
highest _ doom the country to irrelevancy in a rapidly globalizing
economy.
	   The Social Democrats said that Sweden was inching its way back
to a strong economy after suffering in the early part of the decade
while the country tried to dig itself out from under a crushing
debt.
	   Many statistics supported the Social Democrats' argument that
unemployment, although uncomfortably high at 7.3 percent, has
consistently fallen over the past two years; inflation is
negligible and the country expects to run a small budget surplus
this year.
	   Turnout was surprisingly low by the standards of Sweden's
usually diligent voters _ just 79 percent of the electorate of 6.7
million. Analysts said voters were discouraged by the country's
struggles of the past decade.
	   ``Now we have the opportunity to win their confidence back,''
Persson said.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ First it was Florida State, now it's Florida.
	   For the first time in nearly eight years, a team from the state
of Florida is not among the top five in The Associated Press' Top
25 college football poll.
	   Tennessee's 20-17 overtime victory over Florida Saturday night
sent the Gators from No. 2 to No. 8 in this week's poll. A week
ago, the Seminoles lost to North Carolina State and tumbled from
No. 2 to No. 11.
	   The last time the Sunshine State teams were out of the top five
was Oct. 27, 1990, when Miami was eighth, Florida State 12th and
Florida 15th. The Hurricanes last made the top five early in the
1994 season.
	   Ohio State, meanwhile, moved closer to a unanimous choice as No.
1. The Buckeyes, 35-14 winners over Missouri, received 64
first-place votes and 1,744 points from the 70 sportswriters and
broadcasters on the AP panel. Last week, Ohio State had 57
first-place votes.
	   Nebraska, which had the week off, moved up a notch to No. 2 with
one first-place vote and 1,601 points, while UCLA improved a spot
to No. 3 with a first-place vote and 1,562 points. The Bruins beat
Houston 42-24.
	   Tennessee, which ended a five-game losing streak against
Florida, moved up two places to No. 4 with two first-place votes
and 1,542 points. Kansas State, a 48-7 winner over Texas, remained
No. 5 with two first-place votes and 1,522 points.
	   LSU advanced a place to No. 6, followed by No. 7 Penn State, No.
8 Florida, No. 9 Washington and No. 10 Florida State.
	   The Seminoles moved back into the top 10 with a 62-13 victory
over Duke. The Nittany Lions, despite a narrow 20-13 win over
Pittsburgh, moved up one spot from a week ago. Washington, which
beat Brigham Young 20-10, plays at Nebraska next Saturday.
	   Virginia, a 20-18 winner over Clemson, fell one place to No. 11,
followed by No. 12 Syracuse, No. 13 Georgia, No. 14 Wisconsin, No.
15 Colorado, No. 16 Arizona, No. 17 Texas A and M, No. 18 Southern
California, No. 19 West Virginia and No. 20 Oregon.
	   Virginia Tech, a 27-20 overtime winner against Miami, jumped
into the Top 25 at No. 21, followed by No. 22 Alabama, with Air
Force and Notre Dame tied at No. 23 and Missouri at No. 25.
	   In the USA Today/ESPN Top 25, the top five were: Ohio State,
Nebraska, Kansas State, Tennessee and UCLA.
	   Air Force (3-0), which beat Colorado State 30-27 last Thursday,
and Virginia Tech (3-0) are the new teams in the Top 25. North
Carolina State, a 33-30 loser to Baylor, and Mississippi State,
beaten 42-23 by Oklahoma State, fell out of the rankings.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ John Olerud homered and doubled, giving him a
team record-tying nine straight hits, and Al Leiter pitched the New
York Mets past Florida 5-0 Sunday for a half-game lead in the NL
wild-card race.
	   The Mets moved ahead of the Chicago Cubs, who played later at
home against Cincinnati.
	   Leiter (17-5) won his fifth straight decision and set a career
high for victories. He allowed five hits and struck out nine in
eight innings.
	   Olerud went 2-for-2 and walked twice. He is hitting .354, one
point behind Colorado's Larry Walker, and is trying to become the
first player this century to win batting titles in both leagues.
	   Olerud, who hit a two-run homer in the third inning, matched the
Mets record with his ninth straight hit, a record set by Jose
Vizcaino in 1996.
	   With a walk in the seventh, Olerud reached base for the 14th
straight time. He has made only one out in his last 22 plate
appearances, excluding a sacrifice fly.
	   Brian Meadows (10-13) is 0-4 in his last six starts.
 &UR; Astros 2, Pirates 0
	   In Pittsburgh, Richard Hidalgo had his second two-homer game
against Pittsburgh in three weeks and Shane Reynolds pitched seven
shutout innings to lead the Houston Astros over the Pirates.
	   The win was the 99th of the season for the NL Central champion
Astros. Houston needs one win in its final five games for its first
100-win season since beginning play in 1962.
	   Reynolds (19-8) gave up 10 hits but stranded eight runners to
move within one victory of his first 20-win season.
	   Hidalgo hit a one-out solo shot in the first off Jason Schmidt
(11-13), then followed with an even longer solo homer into the
center-field seats off Schmidt in the third.
	   Jay Powell pitched a scoreless eighth and Billy Wagner finished
up for his 30th save.
 &UR; Phillies 6, Expos 3
	   In Philadelphia, Paul Byrd pitched 6 1-3 strong innings and
Wendell Magee Jr. hit a key two-run single as the Philadelphia
Phillies defeated the Montreal Expos.
	   Byrd (5-2) tied a season high with seven strikeouts in his third
straight win. He retired the first 10 Montreal batters and gave up
five hits.
	   McGee's single off Dustin Hermanson (14-11) put the Phillies
ahead 3-2 in the sixth.
	   Ricky Bottalico pitched the ninth for his fourth save.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with McGwire almost hitting No. 66 &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ Mark McGwire hit his major league record 65th
home run Sunday, then had an apparent No. 66 taken away by an
umpire's ruling in the St. Louis Cardinals' game against Milwaukee.
	   McGwire pulled two ahead of Sammy Sosa with a first-inning shot
off Milwaukee left-hander Scott Karl.
	   Everybody but second-base umpire Bob Davidson thought McGwire
had No. 66 in the fifth inning, when he sent a line drive deep to
left-center field off rookie Rod Henderson.
	   But Davidson ruled that a fan had interfered by reaching over
the yellow railing at the 392-foot (119-meter) sign and pulling the
ball in. McGwire was forced to stop at second with a double _ he
rounded the bag, looking for a signal _ as the crowd jeered and
Cardinals manager Tony La Russa protested briefly.
	   TV replays were inconclusive.
	   The yellow pipe was installed about 18 inches (45 centimeters)
above the outfield wall padding after the 1982 World Series, when a
fan reached down and snatched a ball from Ben Oglivie's grasp.
	   It has been the source of several disputes since, mostly because
there's a chain-link fence between the padding and the yellow rail,
making it difficult for umpires to tell for certain whether a ball
clears the rail, hits right in front of it and bounces over or even
if a fan reaches over.
	   McGwire, who struck out four times Saturday night, took a
curtain call after giving St. Louis a 2-0 lead. His 423-foot
(129-meter) homer in the first followed a single by Fernando Tatis.
	   Before the game, La Russa said he had no doubt his slugger would
bounce right back after his first four-whiff game of the year.
	   ``If you're talking about the mental aspect of the game, you
never have to worry about Mark,'' La Russa said. ``He's been very
strong mentally. He's been the same every day, all year.''
	   On a 2-1 pitch, McGwire sent a no-doubt drive into the
left-field bleachers, setting off a scramble for the ball.
	   McGwire had an 18 at-bat homer drought after breaking Roger
Maris' record Sept. 8, but has three homers in his last five games.
	   McGwire, who broke a tie for the home run lead Friday with a
417-foot (127-meter) two-run homer off Milwaukee rookie Rafael
Roque, skipped batting practice Sunday after hitting nine homers in
18 swings Saturday night.
	   Sunday's homer was the 451st of McGwire's career, tying him with
Carl Yastrzemski for 20th on the career list. He has 176 homers the
past three seasons.
	   The Cardinals have six games to go, all at home, where he has
homered a record 33 times.

	   TORONTO (AP) _ The filly Cotton Carnival, one of Canada's top
3-year-olds last year, died of a heart attack after the dlrs 52,000
Wilderness Song Stakes Sunday at Woodbine.
	   Cotton Carnival began to show distress about a half mile (0.8
kilometer) into the 1 and 1/16-mile (1.7-kilometer) race. Jockey
Robert Landry pulled up shortly after and had the horse at a casual
gallop, crossing the finish line last in the six-horse field.
	   After Landry dismounted, track officials began hosing down the
filly, then she collapsed. Cotton Carnival was still breathing
before going into cardiac arrest.
	   Last year, Cotton Carnival won four of nine starts and earned
dlrs 241,906. In 1996, she had two wins and three seconds in seven
races, earning dlrs 90,345.

Florida falls from top five in AP poll
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITS to fix slug &QL; 
 &UR; By RICHARD ROSENBLATT &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ First it was Florida State, now it's Florida.
	   For the first time in nearly eight years, a team from the state
of Florida is not among the top five in The Associated Press' Top
25 college football poll.
	   Tennessee's 20-17 overtime victory over Florida Saturday night
sent the Gators from No. 2 to No. 8 in this week's poll. A week
ago, the Seminoles lost to North Carolina State and tumbled from
No. 2 to No. 11.
	   The last time the Sunshine State teams were out of the top five
was Oct. 27, 1990, when Miami was eighth, Florida State 12th and
Florida 15th. The Hurricanes last made the top five early in the
1994 season.
	   Ohio State, meanwhile, moved closer to a unanimous choice as No.
1. The Buckeyes, 35-14 winners over Missouri, received 64
first-place votes and 1,744 points from the 70 sportswriters and
broadcasters on the AP panel. Last week, Ohio State had 57
first-place votes.
	   Nebraska, which had the week off, moved up a notch to No. 2 with
one first-place vote and 1,601 points, while UCLA improved a spot
to No. 3 with a first-place vote and 1,562 points. The Bruins beat
Houston 42-24.
	   Tennessee, which ended a five-game losing streak against
Florida, moved up two places to No. 4 with two first-place votes
and 1,542 points. Kansas State, a 48-7 winner over Texas, remained
No. 5 with two first-place votes and 1,522 points.
	   LSU advanced a place to No. 6, followed by No. 7 Penn State, No.
8 Florida, No. 9 Washington and No. 10 Florida State.
	   The Seminoles moved back into the top 10 with a 62-13 victory
over Duke. The Nittany Lions, despite a narrow 20-13 win over
Pittsburgh, moved up one spot from a week ago. Washington, which
beat Brigham Young 20-10, plays at Nebraska next Saturday.
	   Virginia, a 20-18 winner over Clemson, fell one place to No. 11,
followed by No. 12 Syracuse, No. 13 Georgia, No. 14 Wisconsin, No.
15 Colorado, No. 16 Arizona, No. 17 Texas A and M, No. 18 Southern
California, No. 19 West Virginia and No. 20 Oregon.
	   Virginia Tech, a 27-20 overtime winner against Miami, jumped
into the Top 25 at No. 21, followed by No. 22 Alabama, with Air
Force and Notre Dame tied at No. 23 and Missouri at No. 25.
	   In the USA Today/ESPN Top 25, the top five were: Ohio State,
Nebraska, Kansas State, Tennessee and UCLA.
	   Air Force (3-0), which beat Colorado State 30-27 last Thursday,
and Virginia Tech (3-0) are the new teams in the Top 25. North
Carolina State, a 33-30 loser to Baylor, and Mississippi State,
beaten 42-23 by Oklahoma State, fell out of the rankings.

Arafat will seek support for state, regardless of peace talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Yasser Arafat will use the upcoming U.N.
General Assembly to seek support for a declaration of Palestinian
statehood, regardless of whether there is progress in talks with
Israel on a West Bank withdrawal by then, an aide said Sunday.
	   In his speech to the world body on Sept. 28, Arafat will also
call for the convening of an Arab summit, said Arafat adviser Nabil
Abourdeneh. If held, such a summit would likely result in Israel
being further ostracized in the Arab world.
	   The adviser initially said Arafat might not seek an Arab summit
if there was a breakthrough in negotiations with Israel before next
weekend, but later said there was no link between a call for a
summit and progress in negotiations.
	   Coinciding with the start of the U.N. General Assembly in New
York this week, the United States will try again to wrap up an
elusive agreement on an Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is likely to hold
separate talks with Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
	   Abourdeneh said Israeli-Palestinians contacts might also be
possible in New York, but would not elaborate.
	   Netanyahu is flying to New York after the Jewish New Year's
which ends Tuesday, and Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath,
a member of the negotiating team, is already in the city.
	   Abourdeneh said no preparations had been made for an
Arafat-Netanyahu meeting and that a summit would only be possible
once there was a breakthrough.
	   Talks have remained deadlocked for months, and an 11-day mission
by U.S. envoy Dennis Ross ended Saturday without progress.

2002 Olympic budget to be unveiled Thursday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Utah residents will get their first look
at the budget for the 2002 Winter Games Thursday, but Olympic
officials are not tipping their hand.
	   Salt Lake Organizing Committee officials have kept a tight lid
on the details of the budget, projected to be about dlrs 1.4
billion.
	   That figure, should it be the bottom line, is within revenue
projections, meaning the Games would avoid red ink.
	   SLOC sources also told The Salt Lake Tribune that the budget
will _ as promised _ not use any local tax dollars and the state
and local governments' dlrs 59 million investment in venues will be
repaid, with a dlrs 40 million endowment to pay for operations.
	   The budget does rely on federal money for Games-related expenses
such as transportation and public safety _ as have other Games
staged in the United States.
	   SLOC board president Robert Garff said, whatever the budget is,
Utah residents will be proud of the Games.
	   ``We're going to make do with what we have, and it is
conservative,'' he said. ``But is it too frugal? I don't think
we'll be embarrassed. It will not be the lap of luxury, but that's
not the Utah spirit anyway.''
	   Board members were expected to approve the budget Oct. 8, but
two weeks may not be long enough to digest the figures.
	   John Krimsky, president of the U.S. Olympic Committee's joint
marketing venture with SLOC, said approving the budget allows
actual projects to begin, making it easier to get businesses to
contribute goods and services to the Games.

Socialists head for narrow win over right in Sweden

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The Social Democrats, who have governed
Sweden for most of the past seven decades and built its high-tax
welfare state, got their lowest support ever in national elections
but were likely to retain power.
	   With votes counted from 99 percent of the districts, the Social
Democrats had just 36.7 percent of the vote, a steep plunge for the
45 percent they got four years ago and far short of the majority
needed to govern without support from other parties.
	   That support is likely to come from the ex-Communist Left Party,
which nearly doubled its representation with 12 percent of the vote
_ a surge that apparently came at the expense of the Social
Democrats _ and from the Greens, who got 4.4 percent. Together the
parties would have 190 of the Riksdag parliament's seats.
	   But relying on the Left and Greens for support is an unsavory
prospect for the Social Democrats.
	   ``This is not a good situation. It will be difficult to find a
solid base for the government,'' Social Democrats general secretary
Ingela Thalen said.
	   Prime Minister Goeran Persson opposes a formal coalition with
the Left and the Greens because they resist his party's economic
pragmatism and favor Sweden's withdrawal from the European Union.
	   Nevertheless, he said late Sunday that he intends to remain in
government. That means the only way to unseat the Social Democrats
would be to call a vote of confidence in the government, with the
Lefts or the Greens joining the non-socialist parties or abstaining
from the vote.
	   ``We rule on!'' the usually phlegmatic Persson said jubilantly
at the Social Democrats' election-night festivities in Stockholm.
``We have taken the country out of crisis. We have fought.''
	   Carl Bildt, the conservative Moderates party leader who was
prime minister in 1991-4, said Persson's crowing was premature.
	   ``The Social Democrats are facing both a parliamentary and
political crisis,'' he said.
	   The Moderates, the main non-socialist party, got 22.7 percent
while the Christian Democrats more than doubled their current
support to 11.7 percent.
	   The Center Party _ which follows an idiosyncratic program of
conservative economics and staunch environmentalism and is
unwilling to enter a coalition government headed by Bildt _ had 5.1
percent. The Liberals were at 4.7 percent.
	   The campaign centered on economic issues, with the
non-socialists arguing that Sweden's taxes _ currently the world's
highest _ doom the country to irrelevancy in a rapidly globalizing
economy.
	   The Social Democrats said that Sweden was inching its way back
to a strong economy after suffering in the early part of the decade
while the country tried to dig itself out from under a crushing
debt.
	   Many statistics supported the Social Democrats' argument:
unemployment, although uncomfortably high at 7.3 percent, has
consistently fallen over the past two years; inflation is
negligible and the country expects to run a small budget surplus
this year.
	   Turnout was surprisingly low by the standards of Sweden's
usually diligent voters _ just 79 percent of the electorate of 6.7
million. Analysts said voters were discouraged by the country's
struggles of the past decade.
	   ``Now we have the opportunity to win their confidence back,''
Persson said.

	   SOCIAL CIRCLE, Georgia (AP) _ Frederick Alderman, the oldest
Olympic gold medalist in track and field in the United States, is
dead at 93.
	   He died Tuesday of congestive heart failure at The Mews personal
care home.
	   Alderman won both the National Collegiate Athletic Association
100- and 220-yard dashes in 1927 while competing for Michigan
State.
	   In the 1928 Olympics at Amsterdam, he ran on the U.S.
1,600-meter relay team, helping the Americans win a gold medal and
set a world record.
	   During the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Alderman helped carry the
torch.

Zaragoza misses opportunity to gain No. 1 spot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Newly promoted Alaves defeated Zaragoza 1-0
Sunday, stopping Zaragoza's bid to advance to first place in the
Spanish first division.
	   Meanwhile, Real Madrid maintained its lead over the first
division after drawing with arch-rival FC Barcelona a day earlier.
	   The big chance for Alaves, from the northern city of Vitoria,
came in the 70th when Manuel Calabal scored between the Zaragoza
goalkeeper's legs. Canabal's goal became the first scored by Alaves
in the premier division in 42 years.
	   Zaragoza is now No. 3 in the league with 6 points, one behind
Real Madrid.
	   Madrid was held to a 2-2 draw by defending champion FC
Barcelona. Raul Gonzalez scored twice for Madrid while Barcelona's
goals came from Brazilian ace Sonny Anderson and Dutchman Patrick
Kluivert.
	   In other games Sunday, it was: Oviedo 0, Tenerife 1; Real
Sociedad 0, Mallorca 1; Espanyol 1, Atletico de Madrid 1; Salamanca
3, Deportivo de La Coruna 0; Valencia 1, Villareal 0; Celta 0,
Valladolid 0; Extremadura 0, Athletic de Bilbao 1; Racing de
Santander 1, Betis 1.
 &UR; Salamanca 3, Deportivo 1 &QC; 
	   Argentine Walter Silvani scored a goal in each half to lead
Salamanca to its first victory in the league. Leo Ramos of Uruguay
added another in the 61st. Salamanca's Sergio Corino helped the
rivals with an own goal in the second half.
 &UR; Real Sociedad 0, Mallorca 1 &QC; 
	   In San Sebastian, Mallorca's defender Marcelino Elena made it
1-0 in the 16th, giving the visiting team a needed victory against
middle-ranked Real Sociedad.
	   With the victory, Mallorca advances to No. 2 in the league, tied
at seven points with Real Madrid.
 &UR; Extremadura 0, Athletic de Bilbao 1 &QC; 
	   At the small farm town of Almendralejo, Athletic downed lowly
Extremadura thanks to a 67th-minute close-range shot by forward
Ismael Urzaiz. Athletic is tied with Zaragoza and Valencia with six
points.
 &UR; Espanyol 1, Atletico 1 &QC; 
	   In Barcelona, a 78-minute goal by forward Francisco ``Kiko''
Narvaez gave Atletico the chance to equalize against Espanyol.
Paraguayan Miguel Angel Benitez scored for the local team in the
58th.

	   PASADENA, California (AP) _ Goaltender David Kramer extended his
shutout streak to 250 minutes and Ronald Cerritos scored on a
first-half free kick Sunday as the San Jose Clash defeated the Los
Angeles Galaxy 1-0, avenging Wednesday's 1-0 shootout loss.
	   Cerritos twisted a 22-yard (20-meter) shot inside the near goal
post in the 41st minute, eluding goalkeeper Matt Reis, who was
positioned near the far goal post.
	   A combination of Kramer and luck kept the Galaxy scoreless.
Kramer made five saves, three in the first half and two in the
second. Cobi Jones' 36th-minute shot hit the crossbar, Carlos
Hermosillo's shot in the 65th minute rolled wide and midfielder
Eddie Lewis deflected Mauricio Cienfuegos' 85th-minute shot.
	   Los Angeles led 16-9 in shots, with both teams taking six shots
on goal. Reis made five saves in his first start since defeating
San Jose on June 27.
	   The Galaxy played the final 67 minutes with 10 players after
rookie midfielder Clint Mathis was ejected for tripping San Jose
midfielder Martin Vasquez. Under Major League Soccer rules, Mathis
will be suspended for Los Angeles' next match, Sunday against
Chicago at the Rose Bowl.
	   The loss ended the Galaxy's three-match winning streak and was
just its second in the past nine matches. Los Angeles (23-8) is
assured of the Western Conference championship, while San Jose
(12-19) has been eliminated from playoff contention.
	   An announced crowd of 11,123 attended.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) - Two British charity workers returned to England on
Sunday after Chechen kidnappers released them from their 14-month
captivity.
	   Camilla Carr and Jon James were kidnapped in July 1997 while on
a charitable mission in Chechnya for a Quaker relief organization,
the Center for Peacemaking and Community Development.
	   They waved and smiled as they stepped out of the plane at Brize
Norton, a Royal Air Force base in Oxfordshire, northwest of London.
	   After spending fifteen minutes alone with their families, the
pair spoke briefly to the media. They looked weary but in good
spirits, as their family stood smiling behind them.
	   ''It is beyond words really,'' Carr said.
	   ''How am I feeling now? Slightly numb,'' James added.
	   The Britons' release ``shows the benefits of co-operation
between our government and the Russian government,'' said a
spokesman for the Foreign Office, speaking on customary condition
of anonymity.
	   Britain's ambassador to Moscow, Sir Andrew Wood, met Carr and
James at a Moscow airport operated by the Lukoil company, where the
pair arrived before flying on to Britain. He thanked Russian
financier and regional trouble-shooter Boris Berezovsky for helping
win the hostages' release, and said the British had paid no ransom.
	   Berezovsky refused to speak with reporters at the airport, and
he quickly ushered two Russian soldiers who had also been released
into his limousine.
	   Vladimir Ivanenko and Alexander Dubnov, both from the southern
Rostov region, had been captured during Russia's 1994-96 war to
stop the Chechens' drive for independence, Russian television
reported Sunday. They were shown on television shaking hands with
Salman Raduyev, a former Chechen field commander who reportedly
brokered their release.
	   ``By this act we call on the Russian side to meet us half way,''
Raduyev said. ``We are ready to continue the release of Russian
prisoners of war, but we expect the Russian side to do the same
with Chechen prisoners.''
	   The Chechen side has been pressing Russia to release two Chechen
women arrested in Russia on suspicion of terrorism.
	   Carr told reporters at the airport that the kidnappers had moved
her and James 14 times to confound possible rescuers, and that they
had not always treated the captives well.
	   ``A few times we got hit _ a little bit,'' Carr told reporters.
	   But she said,''I don't really feel bitterness.'' She described
their captors as ''desperate.''
	   The pair said they were mostly hidden in cellars, with little or
no light. They said they did not know why they had been released
now.
	   Hugging her daughter at the airport, Carr's mother Helen said,
''I can't believe it. I had no idea. It is all a bit
overwhelming.''
	   Carr and James, both medics, had traveled to Chechnya to
establish a center for helping children recover from the trauma of
war.
	   They were among the longest-held foreign captives in Chechnya.
Scores of people have been kidnapped in or near Chechnya since the
end of the 1996 independence war with Russia. Most of the
kidnappings are carried out by armed criminal groups seeking
ransom.

It's Sammy Day in Chicago
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NANCY ARMOUR &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Sammy Sosa hugged his mother, kissed his wife and
then took off on a victory lap around Wrigley Field, waving his cap
as the theme from ``Superman'' blared over the loudspeakers.
	   What a way to end the best party Wrigley Field has seen in
decades.
	   ``It's been something special,'' Sosa said Sunday. ``Thank you
very much and God bless all of you.''
	   A week after Sosa hit home runs No. 61 and 62 to tie and pass
Roger Maris' single-season mark, the Chicago Cubs and major league
baseball threw a bash to celebrate his amazing season. He has 63
home runs, two behind St. Louis' Mark McGwire.
	   Sosa's mother, Lucrecya, and his siblings were flown in from the
Dominican Republic, and Maris' six children were on hand, too.
Commissioner Bud Selig came, and so did Juan Marichal, the Hall of
Fame pitcher who is Secretary of Sports in the Dominican Republic.
	   Even Michael Jordan showed up.
	   ``It's been one of the greatest individual seasons in the
history of major league baseball,'' Cubs general manager Ed Lynch
said. ``I don't think there's any way we could properly show our
appreciation, but we're going to try.''
	   Many said they should have tried earlier. Unlike the spontaneous
party after McGwire's 62nd homer, Sosa didn't even get a small
get-together last weekend.
	   Selig wasn't even at the game, though he did call to
congratulate Sosa afterward.
	   ``I never want him to think that he has been treated in any way
but with the greatest respect,'' Selig said. ``Here's a young man
who battled from nothing, stayed with it. It's a wonderful story.''
	   And a wonderful party. A huge sign in left field read, ``Sammy:
YOU'RE the Man.'' The team pennants that usually fly above Wrigley
were gone, replaced by Dominican flags and pennants with ``Sosa''
on one side and ``21'' on the other. Latin music blared over the
loudspeakers.
	   When Sosa came out of the dugout to take batting practice, fans
roared and waved little Dominican flags that were being handed out
outside.
	   ``We're Dominican today,'' said teammate Manny Alexander, who
grew up in the same town as Sosa. ``It's just like playing winter
ball.''
	   There were gifts galore. McGwire sent a letter of
congratulations. Selig gave him the Commissioner's Historic
Achievement Award, and the Cubs gave him a painting. Cubs manager
Jim Riggleman gave him a crystal statue.
	   Just when it seemed like everyone was done, the metal doors in
right field opened, and in rolled a brand-new, maroon Plymouth
Prowler convertible. As Lynch held up a license plate that read,
``Sammy 98,'' a huge grin crossed Sosa's face.
	   Not bad for a boy who grew up selling oranges and shining shoes
to help support his family.
	   ``Baseball been very, very good to me,'' he said as the 40,000
fans at Wrigley roared.
	   His mother, whom Sosa honors with his now-famous heart taps
every time he homers, beamed throughout the entire ceremony.
	   After all the gifts and honors had been handed out, Sosa thanked
everyone and walked over to hug his mother and kiss his wife. Then,
with a sheepish grin, he walked back to the microphone.
	   ``Excuse me, I forgot my family,'' he said as his family
laughed. ``My wife, my mother, my brothers and friends, they've
been supportive 100 percent to me.''
	   Then he was off on his victory lap _ even running through the
Cincinnati bullpen while Pete Harnisch was warming up. The fans in
right field bowed as he passed, and there were chants of ``M-V-P,
M-V-P.''
	   As he reached the Cubs dugout, his applauding teammates
swallowed him up in a huge hug.

De Boer twins back at Arena but Ajax has to settle for a point
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Ajax Amsterdam wasted chance after
chance Sunday and could do no more than tie 1-1 with De Graafschap
Doetinchem.
	   The tie leaves Ajax sharing second place in the standings with
FC Utrecht, which drew 1-1 with Fortuna Sittard, and a point behind
Feyenoord, which has the maximum 12 points from its four games.
	   Feyenoord can extend its league lead if it wins at PSV Eindhoven
Tuesday night. The top-of-the-league match was postponed from
Sunday because of fears of clashes between rival fans.
	   The Ajax game was the first at home for the De Boer twins,
returning from a two-month layoff during which both refused to play
for the club because they were denied transfers.
	   The 45,000 Arena crowd greeted the brothers' first touches of
the ball with a chorus of whistles, but gradually warmed to the
pair, who have been the mainstay of the successful Ajax teams of
recent years.
	   Tijani Babangida missed three clear-cut chances for Ajax in the
first half and an uncharacteristic goalkeeping error from Edwin van
der Sar gave De Graafschap a 1-0 lead at 21 minutes.
	   Robert Fuchs launched a weak and speculative shot from a
distance and the ball bounced just in front of Van der Sar and past
the off-balance goalie.
	   It took just five minutes for Ajax to tie the score. Frank de
Boer's quickly-taken free kick produced a first-touch center from
Georgi Kinkladze and a Jari Litmanen tap-in.
	   Ajax stepped up the pressure during the entire second half but
looked too nervous in the penalty area to score.
	   MVV Maastricht gained its first points of the season Saturday
and climbed off the bottom of the table in spectacular fashion,
upsetting championship hopeful Vitesse Arnhem 4-2.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The Social Democrats, who have governed
Sweden for most of the past seven decades and built its high-tax
welfare state, got their lowest support ever in national elections
Sunday but were likely to retain power.
	   With votes counted from 99 percent of the districts, the Social
Democrats had just 36.7 percent of the vote, a steep plunge for the
45 percent they got four years ago and far short of the majority
needed to govern without support from other parties.
	   That support is likely to come from the ex-Communist Left Party,
which nearly doubled its representation with 12 percent of the vote
_ a surge that apparently came at the expense of the Social
Democrats _ and from the Greens, who got 4.4 percent. Together the
parties would have 190 of the Riksdag parliament's seats.
	   But relying on the Left and Greens for support is an unsavory
prospect for the Social Democrats.
	   ``This is not a good situation. It will be difficult to find a
solid base for the government,'' Social Democrats general secretary
Ingela Thalen said.
	   Prime Minister Goeran Persson opposes a formal coalition with
the Left and the Greens because they resist his party's economic
pragmatism and favor Sweden's withdrawal from the European Union.
	   Nevertheless, he said late Sunday that he intends to remain in
government. That means the only way to unseat the Social Democrats
would be to call a vote of confidence in the government, with the
Lefts or the Greens joining the non-socialist parties or abstaining
from the vote.
	   ``We rule on!'' the usually phlegmatic Persson said jubilantly
at the Social Democrats' election-night festivities in Stockholm.
``We have taken the country out of crisis. We have fought.''
	   Carl Bildt, the conservative Moderates party leader who was
prime minister in 1991-4, said Persson's crowing was premature.
	   ``The Social Democrats are facing both a parliamentary and
political crisis,'' he said.
	   The Moderates, the main non-socialist party, got 22.7 percent
while the Christian Democrats more than doubled their current
support to 11.7 percent.
	   The Center Party _ which follows an idiosyncratic program of
conservative economics and staunch environmentalism and is
unwilling to enter a coalition government headed by Bildt _ had 5.1
percent. The Liberals were at 4.7 percent.
	   The campaign centered on economic issues, with the
non-socialists arguing that Sweden's taxes _ currently the world's
highest _ doom the country to irrelevancy in a rapidly globalizing
economy.
	   The Social Democrats said that Sweden was inching its way back
to a strong economy after suffering in the early part of the decade
while the country tried to dig itself out from under a crushing
debt.
	   Many statistics supported the Social Democrats' argument:
unemployment, although uncomfortably high at 7.3 percent, has
consistently fallen over the past two years; inflation is
negligible and the country expects to run a small budget surplus
this year.
	   Even if the non-socialists were to scrape together enough
support to push the Social Democrats out, no large changes are
likely in two of Sweden's most salient qualities: high taxes and
extensive social services.
	   The Moderates have proposed a tax cut of 80 billion kronor (dlrs
10 billion) that would be substantial for a country of just 8.8
million people, but would reduce Sweden's tax burden only to 50
percent of gross domestic product, one of the world's highest
levels.
	   And all parties campaigned on promising improvements in Sweden's
inexpensive medical system, where quality has declined under
funding cuts of the 1990s.
	   Turnout was surprisingly low by the standards of Sweden's
usually diligent voters _ just 79 percent of the electorate of 6.7
million. Analysts said voters were discouraged by the country's
struggles of the past decade.
	   ``Now we have the opportunity to win their confidence back,''
Persson said.

Tyson could be fighting as early as November
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson, basically broke despite earning
more than dlrs 100 million in his last six fights, could be back in
the ring and earning millions by the end of November.
	   With his bid for a boxing license reinstatement now only a mere
formality away from being accepted, Tyson stands ready to cash in
with a series of megafights that figure to culminate in a third
fight with Evander Holyfield.
	   If a psychiatrist gives the OK, Tyson could be fighting as early
as late November at the same Las Vegas casino where he bit
Holyfield's ears and was banished from the sport he once dominated.
	   ``If I ever get reinstated again, I'll probably make dlrs 300
million,'' Tyson said Saturday.
	   If he does, he has a team of new advisers who say it will be
their job to make sure he keeps most of the money.
	   Though Tyson made more than dlrs 100 million in official purses
in six fights ending in the aborted title fight with Holyfield, he
is now basically broke and owes the Internal Revenue Service dlrs
13 million in back taxes.
	   Tyson's free-spending ways did much to contribute to his
financial problems. But a contract that gave promoter Don King and
Tyson's two co-managers half of everything he made didn't help
matters.
	   Tyson's attorney, Dale Kinsella, introduced figures at
Saturday's Nevada Athletic Commission meeting showing Tyson ended
up with only dlrs 5.2 million out of the dlrs 30 million purse he
received to fight Holyfield in their second bout.
	   Kinsella promised that when Tyson resumes fighting, the
commission will be given copies of all the contracts he has signed.
	   ``Mike Tyson will be fighting for Mike Tyson again, not all the
people around him,'' Kinsella said.
	   Tyson's new advisers have already negotiated an extension of his
old deal with the Showtime network, which televises his fights via
pay-per-view.
	   Top executives of the MGM Grand hotel-casino, which hosted all
but one of Tyson's fights since his release from prison, attended
Saturday's six-hour hearing, and it is likely Tyson will fight at
the hotel when his career resumes.
	   That will happen on a Saturday night in late November or early
December, assuming a psychiatrist finds that Tyson is able to fight
again without snapping and the commission grants him a new license
when it meets Oct. 3.
	   Tyson's comeback would likely go along the lines of the one
following his release from prison in 1995 when his first two fights
were against two opponents deemed easy, Peter McNeeley and Buster
Mathis, Jr.
	   Though Tyson is getting old for a boxer at the age of 32, and is
coming off two straight losses to Holyfield, he remains the premier
attraction in the sport.
	   ``Win or lose, people want to see Mike Tyson,'' Showtime
executive Jay Larkin said. ``There's an almost insatiable appetite
to see him in the ring.''
	   Tyson still must be licensed, of course, and also must either
reach a deal with King on his promotional rights or get a court to
rule in his favor. Tyson has sued King and his former managers to
break their contracts and recover money he claims was rightfully
his.

Zambian president hopeful for Congo truce after Rwanda, Uganda
</HEADLINE>
talks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ President Frederick Chiluba on Sunday said
that Uganda and Rwanda had agreed to the details of withdrawing
troops from combat zones in Congo.
	   Chiluba returned to Lusaka after meeting Saturday with Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni and Sunday with Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu in a peace initiative for the Southern African
Development Community.
	   Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa was also involved in the
talks.
	   Museveni said Sunday in a radio interview that he was optimistic
that regional leaders would soon end the conflict in Congo, despite
many failed attempts.
	   ``They cannot allow themselves to squander resources for such
futile conflicts,'' Museveni said on the British Broadcasting
Corp.'s International Question Time, monitored in Nairobi. ``I am
sure they will find a solution.''
	   The Congo conflict, the most serious threat to security in
central Africa in years, has drawn in at least five regional
powers, with Uganda and Rwanda backing rebels trying to unseat
Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
	   Kabila's military backers are Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola.
	   Speaking on his arrival from Rwanda, Chiluba described the
discussions as very fruitful and positive but refused to give
details, the South African Press Association reported.
	   He said he would brief SADC presidents at a summit to be called
soon by the SADC chairman, South Africa's President Nelson Mandela.
	   Congo President Laurent Kabila accuses both Uganda and Rwanda of
backing rebels who are trying to topple him.
	   Uganda says its troops are in northeastern Congo under an
agreement with Kabila made earlier in the year to permit Uganda to
flush out rebels who have been attacking western Uganda.
	   But Uganda, while denying its forces are aiding the Congolese
rebels, earlier in the week vowed to keep Ugandan troops in Congo
as long as Uganda's security was threatened.
	   Rwanda also denies its troops are participating directly in the
conflict, but it has also reserved the right to intervene to
protect its national interests.
	   Rwandan Hutu rebels, remnants of the army and militia that
carried out the 1994 genocide against minority Tutsis in Rwanda,
have been launching attacks against Rwanda from northeastern Congo.

South Africa condemns killing of Iranians in Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa condemned the killing
of Iranian diplomats and a journalist by Afghanistan's Taliban
forces in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   ``The killing of diplomats is seen as an unacceptable breach of
the provision of the Vienna convention on Diplomatic Relations,'' a
statement on Saturday from the Foreign Affairs Ministry said.
	   The government called for the perpetrators to be brought to
justice.
	   The Taliban militia released five more Iranian prisoners
Saturday in an attempt to ease tensions with its powerful neighbor
Iran.
	   Iran has deployed thousands of troops on its border with
Afghanistan after eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist were
killed by Taliban troops on Aug. 8. Protesters in Iran have
demanded revenge for the killings.
	   South Africa called on all parties in the conflict in
Afghanistan to cease hostilities, exercise restraint and observe
internationally accepted norms of human rights.

Pepper and Steinhauer guide U.S. to another Solheim win
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RUSTY MILLER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) _ Dottie Pepper won another emotional match
and Sherri Steinhauer hit two memorable iron shots down the stretch
for the deciding point as the United States blunted a European
comeback Sunday to retain the Solheim Cup.
	   Criticized by the Europeans for her emotional displays and
cheerleading on the course, Pepper ran her record to 4-0 this week
and 10-1 in the last three Solheims.
	   ``I get inspired for stuff like this,'' Pepper said. ``I love a
team format and playing for your country gives me goosebumps.''
	   The 16-12 victory was the Americans' fourth in the five biennial
competitions, the women's version of the men's Ryder Cup. Europe's
only victory came in 1992 at Dalmahoy in Scotland.
	   Ahead 10 1/2-5 1/2 to start the final day, the United States
needed just 3 1/2 points in singles to retain the Solheim Cup. With
one point up for grabs in each of the 12 head-to-head matches,
Europe applied the heat by capturing Sunday's first three matches
at Muirfield Village Golf Club.
	   ``They came out with their guns loaded,'' Pepper said.
	   But then Pepper completed a 3 and 2 victory over Trish Johnson,
followed by Rosie Jones' 6 and 4 win over Catrin Nilsmark.
	   After knocking a wedge shot within 4 feet (1.2 meters) at the
par-4 14th to clinch the match, Jones _ who played at nearby Ohio
State _ pumped her arm and smiled to the crowd as she walked to the
green.
	   Then Kelly Robbins drained a 12-foot (3.7-meter) birdie putt at
the 17th to close out Charlotta Sorenstam 2 and 1 to move the U.S.
team within a point of retaining the crystal championship trophy.
	   Steinhauer _ who didn't earn her way onto the team but was
selected by captain Judy Rankin _ took it from there.
	   Steinhauer assured the United States of retaining the cup when
her third-shot approach on the par-5 15th came to rest 18 inches
(46 centimeters) from the hole. Her birdie tap-in locked up the
half-point the Americans' needed to keep the Solheim Cup.
	   Then on the 159-yard (145-meter), par-3 16th, Steinhauer hit an
iron to 8 feet (2.4 meters). Europe's Catriona Matthew followed
with a clutch shot of her own, knocking the ball 2 feet (0.6
meters) inside of Steinhauer's.
	   ``I knew she was going to make that putt, so I said to myself,
`Let's just get this thing over with,' '' Steinhauer said. ``What a
feeling!''
	   Tammie Green, who lives just 50 miles (80 kilometers) away in
Somerset, was followed by a large partisan gallery in beating
Alison Nicholas 1-up.
	   In the final match of the day, Meg Mallon conceded the final
hole to Europe's Sophie Gustafson _ even though Mallon was on the
back fringe and was ahead 1-up while Gustafson had an 18-foot
birdie putt.
	   The late American heroics followed a valiant comeback by the
Europeans, who went 6-5-1 on the final day.
	   Laura Davies got the first of Europe's points, taking advantage
of Pat Hurst's errant drive on the closing hole for a 1-up victory.
	   Moments later, Helen Alfredsson saved par at 17 with an 8-foot
putt that closed out Juli Inkster 2 and 1. It was Inkster who had
given the United States a dramatic final point as the sun was
setting Saturday night, rolling in a 45-foot putt at the 17th and
then pirouetting three times across the green in celebration.
	   Annika Sorenstam made it three straight for Europe when she
closed out Donna Andrews 2 and 1.
	   Sorenstam, the world's No. 1-ranked player, birdied the 13th
hole to go dormie, then went par, bogey, bogey to see her lead drop
to 2-up going to 17. From the back fringe, she chipped up for an
easy par to lock up the point.
	   Europe also picked up points on Liselotte Neumann's 1-up victory
over Brandie Burton, Marie Laure de Lorenzi's 1-up decision over
Chris Johnson and Lisa Hackney's landslide 6 and 5 win over LPGA
Hall of Famer Betsy King.

Australia expresses deep concern over Malaysian arrest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard on Monday
expressed deep concern about the arrest of former Malaysian Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and urged Malaysia's government not to
go down an authoritarian path.
	   Anwar was arrested at his Kuala Lumpur home Sunday night after
he led thousands of demonstrators through the streets of the
Malaysian capital calling on Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad to
resign.
	   The arrest came 2 1/2 weeks after he was dismissed from the
Cabinet and on the eve of the final day of the Commonwealth Games,
to be closed by Queen Elizabeth II on Monday.
	   Howard told Channel 9 TV, ``I have been following it and I am
concerned.
	   ``It is a matter of deep concern to me and I think to most
Australians that there does appear to have been a drift towards a
more authoritarian approach.
	   ``The image of one's political opponents being arrested, I mean
the image of somebody who is clearly a political opponent of the
current prime minister being arrested, is very disturbing.
	   ``And I can only hope that those forces inside the Malaysian
government that are pushing for an even more authoritarian
government pull back and understand that if you want to defeat your
political opponents you do so through the force of public opinion
and through the force of the ballot box and not use the executive
authority of the government and the police.''
	   Anwar's arrest followed the jailing on Saturday of two men who
allegedly admitted to consensual sodomy with him, but he and his
supporters have attacked the move to arrest him as political.
	   The arrest further inflamed the tense political situation in
Malaysia, and Australian athletes in Kuala Lumpur for the Games
were confined to the athletes' village overnight as thousands of
angry protesters took to the streets.

	   LONDON (AP) - Two British charity workers returned to England on
Sunday after Chechen kidnappers released them from their 14-month
captivity.
	   Camilla Carr and Jon James were kidnapped in July 1997 while on
a charitable mission in Chechnya for a Quaker relief organization,
the Center for Peacemaking and Community Development.
	   They waved and smiled as they stepped out of the plane at Brize
Norton, a Royal Air Force base in Oxfordshire, northwest of London.
	   After spending fifteen minutes alone with their families, the
pair spoke briefly to the media. They looked weary but in good
spirits.
	   ``It is beyond words really,'' Carr said.
	   ``How am I feeling now? Slightly numb,'' James added. ``I don't
know how we got through it. We just did it. We asked each other
questions, what day it was, what date it was.''
	   He said that although they did not know their families were
campaigning for their release, he trusted they would be.

	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ One day after battles left parts of the
Liberian capital littered with corpses and the wreckage of war, the
government on Sunday accused former rebel warlord Roosevelt Johnson
of plotting against President Charles Taylor.
	   Information Minister Joe Mulbah, speaking on state radio, said
Johnson had been training a force to subvert the government.
Johnson is a longtime rival of the president's.
	   ``The government prays that Roosevelt Johnson and his
collaborators be arrested for treason,'' Mulbah said.
	   Moves to nab Johnson and his supporters on Saturday, however,
triggered day-long firefights in downtown Monrovia, leaving at
least 33 people dead.
	   Johnson was believed to be hiding in the U.S. Embassy Sunday.
	   During Friday night's firefight outside his home, Johnson fled
into the U.S. embassy in Monrovia, according to a State Department
official in Washington, who spoke Sunday on condition of anonymity.
	   Johnson was hiding in the embassy, at least temporarily, the
official said. Government forces told embassy personnel they ``will
honor the inviolability of the embassy,'' said the official, who
didn't know how whether he was still there late Sunday.
	   As Johnson's group entered the embassy, government forces
attacked him and his party, killing two of his allies and injuring
two U.S. workers, the official said. One American security officer
was evacuated for medical treatment to Freetown, Sierra Leone.
	   The embassy temporarily suspended operations and authorized the
departure of non-emergency personnel and family members of embassy
workers. Remaining U.S. officials were working out of another
building.
	   The State Department also issued a travel advisory on Saturday,
warning American citizens against going to Liberia because of the
unstable security situation.
	   Volunteers on Sunday performed the grim task of collecting dead
bodies from Monrovia's streets. Calm returned to the city, but many
people stayed home for fear the fighting could flare up again.
	   Hundreds of soldiers watched over the streets, stopping cars at
checkpoints throughout the city.
	   Dozens of people were wounded by stray bullets during the
fighting, which centered around Johnson's home. On Sunday, dozens
of camouflage-wearing soldiers patrolled the streets of that
neighborhood, stopping cars and chasing away pedestrians.
	   Tanks, with helmeted men sticking their heads out of the turret
hatches, occasionally rumbled past.
	   A half-dozen soldiers lounged in front of Johnson's ramshackle
concrete house, marked by the wreckage of a 4-door Mazda that had
been torn apart by gunfire.
	   Next door, an armored car, it's tires blown out, it's windows
pocked by gunfire, sat crippled. Witnesses said dozens of people
had been forced from their homes in the neighborhood, a stronghold
of Johnson supporters.
	   Government troops captured Johnson's residence after issuing an
order for his arrest.
	   Taylor's attempt to arrest him in 1996 touched off months of
brutal fighting that left hundreds of people in Monrovia dead and
the city a burned-out, looted wreck. Johnson eventually fled to
Ghana _ after taking shelter in the U.S. embassy and then flying
out of the country in an American helicopter.
	   He and Taylor eventually reached a tenuous peace.
	   Johnson returned from exile to become Liberia's rural
development minister after Taylor won last July's presidential
elections. He has become distanced from Taylor's administration in
recent months and his future in the government is unclear.
	   Liberians have vivid memories of their country's civil war,
which left 150,000 people dead and prompted countless thousands
more to flee their homes before it ended in 1996.

Chris Perry finally wins a PGA tournament after 14 years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN KEKIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ENDICOTT, New York (AP) _ Chris Perry finally won't have to hear
it any more: ``Why haven't you won? You've been right there.''
	   After 14 years, Perry finally was right there on a Sunday.
	   He shot a 5-under-par 67 to win the B.C. Open by three strokes
over Peter Jacobsen. Perry finished the four rounds at 15-under 273
and took the first-place check of dlrs 270,000.
	   Nolan Henke was third, another stroke back, while Curt Byrum,
Robert Allenby, and Ted Tryba finished tied for fourth at 278.
	   This was Perry's 378th tournament.
	   ``The first win is pretty tough,'' said Perry, who began the day
two shots off the lead and made three birdies on the front nine to
move into first. ``Somebody's always just played better. I've been
in position sometimes, I just haven't played my best on Sunday. I
drew on all those experiences. It was time for me to win. I never
really lost faith in myself. You've just got to believe you can do
it.''
	   Perry won it when nobody else mounted a challenge.
	   Third-round leader Bruce Fleisher, who started Sunday with a
one-shot lead over Henke, faltered on the front nine with three
bogeys, added two more on the back and finished with a 76 and in a
tie for ninth at 280.
	   ``I feel like I had the breaks today,'' said Fleisher, who will
celebrate his 50th birthday in October and then head for the Senior
PGA Tour. ``You make your own breaks. It's a good finish. I'm
looking forward to the senior tour. I don't think my heart can take
this course again. I got off to a very slow start. When you start
bogeying par-5s, you know you're in trouble.''
	   Perry was in trouble four times but always managed to escape.
	   ``I'd see him in the trees and in the fairway. Then I'd see him
put his hand up after he made the putt for par,'' said Henke, who
parred the first eight holes and finished with a 72 after two
birdies and two bogeys. ``He played well today. He's got the monkey
off his back. Now maybe he'll win a few more tournaments.''
	   Perry went to 13 under with a 14-foot (4.3-meter) birdie putt on
the par-4 9th, then watched Henke finally break through with a
birdie on No. 10 to tie him for the lead.
	   After a bogey-5 on the 11th, though, Perry reeled off three
straight birdies on the rock-hard En-Joie Golf Club course to go 15
under. Jacobsen, who was already in the clubhouse with a
final-round 67, watched on TV as his chance at victory suddenly
vanished.

Paul wins for first time in 15 years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) _ John Paul Jr. stayed out of trouble on
an attrition-filled day and came away with his first win in 15
years Sunday in the inaugural Indy Racing League Lone Star 500.
	   The 38-year-old driver gave up track position when he made a
strategic pit stop on lap 163 of the 208-lap event at Texas Motor
Speedway. But he steadily moved toward the front as other drivers
who had stayed on the track had to pit for fuel.
	   Paul took the lead on lap 191 and held off a late challenge from
rookie Robby Unser, crossing the finish line about 10 car-lengths
(1.577 seconds) ahead. It was the first win for Paul since he took
the 1983 Michigan 500 in the rival CART series.
	   ``It's been a long 15 years,'' said an emotional Paul, who spent
28 months in a federal prison from 1986-88 after pleading guilty to
a charge of racketeering for the unloading of a boat containing
marijuana and helping in preparations to use the boat to haul
marijuana from Colombia to Louisiana.
	   People who knew Paul placed the blame on his father, John Paul
Sr., a two-time world endurance driving champion currently serving
a 25-year term for drug trafficking and attempted murder of a
witness in a federal drug case.
	   It took years after being released for Paul to get his racing
career back in sync, and he finally got his chance when the IRL was
formed in 1996.
	   ``Today was just awesome,'' Paul said. ``The car was just
perfect all day. I'm just as fresh as a daisy. I'm ready to go
another 300 laps around this place.''
	   That was the probably the euphoria of the moment speaking since
air temperatures in the mid-90s F (low 30s C) and track
temperatures over 140 F (60 C)caused considerable discomfort for
the drivers and a big problem for some of the teams racing on
Goodyear tires.
	   The race, which was interrupted by eight cautions, was marred by
a series of crashes resulting from tires apparently coming apart in
the intense heat. Among the drivers who either spun or hit the wall
after having tires blown were pole-winner Billy Boat and rookie
David Steele. Paul's car was on Firestone tires.
	   Between yellow flags, though, the race was as hot as the day,
getting the crowd estimated at 81,000 on its feet and cheering a
number of times over the 500-kilometer (312-mile) distance.
	   Jeff Ward and Roberto Guerrero, who both had to pit late in the
race, got back on the lead lap near the end and finished third and
fourth.
	   Kenny Brack, who saw his record three-race winning string end,
finished a lap down in fifth and padded his series points lead.
Going into the season-finale on Oct. 10 at Las Vegas, Brack will
carry a lead of 31 points over Davey Hamilton and 43 over defending
series champion Tony Stewart.
	   That gives both a mathematical chance at the title _ with a
maximum of 55 points available. But Brack, from Sweden, can shut
them out by finishing seventh or better.
	   Hamilton, who had tire problems and lost a lap in the early
going, finished ninth on Sunday, while Stewart, who led early in
the race, wound up 20th after blowing his engine on lap 80.
	   The most serious accident of the afternoon came on lap 134 when
rookie Donnie Beechler and Marco Greco tangled between turns one
and two. The accident also caught up rookie Steve Knapp and Raul
Boesel.
	   Greco was awake and alert after being removed from his car by
safety personnel, but was flown by helicopter to a Dallas hospital
for a precautionary CAT-Scan.
	   Stephan Gregoire, who brought out the first yellow with a crash
on lap 20, was treated and released from the infield medical center
with a bruised right knee.

Lesotho parties meet with neighbors trying to mediate dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ A foreign team of negotiators on Sunday
met separately with the government and opposition parties to
discuss security and election fraud issues that have paralyzed this
tiny country since last month.
	   After a rebellion in the army ten days ago, the military is
under new leadership and continues to refrain from restoring order
in the streets.
	   About 1,500 protesters were gathered at the palace on Sunday to
await the outcome of the meetings, American diplomat Ray Brown
said.
	   Lesotho officials could not be reached for comment.
	   In a report released Thursday, the Langa Commission composed of
representatives of South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe cited
``serious concerns'' about Lesotho's May elections.
	   The report said seals on ballot boxes had been prematurely
broken and material from different polling stations had been mixed
together. But it did not suggest the election be declared invalid.
	   Three opposition parties that have organized the protests claim
the ruling Lesotho Congress Party's landslide victory in May was
the result of fraud.
	   On Friday the government said it would not step down.
	   South African Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi met
Sunday with Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili and cabinet
ministers, but refused to comment on the talks.
	   By late afternoon on Sunday, the opposition leaders were still
waiting for the prime minister to show up for a proposed joint
meeting with the foreign leaders.
	   The leader of the opposition Basotholand Congress Party, Molapo
Qhobela, dismissed as ``unmitigated rubbish'' the ruling party's
claim that it could not meet opposition party leaders because of
fear of violence.
	   Qhobela criticized alleged plans by Zimbabwe and other countries
to intervene and restore order ``as if Lesotho was in a state of
war,'' the South African Press Association reported.
	   King Letsie III, a figurehead monarch who the opposition parties
want to dissolve parliament, cancelled a visit to China because of
the political situation.

Socialists head for narrow win over right in Sweden
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 100 percent of vote counted. &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The Social Democrats, who have governed
Sweden for most of the past seven decades and built its high-tax
welfare state, got their lowest support ever in national elections
Sunday but were likely to retain power.
	   With votes counted from all precincts, the Social Democrats had
just 36.6 percent of the vote, a steep plunge for the 45 percent
they got four years ago and far short of the majority needed to
govern without support from other parties.
	   That support is likely to come from the ex-Communist Left Party,
which nearly doubled its representation with 12 percent of the vote
_ a surge that apparently came at the expense of the Social
Democrats _ and from the Greens, who got 4.5 percent. Together the
parties would have 190 of the Riksdag parliament's seats.
	   But relying on the Left and Greens for support is an unsavory
prospect for the Social Democrats.
	   ``This is not a good situation. It will be difficult to find a
solid base for the government,'' Social Democrats general secretary
Ingela Thalen said.
	   Prime Minister Goeran Persson opposes a formal coalition with
the Left and the Greens because they resist his party's economic
pragmatism and favor Sweden's withdrawal from the European Union.
	   Nevertheless, he said late Sunday that he intends to remain in
government. That means the only way to unseat the Social Democrats
would be to call a vote of confidence in the government, with the
Lefts or the Greens joining the non-socialist parties or abstaining
from the vote.
	   ``We rule on!'' the usually phlegmatic Persson said jubilantly
at the Social Democrats' election-night festivities in Stockholm.
``We have taken the country out of crisis. We have fought.''
	   Carl Bildt, the conservative Moderates party leader who was
prime minister in 1991-4, said Persson's crowing was premature.
	   ``The Social Democrats are facing both a parliamentary and
political crisis,'' he said.
	   The Moderates, the main non-socialist party, got 22.7 percent
while the Christian Democrats more than doubled their current
support to 11.8 percent.
	   The Center Party _ which follows an idiosyncratic program of
conservative economics and staunch environmentalism and is
unwilling to enter a coalition government headed by Bildt _ had 5.1
percent. The Liberals were at 4.7 percent.
	   The campaign centered on economic issues, with the
non-socialists arguing that Sweden's taxes _ currently the world's
highest _ doom the country to irrelevancy in a rapidly globalizing
economy.
	   The Social Democrats said that Sweden was inching its way back
to a strong economy after suffering in the early part of the decade
while the country tried to dig itself out from under a crushing
debt.
	   Many statistics supported the Social Democrats' argument:
unemployment, although uncomfortably high at 7.3 percent, has
consistently fallen over the past two years; inflation is
negligible and the country expects to run a small budget surplus
this year.
	   Even if the non-socialists were to scrape together enough
support to push the Social Democrats out, no large changes are
likely in two of Sweden's most salient qualities: high taxes and
extensive social services.
	   The Moderates have proposed a tax cut of 80 billion kronor (dlrs
10 billion) that would be substantial for a country of just 8.8
million people, but would reduce Sweden's tax burden only to 50
percent of gross domestic product, one of the world's highest
levels.
	   And all parties campaigned on promising improvements in Sweden's
inexpensive medical system, where quality has declined under
funding cuts of the 1990s.
	   Turnout was surprisingly low by the standards of Sweden's
usually diligent voters _ just 79 percent of the electorate of 6.7
million. Analysts said voters were discouraged by the country's
struggles of the past decade.
	   ``Now we have the opportunity to win their confidence back,''
Persson said.

Australia expresses deep concern over Malaysian arrest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard on Monday
expressed deep concern about the arrest of former Malaysian Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and urged Malaysia's government not to
go down an authoritarian path.
	   Anwar was arrested at his Kuala Lumpur home Sunday night after
he led thousands of demonstrators through the streets of the
Malaysian capital calling on Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad to
resign.
	   The arrest came 2 1/2 weeks after he was dismissed from the
Cabinet and on the eve of the final day of the Commonwealth Games,
to be closed by Queen Elizabeth II on Monday.
	   Howard told Channel 9 TV, ``I have been following it and I am
concerned.
	   ``It is a matter of deep concern to me and I think to most
Australians that there does appear to have been a drift towards a
more authoritarian approach.
	   ``The image of one's political opponents being arrested, I mean
the image of somebody who is clearly a political opponent of the
current prime minister being arrested, is very disturbing.''
	   Anwar's arrest followed the jailing on Saturday of two men who
allegedly admitted to consensual sodomy with him, but he and his
supporters have attacked the move to arrest him as political.
	   The arrest further inflamed the tense political situation in
Malaysia, and Australian athletes in Kuala Lumpur for the Games
were confined to the athletes' village overnight as thousands of
angry protesters took to the streets.

Japan's trade surplus rises again in August
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's trade surplus with the world rose 24.7
percent in August for the 17th straight month of increase, the
government said Monday.
	   The merchandise trade surplus, a tally of goods exported minus
imports, rose to 896.7 billion yen (dlrs 6.72 billion) from the
same month last year, the Finance Ministry said.
	   The surplus is measured as goods pass customs but before
adjustment for seasonal factors.
	   Japan's politically sensitive surplus with the United States,
meanwhile, continued to climb, rising 28.4 percent to 431 billion
yen (dlrs 3.23 billion). It was the 23nd straight month of
increase.
	   The trade surplus has been rising as Japan has increased its
reliance on exports to pull itself out of a prolonged slump. The
weak domestic economy has also crimped demand for foreign goods.
	   Japan has come under increasing pressure to revive its
recession-plagued economy and help struggling Asian nations by
importing more from the region.

Malaysian police arrest Anwar, fire tear gas at crowd

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's sacked deputy prime
minister faced charges of sexual misconduct Monday after riot
police raided his home and arrested him during a news conference.
	   Hundreds of Anwar Ibrahim's allies shouted angrily, ``God is
great!'' and ``Long live Anwar!'' shaking their fists as police led
him away from the house Sunday where he had conducted almost two
weeks of protest rallies against the 17-year rule of Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Sunday's newspapers carried banner-headlined stories containing
explicit details of Anwar's alleged sodomy offenses. Anwar's
adopted brother and a friend allegedly confessed to the crimes in a
court hearing on Saturday. Both had been denied access to their
relatives or lawyers during their police detention.
	   Sodomy is a crime in this conservative Muslim country, and both
men were sentenced to six months in prison.
	   Anwar has vehemently denied the charges, saying they were cooked
up by Mahathir, who fears Anwar's growing popularity and any
challenge to his rule.
	   Anwar also charged that defendants had been tortured into
confessing they committed sodomy with him. Mahathir denied the
allegation.
	   Kuala Lumpur Police Chief Kamarudin Ali told the national news
agency Bernama late Sunday that Anwar was being detained to aid
police investigations into several crimes, including public
disturbance, illegal assembly, criminal use of force and rioting.
Kamarudin said Roslan had been arrested in connection with the
Merdeka Square rally.
	   ``Police have taken action to restore order and the situation is
under control and has returned to normal,'' the police chief said.
	   Police had previously said they were investigating allegations
against Anwar of treason, sexual misconduct and abuse of power.
Anwar had predicted he would be arrested at the end of the
Commonwealth Games, which close Monday.
	   The violence sullied a state visit by Queen Elizabeth II, who
worshipped at a church not far from a mass opposition rally Sunday
and was to meet with Mahathir on Monday.
	   Anwar, once Mahathir's handpicked successor, is now his
principal foe. His arrest appeared to be an attempt to thwart the
kind of large-scale protests earlier this year that led to the
ouster of Indonesia's President Suharto, 77.
	   Mahathir, 72, became Asia's longest-serving leader after Suharto
was forced out in May after 32 years by violent protests against
alleged government corruption and a severe economic crisis.
	   Helmeted special reserve police, armed with assault rifles,
parked jeeps in front of Anwar's house and blocked off roads in the
well-heeled neighborhood.
	   Also arrested was Roslan Kassim, a northern state youth-wing
leader from the ruling party, who was in the house during an Anwar
news conference.
	   Matthew Moore, a journalist with Australia's Sydney Morning
Herald, said when police came through the door, ``They jumped on
me, screamed at me and knocked me down.'' He said they demanded his
tape recorder and notebook at gunpoint.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Workers got bonuses from employers and shoppers
scooped up gifts and food. Even so, a feeling of malaise cast a
shadow over Israel as it rang in the Jewish New Year.
	   In the hours before the start of the two-day Rosh Hashana
holiday, preparations were festive but frantic Sunday, and some
people's nerves were on edge over threats from Islamic militants.
	   The two-day Rosh Hashana holiday, beginning at sundown Sunday,
finds Israel where it was a year ago: in the midst of a political
stalemate with the Palestinians. Few are expecting a breakthrough
soon.
	   American mediator Dennis Ross left for Washington Sunday after
yet another inconclusive peace mission.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has managed to anger
supporters and opponents alike. Some charge he has conceded too
much to the Palestinians, others say he has killed the peace
process.
	   ``A believing Jew is always optimistic, but I cannot hide the
concern that we have,'' said Rabbi Eliezer Waldman, head of a
rabbinical school in Kiryat Arba, a militant Jewish settlement in
the West Bank.
	   He is worried that the Netanyahu government will carry out
Israel's commitment to turn over more West Bank land to the
Palestinians. Waldman believes Israel must retain all of the West
Bank for religious and security reasons.
	   Israeli peace activists, for their part, complain that Netanyahu
has no intention of making peace with the Palestinians. Israeli
newspaper columnist B. Michael, exhorted the peace camp to
persevere.
	   ``Don't give up, don't despair, lie low, hold on to what we
have, and wait for this evil regime to pass,'' he wrote in the
Yediot Aharonot newspaper.
	   Israeli faces problems apart from the 18-month stalemate in the
peace process.
	   More than 200,000 Israelis _ representing more than 9 percent of
the work force _ faced the New Year holiday unemployed. Economists
say Israel is in recession. The government is trying to reduce
inflation by cutting spending, and interest rates remain relatively
high.
	   On the eve of the New Year, Israelis crowded shopping malls and
traditional open-air markets, stocking up on food and gifts for the
holiday. Businesses gave bonus presents to workers, some worth
hundreds of dollars.
	   But there was tension in the air. On streets and in markets, _
as shoppers scurried around, sellers hocked their goods and
children scooted underfoot _ Israeli soldiers kept a vigilant
watch.
	   Security was tight. The militant Islamic group Hamas had
threatened bombings and kidnappings during the holidays to avenge
the killings of two Hamas members earlier this month by Israeli
troops.
	   Marina Koshmer came to Israel from the former Soviet republic of
Moldova six months ago. She hadn't heard of the Hamas warnings, and
like so many immigrants, she had her own worries.
	   ``I want to find work. I'm a music teacher, and I don't have a
job,'' she said.
	   As the New Year began, some people couldn't help but look back.
	   ``Someone described the past year as `zero year,' '' said
Israeli songwriter Ehud Manor. ``If you went to sleep at the
beginning and woke up at the end, you would find that nothing
changed.''

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ President Andres Pastrana suggested
Sunday that a bill passed by the U.S. House to place conditions on
anti-drug aid to Colombia could damage the government's efforts to
launch peace talks with rebels.
	   The political battle in Washington over the drug war ``is the
worst thing that could have happened in the past four years,''
Pastrana told a news conference before departing Sunday on a trip
to New York and Washington.
	   Pastrana is traveling to the United States this week to attend
the U.N. General Assembly and meet with congressional leaders in
Washington about the bill.
	   An amendment to a bill passed by the House last week stipulated
that anti-drug aid, currently some dlrs 100 million annually, would
be suspended if Colombia halts aerial drug eradication in a
sparsely populated southern area.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso criticized the so-called Group of Seven industrialized
nations for limiting membership and said the group should expand to
include developing countries, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The group is ``demonstrating that it can't function as a world
directorate because it does not have the strength to do so,''
Cardoso was quoted as saying by the O Globo newspaper.
	   Emerging nations like Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, India and China
should be included in the group's decision-making, the president
was quoted as saying.
	   The Group of Seven is made up of the United States, Canada,
Japan, Britain, France, Germany and Italy.
	   ___
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's President Fernando
Henriqe Cardoso has announced plans to adjust the country's 1999
budget to weather the world financial crisis, according to a press
report.
	   Brazil has to make a ``strong and rapid adjustment'' to the
budget to adjust to the new conditions, Cardoso told the O Jornal
do Brasil newspaper this weekend.
	   The cuts are planned should Cardoso be re-elected as expected at
Brazil's presidential elections on Oct.4. No details about the size
of the adjustment were given.
	   Brazil has moved to stabilize its economy by twice hiking basic
lending rates over the last month to stem the exit of cash. It has
lost some dlrs 25 billion in reserves.
	   Cardoso's announcement came after a meeting with the chairs of
the Senate and Lower House, said O Jornal do Brasil.
	   The president also announced plans to rapidly forge ahead with
reforms to social welfare and tax system structures if elected,
said the daily.

Persian excursion left HMCS Toronto without key supplies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Dollar amounts are in Canadian dollars
 &UR; By The Associated Press

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX (AP) _ Defence Minister Art Eggleton gave them all
medals, but crew members on a naval frigate were denied basics like
summer shirts and medication while patrolling the Persian Gulf
earlier this year.
	   A newly released report from HMCS Toronto says the ship also
lacked targets for target practice, lubrication oil for a hot
climate and passports to send ailing crew members home.
	   Many of the problems arose because the high-tech warship was
reassigned to enforce a U.S.-led embargo against Iraq on Feb. 10
while it was in the midst of a cold-climate NATO exercise off
Norway.
	   ``Toronto sailed with the expectation of operating primarily in
the North Atlantic,'' says the 42-page report, obtained under the
Access to Information Act. ``The re-tasking to the Arabian Gulf
meant that many of the ship's company did not have sufficient
short-sleeve shirts.

 &UR; Economy tops agenda as MPs return to work
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Prime Minister Jean Chretien and his government
face Parliament for the first time in three months today with one
thing uppermost in their minds _ the state of the country's
economy.
	   ``It's got to be our biggest preoccupation,'' says Liberal
caucus chair Joe Fontana.
	   But there won't be any quick and easy answers to the questions
opposition parties lob across the Commons floor on the first day
back from summer holiday.
	   Much of the verbal heat will be directed at Finance Minister
Paul Martin as he crafts his February budget.
	   A summer that saw the loonie tumble, stock markets jitter over a
world financial crisis and lagging domestic economic growth have
limited Martin's margin for manoeuvre.

 &UR; Ben Johnson to ask appeal court to lift ban
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Ten years ago, Ben Johnson sprinted his way into
infamy. Today, he's attempting to outrun his past.
	   ``I'm still one of the greatest sprinters of all time,'' Johnson
told The Canadian Press as he prepared for his court battle today
to be allowed to compete again in world track and field.
	   ``Those guys still haven't beaten 9.79 (seconds).''
	   In the marquee event at the Seoul Olympics 10 years ago this
week, Johnson crushed American sprinter Carl Lewis and shattered
the 100-metre world record he'd set a year earlier.
	   The euphoria didn't last.
	   Three days later he broke the hearts of Canadians by losing his
Olympic gold medal after testing positive for a banned steroid.
	   Today _ two days shy of the 10th anniversary of the historic
Seoul race _ the 36-year-old Johnson is asking the Ontario Court of
Appeal to overturn a lower court's refusal to lift his lifetime ban
from the sport for a second positive steroid test.

 &UR; Bouchard wins supporters over: referendum only under `winning
conditions'
	   LAVAL, Quebec (AP) _ Premier Lucien Bouchard said Sunday he will
never hold a losing referendum on Quebec separation, as he emerged
triumphant over Parti Quebecois hardliners who wanted him to have
an independence vote whether or not it could be won.
	   Bouchard won his battle to add the catchwords ``winning
conditions'' to a resolution that calls for him to hold a
referendum if the PQ wins the next provincial election, expected
later this fall or next spring.
	   Those key words could allow him to wriggle out of holding such a
vote or to put it on the back burner indefinitely if he doesn't
think he can win. The move is likely to continue a long-term
climate of political uncertainty.
	   ``There will not be a lost referendum as long as I'm leader of
this party,'' Bouchard told a news conference after a weekend
meeting with PQ members in Laval, north of Montreal.

 &UR; Suspensions meted out for parking scam
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ About 75 parking bylaw officers and another 10
administrators have been suspended by the city for involvement in a
parking scam that drew the ire of the public.
	   The suspensions conclude a four-month investigation where
so-called VIP stickers were found on the personal cars of some
Traffic Department officials and their families and Montreal
police.
	   The stickers tipped off parking officers that the cars should be
given special treatment and not ticketed.
	   The city said in a statement that investigators had gathered
sufficient proof, some of it on videotape, that the bylaw
enforcement officers didn't do their jobs in ticketing vehicles
that broke parking bylaws.
	   Administrators were disciplined for not stopping the fraud when
they were aware of it.

 &UR; More identities expected in Swissair investigation
	   HALIFAX (AP) _ The identities of more passengers on board
Swissair Flight 111 were expected to be confirmed today by Nova
Scotia's medical examiner.
	   Dr. John Butt was to return today to the job of trying to
identify more than 140 different DNA samples taken from passengers'
remains lying on the bottom of St. Margaret's Bay.
	   Ten identities had been confirmed as of Sunday, leaving a huge
job ahead in the attempt to identify the 229 people killed when
Flight 111 plowed into waters off Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia, on
Sept. 2.

 &UR; Union leader pessimistic as teachers' dispute drags on
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Thousands of students begin a third week sitting
out class today because their teachers don't have contracts, and
one union leader said he's pessimistic they'll see school days any
time soon.
	   The fact that four school boards have locked out teachers
suggests ``these things will carry on a lot longer,'' said Marshall
Jarvis, president of the Ontario English Catholic Teachers'
Association.
	   Catholic school boards in Toronto, Hamilton-Wentworth, Durham
region and Peterborough have locked out their high school teachers.
Catholic high school teachers are on strike in Dufferin-Peel. No
talks took place during the weekend. -__

Boxing: Harrison knocks out Mauritian to cap English dominance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIJAY JOSHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Audley Harrison was mad.
	   Just minutes before his fight, the judges had ordered him to
wear new gloves and they were too tight.
	   So Harrison vented his anger in the ring _ a powerful left
straight that floored his opponent, Michael Macaque of Mauritius
just 65 seconds into the fight. The super heavyweight title at the
Commonwealth Games was Harrison's and he wasn't angry any more.
	   The big Englishman's first round victory capped a day of
spectacular success for England's boxers: four gold medals from
four finalists. Two bronzes came earlier from the semifinals.
	   Harrison, the reigning Amateur Boxing Association champion, had
worn personal gloves during his past fights. But just before the
final fight he was made to wear a pair provided by officials. He
said the gloves crimped his large hands and prevented him from
making a fist properly.
	   ``That really got me more angry ... but it worked to my
advantage because I went looking for it with bad intentions,'' said
the London-born boxer whose parents migrated from Jamaica.
	   While Macaque was still on his fours unable to rise, the
190-centimeter (6-foot-3), 114-kilogram (251-pound) Harrison had
draped himself in England's flag and had taken off his headgear to
reveal close-cropped hair dyed with golden stripes.
	   ``I am happy that it is over. He (Macaque) is O.K. I am O.K. We
are having a party tonight,'' Harrison, 26, later told reporters as
the public address system played the song ``Top of the World.''
	   He said his next goal is to win the qualifying tournaments for
Sydney 2000 Olympics and the World Championships in the Philippines
next November.
	   After that it will be time to turn professional.
	   Harrison sees no hurdles in his path.
	   ``I would like to stay around and do the Olympics. I will win an
Olympic gold without a doubt. If I turn professional, I will win
the world title without a doubt,'' he said. He also declared
himself the best super heavyweight fighter England has produced.
	   For now he wants to raise the profile of amateur boxing in
England. He said he has received several sponsorship offers
already.
	   ``But I am not in boxing for money because I know money is gonna
come with it. I am in it for fame and glory. I want to be a
household name,'' he said.
	   The Harrison-Macaque fight provided a perfect end to the boxing
program after convincing victories by the other Englishmen in three
consecutive finals.
	   It was England's best Commonwealth boxing performance after the
five golds won in Edinburgh in 1986 and national coach Ian Irwin
said the result was a windfall.
	   ``I said we would win six medals. But I didn't expect four
golds,'' he said.
	   Middleweight John Pearce said he fought for the gold for his
2-year-old daughter Jade. ``She will have a little romp around the
garden with it,'' he said.
	   Light-middleweight Chris Bessey, a Portsmouth soldier, was
cheered by his father Chris on his way to a 20-15 victory over
Canadian schoolteacher Scott MacIntosh.
	   Courtney Fry beat Canadian Troy Amos Ross 29-21 in the
light-heavyweight final.

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Kordell Stewart passed for just 82 yards with three
interceptions, including Zach Thomas' 17-yard touchdown return, and
Miami's defense outscored Pittsburgh in a 21-0 victory Sunday.
	   Miami managed just 219 yards, including 113 by Dan Marino, but a
group of young, swarming defenders carried the Dolphins to victory
for the second week in a row. Stewart completed just 11 of 35
passes and was intercepted twice by Sam Madison.
	   Heavy rain beginning in the third period turned the baseball
infield into a muddy quagmire, which compounded the Steelers'
offensive woes. Miami improved to 3-0, and Pittsburgh fell to 2-1.
 &UR; Vikings 29, Lions 6 &QC; 
	   In Minneapolis, the Minnesota Vikings held Barry Sanders to 12
yards on 13 carries after halftime and forced three turnovers,
including two by rookie quarterback Charlie Batch.
	   Gary Anderson kicked five field goals for the Vikings, whose
offense sputtered near the end zone with Randall Cunningham
replacing injured Brad Johnson at quarterback.
	   Still, Cunningham threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to Randy Moss in
the third quarter and Leroy Hoard scored on an 11-yard run early in
the fourth quarter after Batch fumbled deep in his own end. That
allowed the Vikings (3-0) to beat Detroit (0-3) for the first time
since 1996.
 &UR; Packers 13, Bengals 6 &QC; 
	   In Cincinnati, Green Bay's defense shut down Neil O'Donnell and
Corey Dillon.
	   O'Donnell, who came into the game with a league-best 72 percent
completion rate, completed only 16 of 30 passes for 151 yards and
was sacked three times. Dillon, last year's AFC offensive rookie of
the year, gained only 28 yards on 16 carries for Cincinnati (1-2).
	   The Packers improved to 3-0 for the second time in three years
even though their offense struggled without a consistent running
game. Brett Favre threw a touchdown pass, extending his streak to
17 consecutive games with at least one, and Ryan Longwell remained
perfect in six field goal attempts this season, hitting from 30 and
35 yards.
 &UR; Jets 44, Colts 6 &QC; 
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Vinny Testaverde threw four TD
passes, Leon Johnson scored three times and Curtis Martin rushed
for 144 yards to give the New York Jets their first victory of the
season.
	   Johnson scored on an 82-yard pass play, a 16-yard run and a
1-yard dive as the Jets (1-2) rushed for 302 yards, second most in
team history. Testaverde took advantage of his chance to start for
injured Glenn Foley with the second four-TD game of his career.
	   Indianapolis quarterback Peyton Manning, the league's top
overall draft pick, completed 20 of 44 passes for 193 yards and was
intercepted twice as the Colts fell to 0-3.
 &UR; Chiefs 23, Chargers 7
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Ryan Leaf, hospitalized earlier in the
week with flu symptoms, committed five turnovers in his first seven
possessions and completed only one of 15 passes for four yards as
San Diego was routed by Kansas City.
	   Leaf, the first rookie quarterback since John Elway in 1983 to
start his career 2-0, had three fumbles and two interceptions on a
rainy and chilly day. All but three of Kansas City's points
followed turnovers, but the Chiefs (2-1) had problems of their own
on the slippery field and committed a team-record 15 penalties.
	   On their first three possessions, the Chiefs got field goals of
35, 31 and 33 yards from Pete Stoyanovich, who became the 25th NFL
player to score more than 1,000 points. They went ahead 23-0 early
in the second half after the Chargers fumbled on a punt return and
then committed a 36-yard pass interference penalty.
 &UR; Patriots 27, Oilers 16 &QC; 
	   In Foxboro, Massachusetts, the New England Patriots scored two
touchdowns in 18 seconds late in the game.
	   Terry Glenn scored on a 51-yard pass play from Drew Bledsoe with
4:25 left and Lawyer Milloy returned an interception 30 yards for a
touchdown three plays later for the Patriots (2-1).
	   Eddie George, who matched his career-low with 11 yards rushing
in a loss to San Diego last week, gained 100 yards on 23 carries
for the Oilers (1-2).
 &UR; Rams 34, Bills 33 &QC; 
	   In Orchard Park, New York, Tony Banks, stopped less than a yard
short of the end zone on the final play against Minnesota last
week, scored on a 2-yard run with 11 seconds left to give St. Louis
a victory over Buffalo.
	   Trailing 33-28, the Rams began the winning drive on their own 20
with 3:57 left. After they moved down the field with a 34-yard
completion to Ricky Proehl and a 14-yard shuffle pass to Amp Lee,
Banks ran in for the go-ahead touchdown.
	   The Rams (1-2) then went for the 2-point conversion, but the run
failed. St. Louis trailed 28-10 in the third quarter before a pair
of turnovers by Buffalo (0-3) allowed the Rams to make a comeback.
 &UR; Seahawks 24, Redskins 14 &QC; 
	   In Seattle, Steve Broussard ran back the opening kickoff 90
yards for a touchdown and Seattle improved to 3-0, the Seahawks'
best start since 1986.
	   Ricky Watters had his second straight 100-yard rushing game and
scored his first touchdown for the Seahawks, who also got Warren
Moon's sixth TD pass of the season.
	   Trent Green passed for 383 yards and two touchdowns for the
Redskins (0-3), who are off to their worst start since 1981.
	   Watters ran 24 times for 146 yards and one touchdown, while Moon
was 16-for-33 for 141 yards and one touchdown with no
interceptions.
 &UR; Bucs 27, Bears 15 &QC; 
	   In Tampa, Florida, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers opened Raymond James
Stadium with a victory, scoring on four straight possessions after
halftime to erase a 15-point deficit.
	   Trent Dilfer threw touchdown passes of 13 yards to Reidel
Anthony and 44 yards to Dave Moore. Then Warrick Dunn broke two
tackles to score on a 43-yard run to give the Bucs (1-2) their
first lead of the season.
	   Mike Alstott's 2-yard TD run with just over five minutes to play
made it 27-15, capping a remarkable turnaround from a sloppy first
half in which Tampa Bay was outgained 217 yards to 63.
	   Chicago (0-3) scored on Glyn Milburn's 93-yard punt return and
Jeff Jaeger's field goals of 26 and 52 yards before being held to
37 yards total offense in the second half.
 &UR; Broncos 34, Raiders 17 &QC; 
	   In Oakland, California, Ray Crockett and Bill Romanowski
combined for three interceptions that led to scores as Denver
remained unbeaten.
	   The Raiders (1-2) seemingly had the Broncos (3-0) on the ropes
but were hurt by their penchant for penalties and critical mistakes
by Jeff George, who was intercepted twice by Crockett and once by
Romanowski after John Elway aggravated a hamstring injury and left
the game in the second quarter.
	   Crockett returned his second interception 80 yards for a
touchdown with 4:29 remaining to kill the Raiders' comeback
attempt.
	   After replacing Elway, Bubby Brister's first pass was
intercepted by Eric Turner and returned 94 yards for a TD. But
Brister came back to throw two TD passes for the Broncos.
 &UR; Jaguars 24, Ravens 10 &QC; 
	   In Jacksonville, Florida, Fred Taylor, who came off the bench to
replaced an injured James Stewart, rushed for 128 yards and a
touchdown and made nine catches for 85 yards to lead Jacksonville
over Baltimore.
	   Mark Brunell, who struggled through two mediocre games to open
the season, threw for 376 yards and two touchdowns as the Jaguars
(3-0) improved to 5-0 against the Ravens (1-2).
	   Jacksonville took a 17-10 lead early in the third quarter when
Brunell hit Jimmy Smith for a 72-yard touchdown.

<TEXT>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ Cal Ripken's incredible major league record
streak of starting in 2,632 consecutive games since May 30, 1982,
is over, and he was not expected to play in the game.
	   The Baltimore Orioles third baseman pulled himself from the
starting lineup Sunday night against the New York Yankees, telling
manager Ray Miller, ``I think the time is right.''
	   A source in the Orioles organization said Ripken would not play,
which would end his streak of appearing in 2,632 straight games.
Ripken, through the Orioles, said he was not hurt.
	   He walked into Miller's office before the game and asked to have
his name removed from the lineup. Rookie Ryan Minor started in his
place.
	   One out into the game, when it became evident that Ripken would
not be playing, all of the Yankees walked to the top step of the
dugout, stood and applauded.
	   Ripken emerged from the Orioles dugout, tipped his hat toward
crowd and the Yankees and stepped back down to the bench.

	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ Mark McGwire's home run total might need an
asterisk, after all.
	   McGwire hit No. 65 to extend his record, then had an apparent
No. 66 taken away by an umpire's ruling in the St. Louis Cardinals'
11-6 victory Sunday over the Milwaukee Brewers.
	   ``After further review, it looked like it was a home run,''
McGwire said. ``The man who caught the ball, he never came across
the yellow line.''
	   Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said the club is appealing to
the National League to make the unprecedented move of reversing
second-base umpire Bob Davidson's call and awarding the homer.
	   NL spokeswoman Katy Feeney said a ruling was expected Monday.
	   Rule 9.02 (a) of the Official Baseball Rules states: ``Any
umpire's decision which involves judgment, such as, but not limited
to, whether a batted ball is fair or foul, whether a pitch is a
strike or a ball, or whether a runner is safe or out, is final.''
	   The fan, Michael Chapes, a 31-year-old high school gym teacher
from Waterford, Wis., was ejected from the stadium and fined $518
for trespassing.
	   After catching the ball with his glove, Chapes was swarmed by
the crush of fans, but he insisted he was doubled over a chain-link
fence behind the railing, not in front of it as the umpire ruled.
TV replays were inconclusive.
	   McGwire moved two homers ahead of Sosa with a first-inning shot
off Scott Karl (9-11) that needed no judgment call.
	   McGwire went 3-for-4 with a walk. Needing a triple to hit for
the cycle _ his last triple came in 1988 _ he struck out in the
seventh inning and walked in the ninth.
	   Karl also gave up homers to Pat Kelly, Ron Gant and pitcher
Manny Aybar (6-6) before leaving the game after three innings
trailing 6-0.
 &UR; Reds 7, Cubs 3
	   In Chicago, Sammy Sosa's home run stroke disappeared for the
fourth straight game, and the Chicago Cubs' spot atop the wild-card
race vanished as well.
	   Not that homers weren't flying out of Wrigley Field.
Cincinnati's Bret Boone hit three of them _ the final one disputed
_ as the Reds beat the Cubs, spoiling ``Sammy Sosa Celebration''
day.
	   Sosa went 0-for-5 and is now in an 0-for-17 skid that has
included six strikeouts.
	   He hasn't homered since hitting a grand slam last Wednesday
against San Diego and is stuck on 63. That's two behind Mark
McGwire, who hit No. 65 Sunday against the Brewers in Milwaukee.
	   The Cubs were doubly disappointed _ no homers from Sosa after
the pregame bash honoring him and a frustrating third straight loss
to the Reds that knocked them a game behind the Mets for the
wild-card spot with just five games remaining.
	   Boone hit a solo homer in the fourth, a three-run shot in the
fifth and a controversial two-run drive in the eighth that the Cubs
argued was to the foul side of the left-field pole. Boone now has
23 homers for the season.
	   After Boone's third homer, off reliever Chris Haney, put the
Reds up 7-2, fans littered the field with debris to dispute
third-base umpire Harry Wendlestedt's call. Cubs manager Jim
Riggleman was ejected after vigorously arguing, and TV replays were
inconclusive
	   Kevin Tapani (19-8) allowed nine hits and five runs in 4 2-3
innings. Pete Harnisch (13-7) won for the fifth time in six
decisions.
 &UR; Mets 5, Marlins 0
	   In New York, John Olerud homered and doubled, giving him a team
record-tying nine straight hits, and Al Leiter pitched the New York
Mets past Florida 5-0 for a one-game lead in the NL wild-card race.
	   The Mets moved ahead of the Chicago Cubs, who played later at
home against Cincinnati.
	   Leiter (17-5) won his fifth straight decision and set a career
high for victories. He allowed five hits and struck out nine in
eight innings.
	   Olerud went 2-for-2 and walked twice. He is hitting .354, one
point behind Colorado's Larry Walker, and is trying to become the
first player this century to win batting titles in both leagues.
	   Olerud, who hit a two-run homer in the third inning, matched the
Mets record with his ninth straight hit, a record set by Jose
Vizcaino in 1996.
	   With a walk in the seventh, Olerud reached base for the 14th
straight time. He has made only one out in his last 22 plate
appearances, excluding a sacrifice fly.
	   Brian Meadows (10-13) is 0-4 in his last six starts.
 &UR; Astros 2, Pirates 0
	   In Pittsburgh, Richard Hidalgo had his second two-homer game
against Pittsburgh in three weeks and Shane Reynolds pitched seven
shutout innings to lead the Houston Astros over the Pirates.
	   The win was the 99th of the season for the NL Central champion
Astros. Houston needs one win in its final five games for its first
100-win season since beginning play in 1962.
	   Reynolds (19-8) gave up 10 hits but stranded eight runners to
move within one victory of his first 20-win season.
	   Hidalgo hit a one-out solo shot in the first off Jason Schmidt
(11-13), then followed with an even longer solo homer into the
center-field seats off Schmidt in the third.
	   Jay Powell pitched a scoreless eighth and Billy Wagner finished
up for his 30th save.
 &UR; Dodgers 1, Giants 0
	   In San Francisco, Carlos Perez threw a four-hitter to win a
pitching duel against Shawn Estes as the Los Angeles Dodgers beat
San Francisco, dropping the Giants another game back in the NL
wild-card race.
	   The Giants, who had a three-game winning streak snapped, fell
four games behind the New York Mets in the wild-card chase.
	   Perez (11-13), who threw his fourth straight complete game,
struck out eight and walked three. Shawn Estes (7-12) took the
loss.
 &UR; Braves 10, Diamondbacks 0
	   In Phoenix, Bruce Chen pitched seven shutout innings in his
third major league start and the Atlanta Braves blanked the Arizona
Diamondbacks for the third time in four games.
	   The 21-year-old left-hander gave up three hits, struck out five
and walked two. He also squeezed home a run.
	   Andres Galarraga continued his history of pounding Amaury
Telemaco (6-10), going 2-for-2 with a triple, double and a
sacrifice fly against the Arizona starter. Galarraga is 6-for-13
(.461) with three homers lifetime against Telemaco.
	   Chen, moved into the late-season rotation because the Braves
plan to use Kevin Millwood in the bullpen in the playoffs, is 2-0
since being called up from Triple-A Richmond on Sept. 1.
 &UR; Rockies 1, Padres 0
	   In San Diego, Darryl Hamilton's RBI single in the 11th inning
made a winner of Darryl Kile and gave the Colorado Rockies a
victory over the San Diego Padres.
	   Kile (13-16) allowed just three hits in 10 scoreless innings in
outlasting Kevin Brown just enough to get the win. Brown allowed
four hits in nine shutout innings.
	   Kile won for the sixth time in his last eight decisions. He
struck out seven and walked two. Dave Veres pitched the 11th for
his seventh save.
	   Colorado's Larry Walker, who didn't start because of a sore
lower back, hit a one-out double off Randy Myers (1-2). Hamilton
singled to center and Steve Finley's throw home was up the
third-base line.
 &UR; Phillies 6, Expos 3
	   In Philadelphia, Paul Byrd pitched 6 1-3 strong innings and
Wendell Magee Jr. hit a key two-run single as the Philadelphia
Phillies defeated the Montreal Expos.
	   Byrd (5-2) tied a season high with seven strikeouts in his third
straight win. He retired the first 10 Montreal batters and gave up
five hits.
	   McGee's single off Dustin Hermanson (14-11) put the Phillies
ahead 3-2 in the sixth.
	   Ricky Bottalico pitched the ninth for his fourth save.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The Social Democrats, who built
Sweden's welfare state and then forced it to deteriorate, now have
a chance to make good on their promise to rebuild it.
	   The party came through Sunday's national elections with their
worst performance ever _ just 36.6 percent of the votes _ but with
conservative parties apparently unable to budge them from power.
	   The four non-socialist parties ended up with a total of 169
seats in the 349-seat Riksdag parliament: far more than the Social
Democrats' 131, but short of a majority.
	   The Social Democrats' strength lies in the seats won by two
other parties, the Left Party and the Greens. Together, the three
parties would have 190 seats.
	   But it's not a combination that makes the Social Democrats
comfortable. The Social Democrats say the other two parties'
policies are unrealistic, and the Left and the Greens adamantly
oppose Sweden's possible participation in the European Union's
single-currency system which the Social Democrats have supported in
theory if not in action.
	   ``This is not a good situation'' said Ingela Thalen, a top party
official, as voting results rolled in.
	   When they regained power in 1994, the Social Democrats embarked
on an austerity program of cutting funding to Sweden's cherished
cradle-to-grave social services in order to extract the country
from an enormous debt.
	   The measures paid off in restoring balance to public finances,
including a predicted small budget surplus this year; in a
virtually undetectable inflation rate and in reducing unemployment,
although it is still high at 7.3 percent.
	   But the measures also left Swedes watching medical and other
services decline even as they continued to pay the world's highest
taxes.
	   The austerity clearly cost the Social Democrats votes. While
their support declined from the 45 percent the party got in 1994,
the ex-Communist Left Party nearly doubled its total with 12
percent of the vote on promises of restoring the welfare state
while reducing the workweek.
	   Others may have gravitated to the other end of the political
spectrum, to the Christian Democrats who nearly tripled their
support with a platform emphasizing improved medical and elderly
care.
	   The Social Democrats have promised they can rebuild the welfare
state, but say it will never be what it was in the 1960s, when the
rest of the world looked admiringly at a country with full
employment and medical care that cost only nominal fees.
	   How they will do that is unclear, given the new balance of power
in the parliament.
	   ``It's too early to say which party we may cooperate with'' in
the budget process, Finance Minister Erik Aasbrink said late
Sunday.
	   It won't be with the Moderates, the main conservative party.
Moderates leader Carl Bildt, a former prime minister, ruled out any
parliamentary cooperation with the party.
	   ``The Social Democrats are entering both a parliamentary and a
political crisis,'' Bildt said.
	   Prime Minister Goeran Persson put on a sanguine face in public,
proclaiming to a party fete that ``We rule on!'' But he also said
he was cancelling a planned trip to New York on Monday in order to
analyze the election results.
	   Bildt had focused his campaign on characterizing the Social
Democrats as trying to hold on to a vision made obsolete by the
globalizing economy. Sweden's taxes stifle job-creation and doom
the country to marginality, he said.
	   But even Sweden's most market-oriented major politician could
not buck the system in a big way: Bildt's proposal for cutting
taxes would have reduced them to 50 percent of gross domestic
product _ still one of the world's highest tax burdens.

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Known on film for zinging the bad guys,
Jackie Chan has a soft spot in his heart for animals.
	   The Hong Kong action star is asking the Taiwanese legislature to
pass the nation's first animal protection law, one that would ban
the killing of stray dogs.
	   ``I was saddened to learn recently that dogs in Taiwan are being
killed cruelly by poisoning, electrocution and starvation. This
treatment of dogs goes against everything that an advanced, human
nation like Taiwan represents,'' Chan wrote in a Sept. 16 letter to
Secretary General Liu Pi-Liang.
	   Chan, who stars in the new movie ``Rush Hour,'' is very famous
in Hong Kong and Japan.
	   He made the appeal on behalf of the group People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals, which says there are some 2 million stray
dogs on the streets of Taiwan. Dogs are popular pets on the island,
but there is no registration system and they are frequently
abandoned.

	   LONDON (AP) _ One of Helen Mirren's pivotal co-stars in the
Royal National Theater's new staging of Shakespeare's ``Antony and
Cleopatra'' will get his chance in the spotlight after all.
	   Cedric the snake slithered off two weeks ago, rather than
participate in the climactic scene in which Mirren commits suicide
by pressing a snake to her bosom to administer a fatal bite.
	   But the Californian King snake _ said to be quite convincing as
an Egyptian asp _ made a surprise reappearance on Saturday when it
was caught sliding across the floor of the theater's costume room.
	   Now Cedric is back in his box in the theater's offices, ready
for the play's opening, a theater spokesman said Sunday.
	   ``Anthony and Cleopatra,'' which also stars Alan Rickman, opens
on Oct. 20.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Midfielder Stefan Effenberg, hailed as a
savior one month ago, deepened the German soccer crisis with the
surprise announcement he wants to quit the troubled national team.
	   The Bayern Munich player had been called back to international
duty after a wave of soul-searching swept the country following the
recent World Cup. The three-time world-champions lost in the
quarterfinals for the second straight time in France.
	   ``We've fallen way behind Holland, France and Spain. We're out
of step. If we don't watch out, we'll be on the same level as
Albania,'' warned German soccer legend Franz Beckenbauer on ARD
television.
	   Effenberg, kicked off the squad at the 1994 World Cup for making
an obscene gesture at a spectator, was supposed to play a key role
in the team's rebuilding effort.
	   Effenberg is one of the country's few creative playmakers and
creativity was among the missing ingredients when Germany was
shocked 3-0 by Croatia in France.
	   Effenberg told new national team coach Erich Ribbeck on Saturday
that he may want to quit again to concentrate on Bayern Munich and
spent time with his family.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _Talk about a crowd pleaser.
	   When country music star Garth Brooks' Oct. 6 show sold out
Saturday in 11 minutes, he wound up scheduling eight other shows to
accommodate all his fans.
	   ``Garth wants to play to everyone he can,'' said Caryn Fine,
spokeswoman for the Target Center, where Brooks will be performing.
	   When hundreds of people lined up outside the center Saturday,
organizers kept adding concerts until everyone had tickets. To
prevent fans from camping out, they handed out wristbands that
people could redeem for tickets.
	   A total of 159,000 people bought tickets for the nine shows,
which will run from Oct. 6-14.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   SEATTLE (AP) _ Amazon.com has a video hit on its hands even
before the online bookstore _ or its customers _ know what's on the
tape.
	   On Saturday, the Seattle-based company began taking advance
orders for a home-video version of President Bill Clinton's grand
jury testimony. By Sunday afternoon, the dlrs 9.95 videotape had
climbed to the top of the company's bestseller list, which is
updated hourly and posted on the Internet.
	   Amazon.com spokesman Bill Curry said production of the tape will
begin as soon as the president's testimony is made public Monday.
Copies should begin shipping by week's end, he said.
	   Curry declined to give out sales figures for the videotape,
which bumped Stephen King's new book, ``Bag of Bones,'' into the
second slot on Amazon.com's list.
	   Two other Clinton-related titles were among those listed as the
company's top five sellers. In third place was Kenneth Starr's
report on the Clinton-Monica Lewinsky affair, and in fifth was
``Death of Outrage: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American
Ideals'' by William J. Bennett.

	   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) _ Families huddled in basements and
businesses barricaded their entrances with sandbags as Hurricane
Georges began lashing the easternmost islands of the Caribbean.
	   Winds were gusting to 50 mph (80 kph) in Antigua Sunday evening,
with forecasters predicting the arrival of the hurricane's full 125
mph (200 kph) fury by late Sunday night.
	   Georges' winds had weakened from 150 mph (240 kph) earlier
Sunday, but government officials warned it could still cause the
worst damage in decades. Residents on Guadeloupe and Dominica,
fearing the hurricane would peel roofs off homes, moved beds into
their basements or headed to hurricane shelters set up in schools.
	   Church congregations on many of the islands cut Sunday services
short in order to convert their sanctuaries into shelters.
	   ``We expect a full house tonight,'' said Priscilla Nicholas, a
volunteer at the Seventh Day Adventist church in Cedar Grove,
Antigua.
	   At 8 p.m. (2400 GMT), Georges' center was near 16.7 degrees
north, 60.6 degrees west, or about 85 miles (135 kilometers)
east-southeast of Antigua. It had slowed slightly from Saturday to
16 mph (26 kph) and was forecast to sweep west-northwest through
the Lesser Antilles, threatening Puerto Rico and the British and
U.S. Virgin Islands on Monday.
	   The National Hurricane Center in Miami announced a hurricane
watch for the Dominican Republic Sunday evening.
	   Twenty-foot (6-meter) waves were forecast for the waters nearest
to the eye.
	   In Guadeloupe, raging seas flooded roads in the northern towns
of Anse-Bertrand and Campeche and forced residents living near the
beach to head for shelter inland.
	   Emergency management officials moved through the shelters in
Antigua, handing out kits of flashlights, mosquito coils, water and
toilet paper.
	   Officials in Dominica shut off water service at noon, saying
silt caused by heavy rains was overloading treatment plants.
Emergency workers compared the storm to 1979's Hurricane David,
which devastated banana farms, the island's biggest employers.
	   Farther west, residents in Puerto Rico rushed to stores for
plywood, water and canned food. Many stores reported they were sold
out of ice, as residents prepared for power outages.
	   ``Hurricanes come every year here, but this one looks like it's
serious,'' said Jose Firpi as he boarded up windows in his San Juan
home.
	   Gov. Pedro Rossello announced a ban on liquor sales beginning
Sunday night, activated the island's national guard and ordered
officials to begin preparing more than 300 shelters. He also
suspended a small-business protection law that limits sales of
``non-essential'' household items on Sundays.
	   ``This hurricane has the characteristics of being the strongest
that we have confronted in Puerto Rico in decades,'' Rossello said.
He said the hurricane could bring ``havoc and difficulties for our
people.''
	   Georges is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale,
meaning it is comparable to Hurricane Andrew, which tore through
parts of southern Florida in 1992, or 1989's Hurricane Hugo, which
spread destruction throughout the Caribbean.
	   The Hurricane Center said storm surge flooding of five to 10
feet (1.5 to 3 meters) above normal tide levels should be expected
in islands within an 85-mile (140-kilometer) radius of the eye,
along with five to eight inches (13 to 20 centimeters) of rain,
with heavier rainfall possible in some areas.

Cambodia all-party talks may ease tensions, but just for a while
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's contending political
parties may have set aside some of their differences to try to curb
mounting violence, but long-term stability appears to be as far
away as genuine democracy.
	   Talks to be held Tuesday among rival party leaders will mark the
first face-to-face meeting between strongman Hun Sen and top
opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh since Hun Sen ousted
Ranariddh as his co-premier in a coup d'etat in July last year.
	   Also attending the royal-hosted talks in the northwestern city
of Siem Reap will be junior opposition leader Sam Rainsy, a
firebrand whose arrest Hun Sen had called for just two weeks ago.
	   All sides agreed to the talks to ease tensions after unrest in
the capital threatened to escalate when a violent police crackdown
on anti-government street demonstrations was met by continued
defiance. The protesters marched in support of the opposition's
contention that Hun Sen's party won July 26 parliamentary elections
through fraud.
	   Security forces killed at least four people and arrested and
injured dozens others.
	   The show of force was designed to shake the opposition's
determination to boycott the convening of parliament, which would
have effectively blocked the formation of a new government.
	   It worked. The rival parties agreed to a three-point plan for
all sides to cease demonstrations, hold the summit meeting and
attend parliament's opening session.
	   The summit meeting, however, will likely serve only as an
opportunity for the opposition to air its technical election
complaints. It is not clear whether the opposition is prepared to
enact any parliamentary business beyond a swearing-in of members
and election of officers.
	   ``I think this is just a few steps in the right direction, but
there is still a long way to go before Cambodia can enjoy
democracy,'' Sam Rainsy said Sunday. ``We cannot say for sure
whether the next few weeks or months will be peaceful, because I am
concerned that the ruling party will use force to oblige the
members of parliament to fulfill the ruling party's plan. And if we
oppose their plan we can be the victims of arrest, of
assassination.''
	   Hun Sen and the international community had hoped that the
elections would mark a fresh start for Cambodia, after last year's
coup earned international opprobrium and a severance of much-needed
foreign aid.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party, with sole control of the
state apparatus and the electronic media, emerged as expected the
winner, taking 64 of the 122 seats in the National Assembly.
	   But Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and the Sam Rainsy Party managed
to deny Hun Sen the two-thirds majority he needed to form a
government. Their charges of fraud were just a rallying point to
pressure Hun Sen.
	   ``It was entirely predictable that the July elections would not
bring peace or stability,'' David Ashley, a British scholar of
Cambodia, said in a recent e-mail interview.
	   ``The international community concentrated only on the
participation of all the political players, who had been trying to
kill each other only a few months before, hoping that electoral
competition would replace the military confrontation of two decades
and that a legitimate winner would emerge,'' said Ashley. ``This
meant that for all sides the stakes were too high. Victory would
bring power, legitimacy, impunity, wealth, patronage; defeat would
bring death, politically and _ quite probably _ actually.''
	   ``Ultimately, the only ways to bring peace to Cambodia would be
either for Hun Sen or his opponents to win out definitively _ which
may well require significant bloodshed along the way _ or for the
development of a democratic processes and environment in which
political interests can compete peacefully,'' said Ashley. ``The
latter is obviously the preferred solution but, regrettably,
nothing in Cambodia's past or present suggests it is happening.''
	   However, said another analyst, ``One achievement of the recent
street protests was to put the government on warning that that if
the negotiation breaks down they cannot discount the potential of
another demonstration.''
	   ``The demonstrations show that the people, in particular the
opposition parties, cannot be bullied anymore,'' said Kao Kim
Hourn, director of the independent Cambodian Institute for
Cooperation and Peace.
	   According to Ashley, the opposition's only gain from its recent
actions ``will have been if the experience of mass demonstrations
and the government's crackdown has led to a further mobilization of
popular opinion in Phnom Penh, which could be a basis for another
subsequent popular challenge to Hun Sen.''

Spain proves there's no substitute for experience

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA, Switzerland (AP) _ Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario and Conchita
Martinez proved there's no substitute for experience, overcoming a
stacked deck to collect Spain's fifth Fed Cup title Sunday.
	   Despite facing a hostile cowbell-clanging crowd, the world
number one, injuries and fatigue, the two battle-hardened Fed Cup
veterans were able to add the 1998 title to the ones they claimed
in 1991, 1993, 1994 and 1995.
	   ``We had everything against us: the home crowd, the court
surface, the World No. 1,'' said French Open champion
Sanchez-Vicario, who along with Martinez has led Spain to seven Fed
Cup finals in the last eight years. ``It makes the trophy worth
that much more.
	   ``We played one of the best teams and worked so hard to win.''
	   For the first time since 1991, the Fed Cup title was decided in
the doubles, the Spaniards breezing past Swiss teenagers world No.
1 Martina Hingis and Patty Schnyder 6-0, 6-2 in just 56 minutes,
sending 12,000 disappointed supporters silently into the night.
	   It was an unexpectedly speedy finish to a long day that had
started 10 hours earlier with the first of two gripping reverse
singles.
	   Hingis put Switzerland ahead 2-1 and into position to claim
their first ever Fed Cup title when she won a two set slugfest from
Sanchez-Vicario 7-6 (7-5), 6-3. But Martinez, playing most of a
three-hour-plus marathon hobbled by blisters, bravely battled
Schnyder to a 6-3, 2-6, 9-7 win, forcing the tie to a decisive
doubles.
	   While Martinez blossomed under the pressure, Schnyder, winner of
five tournament titles this season, showed none of the poise that
had helped lift her from 26th to number nine in the world rankings
this year.
	   Failing to convert a key match point against Martinez _ which
would have given Switzerland the title _ Schnyder was consumed with
guilt, collapsing in tears after helplessly watching a high lob
drop in behind her on the winning point.
	   ``I gave all I had,'' said Schnyder. ``I tried everything.
Martina won her matches but in the doubles we weren't able to
win.''
	   Swiss team captain Melanie Molitor, Hingis' mother, believed
Schnyder simply succumbed to the jitters.
	   ``I think Patty learned a lot this weekend,'' said Molitor.
``She was far too emotional in her first match and the doubles.
There was a lot of pressure on her here.''
	   Hingis, still just 17, displayed the same steely nerve as her
Spanish opponents but again the question of the Swiss star's
physical conditioning came into question after she required
courtside attendance for cramping muscles.
	   ``I was dead tired after my singles against Arantxa,'' said
Hingis, who called an injury break to have her legs massaged near
the end of the match. ``I was happy to end it quickly because my
legs were beginning to cramp and I couldn't jump on my left leg to
serve anymore.
	   ``Luckily I'm still young and I can recuperate quickly,
though.''
	   Hingis diverted attention from her physical form, citing fatigue
as a factor which played against Schnyder in their doubles match.
	   In smooth acceptance of their defeat, Hingis insisted it was ''
a great accomplishment for Switzerland just to reach the finals.''
	   Hingis' temperance may have something to do with her uncertain
future in Fed Cup competition.
	   Hingis earlier hinted this might be her last Fed Cup campaign,
the three weeks of competition difficult to cram into an already
lengthy season.
	   Following the Spanish victory, Hingis danced around the issue of
next year's nation's contest.
	   ``This was an unbelievable Fed Cup this year,'' said Hingis, the
key player in Switzerland's climb out of Fed Cup third division
three years ago to a berth in the world group final this year. ``We
got better and better each time.
	   ``Who knows what will happen next year? I haven't made up my
schedule for next season.''

<TEXT>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ The Streak is apparently over.
	   After 16 years and 2,632 consecutive games, Cal Ripken took
himself out of the Baltimore Orioles' starting lineup Sunday night
and was not expected to play _ ending the most amazing iron man
record in sports history.
	   ``I think the time is right,'' Ripken told manager Ray Miller.
	   The 38-year-old third baseman said he was not hurt. But with the
Orioles out of playoff contention and playing their final home game
of the season against the New York Yankees, Ripken decided to end
the string that began on May 30, 1982.
	   An Orioles source said Ripken, who had started every game during
his streak, was not planning to play Sunday night.
	   The end came during a magical season that has featured the
historic home run chase between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, a
perfect game by David Wells and the Yankees' pursuit of the AL
record for victories.
	   There had been recent talk that Ripken would volunteer to end
the streak, which broke Lou Gehrig's record of 2,130. Before the
game, he walked into Miller's office and asked to have his name
removed from the lineup. Rookie Ryan Minor started in his place.
	   One out into the game, when it became evident that Ripken would
not be playing, all of the Yankees walked to the top step of the
dugout, stood and applauded.
	   Ripken emerged from the Orioles dugout, tipped his hat toward
the Yankees and stepped back down to the bench. With the sellout
crowd standing and cheering, Ripken came out again and bowed to his
fans.
	   There was an immediate rush to the souvenir stands at Camden
Yards, with fans lining up to buy programs to the mark the historic
night.
	   Ripken was batting .273 with 14 home runs and 61 RBIs.

Virus outbreak threatens Australian chicken exports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Results of tests are expected to
confirm Monday whether birds at two western Sydney chicken farms
have a virulent strain of Newcastle disease that threatens poultry
exports.
	   Chief Veterinary officer Dick Jane said the disease did not
present a public health risk to poultry consumers.
	   An outbreak of the disease at Glenorie and Blacktown farms
forced the New South Wales state Agriculture to impose restrictions
on the movement of poultry in the metropolitan area Sunday.
	   Australia has been free of Newcastle disease in the virulent
form since the 1930s but any outbreak could seriously jeopardize
exports, an agriculture spokesman said.
	   A total of 1,200 chickens had died at the farms so far and
although the disease did not present a public health risk to
consumers of poultry, caged and show birds could be at risk, he
said.
	   Authorities had no idea how the disease got into the farm, but
it could be passed on by pigeons and wild birds or be spread
through the air.
	   A restricted area around the two affected properties prevents
the movement of birds, litter and manure out of the area. Movement
of birds within and through the restricted area will require a
permit.

Tokyo stock prices fall in early trading, dollar higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stock prices fell sharply in early trading
Monday, the first session since Japan's ruling and opposition
parties reached a compromise on crucial bank reform bills late last
week. The U.S. dollar rose against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 258.14 points,
or 1.85 percent, to 13,724.98 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Friday, the Nikkei closed up 123.98 points, or 0.89
percent.
	   The dollar bought 133.30 yen in early trading, up 1.20 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its New York level of 132.60
yen on Friday.
	   Traders said share prices started lower on a flurry of selling
by institutional investors as the agreement on key bills to
stabilize the banking system appeared to unravel over the weekend
as politicians resumed wrangling over key provisions.
	   On Friday, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's LDP bowed to opposition
demands, agreeing to nationalize the ailing Long-Term Credit Bank
of Japan instead of the ruling party's initial plan to use public
money to rescue it.
	   The bills are aimed at cleaning up about 76 trillion yen (dlrs
575 billion) in bad loans that have burdened the country's banking
system since the burst of the highly speculative ``bubble'' economy
in the early 1990s.
	   Shares at LTCB, one of the nation's largest banks, were at 21
yen (16 cents) in early trading, up 2 yen from Friday's finish. On
Friday, LTCB shares fell to an all-time low of 18 yen (14 cents)
before settling at 19 yen (14 cents).
	   The broader Tokyo Price Index of all issues listed on the
exchange's first section was up 15.59 points, or 1.45 percent, to
1,057.63. The TOPIX closed up 4.16 points, or 0.39 percent, on
Friday.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar moved higher against
the yen amid a belief that the ruling party will face difficulty in
revising the proposed bills following the compromise.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.700 percent from Friday's finish of 0.675 percent,
driving its price down to 115.31 yen from 115.51 yen.

Palaces, pork and presidential patronage thrive in Africa

<TEXT>
	   YAMOUSSOUKRO, Ivory Coast (AP) _ With the onset of the rainy
season, weeds are sprouting in the six-lane highway that spills out
of a West African forest and rolls into this strangely quiet
capital city.
	   Long gobs of cobwebs stick to uncleaned cornices inside the
city's cathedral _ the largest in the world. Grass grows waist-high
in the shadow of sprawling office buildings.
	   Yamoussoukro, a small town that exploded with development in the
1970s and '80s when President Felix Houphouet-Boigny decided to
turn his home village into the nation's capital, is withering.
	   Behind its garish, well-polished exterior _ the gargantuan
cathedral, the mirrored, marbled government buildings, the
high-rise hotel _ is a city that never really became more than one
man's monument to himself. Now the man is dead, and the city is
following.
	   ``This is a ghost city,'' said a restaurant owner whose business
has been cut drastically since the 1993 death of Houphouet-Boigny.
	   But in a tradition that stretches across much of Africa,
construction projects are now sweeping the home village of Ivory
Coast's current president, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) to the
east.
	   In Pepressou, a village so small it's not on most maps,
residents and construction workers say President Henri Konan Bedie
is building an enormous mansion for himself and smaller villas for
friends and family.
	   If architectural patronage is common throughout the world _ from
office buildings in the United States to opera houses in Europe _
it has become a hallmark of leadership in many African countries,
draining economies, siphoning aid dollars and leaving projects that
fade once the next ruler comes along.
	   But things have changed in recent years, and Bedie's buildings _
dwarfed by his predecessor's grandiosity _ reflect the shift.
	   These days, cuts in foreign aid, tighter lending controls,
domestic and international criticism and the changing nature of
African ``big man'' politics mean that where Houphouet-Boigny built
a city, Bedie is building some mansions.
	   The change isn't always welcome.
	   President Paul Biya of Cameroon, for example, is believed to
have grown very wealthy during his tenure, but some residents aim
their ire at his failure to build widely and spread the wealth.
	   ``You know President Ahidjo was better,'' a Cameroonian book
dealer said of Biya's predecessor. ``He ate rice with a fork so
some would drop and people could pick at the grains like chickens.
But Mr. Biya ... eats with a very deep spoon and nothing drops for
others.''
	   Still, if Bedie's construction reflects a shift in the scale of
presidential patronage, it also reflects its continued existence.
	   ``In Africa, pork barrel projects can run wild,'' said William
Reno, an Africa specialist at Florida International University.
	   Presidents, often bowing to kinship obligations by building in
their home regions, have built everything from houses to highways
to convention centers.
	   Mobutu Sese Seko did it in the former Zaire, building his
mansions in the isolated river town of Gbadolite. Sekou Toure did
it in Guinea, erecting 50 identical villas for visiting heads of
state who never showed up.
	   Strong institutional restraints on presidents are unknown across
large swaths of Africa and many rulers dole out money and power to
help keep their grip on authority. In such patronage systems, grand
projects can do more than feed egos and sybaritic tastes.
	   ``Building something like a huge cathedral in Yamoussoukro, or
Mobutu with his palaces, is very practical,'' said Reno. ``It says:
This is the guy who controls the purse strings ... so we better
make peace with him.''
	   Bedie, for his part, denies he is constructing a new city amid
the forests and farms of eastern Ivory Coast. He insists he is just
using his own money to spruce up his home village and the nearby
town of Daoukro so they are more presentable to visiting
dignitaries.
	   ``There is nothing pharaoh-like, extravagant or useless about
it,'' he said in a newspaper interview earlier this year after
political opponents lashed out at the construction.
	   But proving what he's doing is impossible. Private guards now
block the road into Pepressou; only trucks loaded with construction
material make it past the roadblock.
	   Questions and requests to continue down the road are met with
shrugs and denials there is a village beyond.
	   Nearby, though, in Daoukro, are signs of Bedie's plans.
	   He has built a mansion there, surrounded by a high wall and
watched by video cameras. He usurped a local park when his yard
needed expanding and soldiers of his Republican Guard live across
the street. Cabinet ministers' homes stand behind nearby walls.
There's a 50-room, four-star hotel on the edge of town, but it
remains all but empty except during the president's visits.
	   Few people are willing to talk about Bedie's projects. No one
wants to risk losing them.
	   ``This is Africa; people are poor. If you can get something, if
you can get away from poverty, you keep your mouth shut,'' said one
Daoukro construction worker who spoke on condition his name not be
used. ``I don't ask questions.''
	   Go to Yamoussoukro, though, and plenty of people will talk about
Houphouet-Boigny and his hometown dreams.
	   ``He was a great man,'' said Guy Peyronnard, a Frenchman who
oversees the late president's sprawling estate, a complex of
mansions and more mansions _ modernist re-creations of Versailles
that look like Las Vegas hotels filled with French and Italian
antiques.

	   Flush with the wealth of Ivory Coast's booming economy,
Houphouet-Boigny began developing the town in the 1960s. The
construction reached a crescendo two decades later, years after the
economy had stumbled.
	   An island of baronial development amid the tiny villages of
rural Ivory Coast, Yamoussoukro quickly sprouted the signs of a
bustling city. It became crowded with office buildings, highways
and a towering hotel. It's cathedral is an enormous _ if
artistically half-hearted _ imitation of St. Peter's in Rome.
	   But Yamoussoukro never became crowded with people. Legislators
and bureaucrats continued to do most of their work in Abidjan, the
Ivory Coast's main city.
	   Houphouet-Boigny made sure some business was done there,
however, and his visits brought small invasions of visitors. For a
few days the restaurants would be lively.
	   But when he died, his city was used less and less. These days,
it's beginning to fray around the edges. Potholes are multiplying.
Buildings aren't repaired as quickly. The highway needs cleaning.
	   ``The city isn't cared for like it was before he died,'' said
Octave Kouakou, who guides occasional tourists through the
cavernous halls of the Houphouet-Boigny Foundation for Peace.
	   ``It's not as clean; it's not as well looked-after. Before it
was Houphouet who kept the city going, but no one wants to pay for
the maintenance now,'' Kouakou said.
	   Then he walked away, preparing to show off yet another unused
meeting room, his footsteps echoing in the empty corridor.

Malaysia's Anwar faces court charges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with news grafs 1-9 with scene outside court, further
details. Changes byline.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's sacked deputy prime
minister faced charges of sexual misconduct Monday after riot
police raided his home and arrested him during a news conference.
	   About 100 reporters and TV crew members crowded around the
Sessions Court, hoping to see Anwar Ibrahim arriving under police
escort.
	   However, there was also speculation a magistrate would simply
notify Anwar of the charges during a hearing at the city's police
headquarters, where he was held overnight.
	   Hundreds of Anwar's allies shouted angrily, ``God is great!''
and ``Long live Anwar!'' shaking their fists as police led him away
from the house Sunday, where he had conducted almost two weeks of
protest rallies against the 17-year rule of Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   Most newspapers featured pictures of Anwar's arrest, while some
showed him clutching his wife as police closed in.
	   Police burst into Anwar's home almost at the same time riot
officers fired tear gas and water cannon at a crowd of several
thousand people who were marching toward Mahathir's official
residence. Many of them had come from a crowd of about 35,000 who
joined Anwar in the National Mosque and the capital's central
Merdeka (Freedom) Square, chanting for Mahathir's resignation
Sunday.
	   The tumult coincided with the visit of Queen Elizabeth II of
Britain and the closing of the Commonwealth Games, a sports
extravaganza bringing together athletes from the former British
Empire. Extra armed police were sent to guard the mansion where the
queen was staying.
	   Malaysia had hoped the royal visit and the Games would give a
much-needed publicity boost to this economically faltering nation,
but the political showdown has seized much of the world's
attention.
	   There was no mention of any change in the queen's busy program
on Monday, which included officiating over the Games' closing
ceremony and a meeting with the prime minister.
	   Several police helicopters swooped low over the capital, as part
of a hefty security force.
	   Newspapers have been carrying banner-headlined stories
containing explicit details of Anwar's alleged sodomy offenses.
Anwar's adopted brother and a friend allegedly confessed to the
crimes in a court hearing on Saturday. Both had been denied access
to their relatives or lawyers during their police detention.
	   Sodomy is a crime in this conservative Muslim country, and both
men were sentenced to six months in prison.
	   Anwar has vehemently denied the charges, saying they were cooked
up by Mahathir, who fears Anwar's growing popularity and any
challenge to his rule.
	   Anwar also charged that defendants had been tortured into
confessing they committed sodomy with him. Mahathir denied the
allegation.
	   Kuala Lumpur Police Chief Kamarudin Ali told the national news
agency Bernama late Sunday that Anwar was being detained to aid
police investigations into several crimes, including public
disturbance, illegal assembly, criminal use of force and rioting.
	   ``Police have taken action to restore order and the situation is
under control and has returned to normal,'' the police chief said.
	   Police had previously said they were investigating allegations
against Anwar of treason, sexual misconduct and abuse of power.
	   Anwar, once Mahathir's handpicked successor, is now his
principal foe. Mahathir, 72, became Asia's longest-serving leader
after Indonesia's Suharto was forced out in May after 32 years by
violent protests against alleged government corruption and a severe
economic crisis.
	   Helmeted special reserve police, armed with assault rifles,
parked jeeps in front of Anwar's house and blocked off roads in the
well-heeled neighborhood.
	   Also arrested was Roslan Kassim, a northern state youth-wing
leader from the ruling party, who was in the house during an Anwar
news conference. The police chief said he was arrested in
connection with the protest at Merdeka Square.

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS style of Liu Pi-liang and CLARIFIES Chan's status in
1st item. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Known on film for zinging the bad guys,
Jackie Chan has a soft spot in his heart for animals.
	   The Hong Kong action star is asking the Taiwanese legislature to
pass the island's first animal protection law, one that would ban
the killing of stray dogs.
	   ``I was saddened to learn recently that dogs in Taiwan are being
killed cruelly by poisoning, electrocution and starvation. This
treatment of dogs goes against everything that an advanced, human
nation like Taiwan represents,'' Chan wrote in a Sept. 16 letter to
Secretary General Liu Pi-liang.
	   Chan, who stars in the new movie ``Rush Hour,'' is one of Asia's
biggest movie stars and has recently gained recognition in the
United States.
	   He made the appeal on behalf of the group People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals, which says there are some 2 million stray
dogs on the streets of Taiwan. Dogs are popular pets on the island,
but there is no registration system and they are frequently
abandoned.

World Bank fears corruption threatens Indonesian humanitarian aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Corruption is threatening billions of
dollars worth of international humanitarian aid meant for
Indonesia's dramatically growing number of poor, a visiting World
Bank official has warned.
	   ``It is crucial to ensure that fund leakage in social safety net
programs is not tolerated,'' said visiting senior World Bank
official Katherine Marshall.
	   ``The government needs to treat this matter with the utmost
seriousness,'' newspapers Monday quoted her as saying.
	   Indonesia is enduring its worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   It estimates that about 40 percent of its 202 million people
have slipped below the poverty line. Many of them face dire food
shortages as the price of rice and other food soars.
	   The World Bank has help marshal about dlrs 14 billion in
international aid, including food and medicine, to help alleviate
the suffering.
	   Marshall, who completed an anti-corruption fact-finding mission
to Indonesia over the weekend, said the bank wanted tough measures
to protect the aid from corrupt local officials.
	   After talking with government officials and non-government
organizations she said the World Bank is ``persuaded that that
corruption is an obstacle to helping those hurt most by the
economic crisis.''
	   The World Bank has offered to assist Indonesia fight graft after
the bank was stung by allegations in an internal bank memorandum
that between 20 and 30 percent of its aid loans to the sprawling
Southeast Asian nation has been siphoned off by local officials.
	   The bank's representative in Indonesia, Dennis de Tray, has
disputed the figure, but admits that corruption has been a major
problem.
	   ``Now we need concrete action to demonstrate that the government
is delivering on its commitment to combat the cancer of
corruption,'' de Tray said in a statement.
	   ``Indonesia's fight against corruption is crucial to the
country's recovery from the crisis,'' he said.
	   But he also said the fight to end corruption would be a marathon
effort that could take generations.
	   The push to clean up how Indonesia is governed follows last
May's resignation of President Suharto who gave up 32 authoritarian
years in power after riots and protests.
	   His successor President B.J. Habibie has ordered an
investigation into corruption during the Suharto era.
	   Officials are to meet with Suharto soon over allegations that he
illegally amassed a fortune and stashed millions of dollars away in
foreign bank accounts before he quit.
	   Suharto, whose children built huge business empires when he was
in office, have denied any wrongdoing.

No more coups, says new Thai military chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's new army chief has stressed
that the era of military coups is over and vowed to focus on
helping the government and modernizing the armed forces, newspapers
said Monday.
	   Gen. Surayuth Julanont will take over the military's most
powerful post from retiring Gen. Chettha Thanajaro next month.
	   ``Coups have become a thing of the past. The army will now focus
on helping the government serve society,'' Surayuth was quoted as
saying Sunday.
	   Thailand was plagued by recurring coups by the military between
1932, when absolute monarchy was abolished, until 1992, when troops
gunned down pro-democracy demonstrators in the streets of Bangkok.
	   While still a powerful institution, the military has in recent
years kept a far lower profile and some of its privileges and
status have been eroded.
	   Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, who also serves as defense
minister, has attempted to reduce some of the military's once
freewheeling spending powers as well as some preferential legal
treatment afforded officers.
	   Surayuth, who is regarded as a straightforward professional,
said his priorities would be to try to modernize the army's
structure as well as to increase the welfare of junior soldiers.
	   ``But I have to admit that I am under pressure, since I am
receiving the post during the economic slump,'' he said.
	   He also promised he would only talk about military matters with
the media. In the past army commanders would frequently make highly
charged statements about politics and the civilian government.

	   The Clinton grand jury testimony, the Lewinsky testimony and the
rest of the 2,800 pages of Starr documents will be made public by
the House Judiciary Committee when the Clinton videotape is
released at approximately 9 a.m. (1300 GMT) Monday.
	   The Government Printing Office is printing the materials in
bound form.
	   Sometime after the printed transcripts are distributed _ how
much longer is not known _ we expect to get the materials
electronically.
	   Because of the volume, the full texts of the testimony and
documents will not move on regular news wires.
	   Instead, once they are in electronic form, we will provide the
full texts in ASCII and HTML formats at an ftp site. We have
arranged for an ftp server with additional capacity to handle the
expected demand. This means the files will not be at the same
address used to deliver the Starr report last week.
	   The address of the ftp server is texts.ap.org. The files will be
in a directory called testimony. To get the username and password,
you can call your local bureaus. There will also be a voice mail
message at 212-621-6234 with the details, or you can call the
international desk at 212-621-1644.
	   Again, this is not the server we used to deliver the OIC report.
Please do not connect to that server. The files will NOT be there.
	   Also, we set up this ftp site so that members can have access to
the full text of the testimony and other evidence. So please do not
make the address, username and password public. If the address
becomes public you may have trouble connecting to the ftp site.
	   We will advise you as soon as there is something available at
the site.
	   We will also post the full texts on the Web at
http://textsweb.ap.org/starrtext
	   Running excerpts will move on regular news wires. We cannot
estimate wordage until we see the documents. The excerpts will be
edited; much of the sexually graphic detail may be deleted and any
that remains will be carefully flagged.
	   The full transcripts on the ftp site will be unedited and will
move in the official form provided by the House Judiciary
Committee.
	   Edited video clips in RealVideo and QuickTime formats from the
videotape of President Bill Clinton's testimony will also be
available at the ftp site.
	   Additionally, we will post the text files and video excerpts on
The WIRE, the AP's public Web site that is displayed by newspaper
and broadcast sites around the world.
	   APTV, the AP's international video service that provides video
to 200 broadcasters in the United States and abroad, plans to carry
the video in full, unedited, as soon as it is made available.
	   Warnings about explicit language will be shown both on screen
and in APTV advisories before the tapes are played.

Virus outbreak threatens Australian chicken exports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Results of tests are expected to
confirm Monday whether birds at two western Sydney chicken farms
have a virulent strain of Newcastle disease that threatens poultry
exports.
	   Chief Veterinary officer Dick Jane said the disease did not
present a public health risk to poultry consumers.
	   An outbreak of the disease at Glenorie and Blacktown farms
forced the state of New South Wales to impose restrictions on the
movement of poultry in the metropolitan area Sunday.
	   Australia has been free of Newcastle disease in the virulent
form since the 1930s but any outbreak could seriously jeopardize
exports, an agriculture spokesman said.
	   A total of 1,200 chickens had died at the farms so far and
although the disease did not present a public health risk to
consumers of poultry, caged and show birds could be at risk, he
said.
	   Authorities had no idea how the disease got into the farm, but
it could be passed on by pigeons and wild birds or be spread
through the air.
	   A restricted area around the two affected properties prevents
the movement of birds, litter and manure out of the area. Movement
of birds within and through the restricted area will require a
permit.

Japan's trade surplus rises again in August
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with more figures, background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's trade surplus rose 24.7 percent last month
from a year ago as the nation's economic slowdown and a drop in
crude oil prices lessened imports, the government said Monday.
	   The trade surplus, a tally of goods exported minus imports
without adjustment for seasonal factors, rose to 896.7 billion yen
(dlrs 6.72 billion) from the same month last year, the Finance
Ministry said.
	   Japan's politically sensitive surplus with the United States
continued to climb, rising 28.4 percent to 431 billion yen (dlrs
3.23 billion). It was the 23nd straight month of increase.
	   The overall trade surplus has now risen for 17 months straight
compared to last year. Japan has come under increasing pressure to
revive its recession-plagued economy and help struggling Asian
nations by importing more from the region.
	   Japan's exports rose 2 percent to 4.0 trillion yen (dlrs 30
billion) in August and imports fell 3 percent to 3.1 trillion yen
(dlrs 23.3 billion), officials said.
	   Japan's exports to the United States rose 15.3 percent to 1.2
trillion yen (dlrs 9 billion); imports also rose, by 9.2 percent,
to 781.9 billion yen (dlrs 5.87 billion).
	   Exports to the United States were led by a 17 percent rise in
auto exports and a 175.3 percent jump in steel exports, they said.
A stronger dollar also helped push auto exports to the United
States higher, Tokyo said.
	   The dollar averaged 143.48 yen in August, up sharply from 117.12
yen a year ago.
	   Overall, exports were led by a 29.4 percent rise in engine
exports from a year earlier and a 16.4 percent rise in steel
exports.
	   Falling oil prices, which dropped 14.6 percent in August
compared with the previous year, also boosted the trade surplus for
Japan, which imports most of its oil.
	   The Finance Ministry, however, does not expect the trade surplus
to continue to grow sharply over the long run because of the
expansion of Japanese production overseas and government efforts to
stimulate the economy.

Clinton tops list of speakers, but Monica Lewinsky scandal could
</HEADLINE>
overshadow first day &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Speeches scheduled to begin at 1400 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; With US-Japan &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The official talk at this year's General
Assembly confab of world leaders is Kosovo, nuclear disarmament,
terrorism and the Asian financial crisis.
	   But in the halls of the United Nations on Monday, conversations
were expected to focus on Monica Lewinsky, and President Bill
Clinton's videotaped testimony in the scandal that was to be
released within hours of _ or possibly during _ his address.
	   Clinton's speech about the issues that should top the world's
agenda would be in stark contrast to what people familiar with the
tape say is his admission of having had ``inappropriate intimate
contact,'' with the former White House intern and his resistance to
answer further questions.
	   Clinton, though, will have plenty to distract him, speaking
before the world for 20 minutes on issues such as terrorism _ a key
element of his address because of the U.S. embassy bombings in
Africa _ and then hearing from his counterparts on what matters to
them.
	   And the first day of the General Assembly's annual general
debate, there will be quite a few issues.
	   Clinton arrived in New York on Sunday evening and held a nearly
one-hour meeting with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi at the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel where Clinton was staying until Tuesday. On
Tuesday he was to meet Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi in
Tarrytown, New York.
	   Clinton follows Brazil's Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia
on the list of speakers on the first day of the General Assembly's
annual general debate. He is to be followed by South African
President Nelson Mandela, British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami and Obuchi among others.
	   By the time the session ends next Friday, 26 heads of state, two
crown princes, one vice president and 152 other ministers will have
had the chance to address the world body.
	   Of particular note Monday on the sidelines of the debate will be
an eight-nation meeting on the tensions between the Taliban militia
that rules most of Afghanistan and Iran.
	   Later in the week, Africa tops the agenda of a major ministerial
conference on the tensions and problems on the continent.
	   A bilateral meeting between the prime ministers of India and
Pakistan was expected on Wednesday.
	   And next week, the Palestinians will speak to the assembly
audience for the first time, thanks to a vote this summer to
enhance their observer mission's status. The vote gave the
Palestinians many of the same rights as member-states to
participate in assembly matters, except for the right to vote.
	   PLO leader Yasser Arafat plans to use his speech try to gain
support for plans to declare a Palestinian state in May 1999,
Palestinian officials have said.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Officials on Monday are investigation
whether a Sydney ferry carrying 500 passengers struck a rock en
route from Manly to Circular Quay because it was diverted around an
Olympic yacht race.
	   The Sydney Harbor Regatta had forced the ferry Narrabeen to take
a wider course around the harbor on Sunday, when the accident
occurred, State Transit spokeswoman Susan North said.
	   ``It struck a rock, but no one was injured and the vessel got
back to the overseas terminal at Circular Quay okay,'' North said.
	   ``The passengers disembarked and we've been working on the boat
to see what sort of damage has been done.''
	   State Transit will conduct an internal inquiry after the New
South Wales Waterways Authority complete an investigation, she
said.

Georges begins whipping Caribbean islands

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Georges weakening from a category 4 to

	   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) _ Families huddled in basements and
businesses barricaded their entrances with sandbags as Hurricane
Georges began lashing the easternmost islands of the Caribbean.
	   Winds were gusting to 50 mph (80 kph) in Antigua Sunday evening,
with forecasters predicting the arrival of the hurricane's full 125
mph (200 kph) fury by late Sunday night.
	   Georges' winds had weakened from 150 mph (240 kph) earlier
Sunday, but government officials warned it could still cause the
worst damage in decades. Residents on Guadeloupe and Dominica,
fearing the hurricane would peel roofs off homes, moved beds into
their basements or headed to hurricane shelters set up in schools.
	   Church congregations on many of the islands cut Sunday services
short in order to convert their sanctuaries into shelters.
	   ``We expect a full house tonight,'' said Priscilla Nicholas, a
volunteer at the Seventh Day Adventist church in Cedar Grove,
Antigua.
	   At 8 p.m. (2400 GMT), Georges' center was near 16.7 degrees
north, 60.6 degrees west, or about 85 miles (135 kilometers)
east-southeast of Antigua. It had slowed slightly from Saturday to
16 mph (26 kph) and was forecast to sweep west-northwest through
the Lesser Antilles, threatening Puerto Rico and the British and
U.S. Virgin Islands on Monday.
	   The National Hurricane Center in Miami announced a hurricane
watch for the Dominican Republic Sunday evening.
	   Twenty-foot (6-meter) waves were forecast for the waters nearest
to the eye.
	   In Guadeloupe, raging seas flooded roads in the northern towns
of Anse-Bertrand and Campeche and forced residents living near the
beach to head for shelter inland.
	   Emergency management officials moved through the shelters in
Antigua, handing out kits of flashlights, mosquito coils, water and
toilet paper.
	   Officials in Dominica shut off water service at noon, saying
silt caused by heavy rains was overloading treatment plants.
Emergency workers compared the storm to 1979's Hurricane David,
which devastated banana farms, the island's biggest employers.
	   Farther west, residents in Puerto Rico rushed to stores for
plywood, water and canned food. Many stores reported they were sold
out of ice, as residents prepared for power outages.
	   ``Hurricanes come every year here, but this one looks like it's
serious,'' said Jose Firpi as he boarded up windows in his San Juan
home.
	   Gov. Pedro Rossello announced a ban on liquor sales beginning
Sunday night, activated the island's national guard and ordered
officials to begin preparing more than 300 shelters. He also
suspended a small-business protection law that limits sales of
``non-essential'' household items on Sundays.
	   ``This hurricane has the characteristics of being the strongest
that we have confronted in Puerto Rico in decades,'' Rossello said.
He said the hurricane could bring ``havoc and difficulties for our
people.''
	   Georges weakened from a category 4 to a category 3 hurricane on
the Saffir-Simpson scale, but forecasters warned it could gain
strength again.
	   The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency sent early response
teams, which include health care workers, engineers, firefighters
and other professionals, to the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico
ahead of the storm. The American Red Cross activated 1,000
volunteers and sent a 15-member crisis team from the United States.
	   The Hurricane Center said storm surge flooding of five to 10
feet (1.5 to 3 meters) above normal tide levels should be expected
in islands within an 85-mile (140-kilometer) radius of the eye,
along with five to eight inches (13 to 20 centimeters) of rain,
with heavier rainfall possible in some areas.

Amid Russia's turmoil, `blind town' struggles to carry on
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY310-314; AP Graphic RUSINOVO RUSSIA &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RUSINOVO, Russia (AP) _ At first glance, this small town seems a
typical product of Soviet urban design, with just a few hints of
its unique nature _ guide rails along the sidewalks, rubber treads
that serve as a road map on a factory floor, Braille on office
doors.
	   Rusinovo is better known as the ``city of the blind,'' because
about 300 of the 1,000 residents are without sight.
	   In a country that traditionally has provided little help to
people with disabilities, Rusinovo for decades offered the rare
promise of meaningful work and a full life for the blind. But now
it's all falling apart.
	   The settlement, about 65 miles (105 kilometers) south of Moscow,
dates to 1948, when the National Association of the Blind built a
factory and apartment buildings to assist Russians who lost their
sight to wounds and illnesses during World War II.
	   ``It was a good intention _ to create normal conditions for the
blind, both for life, and for work,'' said Viktor Kulikov, factory
director and effectively the man in charge of the town's affairs.
	   Over the past half-century, hundreds of blind people have
migrated to Rusinovo. But like so many places in Russia, the town
has been in sharp decline since the Soviet Union collapsed at the
end of 1991, and the government in Moscow lacks the resources to
help.
	   ``We have been left to our own devices,'' said Dmitry Terekhov,
who has lived in Rusinovo for nearly 50 of his 71 years. ``Pensions
are unpaid for two, three months. They have basically abandoned
us.''
	   In Soviet times, the Rusinovo factory assembled parts for the
country's Rubin television sets, but the plant folded several years
ago.
	   The factory switched to making lids for mayonnaise jars. An
average worker can put together 1,500 lids in a day, earning all of
3 rubles, or about 50 U.S. cents. Even those wages often go unpaid
for months.
	   In a sign that reflects the desultory state of the Russian
economy, a note in the factory hallway proclaims: ``The barter shop
can provide goods to the factory staff toward their wages for any
month except the current one.''
	   ``But they only give us junk there _ canned stuff,'' said Nina
Merkulova. ``We would also like to buy chocolate for our
grandchildren, but we never have any money at all.''
	   To pass the time, blind men and women sit around wooden tables,
playing chess in the shade of poplar trees in a small courtyard,
	   The players gently move their hands over the board to feel the
pieces, make a move, and call it out for others: ``Bishop, to E4.''
	   The guide railings and a few signs in Braille _ something not
found elsewhere in Russia _ are about all the special conveniences
that remain in Rusinovo.
	   No one has a seeing-eye dog _ a luxury that's far too expensive.
Disability pensions barely cover utility bills.
	   Still, staying in Rusinovo has attractions for its blind
residents.
	   ``When we are all together, it's easier for us, even in these
hard times,'' said Terekhov.
	   If nothing else, Rusinovo is familiar. A man walks briskly by,
unseeing eyes staring straight ahead, apparently guided by an
ingrained sense of his surroundings.
	   ``The blind have lots of their private landmarks _ a barrier, a
pot hole, a ditch,'' said Nikolai Poputnikov.
	   Now 60, Poputnikov lost his sight at age 4 due to complications
from measles during the war.
	   ``I remember some bright colors _ like red, or white _ those
that kind of stick in your memory,'' he said.
	   He no longer remembers the color of grass, but he does not need
a cane to find his way about and says he can ever ``hear'' air
drifting around him as he moves.
	   Kulikov, the factory director, hopes to revive Rusinovo's past,
and is brimming with ideas. He has written to Moscow Mayor Yuri
Luzhkov offering to supply plastic brooms _ another of the
factory's products _ for sweeping Red Square.
	   Meanwhile, the lack of jobs has prompted some of the blind to
beg. They take suburban trains into Moscow and hang out on street
corners and in subway stations, or rummage through garbage heaps
for scraps of food.
	   ``Even if I want to work very much, I can't apply myself,'' said
Erna Strekalova _ a university graduate in literature and one of
the few people in Rusinovo who have been to college.
	   Ms. Strekalova used to work as a local radio host, until the
station closed in January for lack of funds. Now she spends most of
her time reading Braille translations of Russian literary magazines
and helping her 13-year-old son, Maxim, with school work.
	   ``You can sit, grow cobwebs, and sink in the dirt in your dusty
room,'' Strekalova said. ``Or you can try to live. It is difficult.
And often it hurts.''

Caught in the cross hairs: Massachusetts' Burma Law under fire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LESLIE MILLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ A maverick lawmaker on the local scene will soon
find himself caught squarely in the cross hairs of much of the
world.
	   Byron Rushing, a Boston state representative, wrote a law in
1996 that forbids the state from contracting with companies that do
business with the military government of Burma, also known as
Myanmar.
	   This week, some of the biggest companies and most powerful
governments in the world will line up on both sides of the Atlantic
Ocean to try to rid Massachusetts of its Burma Law.
	   On Wednesday, the National Foreign Trade Council will argue for
striking down the law in U.S. District Court in Boston.
	   Coincidentally, on the day before, Japan and the European
Commission will file a request in Geneva for the World Trade
Organization to set up a formal dispute panel to challenge
Rushing's law.
	   It's the first time the World Trade Organization has challenged
a state law since the 1994 GATT treaty on international tariffs and
trade.
	   Legal experts say it's the first salvo in an international
battle to eliminate local laws that do everything from promoting
minority businesses to banning the purchase of products made from
tropical wood.
	   ``Our goal would be to get a decision that would stop these
state and local sanctions around the country,'' said Frank
Kittredge, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, a trade
group representing 550 major U.S. corporations.
	   The small New England state apparently made a tempting target
for opponents of such laws.
	   ``They thought this would be a relatively easy fight, to pick on
poor, defenseless Massachusetts,'' said Matt Porterfield, senior
fellow at the Harrison Institute for Public Law at Georgetown
University.
	   But the state plans a vigorous defense of its right to choose
its vendors.
	   ``They should have picked on poor, defenseless Berkeley,'' said
Porterfield. The California city was the first to pass a law
sanctioning companies doing business with Burma.
	   Massachusetts certainly has plenty of other company in the
freelance foreign policy arena _ both on the political left and on
the political right.
	   North Olmsted, Ohio, recently passed a law barring the purchase
by the city of goods manufactured under sweatshop conditions.
	   More than a dozen states ban investments in companies in
Northern Ireland that engage in religious discrimination.
	   A number of states planned to impose sanctions on Swiss banks
until last August, when Switzerland's two biggest commercial banks
agreed to pay dlrs 1.25 billion to settle Holocaust survivors'
claims against them.
	   Rushing wrote the Massachusetts Burma Law in response to Aung
Sun Suu Kyi, leader of Burma's pro-democracy party. She urged an
end to investment in Burma until the military regime _ which has
been accused of drug trafficking and widespread human rights
violations _ negotiates a peaceful transition to representative
government.
	   The NFTC will argue the Massachusetts Burma Law is
unconstitutional because it regulates foreign policy, which only
the federal government is empowered to do.
	   The group will not identify its members because they fear
consumer boycotts.
	   ``The sanctions have been damaging to U.S. companies for sure,
and U.S. workers, and they've lost jobs as a result of them,'' said
Kittredge. ``It would be hard to argue that they have, in this
case, changed the government of Burma.''
	   Several companies have stopped doing business in Burma because
of sanctions.
	   Rushing, for his part, hopes the publicity accompanying the
legal maneuverings shed light on human rights abuses in Burma.
	   ``We're not out to reform the WTO. Our job is to get people
focused on Burma,'' said Rushing.

Japanese stock prices hit new 12-year low, dollar higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday stock, late morning bond and currency
prices; ADDS quotes throughout.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stock prices hit a new 12-year low early
Monday as investors dumped shares amid uncertainty over the fate of
legislation to revive the country's ailing banking system. The U.S.
dollar rose against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 321.13 points,
or 2.30 percent, to 13,661.99 as of midday, after earlier dipping
as low as 13,658.79 for the first time since early 1986. On Friday,
the Nikkei had closed up 123.98 points, or 0.89 percent.
	   The stock market tumbled from the outset of trading in reaction
to the apparent unraveling of an agreement on a set of banking
industry stabilization bills as ruling party and opposition
lawmakers resumed wrangling over key provisions, traders said.
	   On Friday, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's Liberal Democratic
Party struck a preliminary accord with the opposition for dealing
with the huge load of bad loans burdening Japan's banking industry.
The plan calls for closing or nationalizing insolvent lenders and
buying up bad debt with public money.
	   But important issues remain unresolved.
	   ``The agreement is hard to grasp,'' said Isao Takahashi, senior
manager of Japanese equity trading at HSBC James Capel Securities
Co. ``For example, it still remains unclear exactly how they are
going to write off problem loans at banks.''
	   A top ruling party lawmaker suggested Sunday that 13 trillion
yen (dlrs 97.5 billion) in previously approved funds could be used
to bail out banks, apparently backing away from a major concession
to the opposition. Naoto Kan, leader of the largest opposition
party, warned the entire pact could fall apart.
	   Another point of contention involves the troubled Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., shares of which rebounded 16 percent to
22 yen (17 U.S. cents) after having closed Friday near an all-time
low of 19 yen (14 cents).
	   Obuchi, speaking to reporters en route to a meeting with U.S.
President Bill Clinton in New York, signaled Monday that LTCB would
not be allowed to founder, despite opposition demands the bank be
declared insolvent and nationalized.
	   ``If the Long-Term Credit Bank were to fail, it would cause a
major impact on the global economy,'' Obuchi said.
	   The broader Tokyo Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange declined 19.75 points, or 1.84
percent, to 1,053.47. The TOPIX had closed up 4.16 points, or 0.39
percent, on Friday.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, meanwhile, the dollar
bought 133.24 yen in late morning trading, up 1.14 yen from late
Friday in Tokyo and also above its New York level of 132.60 yen on
Friday.
	   The U.S. currency moved higher against the yen amid a belief
that the ruling party will face difficulty revising the proposed
bills more to its liking following Friday's compromise deal,
traders said.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.710 percent from Friday's finish of 0.675 percent,
driving its price down to 115.24 yen from 115.51 yen.

Seoul to shut down 13 more overseas diplomatic missions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea will shut down 13 more
diplomatic missions by the end of the year to save money, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said Monday.
	   With six missions, mostly in Africa, already closed in the first
half of the year, South Korea will maintain 125 missions by year's
end, it said.
	   To be affected are embassies in Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago,
Bolivia, Yemen and Bahrain and consulates in Karachi, Anchorage,
Miami, Hagatna in Guam, Hamburg and Las Palmas, the ministry said.
	   South Korea's mission to the U.N. Educational and Scientific
Organization in Paris will be merged into the Korean embassy in
Paris. The consulate in Berlin will be merged into the Korean
embassy in Bonn.
	   The ministry expects the shutdowns to save about dlrs 10 million
annually.

Virus outbreak threatens Australian chicken exports

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Biological test on Monday confirmed
that birds at two western Sydney chicken farms have a virulent
strain of Newcastle disease, which threatens poultry exports.
	   Chief Veterinary officer Dick Jane said the disease did not
present a public health risk to poultry consumers.
	   An outbreak of the disease at Glenorie and Blacktown farms
forced the New South Wales state Agriculture to impose restrictions
on the movement of poultry in the metropolitan area Sunday.
	   New South Wales Agriculture spokesman Bill Muldrew said that
100,000 chickens will be destroyed in an operation that will begin
Monday night.
	   Australia has been free of Newcastle disease in the virulent
form since the 1930s but any outbreak could seriously jeopardize
exports, an agriculture spokesman said.
	   A total of 1,200 chickens had died at the farms so far and
although the disease did not present a public health risk to
consumers of poultry, caged and show birds could be at risk, he
said.
	   Authorities had no idea how the disease got into the farm, but
it could be passed on by pigeons and wild birds or be spread
through the air.
	   A restricted area around the two affected properties prevents
the movement of birds, litter and manure out of the area. Movement
of birds within and through the restricted area will require a
permit.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Long-time leader Craig Barrett of
New Zealand collapsed with dehydration less than a kilometer from
the end of the 50-kilometer walk Monday, handing Malaysia its first
athletics gold medal at the Commonwealth Games.
	   In an extraordinary ending to the race on the final day of the
16th Games, Barrett, who had led almost from the start and had a
5-minute lead on his rivals almost four hours into the race, began
staggering along the road.
	   He stopped and leaned forward, placing both hands on the ground.
He got up, tried to walk again but had to stop twice more.
	   After trying again, Barrett staggered to the side of the road
and fell. Team officials and medics got out of their vehicles and
went to him but race rules meant they were unable to help him up.
	   Eventually, and still in the lead, Barrett got to his feet and
began walking again. But he was still very unsteady and fell once
more.
	   After his third attempt to finish the race, he fell again and
this time New Zealand officials called for an ambulance.
	   By coincidence, it was at that stage, less than a kilometer from
the finish line, that Malaysia's Govindasamy Saravanan walked past
him, looking strong.
	   The Malaysian kept going and crossed the finish line to be
greeted by wildly cheering fans in 4 hours, 10 minutes, 5 seconds.
	   He was well clear of two Australians, Duane Cousins, who was 25
seconds slower, and Dominic McGrath, who finished 2 minutes and 45
seconds behind the winner.
	   While Malaysia celebrated its first athletics triumph, Barrett
was rushed to a first aid unit at the finish line and given
treatment.

Queen Elizabeth II visits Malaysia during political storm
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A crowd of demonstrators briefly
chased after Queen Elizabeth's motorcade, but only to get a peek of
her before resuming chants calling for political reform in Malaysia
near a courthouse where the country's former deputy prime minister
was expected to be arraigned.
	   Armed troops guarded the Carcos Seri Nagara mansion in
Malaysia's capital city where the queen spent Sunday night after
the fleeting brush with the group of demonstrators, Britain's Press
Association reported.
	   The mansion is located only a few kilometers (miles) from the
residence of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the target of a
protest march Sunday in which thousands of people were hit with
tear gas and water cannons fired by riot police.
	   Queen Elizabeth has stepped into the midst of a roiling
political drama in Southeast Asia during a four-day state visit to
officiate at the closing of the 16th Commonwealth Games, the first
ever to be held in Asia.
	   Mahathir, who was expected on Monday to meet the queen and her
husband, Prince Phillip, triggered the political turmoil by firing
his former heir-apparent, Anwar Ibrahim, on Sept. 2.
	   The ex-finance minister and former deputy prime minister has
since been fighting for his freedom and political life. Anwar has
repeatedly denied leaked police accusations of everything from
sexual misconduct to treason.
	   He has responded by orchestrating a series of nationwide
political rallies and calling for Mahathir's resignation after 17
years in power.
	   Anwar was arrested late Sunday in a police raid on his home, and
was due to be charged in Sessions Court on Monday morning on a
charge of sodomy, which he has vehemently denied.
	   About 500 of his supporters, having waited more than two hours
for his appearance, were protesting there when they queen was
driven by, on her way to a formal welcoming ceremony in Parliament
Square.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who had intended to leave
Monday night for an important meeting of the United Nations General
Assembly, decided to stay with the queen until the end of her visit
on Wednesday.
	   Cook's decision was made after Anwar had addressed a crowd of
35,000 supporters in central Merdeka (Freedom) Square, leading them
in chants against Mahathir.
	   The demonstration had begun as the royal couple were worshiping
in St. Mary's Cathedral, next to the square. It was the first
public event of her trip to Malaysia, which she has not visited
since 1989.
	   But Anwar told reporters before his arrest that his protest
movement would not intentionally strive to complicate the queen's
visit.
	   ``I don't think Malaysians would want to embarrass the queen in
any way. This is a domestic matter.
	   ``I know Mr. Cook quite well,'' Anwar had said. ``And I know his
concern and commitment with humanitarian issues.''

Lieutenant gets temporary promotion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ For an ordinary army lieutenant,
the deference and chauffeur-driven cars were an unusual treat.
	   Lt. Hasnah Abidin was given the assignment of playing the part
of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II in rehearsals for the Commonwealth
Games closing ceremonies.
	   ``I'm truly lucky,'' she said. ``I get to be chauffeured into
the National Stadium in a Rolls Royce and out of the arena in a
modified Proton Perdana which has a mini-television screen
inside.''
	   The Proton is a Malaysian-made car.
	   Lt. Abdul Halim Hashim has played the part of Prince Philip in
practice for the formal end to these games among 70 nations, most
of which once were part of the British empire.
	   ``I feel very proud,'' he said. ``I treasure the chance to help
my country make the games a success. I especially like the grand
cars we were driven in. I think these are the only few times in my
life when I get such treatment from fellow Malaysians,'' he told
the newspaper The Star.
	   Come the actual ceremony, however, the two lieutenants were
assigned ordinary seats in the stadium to watch the real queen and
her husband.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   HOST TO HOST: Malaysia Airlines plans to start flights next July
from Kuala Lumpur, host of the current Commonwealth Games, to the
2002 host city, Manchester, England.
	   The airline said the three flights a week _ with a stop in
Munich, Germany _ will be MAS' second service to Britain. It
already has 14 flights a week to London.
	   The new flights ``will provide the linkage for the business
community between Malaysia and Manchester city, as well as cater to
the potential huge tourist market from Manchester and its
surrounding areas to Malaysia,'' the airline said in a statement.
	   Richard Leese, leader of the Manchester City Council, said,
``The introduction of this new service is a clear demonstration of
the benefits that can accrue from hosting such major sports
events.''
	   He was visiting Kuala Lumpur for the games.

McKellar, Lepage big winners at Toronto film fest

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Stories about the end of the world and about the
rejection of Quebec separatism brought top prizes for Canadian
directors Sunday at the 23rd annual Toronto International Film
Festival.
	   Don McKellar's ``Last Night,'' the story of how a handful of
Canadians spend their last hours before the destruction of the
world, won an award for best Canadian first feature film. Robert
Lepage's ``No,'' a satirical look at Quebec separatists, was named
best Canadian feature.
	   Ziad Doueiri's ``West Beirut,'' a Lebanese-French co-production,
and Australian John Curran's ``Praise'' shared the Rothman's World
Film International Critics Award given to first-time filmmakers.
	   Mary Lewis' ``When Ponds Freeze Over,'' about family life in
Newfoundland, won for best Canadian short film.
	   Roberto Benigni's Italian film, ``Life is Beautiful,'' won the
Air Canada People's Choice Award, voted on by festival audiences.
	   The festival _ now considered one of the world's biggest _
screened 311 films from 53 countries over 10 days.
	   ``We welcomed the world and they came in force,'' exulted
festival director Piers Handling.
	   Handling did not have a final tally of films sold during the
fest, but he predicted that total sales would be at least as high
as last year.
	   He also dismissed criticisms that the Toronto festival was
getting too big, saying it was designed for the public, not the
media or the film industry.
	   ``As long as they're there and the theaters are full, I don't
think the festival is too big,'' he said.

Anwar supporters rally to support ousted deputy prime minister
</HEADLINE>

demonstrator, other details.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police fired tear gas and water
cannon Monday to disperse 2,000 supporters of the Malaysia's ousted
deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim.
	   The demonstrators chanted ``reform, reform'' as they rallied in
hopes of catching a glimpse of their arrested leader outside a
courthouse in the capital city of Kuala Lumpur.
	   Anwar was expected to face charges of sexual misconduct and
disturbing the public order. His arrest at his home Sunday night
could add a volatile element to Malaysia's political and economic
troubles.
	   The official Bernama news agency quoted national police chief
Abdul Rahim Noor as saying that Anwar could be held under the
Internal Security Act, a harsh measure providing for indefinite
imprisonment without trial for those deemed to pose threats to
national security.
	   Anwar's detention has already threatened to overshadow a visit
by Queen Elizabeth II to Kuala Lumpur and her festive closing of
the 16th Commonwealth Games. The queen's motorcade passed a throng
of noisy pro-reform demonstrators in downtown Kuala Lumpur on
Sunday.
	   ``We're here to support Anwar because he's innocent. He didn't
do all those crazy things,'' said Haji Abdul Karim, a 35-year-old
businessman and member of the UMNO ruling party. ``We want him as
our prime minister.''
	   More than 100 reporters showed up at the Sessions Court,
expecting to see Anwar brought in to hear the charges against him.
Anwar has been leading an increasingly noisy opposition movement
against the 17-year-rule of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   However, late Monday morning, prosecutors said Anwar would stay
put in jail while police gather more evidence against him.
	   The 51-year-old Anwar was held incommunicado, but his wife,
Azizah Ismail, spoke to reporters.
	   She said her husband had been taken into custody by a SWAT team
that broke down their front door. She called it ``unwarranted,''
especially because her lawyers had promised the country's attorney
general that Anwar would not resist arrest.
	   Anwar's wife expressed apprehension about any further protests
like the huge demonstration that preceded her husband's arrest
Sunday night, but she added, ``The struggle will go on. It's better
to die in dignity and honor.''
	   Hundreds of Anwar's allies shouted angrily, ``God is great!''
and ``Long live Anwar!'' shaking their fists as police led him away
from the house Sunday.
	   Most newspapers featured pictures of Anwar's arrest, while some
showed him clutching his wife as police closed in.
	   Police burst into Anwar's home almost at the same time riot
officers fired tear gas and water cannon at a crowd of several
thousand people who were marching toward Mahathir's official
residence.
	   Many of them had come from a crowd of about 35,000 who joined
Anwar in the National Mosque and the capital's central Merdeka
(Freedom) Square, chanting for Mahathir's resignation Sunday.
	   Malaysia had hoped the royal visit and the Games would give a
much-needed publicity boost to this economically faltering nation,
but the political showdown has seized much of the world's
attention.
	   Several police helicopters swooped low over the capital, as part
of a hefty security force.
	   Newspapers have been carrying banner-headlined stories
containing explicit details of Anwar's alleged sodomy offenses.
Anwar's adopted brother and a friend allegedly confessed to the
crimes in a court hearing on Saturday. Both had been denied access
to their relatives or lawyers during their police detention.
	   Sodomy is a crime in this conservative Muslim country, and both
men were sentenced to six months in prison.
	   Anwar has vehemently denied the charges, saying they were cooked
up by Mahathir, who fears Anwar's growing popularity and any
challenge to his rule.
	   Kuala Lumpur Police Chief Kamarudin Ali told the national news
agency Bernama late Sunday that Anwar was being detained to aid
police investigations into several crimes, including public
disturbance, illegal assembly, criminal use of force and rioting.
	   ``Police have taken action to restore order and the situation is
under control and has returned to normal,'' the police chief said.
	   Police had previously said they were investigating allegations
against Anwar of treason, sexual misconduct and abuse of power.
	   Anwar, once Mahathir's handpicked successor, is now his
principal foe.
