<HEADLINE> Mideast Peace Not to Stop: PLA Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A top Palestinian official
has said that the Mideast peace process will not stop regardless
of the outcome of the meetings of the U.S. president with Israeli
and the Palestinian leaders later this month.
</P>
<P>
Abu Mazen, Palestinian Liberation Organization's (PLA) Secretary
General who arrived here Tuesday on a two-day visit, made the
remarks in an exclusive interview with the United Arab Emirate's
official Wam news agency.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton is scheduled to hold separate talks
with Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later this month in a bid
to revive the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process will not stop. In our view, the process will
continue... no matter the visits (by Arafat and Netanyahu) to
Washington succeed or not," the Palestinian official said.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue our peace efforts and we do not think the
failure of a visit or a meeting means a big disaster," he added.
</P>
<P>
Abu Mazen also stressed the continuation of the peace process
will not be affected by the failed mission of U.S. special envoy
Dennis Ross in the Middle East region last week.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians' frustration rose after Ross failed to achieve any
progress toward breaking the deadlock in the Middle East peace
process during a four-day visit to the region.
</P>
<P>
However, Abu Mazen warned against "great danger" if Washington
meetings achieve nothing.
</P>
<P>
"This means the peace process and the whole (Middle East)
region will be in danger if no progress happens," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"What worries us is: someday we are not able to control the
situation," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"(Palestinian) People are living with the hope to get their
legal rights. If they can not, things will develop towards a
diametrically opposite way," he warned.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Rebels Should Be Isolated: S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 14 (Xinhua) -- South Africa today
condemned last week's killing of nine Catholic nuns in Rwanda's
Northwest Province and urged the international community to back
Kigali and isolate the rebels responsible for the deaths.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Affairs Department said in a statement it was
concerned about the loss of life in Rwanda and the increase in
terrorist attacks by Hutu rebels.
</P>
<P>
In December last year, a government prison in Gitarama, Rwanda
was attacked and a number of people were killed.
</P>
<P>
A few days ago, 40 people were reportedly killed in the same
area by a terrorist group, and 52 more people were killed near
Nyakabanda in central Rwanda, a spokesman for the South African
Foreign Affairs Department said.
</P>
<P>
The nuns killed in Busasamana last Thursday were ethnic Hutus
belonging to the sisters of resurrection order.
</P>
<P>
"The Rwandan government through its activities has
demonstrated its commitment to peace and reconciliation. However,
the very forces which were responsible for the genocide in Rwanda
in 1994 are now intensifying their terrorist campaign," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation was affecting security and stability in
the country.
</P>
<P>
"It is vital that the international community takes urgent
action to support the Rwandan government and isolate the
extremists," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Horticultural Exports Up 20 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's horticulture
industry, one of the country's big foreign currency earners,
earned just over two billion Zimbabwe Dollars (118 million U.S.
Dollars) from exports in 1997, an industry official said today.
</P>
<P>
Chief executive of the Fresh Produce Producers Association Pat
Henson said last year had seen continuous growth of the industry
with about 13,000 tons of fresh produce and over 17,000 tons of
flowers exported between January and December.
</P>
<P>
''Fresh produce and flowers together have earned the industry
118 million U.S. Dollars, with flowers earning the country 80
million U.S. Dollars, while 38 million U.S. Dollars came from
fresh produce,'' Henson said.
</P>
<P>
She said the industry continued expanding yearly as growers
increased production.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand they continued seeking new markets besides
the traditional European Union.
</P>
<P>
She said surveys were taking place in the gulf where there was
demand for horticultural products.
</P>
<P>
Other markets for fresh produce and flowers were the
Netherlands and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, despite the freight costs which constituted over 50
percent of the total input costs for production, she said the DHL
Aviation of Belgium and national cargo airline Affretair had
greatly improved cargo facilities.
</P>
<P>
Late last year Affretair and DHL Aviation signed an agreement,
where the technical partner would provide advanced equipment to
ensure timely loading of aircraft as well as deliver products on
time to final destination.

<HEADLINE> US Retail Sales Edge Up 0.7 Pct in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. retail sales edged
0.7 percent in December to a seasonally adjusted 215.6 billion
U.S. dollars following a 0.3 percent rise in November, the
Commerce Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
December's retail sales growth, the strongest in five months,
brought sales for the full year to 2.55 trillion dollars. That
represents a 4.2 percent increase, compared with 5.2 percent in
1996. And it's the smallest annual gain since sales rose 0.6
percent in the recession year of 1991.
</P>
<P>
The strong monthly sales were largely attributed to autos,
which were up 2.3 percent after a 1.2 percent advance the month
before. Excluding the auto category, sales rose only 0.2 percent
after no change in November.
</P>
<P>
With a 3.7 percent annual growth, 1997 was regarded as a robust
year for the U.S. economic development. But it was a flat year for
retail sales, which represent roughly one-third of the economy's
output.
</P>
<P>
Low interest rates and a booming job market supported
consumers' purchasing power. However, consumer debt and individual
bankruptcies went up to new highs, stemming consumers' desire to
spend. And spending shifted somewhat from goods towards services,
such as vacation travel, which aren't included under retail sales.
</P>
<P>
Also, sales figures reflect retailers' inability to demand
higher prices. Prices overall rose just 1.7 percent last year and
for many goods, from autos to computers, they declined.
</P>
<P>
Analysts see retail spending growth at a moderate pace in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, sales rose 4.3 percent at auto dealers and 5.8 percent
at department stores. They were up 6.4 percent at building supply
and hardware stores, 5.9 percent at furniture stores, 2.9 percent
at clothing and accessory shops, 2.1 percent at food stores, 0.9
percent at gas stations, 3.2 percent at restaurants and bars and
8.6 percent at drug stores.

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends MONUA Mandate Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today recommended extension of the mandate of the
United Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA) for a further
period of three months until April 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan also recommended
further reduction by several hundred from the MONUA's current
strength of some 2,100 troops, staff officers, military observers
and civilian police
</P>
<P>
Annan said that despite extensive efforts by the government of
Angola and the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) and continued international assistance, certain
important tasks remain to be completed in order to conclude the
peace process in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said there is an urgent need for both parties, but
particularly UNITA, to show a greater sense of urgency in carrying
out the 1994 peace agreements, which ended a 20-year-long civil
war in the country.
</P>
<P>
The unfinished tasks include formal normalization of state
administration throughout the country, including the areas under
UNITA control, demobilization of UNITA forces, and transformation
of the UNITA radio station into a nonpartisan facility, Annan
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, UNITA has to take decisive steps towards its
transformation into a purely political party, declare that it has
no more armed personnel, or weapons under its control and move its
leadership to the Angolan capital," the secretary-general added.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief also expressed the hope that the government of
Angola will foster a climate of confidence so that the peace
process can continue in an atmosphere of trust and security.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Firm to Achieve Economic Independence: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's acting President
Simon Muzenda said today the government is determined to achieve
economic independence especially for the indigenous population.
</P>
<P>
After a tour of the new tobacco auction floors in Harare owned
by black tycoon Roger Boka, Muzenda said the Boka Group of
companies had represented meaningful participation by the
indigenous people in the development of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
"Boka has transformed the lucrative tobacco industry and
opened doors to the communal tobacco farmers who have had limited
participation in this industry," Muzenda said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Boka Tobacco Auction Floors (BTAF) which now
employed 7,000 people, had played a significant role in reducing
unemployment in the country, a practice that other indigenous
business people should emulate.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco was a vital commodity to the country's economic
development as it accounted for 42 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP), Muzenda said.
</P>
<P>
Muzenda added although Boka was not taken seriously when he
started the auction floors development which had proved to be a
success, hard work and great dedication had contributed
significantly to his success.
</P>
<P>
An official from the BTAF Farayi Munyuki said this year will
see the Boka Tobacco Auction Floors go public, a trend already
set by a number of local companies, as the company will offer the
public 320 million shares equivalent to 40 percent equity. The
remaining 60 percent would be taken by the company.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Calls for Arab Solidarity to Fight Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 14 (Xinhua -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today called for Arab solidarity in fighting terrorism and
extremism, phenomena that threaten the Arab world, the Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab nation's ability to stand up to terrorism depends on
firmness (on terrorism) at home front and activation of joint will
of its peoples," he said in a message addressing an Arab
Parliamentary Union emergency meeting in Luxor.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 19 Arab parliaments gathered for the
one-day meeting in Luxor, the most famous tourist draw in southern
Egypt and the scene of the last bloody terrorist attack in which
58 foreign tourists were killed 64, to show solidarity with the
Egyptian government in combating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak pointed out that Arab interior ministers' endorsing of
an agreement to fight terrorism during their last meeting in
Tunisia "laid a a good basis" for beefed-up Arab efforts in this
respect.
</P>
<P>
In the message read out by Fathi Sorour, People's Assembly
speaker and APU chairman, Mubarak said "efforts should be boosted
and coordinated at bilateral, regional and international levels to
put an end to terrorist acts."
</P>
<P>
The president said the Arab parliamentarians' keenness to
participate in the session reflects their sincere commitment to
examine "the dangerous challenge facing the Arab nation that
threatens human values and principles of the law."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also urged the Arabs to ask certain countries not to
harbor terrorists or provide them with shelter and support.
Efforts should be made to guarantee that perpetrators of terrorist
acts be put on trial, and to defile sources of financing terrorist
groups, he added.
</P>
<P>
The APU emergency session which will end later today is
expected to come up with an initiative in confronting the
phenomenon of terrorism and in solidarity with Egypt's efforts to
deal with it.
</P>
<P>
Islamic militants target tourism, a mainstay of Egypt's
economy, in its struggle to topple the secular government and
enforce strict religious rule. Luxor witnessed the worst massacre
of 58 foreign tourists and four Egyptians by six militants on
November 17, 1997.

NEW YORK, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Three masked men interrupted a
currency delivery to a bank in the World Trade Center Tuesday,
handcuffed the guards and escaped with three bags of cash
containing international currencies worth 1.6 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to reports here today, the suspects, with handguns in
hand, cornered the two armored car guards at 8:30 a.m. outside the
offices of the Bank of America on the 11th floor of Building One
of the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
The robbers took three of the seven bags the guards were
bringing in and rode another elevator going down.

The suspects' familiarity with the environment and their
ability to pass through security checkpoints indicated that it was
"very possibly" an inside job, according to a spokesman of the

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Three Israelis and three
Lebanese were injured Wednesday at a border crossing near the
northern border town Metulla when a booby-trapped bomb exploded,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The bomb was perpetrated by the Shiite Amal organization
which has been fighting against Israeli occupation of South
Lebanon. One Lebanese civilian was critically wounded, and two
other Lebanese and three Israelis at the site were injured in
the blast.
</P>
<P>
The report said the blast occurred when an Israeli border
guard on duty stopped a Lebanese man carrying a parcel which
he alleged containing a video cassette, and demanded another
Lebanese civilian open it.
</P>
<P>
All the six wounded were sent to Israeli hospitals for
treatment. The Amal organization issued a statement in Lebanese
capital Beirut claiming responsibility for the attack, saying it
dealt a serious blow to Israeli Army's intelligence operation.
</P>
<P>
The border crossing has been a common target for bombing
attacks, and Israeli forces have beefed up security measures to
prevent further attacks, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Opposition Slams Price Hikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The recent price hikes in basic
commodities will result in further drops in the standard of
living for the majority of Zimbabweans, the opposition United
Parties (UP) said today.
</P>
<P>
UP Information and Publicity Secretary Isaac Manyemba said the
price increases would "sink many families below the ability to
acquire basic foods".
</P>
<P>
Prices of most basic commodities including mealie-meal,
cooking oil and bread went up by an average 20 percent last week
with manufacturers citing the devaluation of the local currency
and rising operational costs as the main reasons.
</P>
<P>
Mealie-meal or maize meal "is our staple food and now that its
price has been hiked most families and the growing army of the
unemployed are not going to afford a meal a day," Manyemba
complained.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the spiraling prices on what he said was the gross
mismanagement of the economy by the government for the past 17
years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chairman of the Foundation for Democracy Chris
Mushonga said, "we strongly encourage the government to deal with
this economic crisis which poses a grave threat to the social,
economic and political future of our country."

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Security Forces Instructed to Prevent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Defense Ministry
has instructed the police department and the three services to
maintain proper law and order and prevent any violence during the
local government elections in the north.
</P>
<P>
A press release of the ministry issued Wednesday said that
security forces have been directed to maintain close surveillance
on any developments unfavorable to the elections scheduled for
January 29.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which
has been fighting with government troops for an independent state
of their own in the north and east, may pose a threat to the polls
as it has done before.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some of the political parties contesting the
forthcoming polls have threatened each other with their weapons
issued for self-protection, the ministry noted.
</P>
<P>
Armed members of the parties in some small islands off the
Jaffna peninsula even prevented other parties from entering their
land to campaign.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said these developments were not in the interest
of a free and fair election.
</P>
<P>
It therefore asked the security forces to make every effort to
ensure the safety of candidates and other campaigners.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1171 candidates nominated by four political parties
and two independent groups will contest 234 posts in 17 local
bodies in Jaffna and Kilinochchi districts in the north.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who fails to abide by the commitment not to misuse
weapons will be disarmed, except those who are deployed to guard
party office premises, the ministry warned.
</P>
<P>
Besides, each election-related incident will be subjected to
thorough investigation and offenders will be taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
The elections will be the first in more than ten years in the
regions. A total of 571,484 voters are eligible to cast their
ballots at 422 polling stations.

ISLAMABAD, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Rescue operation to recover
the bodies of the passengers and crew members of the ill-fated
Afghan aircraft has been completed by the Frontier corps of
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
All 51 persons on board including six crewmen have died in the
fatal crash. The dead bodies and baggage have been collected and
are being transported to Kandhar, the southern Afghan city.
</P>
<P>
It has officially been confirmed that passengers died in the
plane crash are 51 while earlier media reports had suggested some
80 casualties.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the Frontier corps, most of the
bodies could not be identified as they were scattered in the area
into pieces, and were charred by the fire that broke out in the
place after the plane crashed Tuesday night near bordering town
Chaman, some 100 kilometers north of Quetta, the provincial
capital of Balochistan.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that guards have been deployed at the plane
wreckage until it is removed from the site and examined by the
experts.
</P>
<P>
They also said that the Russian-made aircraft belonged to
Afghan Air Lines- Ariana.
</P>
<P>
Heavy snow over the entire area and the ruggedness of the
terrain hampered the rescue operation during the night and the
snow is still falling in the area.

<HEADLINE> Angola Starts Education in Multi-forms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Education Minister
Francisca do Espirito Santos said here today that her ministry
would resort to various kinds of education to enable more
Angolans to be taught.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the second term of the
distance education program of the bank system, Francisca said
that as more and more people wish to go to school with the
realization of peace in the country, merely rely on the
traditional way of education is far from enough.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of the country's schools have been ruined in
years of civil war, she said, adding that the war had brought
many young people onto the battlefield, resulting in an
illiteracy rate of 60 percent in Angola.
</P>
<P>
To meet the demand for more well-educated people for the
country's reconstruction, she said, the Ministry of Education is
making use of every means to start education.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is also cooperating with television station on a
pineering project to open up a TV education network.
</P>
<P>
The program, if proved to be a success, would become a
nation-wide new education system later, Francisca said.
</P>
<P>
Another form of distance education, the minister said, is to
establish education centers in different places for more people
to receive education, for which the institute of the bank system
has set a good example.
</P>
<P>
She said that her ministry had set up distance education
centers in seven out of 18 provinces throughout the country,
enrolling 221 students this year.
</P>
<P>
Distance education, a very important way of education, would
be extended to 18 provinces, especially remote and backwater
ones, Francisca said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Warns Turkey Not to Violate Its Sovereign Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Greece's Defense Undersecretary
Dimitris Apostolakis said today that Athens would not tolerate any
violation of its sovereign rights by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey was trying to overstep the limits, he said, adding that
Greece's reaction would be "very forceful."
</P>
<P>
Apostolakis did not rule out the possibility of a conflict
between Greece and Turkey in the Aegean Sea, but he stressed that
the Greek army was always ready to deal with "any provocation on
the party of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In the past days, a large number of Turkish jet fighters
reportedly violated the Greek air space in the eastern Aegean
region. Turkish warplanes today violated Greece's air space
between Limnos island and Hios island and between Rhodes island
and Kos island in the Aegean on 16 occasions, and all were
successfully intercepted by Greek fighter planes, Greek Defense
Ministry sources said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas today
condemned the continued violation of Greek air space by Turkish
warplanes as "provocative and aggressive."
</P>
<P>
He said that Athens had taken all the necessary diplomatic
actions to deal with Turkey's violation of Greek air space.
</P>
<P>
Greece today summoned Turkey's ambassador in Athens to the
Foreign Ministry and protested to the European Union (EU),
accusing Ankara of using armed forces to exercise its foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos Tuesday also
inspected some islands in the eastern Aegean to show Athens'
determination to defend its sovereign rights.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar President Pardons 16 Prison Inmates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar President
Salmin Amour has pardoned 16 prison inmates as part of the
celebrations for the 34th anniversary of the Zanzibar revolution
that toppled the sultanate regime.
</P>
<P>
A government statement released from Zanzibar today said the
presidential pardon will only cover those who committed petty
offenses, elders and those who have served more than half of
their jail terms.
</P>
<P>
The pardon has excluded inmates convicted and jailed for
murders, robberies, drug abuses, theft of government property and
those who committed sexual abuse of women, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibar constitution empowers the president to grant
amnesty to people convicted and jailed for petty criminal
offenses.
</P>
<P>
Celebrations marking the Revolution Day reached its climax
Monday at the Amman Stadium which was attended by top national
leaders and retired presidents of Tanzania and Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
Formerly a British protectorate, Zanzibar became an
independent sultanate on December 10, 1963. Following an armed
uprising by the Afro-Shiraz Party in January of 1964, the Sultan
was disposed and a republic proclaimed. The new government signed
an Act of Union with the Tanganyika Republic on April 26, 1964,
thus creating the United Republic of Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> US Spokesman Denies Policy Shift on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A report on U.S. flexibility
about the composition of the U.N. weapons inspection team was
misinterpreted, State Department spokesman James Rubin said today.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the International Herald Tribune, which ran
a story, quoting Rubin's remarks at a briefing and asserting that
the United States had shown flexibility on the inspection issue,
which has renewed confrontation between Iraq and the United States
this week.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said, "There's nothing to that. It is just an
interpretation. I wasn't meaning to suggest anything new.... I
strongly deny" there has been a shift in the U.S. position on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. position on the composition of the inspection
teams remains what it has been. The composition of the teams
"depends on expertise and it's up to the United Nations to decide,"
he said in a telephone interview with Reuters.
</P>
<P>
"The more often that other experts come forward in the world,
the less the United States will have such a dominant percentage"
on the teams, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has a lot of expertise (in the field of
nuclear, biological and chemical weapons inspection) and the
United States offers a lot" to the U.N. effort, he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Proposes Lifting of Ban on N. Irish Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission today
proposed lifting the ban on beef exports from Northern Ireland
where computerized records have been kept on cattle herds.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made during the day's commission meeting at
Strasbourg.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture commissioner Franz Fischler tabled to the meeting a
plan that proposes that de-boned beef from cattle between six and
30 months old could be exported so long as they were from herds
free of the mad cow disease for at least eight years.
</P>
<P>
The worldwide ban on beef exports, imposed 21 months ago, may
be lifted with a qualified majority approval by the commission's
standing veterinary committee next week.
</P>
<P>
But the date on which the ban can be lifted will have to be
decided later.
</P>
<P>
Without a qualified majority, the proposal will be put forward
to the council meeting of EU farm ministers in February. A simple
majority is required of the 15 ministers to make the approval.
</P>
<P>
At a post-meeting press conference, Fischler said that it was
very difficult to say when the lifting of the ban will be made in
that the commission does not have a target date in mind.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said that apart from record keeping, the
qualified herds have to be slaughtered in certain slaughter houses
to minimize the risk of contamination of the mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
Special certification stamps will also be resorted to help
trace origins of qualified herds as well as beef.
</P>
<P>
Cattle farmers in England, Wales and Scotland will have to wait
until a computer tracking system is in force and working to the
European Union's satisfaction before they can hope for a lift of
ban on their beef.
</P>
<P>
More than 132,000 farmers in Britain have been asked to fill in
forms recording their cattle by January 26 to ensure that the
database contains accurate information.
</P>
<P>
All the forms have to be checked before the tracking system can
be activated.
</P>
<P>
So far, 170,000 heads of cattle were found to have bovine
spongiform encephalopathy or mad cow disease in Britain, where 21
people have been claimed to have died from the disease.

<HEADLINE> PNA Rejects Israeli Decision on West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Wednesday rejected the Israeli cabinet's decision
to retain most of the West Bank because of its "vital security
interests."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet said in a statement issued after today's
meeting that all the areas of "vital security interests" to Israel
will definitely be under Israeli control in the future.
</P>
<P>
Those include two security strips west and east of the West
Bank, areas surrounding Jerusalem, Jewish settlements, military
areas, certain roads and all Jewish historical sites in the West
Bank, the cabinet said.
</P>
<P>
The decision met with angry responses from the Palestinians.
PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat's advisor on Israeli Affairs Ahmed
Al-Tibi said in Gaza that the Israeli cabinet's decision is a
clear signal indicating Israel's intention of moving the peace
process backward.
</P>
<P>
The PNA totally rejects this decision, he said, adding that if
it is being putting into practice, the future of the peace process
will be very cloudy, according to the Palestinian press service
JMCC (Jerusalem Media and Communication Center).
</P>
<P>
PNA Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Nabil
Sha'ath said in Gaza the decision meant Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu wants to bury the agreements and deepen the
occupation.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council Abu Ala said in
a statement issued in Ramallah that Israel must pull back its
troops from all territories of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
During today's cabinet meeting, the third in this week, the
ministers did not endorse the maps which stipulates how many lands
Israel would hand over back to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet will meet again on Thursday to finalize Israel's
principles concerning its troop withdrawal during the second
redeployment in the West Bank, and Netanyahu will take them to
Washington later this month for talks with U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The Israel cabinet on Wednesday linked further redeployment in
the West Bank again to PNA compliance. It adopted a 12-page
document listing the obligations and commitments the PNA has
failed to fulfill as stipulated by the Hebron Agreement signed on
January 15, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In short, there will be no troop redeployment unless PNA
fulfills its obligations.
</P>
<P>
But different voices are strong in Israel. Maj-Gen. Dan Dayan,
the Central Command of the Israel Defense Forces, while talking to
Ben Gurion University students today in Beer Sheva, southern
Israel, insisted that Israel should fulfill its own commitments of
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel should carry out its troop redeployment in the West
Bank, he emphasized.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Surprised at EU's Fish Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The government has expressed
"surprise" here today over European Union's (EU) decision to ban
the import of fresh fish from Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Last week EU stopped importing fresh fish from some African
countries, including Mozambique, on the excuse of the cholera
outbreak in these countries.
</P>
<P>
Herminio Tembe, director of National Fishery Bureau, was
quoted by Mozambican News Agency as saying that EU's decision
"made us very surprised", and the bureau is trying to make EU
change its position.
</P>
<P>
Tembe said that the government is trying to invite EU official
to inspect the country to see if the fish they export to Europe
is contaminated by cholera.
</P>
<P>
The government has long taken measures to prevent the sea fish
from being polluted by cholera.
</P>
<P>
About 270 Mozambicans died when cholera broke out in August
last year.
</P>
<P>
Tembe said that up to now study has shown that the fish caught
along the coast of the country has not been contaminated.
</P>
<P>
The EU is No. one buyer of Mozambique's fresh fish, with an
import of about 20 to 30 tons a day, valuing at 40,000 to 60,000
U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The export of sea food, including prawns and sea shells,
accounts for about 40 percent of the total export earnings of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique exports about 8,000 tons of prawns and over 10,000
tons of fish a year, to mainly EU members, besides Asian
countries including Japan.

<HEADLINE> Two Jewish Extremists in Pig Plot Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Two Jewish right extremists
who plotted to provoke Muslim violence by throwing pig head into
the Muslim holy shrine Aqsa Mosque's compound in the Old City of
Jerusalem were indicted here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem District Court issued indictments against
right-wing activists Avigdor Eskin and Haim Pakovitch for inciting
violence by planning to throw pig head onto the Temple Mount,
where Aksa Mosque stands, during the current holy Muslim month of
Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
The court also charged the two for placing a pig head on the
grave of a Muslim religious leader Izzadin Kassim near Haifa and
torching the Jerusalem office of peace group Dor Shalom, or
Generation for Peace Movement.
</P>
<P>
According to the prosecution's charges, Eskin and Pakovitch
attempted to provoke violent clashes between Jews and Arabs so as
to disrupt the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution also demanded the court remand the two men
until the legal proceedings against them ends because they pose
threats to the public. The two were released Tuesday by the court
on house arrest.
</P>
<P>
Eskin and Pakovitch were arrested late December in a crackdown
on extremist activists launched by Israeli government. Israeli
police have recently warned against the danger to the society and
peace process posed by increased activities of right-wing
extremists.

BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Swimming
Association (CSA) made a statement after FINA's announcement of
the positive results of the four Chinese swimmers in an
out-of-competition dope test at the current World Swimming
Championships.
</P>
<P>
The statement is as follows:
</P>
<P>
The International Swimming Federation (FINA) announced on
January 14 that four Chinese swimmers tested positive in an
out-of-competition dope test at the World Swimming Championships
and FINA decided to provisionally suspend the four Chinese until a
hearing can be made following the test of the B sample.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Swimming Association was deeply shocked and
supports the decision made by FINA. We will actively co-ordinate
with FINA to investigate the case and impose serious punishment to
those involved.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Swimming Association has always been adhering to
the principle of the Chinese Olympic Committee on anti-doping
campaign. That is "clear stipulation, tight checks and harsh
penalty". We will continuously closely coordinate with FINA and
bring to the end the arduous and sophisticated struggle against
doping.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Accuses Turkish Cypriots of Ruining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has lodged a protest
against alleged destruction by Turkish Cypriots of the cultural
heritage in the north of the island, the Cyprus News Agency
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The protest was made in a letter sent to the United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan by Cypriot representative there Sotos
Zakheos, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The letter of protest gives a list of "large-scale destruction
of over 500 churches," some of them having been changed into
museums, others being used as mosques.
</P>
<P>
It accused that a number of Christian Orthodox churches have
been desecrated, looted and abandoned to deteriorate and in danger
of collapse.
</P>
<P>
The letter said the continuous and systematic plundering of
religious and cultural heritage of Cyprus was an act contrary to
all the principles on which the U.N. was founded and international
law was based.
</P>
<P>
It calls on the U.N. to respond effectively and in a timely
manner to "such gross violations of international law."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island after a
failed pro-Athens coup by the Greek Cypriots.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The head of U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) said today that he had no intention to change
the composition of a weapons inspection team led by American Scott
Ritter.
</P>
<P>
"There is the question of whether we take another shot with the
team led by Mr. Ritter. My inclination is not to do so," Richard
Butler told CNN in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Ritter, who was branded by Iraq as a spy for the United States,
said today that Iraqi officials had refused to escort his team for
checking weapons of mass destruction for a second consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has barred the Ritter-led weapons inspection team from
doing its work on the ground that he was a U.S. spy and the
composition of the team was unbalanced as it was made up largely
by Americans and Britons.
</P>
<P>
Butler said he doubted the Ritter-led team would make another
try "because I think the Iraqi position is clear... but I'll take
a decision on that later today."

<HEADLINE> EU Ends Frankfurt Airport Groundhandling Monopoly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission today
decided to act and end the groundhandling monopoly at Frankfurt
Airport in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken in relation to complaints by Air France,
KLM and British Airways that Frankfurt Airport was abusing its
dominant position by not granting to airlines the right to provide
groundhandling services nor giving access to third-party handling.
</P>
<P>
Groundhandling includes baggage handling, runway operations,
refueling, the handling of freight and postal service, cleaning,
and provision of catering services.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, decided to uphold the complaints and rejected Frankfurt
Airport's arguments that constraints on space and capacity
justified monopoly.
</P>
<P>
The commission gave Frankfurt Airport three months to present a
detailed plan as to how it intends to open the groundhandling
market.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission also decided to introduce legislation
to liberalize groundhandling in all major EU airports handling a
minimum of 1 million to 3 million passengers a year or at least
25,000 tons to 75,000 tons of freight a year.
</P>
<P>
The legislation complements the union's air liberalization
program in that groundhandling is a significant part of operating
costs of airlines who often did not have a choice of provider.
</P>
<P>
Such additional costs are then passed onto consumers in the
form of higher flight fares.

LONDON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) voiced
its disappointment here today that the Algerian government had
rejected a planned EU visit to the country where some 1,000 people
have been reportedly killed recently.
</P>
<P>
A British official, whose country is the current EU president,
was quoted by the Reuters as saying, "We are disappointed that the
Algerians are not willing to receive the Troika mission at senior
official level."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Algerian Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf said
early today that Algeria wanted the EU to send a delegation of
ministers rather than senior officials.
</P>
<P>
However, the British official noted that the EU still wanted to
"engage the Algerian government in dialogue. EU foreign ministers
will discuss Algeria at the General Affairs Council (GAC) on
January 26."
</P>
<P>
"We do not rule out the possibility of a ministerial visit
after the GAC if our EU partners agree," the official added.
</P>
<P>
The EU had planned to send the Troika delegation, which
includes representatives from the current, the immediate past and
the next EU presidency state, to Algeria to discuss the latest
massacres and see what assistance Europe might provide.

brinkmanship by blocking the work of the United Nations Special
Commission on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government announced Monday that it would bar a UN
arms inspection team headed by an American and warned that the
suspension would remain in force until the composition of the team
is changed.
</P>
<P>
"We know that Saddam Hussein wants to build up his capability
to produce chemical and biological weapons and deliver them,"
Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
"He (Saddam) represents a serious threat to his neighbors, to
his own people and to international security," Robertson added.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni, Saudi Leaders Hold Phone Talks on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali
Abdullah Saleh and Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Abdullah Bin Abdel
Aziz hold a discussion over the phone Wednesday on bilateral
relations and the latest Arab and international developments.
</P>
<P>
The phone talks came following Saleh's declaration of his
country's keenness to postpone the negotiations over borders
demarcations "if there is no real intention to solve this crisis
(deadlock in border demarcation) at the time being." according to
Saudi Press Agency (SPA) monitored here.
</P>
<P>
However, SPA did not reveal the details of Saleh's phone talks
with the Saudi Crown Prince.
</P>
<P>
Before the phone talks which Saleh called, Yemeni vice
president Abdraboh Mansour Hadi had asserted Yemen's keenness to
seek international arbitration if the deadlock in border
demarcation negotiations had persisted.
</P>
<P>
But Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayif Bin Abdel Aziz
responded to Hadi's remarks that Saudi Arabia was keen on
cordially solving this issue.
</P>
<P>
He said that negotiations concerning the demarcation of
borders were continuing.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum of understanding providing principles on solving
the 60-year-old border disputes was signed between the two
countries in February 1995.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the two countries have been striving to settle
their border disputes that may eliminate the last obstacle
hindering further improvement of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Political sources said there was an atmosphere of calm over
the relations even following a border accident last November
in which several Saudi citizens and a Yemeni were killed.
</P>
<P>
Both countries' officials had been optimistic towards the end
of last year on a quick solution of their border dispute following
the exchange of points of view over the proposal of King Fahd
presented last July and was responded positively by President
Saleh in the same month.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni President Saleh last year said that bilateral
coordination with "the Saudi brothers is still going on over
demarcation of land and maritime borders."

<HEADLINE> UK to Urge Common US-EU Approach on Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Britain, which is holding the
current European Union (EU) presidency, promised here today to use
its traditional links with Washington to develop a common EU-U.S.
approach on Iran.
</P>
<P>
A British government official told Reuters today that British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, due to hold talks with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright Thursday, will urge a more
flexible U.S. line with Iran after Iran recently signaled a more
positive U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
"Six months (of British EU presidency) is the (immediate)
deadline. It is a unique opportunity while we're in the presidency
to make an impact on this (Iran policy)," the official said.
</P>
<P>
"There will be some pretty intensive diplomacy during our
presidency. We will remain constantly engaged with the United
States. This (Iran) is one of the foreign policy priorities in our
EU presidency," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said that there is a gap between the EU and
Washington and the 15-nation bloc favors dialogue with Iran while
the Americans have imposed unilateral sanctions on any companies
trying to invest in Iran's oil and gas sectors.
</P>
<P>
The British official stressed, "We won't get far if the U.S.
and EU policies do not converge. We want to see them become
closer, which is why we're playing a brokership role."
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, if there is to be a convergence in the positions
of the EU and the United States, there will have to be some
movement on both sides," he added.

<HEADLINE> UK Cheers Likely Limited Easing of Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The British government expressed
here today its excitement over the expected European Union (EU)
decision to ease a global ban on British beefs exports.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the EU's executive Commission is likely to
endorse a proposal on easing the two-year-old ban on British beef
exports later today.
</P>
<P>
British Agriculture Minister Jack Cunningham told reporters
today that he hoped the Commission would back the plan, which is
to allow a limited resumption of exports from Northern Ireland,
where a computer database keeps cattle movements.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the likely EU decision, Cunningham said, "That
would be good news. It's something we've worked tremendously hard
for, both in terms of the actions we are taking here in the UK and
in discussions with our colleagues in the (EU) Commission and
Council of Ministers and the European Parliament."
</P>
<P>
In order to restore public confidence after the mad-cow crisis,
the agriculture minister launched this afternoon a new British
Food Standards Agency, which will have powers to enforce food law
and impose sanctions on companies or individuals who contravene
it.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham said that the new body would not tell people what to
eat, but would help ensure food safety and boost public confidence
following the food scares.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot FM: Cyprus Ready to Tackle Turkish Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Greece have
discussed political measures to tackle Turkish threats against
Cyprus, Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioanuis Kasoulides said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides, who visited Athens last week, told reporters that he
discussed the Turkish threats with his Greek counterpart
Theodoros Pangalos, but refrained from revealing any details.
</P>
<P>
"Cyprus and Greece feel confident they can handle any
development affecting Cyprus," the minister said, adding "we have
discussed ways to react to the political measures Turkey may
decide to enforce."
</P>
<P>
Following the Luxembourg European Union (EU) summit in
December, which excluded Turkey from EU enlargement process,
Ankara and the Turkish Cypriot side stepped up their efforts to
gain international recognition of the so-called the "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus, which was set up in the Turkish
occupied northern areas of Cyprus in 1983 and only recognized by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-controlled south
and Turkish Cypriot-nominated north since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island
following a failed Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has reiterated threats for the partial integration with
northern Cyprus in response to the EU decision to start accession
talks with the Cypriot government in March this year.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot side signed Tuesday a protocol
deciding to merge their representations abroad in a step toward an
integration.
</P>
<P>
"Our main goal is to give the "Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus" worldwide recognition and to let it take its rightful
place in the international arena," Turkey's Foreign Ministry
Undersecretary Korkmaz Haktanir was quoted as saying after signing
the agreement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the agreement, the Cypriot foreign minister said "in
some way it implies that their efforts for international
recognition of the puppet regime are failing and they are trying
to find other means to show that they are taking some measures."
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides dismissed threats by the Turkish side to step up
military measures against Cyprus after a government announcement
said that an air base, near the western coastal town of Paphos,
will be completed and delivered on January 24.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side has threatened to upgrade an airport
in northern areas to enable Turkish military aircraft to be
stationed there permanently.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said these threats "do not frighten us," stressing
that a joint defense pact signed between the governments of
Cyprus and Greece in 1993 "aims at decisively tackling any
eventuality."
</P>
<P>
Under the pact, Greece will provide Cyprus with military
assistance in case the Mediterranean island is attacked.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Paphos air base will be used to intercept Turkish
military aircraft, Kasoulides said "for the moment our decision
is to use it only in the case of a Turkish offensive against the
free part of the Cyprus Republic."

<HEADLINE> Sino-Ethiopian Trade Grows Rapidly, Says Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Bilateral trade between
China and Ethiopia has increased rapidly for three years in
succession.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from Chinese Customs, Sino-Ethiopian
trade in the first 11 months of 1997 reached 51.302 million U.S.
Dollars, a 38.2 percent increase compared with the same period in
1996.
</P>
<P>
This indicated that the bilateral trade has increased annually
by more than 30 percent for three years running.
</P>
<P>
Xiong Jingfen, economic and commercial councillor of the
embassy of the People's Republic of China to Ethiopia, told
Xinhua that the total trade volume between the two countries has
maintained a yearly increase of 10 million dollars for the past
three years.
</P>
<P>
Xiong said, from January to November 1997, the exports from
China to Ethiopia was 50.745 million U.S. Dollars, increasing by
37.5 percent over the same period of 1996, while the imports from
Ethiopia to China was 557,000 U.S. Dollars, 171 percent more than
the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The rapid increase of business between the two countries shows
the friendly cooperation relationship between China and Ethiopia,
which has not only entered a new stage in diplomatic
relationship, but also heralded a high tide in their economic and
commercial relationship after Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi's visit to China in 1995 and the visit by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin to Ethiopia in 1996.
</P>
<P>
She recalled that Sino-Ethiopian trade relations were
established in early 1950s. However, the value of trade remained
a few millions U.S. Dollars yearly until 1991 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
The major export goods from China to Ethiopia are textiles,
light industrial products, native produce and animal by-products,
metal and hardware, aluminium products, cereals, oils and
foodstuffs and industrial and agricultural tools.
</P>
<P>
Xiong told Xinhua that she is full of confidence in the
further development of bilateral trade and cooperation in other
fields between the two countries in the future, adding that the
value of bilateral business will reach a new record of 60-70
million U.S. Dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The contract projects and investment market will be ever more
active this year than before, she said, because of the stable
political situation and the rapid economic recovery in Ethiopia
as well as the economic reform policies carried out by the
Ethiopian government.
</P>
<P>
The recent announcement of limited participation of foreign
investors in the defense industry, power generating and telecom
sector by the Ethiopian government will certainly promote the
investment activities in the country, she added.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Works to Strengthen Ties with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has promised to promote
the existing good relations with China through full
implementation of all the agreements signed between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The assurance was given by Mike Akande, minister of
industries, at a meeting with Lu Fengding, Chinese ambassador to
Nigeria, on Tuesday in the capital Abuja, an embassy source said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed a number of technical cooperation
agreements in the fields of power, oil and steel as well as the
investment protection and promotion agreement when Chinese
Premier Li Peng visited Nigeria in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the need to fully implement these accords, Akande
also said China should take advantage of Nigeria's liberalization
of economy to invest in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
The minister told Lu, the first foreign envoy to visit her
since she took the post about a month ago, that Nigeria has
abundant human and natural resources yet to be tapped.
</P>
<P>
She hoped that Chinese investors could explore the cement,
construction and solid minerals development sectors, which have
not been fully tapped.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who paid a visit to China in 1996 and was
impressed by the rapid economic growth there, said Nigeria has a
lot to learn from China on how to boost economic development in a
developing country with a large population.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria would ensure that the cordial diplomatic relationship
existing between the two countries grows from strength to
strength, she added.
</P>
<P>
The good relations have led to growing economic and trade
links between China and Nigeria in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Besides increasing trade, Chinese companies are in Nigeria
undertaking the renovation of railway network and dredging of
harbor.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Estonia Wednesday
signed two agreements on the abolition of visas and the
establishment of air services, aimed at boosting bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The agreements were signed in Nicosia by the Foreign
Ministers of Cyprus and Estonia, Ioannis Kasoulides and Toomas
Hendrik Ilves.
</P>
<P>
Before signing the agreements, the two ministers held talks
on how Estonia and Cyprus can cooperate in their bid to join
the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Estonia are included in the first group of
countries to open accession talks with the EU in April. The
others are Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides told reporters that his Estonian counterpart's visit
"demonstrates the close ties that are developing between our
two small countries, with similar history and parallel problems,
and particularly the common goal of joining the EU".
</P>
<P>
He said the Visa Abolition Agreement and the Air Services
Agreement will help Cypriots and Estonians to have more
contacts and get to know each other.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Ilves said that Cyprus and Estonia understand
each other, noting that the role of small countries in the
wider political scene of the world is important.
</P>
<P>
He added small countries must work together and cooperate in
order to improve their position in the world and the
organizations they belong to, and make their voices heard.
</P>
<P>
Ilves said he expects a good deal of cooperation and exchange
of ideas and experiences in the years to come, leading to the
time when both countries will join the EU.
</P>
<P>
Ilves, who arrived here Tuesday evening, is currently on a
five-day visit to Cyprus. He had a meeting Wednesday morning with
President Glafcos Clerides to discuss the issues concerning two
countries' accession negotiations with the EU.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Criticizes Greek Claims over Airspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkey Wednesday criticized
recent statements by Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos
that Greece has a 10-mile airspace and possesses all the Aegean
islands.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued Wednesday by the Turkish Foreign Ministry
said "Under the international law, the extent of national airspace
should correspond to the extent of territorial waters. The only
country that does not abide by this international principle and
implements airspace and territorial waters' extent differently is
Greece."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we bring to mind once more that the flights of
Turkish military planes in international airspace over the Aegean
and outside Greece's 6-mile territorial waters zone are
compatible with internaional law," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Greece Tuesday accused Turkey of sending 16 Turkish fighter
jets to violate Greek airspace over the Aegean and flew close to a
helicopter carrying the Greek defense minister.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that Greece's allegations that all the
Aegean islands belonged to Athens were a "distortation of history
and facts," stressing that there was no island, islet or rocky
islands left to Greece apart from those listed in Lausanne and
Paris agreements.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Turkish Foreign Ministry Wednesday
lodged a protest note to the Greek Embassy in Ankara, accusing a
Greek coast guard of attacking a Turkish fishing boat in the
Aegean on January 9.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations fact-finding
team finally arrived in Sierra Leone today for assessment of the
situation in the tiny west African country.
</P>
<P>
The team, led by Francis Okellor, the UN special envoy to
Sierra Leone who had been based in neighboring Guinea for the
past several months, was driven to a hotel in the capital
Freetown this afternoon, the British Broadcasting Corporation
reported.
</P>
<P>
The team is expected to talk with the ruling military junta on
how to keep on the right track the peace process, which has been
on the edge of derailment.
</P>
<P>
The junta, which last may toppled the 14-month-old government
led by ousted president Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in a coup, signed an
agreement in October with the Economic Community of West African
States, promising to hand over power to Kabbah by April 22 this
year.
</P>
<P>
But the junta lately insisted on renegotiating the peace
accord, citing the delay in disarmament and delivery of
international aids, which were scheduled to start in December.
</P>
<P>
The military regime also refused to disarm its army and wanted
to diminish the role of Nigeria in the west African peacekeeping
force (ECOMOG).
</P>
<P>
The UN team was due in Freetown last week but the visit was
delayed as the junta wanted it to stay in Freetown proper instead
of suburb Lungi, where ECOMOG is based.
</P>
<P>
It is not known why the team has gone to downtown Freetown
directly. But the presence of the team in Sierra Leone is
expected to promote the resolution of crisis there.
</P>
<P>
Okello has said earlier that peace plan is still feasible and
the April 22 terminal date could be stuck to although problems
remain unsolved.

<HEADLINE> Group of 77 Chairmanship Shifted from Tanzania to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has officially
handed over the chairmanship of the Group of 77 to Indonisia,
reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's Minister for Foreign Affairs and International
Co-operation, Jakaya Kikwete, has expressed appreciation to all
member states for their support, a fax message from New York
said.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete, who is on a visit to the United States, has called on
member countries to make contributions to the group, including
paying arrears fully and timely.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian foreign minister met the United Nations
Secretary General Koffi Annan on Tuesday and then left New York
for Washington D.C. today.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the minister is expected to be a guest speaker at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington
to discuss the Great Lakes Region issues.
</P>
<P>
The Group of 77 was formed in 1964 after 77 developing
countries made a joint declaration at an international conference
in Geneva. In the declaration, the countries vowed to unite with
each other to safeguard their own economic interests. As
developing countries become increasingly important in
international affairs, more and more countries have joined the
group, but its name remains unchanged.

<HEADLINE> UK Farmers Welcome EU Proposal on Easing Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- British farmers welcomed this
evening the European Union (EU) executive Commission's latest
proposal on easing the 15-nation bloc's worldwide ban on British
beef exports.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission put forward early today in Strasbourg a
proposal to exempt Northern Ireland beef from the total ban on the
grounds that the region kept a computer database on its cattle
movements.
</P>
<P>
Sir David Naish, president of the British National Farmers
Union, said in a statement, "It is a first step in the right
direction. The Commission's proposal provides the industry with a
much-needed glimmer of hope and a morale boost."
</P>
<P>
However, Naish stressed that the overall lifting of the ban on
British beef products exports imposed in March 1996 was still the
top priority.
</P>
<P>
Early today, British Agriculture Minister Jack Cunningham told
BBC Radio, "It's something we've worked tremendously hard for,
both in terms of the actions we are taking here in the UK and in
discussions with our colleagues in the commission and Council of
Ministers and the European Parliament."
</P>
<P>
The EU proposal is expected to be presented to the EU Standing
Veterinary Committee and the EU agriculture ministers meeting next
month for further discussion.

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin Returns Home After Tajikistan Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin winded up his trip to Tajikistan and left for Moscow
today, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day visit the two sides signed several economic
agreements, including an accord on cooperation and exchange of
information on tax legislation, a cooperation agreement between
Tajikistan's national fuel and energy company Barki Tojik and
Russia's RAO Unified Energy System, a cooperation agreement
between the defense ministries, and a civil defense cooperation
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin had intensive talks with Tajik President Emomali
Rakhmonov and after that the two sides issued a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
It said that the two countries considered "burning issues and
prospects for Tajik-Russian cooperation, including (that) in the
context of inter-Tajik political settlement."
</P>
<P>
In the statement they also expressed satisfaction with
Tajikistan's peace process and noted the importance of a peace
deal singed in Moscow in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
The talks were concentrated on issues of trade and economic
cooperation between the two countries, the statement said, noting
that its current volume is lower than the potential possibilities
of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Before the visit to Tajikistan Chernomyrdin paid a two-day
visit to Turkmenistan, where the two side signed an agreement on
avoiding dual taxation but failed to reach an accord on Turkmen
gas transportation to Commonwealth of Independent States markets
and Europe through Russian territory.

<HEADLINE> Water Hyacinth Threatens Power Station of Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Water hyacinth is threatening
to clog the water intakes at the Kafue gorge hydro electricity
power station 50 kilometres from Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Touring today the power station, energy and water development
minister Benjamin Mwila said there is need to control the spread
of the weed, which has almost covered the entire dam.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the Zambian army should be contracted to
remove the weeds manually before they get out of control.
</P>
<P>
Managing director of the Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation
(ZESCO), Robinson Mwansa, told the former defence minister that
the task force has raised 30 million Kwacha (about 20,000 U.S.
dollars) in a bid to control the weeds.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out the use of chemicals because of the possible
environmental impact on the ecosystem and people, especailly at
the Lusaka water supply intake.
</P>
<P>
Acting power station manager Mulako Sililo said the weeds at
the intakes are being controlled manually by using metal barriers
and cranes but the weeds are spreading at a fast pace.
</P>
<P>
The Kafue weeds, which covers more than 20 kilometres stretch
of the dam, have been a source of concern to environmentalists
and the government because of the potential danger it is posing
to the environment.
</P>
<P>
The road and railway bridges could be damaged by the pressure
of the weed being exerted on the pillars. The weeds are also
contributing to water loss, which in turn has led to reduced
power supply.

<HEADLINE> German Parliament Starts Probe Into Neo-Nazi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A German parliament committee
today started an investigation into a series of neo-Nazi scandals
last year that have brought serious image damage to the German
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The probe, urged by the German opposition parties, the Social
Democratic Party (SPD) and the Greens, was prompted mainly by a
major scandal last December after a convicted neo-Nazi, Manfred
Roeder, was found to have been invited to deliver a speech in 1995
to a German military academy training top officers.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a number of video tapes were also made public last
year depicting neo-Nazi behavior of German soldiers ranging from
giving the Nazi salute to staging mock executions and rapes.
</P>
<P>
German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe has insisted that these
cases were isolated incidents and did not prove that rightist
extremism was rampant within the army.
</P>
<P>
Officials from German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling coalition
today accused opposition parties of trying to discredit both the
German army and the defense minister in an election-year tactic.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
today sustained Tuesday's recovery and ended up for the second day
in a row, boosted by Asian markets' strong advances.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index of leading shares rose for a second
day, reassured by an overnight recovery in Asian markets and on
Wall Street. But the index failed to hold its best levels after
the Dow's hesitant opening today.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE index closed 23 points up at 5,106.9, recovering from
its sharp fall early this week.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that despite the rise, it remained broadly stuck
between 5,220 and 4,985 where it has traded since early December.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt closed 30.68 points higher at
4,190.08. Overnight gains on Wall Street and renewed dollar
strength helped the market to a firmer close at the end of the
trading.
</P>
<P>
The Paris CAC-40 index had surged over 1 percent during the
morning but later it was dragged down to close only 16.87 points
up at 2,919.80.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, French traders said the signs were that the market
would resume the climb it began two weeks ago, as long as Asia
remained calm and Wall Street positive.

<HEADLINE> WB Likely to accept Nigeria's Foreign Debt Figure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has indicated
that it would like to accept Nigeria's external debt figure of 27
billion U.S. Dollars as authentic, Finance Minister Anthony Ani
disclosed today.
</P>
<P>
The figure was arrived at after serious reconsideration with
various groups of creditors which began in 1996, the Nigerian
Television Authority reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund (IMF) do not have their figures about Nigeria's
foreign debt stock, "but they rely on our figures".
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government announced early this month that the
country's foreign debt had reduced from 28 billion Dollars in
1996 to 27 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
But its creditors, including the Paris and London clubs,
estimated the figure should be much more.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the World Bank is sending a team to Nigeria to take
our figures and use as a basis for the debt stock," Ani said.
</P>
<P>
According to the government TV station, the debt verification
exercise enabled the country to reduce its debt stock from 32.58
billion Dollars in 1995 to the present figure.
</P>
<P>
However some scepticism has been expressed as to how the debt
reduction has been achieved.
</P>
<P>
In response to this, Ani said the situation was true, adding
that "we have been repaying our debts at two billion Dollars
every year. Since I became finance minister, I've paid eight
billion Dollars".
</P>
<P>
To quicken the pace of the debt reduction exercise, Nigeria
has decided to phase out its dual foreign exchange system. The
step is seen by analysts as helpful in pursuit of debt
rescheduling by the World Bank and IMF.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that a team of the Bretton Woods financial
institutions is expected in Nigeria next month to hold
discussions with officials of the Finance Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Britain Reject Legalizing Cannabis on Prescription </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The British government on
Wednesday rejected fresh calls for cannabis to be made available
on prescription for medicinal purpose.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Paul Boateng told the parliament the case had
not yet been proven for the drug's therapeutic use.
</P>
<P>
To make it available on prescription would be "irresponsible,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The use of cannabis to relieve the suffering of the chronically
sick was outlawed 27 years ago in a court ruling.
</P>
<P>
"To allow any substance -- not just cannabis -- to be
prescribed (by a doctor) without adequate proof of its
effectiveness and safety would be a highly irresponsible and
retrograde step," Boateng said.
</P>
<P>
Until 1971, British doctors were free to prescribe cannabis,
although it was against the law to possess the drug without
medical permission.
</P>
<P>
Then the government tightened up the regulations, taking
cannabis off a list of prescribable drugs which still includes
heroin and cocaine.
</P>
<P>
Labor's backbencher Austin Mitchell appealed to Boateng to
restore cannabis to the list, arguing that many people suffering
from conditions such as multiple sclerosis were defying the law
because they found cannabis brought them relief from pain.
</P>
<P>
Debate on the use of cannabis has intensified since the
government was embarrassed last month by revelations that Interior
Minister Jack Straw's son had sold a small package of the drug for
10 pounds ($16) to a reporter operating under cover.

<HEADLINE> 3 Former Zairean Generals Released in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Three former Zairean
generals, arrested in South Africa in December on charges of
attempting to enter the country with illegal passports, were
released today, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The three generals, Kpama Baramoto, Mudima Mavua and Ngbale
Nzimbi, have been accused of being involved in a plot to kill
Laurent Kabila, whose forces toppled the government of late
Zairean president Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
The Kabila government requested the extradition of the
generals in mid-December, but the South African side said no
decision would be made until an investigation was finalized.
</P>
<P>
Pretoria High Court Judge B. R. du Plessis today directed the
immediate release of them from custody, saying that the detention
was unwarranted and unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
The three fled Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, seven months before Mobutu was overthrown in May last
year.
</P>
<P>
The generals contended in court papers that they were refugees
who were entitled to political asylum in South Africa.

UNITED NATIONS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to
the United Nations Bill Richardson said here today that he is
optimistic about a diplomatic solution to the recent clash between
Iraq and the United Nations over Iraq's weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
"I think the world community's optimism is waning, too.
Patience is waning thin. But we should not abandon diplomacy,"
Richardson told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We want to resolve this issue diplomatically, but we will not
hesitate to use military action. That is a decision the president
will have to make. But we want to exhaust all diplomatic and other
peace initiatives to resolve this crisis," he added.
</P>
<P>
Richardson made the remarks in response to the January 12
decision by the Iraqi Government which announced to ban an
American-led weapons inspection team from working Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has said the team is dominated by Americans and Britons
and accused the American team leader Scott Ritter of spying for
the United States.

<HEADLINE> French Senate Torpedoes Liberal Nationality Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The French Senate Wednesday
torpedoed the new liberal draft law on nationality presented by
the Socialist government, and adopted a nationality law which is
completely different from the original version presented by
Minister of Justice Elisabeth Guigou.
</P>
<P>
The senate removed the clause on automatic acquisition of
French nationality by all children born of foreign parents in
France at the age of 18 if they have lived in France for five
years.
</P>
<P>
The adopted version of the law maintains that a child born in
France of foreign parents must "demonstrate" his or her will to
become a French citizen between the age of 16 and 21, before
obtaining French nationality.
</P>
<P>
The senate also scrapped the clause on granting French
nationality immediately to all who are married with French
citizens, and instead requires a two-year period of application
for French citizenship by foreigners married with French citizens.
</P>
<P>
The right-dominated senate voted 218 for and 95 against for the
totally revised text of nationality law. Ironically, all the
senators of the rightwing Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR)
and Union for French Democracy (UDF) voted for the text, while the
Socialist and Communist senators voted against.
</P>
<P>
The original version of the law was narrowly adopted by the
left-dominated National Assembly last month, despite fierce
opposition from the RPR and UDF deputies.

<HEADLINE> Israel Decides Security Interests in West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Cabinet decided
Wednesday the "vital security interests" to Israel in the West
Bank which will form the basis of Israel's positions on the final
status talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The ministers approved a list of security zones that Israel
would retain in a permanent peace agreement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The security zones include western and eastern strips of the
West Bank, areas surrounding Jerusalem, Jewish settlements,
military bases, strategic roads, Jewish historical sites and water
sources.
</P>
<P>
That means Israel must keep control over most areas of the West
Bank in a permanent peace arrangement. The Palestinians, however,
rejected the decision as a violation of agreements Israel has
already signed.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have hoped to gain control over 90 percent of
the West Bank in a final peace settlement and set up a state on
West Bank and Gaza strip, with Arab east Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Cabinet move further dimmed the prospect for a
breakthough in the stalled Middle East peace process. U.S.
President Bill Clinton has decided to personally intervene by
meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat separately in Washington later
this month.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli ministers did not come up with any maps or
percentages of West Bank lands that they would hand over to the
Palestinians in the long-overdue second troop redeployment as
Washington demanded.
</P>
<P>
They will continue to meet again in order to finalize Israel's
principles concerning troop withdrawal, which Netanyahu will take
to his talks with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli ministers also adopted a 12-page list of
commitments and obligations they require the Palestinians to
fulfill before any redeployment can be carried out.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians signed the Hebron accord early last
year pledging a three-stage troop pullback from West Bank by
mid-1998. But the second phase has never materialized because of
Israeli-Palestinian dispute over the scope of withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Annoyed by the Israel's recalcitrance, Washington is putting
pressure on Netanyahu to live up to its promises and take a bigger
step in pullback in order to restart the peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- British agriculture minister
Jack Cunningham said on Wednesday that the government was planning
to set up a new Food Standards Agency to tackle food safety and
boost consumer confidence in the industry.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham told the parliament that the agency would be "a
powerful new body, able to publish its advice to ministers, free
of vested interests and able to act clearly and decisively at all
stages of the food chain."
</P>
<P>
He said 12 independent commissioners with a wide range of
expertise, backed by advisory committees and civil servants, would
direct it.
</P>
<P>
The agency would have powers across the food chain from animal
foodstuffs, meat and milk hygiene, the micro-biological safety of
food, food additives and chemical contamination.
</P>
<P>
It would also assess new food applications, including
genetically modified food and provide information and advice on
food allergies.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham said the new organization would not tell people what
to eat but would ensure they had the information they needed to
make choices. He said it would also help business by having the
credibility to reassure consumers about food when necessary.

<P>
BONN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Germany's central bank president
Hans Tietmeyer today rejected warnings about a deflation danger in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The danger of a sharp and abrupt drop in prices as had been
witnessed in some Asian countries did not exist in Germany because
there had been no artificial bloating of share and property prices
in the country, Tietmeyer said in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
Any prolonged decline in general price levels for goods and
services could also be tackled with monetary measures in Germany,
he added.
</P>
<P>
He also referred to the less important role played by private
shareholders in Germany and the relatively moderate indebtedness
of private German households as factors which speak against a
deflation.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the German banking industry had not been weakened by
monetary tremors as in some other countries, Tietmeyer said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Praises China's Financial Stabilizing Effect (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Pieter Bottelier, a senior
advisor of the World Bank, said today that China has been
important as a financial stabilizer in Asia and urged it to
step up the reforms of state-owned enterprises and banks.
</P>
<P>
In discussing the financial crisis in Asia, Bottelier said that
without China, the situation in Asia could have gotten even worse.
</P>
<P>
He said that one reason why China has not been affected by the
recent Asian financial crisis, which started with the sharp
devaluation of the Thai currency in July, is that China has a
relatively modest level of external debt and the maturity
structure of its foreign debt is healthy.
</P>
<P>
World Bank figures indicate that short-term debts account for
only about 15 percent of China's external debts, which were valued
at around 118 billion US dollars by the end of last June.
</P>
<P>
Bottelier was chief of the World Bank's resident mission in
China until last July. He said that the Chinese yuan's
inconvertibility under capital account means China is relatively
well protected from capital flight or speculative attacks.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia, he said, China has a

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A photo history of the civil
rights movement in the United States opens here today, the 69th
anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s birth, before beginning a
six-year, nationwide tour.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the National Museum of American History, the
exhibit called "We Shall Overcome" contains about 75 scenes from
the period beginning with the 1954 Supreme Court decision
outlawing school segregation and ending in 1968 when King was
assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
Martin Luther King Day will be marked Monday.
</P>
<P>
One photo shows King being booked on a charge of loitering in
Montgomery, Alabama, 40 years ago. It was his third arrest.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will be in Washington until February 8, before
heading for San Jose, California, on February 21. Later this year,
it is to make two stops in Georgia -- Savannah and Macon.
</P>

<HEADLINE> International Leprosy Congress to Be Held in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Scientists will discuss
eliminating leprosy in the world in the next century at the 15th
International Leprosy Congress in Beijing from September 7 to 12.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and foreign scientists, health officials, and recovered
patients will also discuss new preventive measures and treatments
for the ancient disease, which is believed to be at least 3,000
years old. It can cause serious skin damage and disfigurement, but
is both controllable and curable.
</P>
<P>
China's quarantine officials last year asked all ports of entry
to drop the leprosy question from a health form people entering
China fill out.
</P>
<P>
The congress will give China an opportunity to show
developments in controlling leprosy for the past half century,
said Wan Liya, an official with the Health Ministry's Department
of Disease Control.
</P>
<P>
The number of reported leprosy cases in China has dropped to
fewer than 10,000, compared with some 500,000 in the early 1950s,
and about ten million in the rest of the world now, Wan said.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-five percent of China's counties have kept the rate of
incidence to below 1 per 100,000 people, the nation's standard for
basic elimination of the disease, and more than 95 percent of its
counties will achieve this goal by the year 2000, she said.
</P>
<P>
She attributed the decline in the number of cases to a
surveillance network and to multi-drug therapy introduced in 1982
that has proven effective in stopping the leprosy virus and curing
patients.
</P>
<P>
Leprosy was long regarded as a terrible curse in China because
of lack of a cure and scientific understanding, and patients were
usually kept isolated from their families and communities and
suffered discrimination, Wan said.
</P>
<P>
But, most leprosy patients in China now receive treatment at
home and live with ordinary people, because medical care has
improved and the public are more aware of the truth about the
disease, she noted.

<HEADLINE> Russia Deeply Concerned over U.S.- Baltic Charter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia has expressed "deep
concern" over the Partnership Charter to be signed by the
presidents of the United States, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania on
Friday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, the Anti-NATO commission
of the Russian State Duma Thursday issued a statement voicing
their disapproval. The statement said that since the Baltic states
have refused to accept the security guarantees proposed by the
Russian president, the upcoming signing of the U.S. and Baltic
charter clearly indicates the beginning of preparations for the
next stage of NATO's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
"The involvement of the Baltics in NATO structures is actually
under way," the statement noted, adding that it has been proved by
recent visits of Pentagon representatives to those countries
and the military exercises held there with the U.S. and other NATO
countries' participation.
</P>
<P>
The commission also urged President Boris Yeltsin and the
government to "immediately start developing a national program of
resisting NATO enlargement."
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the Russian foreign ministry issued a
statement claiming that Moscow does not want to see any negative
effects from the U.S.- Baltic partnership charter to European
security.
</P>
<P>
Russia welcomes any step aimed at creating a good neighborly
relationship based on equality and cooperation in the Baltic
region in order to set up a new Europe without boundaries, the
ministry added.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that Moscow's position toward the Charter would
be decided by whether or not the contents of the document met with
the goal proposed by Russia.

<HEADLINE> More Overseas Companies Build Presence in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The total number of overseas
companies registered in Hong Kong stood at 5,067 at the end of
1997, 463 or 10 percent more compared with the end of 1996,
official figures showed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Figures from Registrar of Companies Gordon Jones also revealed
that the number of new overseas companies establishing a place of
business in Hong Kong in 1997 was 713, up 7 percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey released earlier this month by the
Industry Department, Hong Kong remains an attractive base for
overseas companies to build their regional operations.
</P>
<P>
However, the figures showed that the total number of companies
registered under the Companies Ordinance was 474,517 at the end of
1997, 1.8 percent less than a year earlier. The number of newly
registered companies during the year was 49,275, marginally less
than that of 1996 by 459.
</P>
<P>
The net increase in the number of companies on register is the
result of the removal of over 46,000 companies in 1997 which
failed to file annual returns for two or more consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
The removal is part of the extensive striking off exercise
carried out by the Companies Registry over the past three and a
half years to remove the register companies which had been
commercially defunct for many years.

KUWAIT CITY, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Stock Exchange
Market witnessed a marginal drop of 2 percent in the week ending

</P>
<P>
The index closed at 2,602.9 points on Wednesday, down 57.3
points over from a week earlier, according to the report.

BRUSSELS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Economic development in the

Eurostat, the statistical arm of the union, today said that
data on industrial confidence, consumer confidence and investment
led to forecasts of growth for 2.6 percent, 3.0 percent and 3.1
percent in the European economy during the years from 1997 to

<P>
HANOI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's urban unemployment rate
has nearly reached 7 percent which is cause for concern by the
International Labor Organization, reported the "Vietnam Economic
Times" Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment situation is worsening in Vietnam's 25 cities
and provinces, said the official weekly. It describes the rate in
the country's five major cities and provinces -- Hanoi, Hai Phong,
Ho Chi Minh City, Vung Tau and Can Tho -- as "alarming."
</P>
<P>
Hanoi and Hai Phong are posting jobless rates of 8.09 and 8.56
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has a population of about 40 million people who are
able to enter the work force and it increases by 1.4 to 1.5
million annually.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Department of Statistics was quoted as
saying that the "labour supply is increasing but the level of
expertise is not. We have too many unskilled and not enough
skilled workers."
</P>
<P>
The statistics of the Ministry of Labour, War Invalids and
Social Affairs also shows that the number of people employed is
declining in rural and urban areas.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, some 72 percent of the population considered
employable in urban areas and 84 percent in rural areas were
involved in regular employment, a drop of 1.66 percentage points
and 2.57 percentage points respectively over the previous year.

BUDAPEST, January 15 (Xinhua) -- In an effort to eliminate

<P>
So far, about 100 Hungarians have been charged with the
offense, and three of them have been sentenced.

<HEADLINE> UNSCOM Chief to Meet French FM Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The chief of the United Nations
special commission in charge of disarmament in Iraq (UNSCOM),
Richard Butler, will meet with French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine Friday in Paris before continuing on to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said
Thursday that Butler will also meet with French Defense Ministry
officials during his brief stay in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Butler will fly to Baghdad to seek a solution to the renewed
confrontation between Iraq and an UNSCOM team headed by U.S. Gulf
War veteran Scott Ritter, which was blocked from carrying out
their work Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq suspects Ritter is a U.S. secret agent, which he was
denied.
</P>
<P>
The French spokeswoman also described the recent blocking of
the UNSCOM team by Iraq as "unacceptable," and said the
U.N. Security Council resolution Wednesday, which expressed regret
over the blocking, is a "firm signal of support" to Butler.
</P>
<P>
"The decision made by the Iraqi authorities in terms of the
mission is unacceptable and resulted in this kind of reaction. The
resolution and the unity of the Security Council, which it
demonstrates, are important and will allow Richard Butler to go to
Iraq armed with the full support of the Security Council's
members," she added.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea's Government Reform Committee Unveils Draft Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 15 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's President-elect Kim
Dae-jung's government reform committee today revealed its plans to
reorganize government bodies.
</P>
<P>
The plans are designed to streamline the government through
the abolition or mergers of agencies to make it smaller but more
efficient.
</P>
<P>
The committee will make its final decision by the end of this
month after holding public hearings on the draft plans.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly (parliament) plans to pass a government
reorganization bill at a special session slated to open early next
month.
</P>
<P>
Kim will be sworn in as the president of the country next month.
</P>
<P>
Under the plans, the positions of deputy prime ministers will
be abolished and the current 23 ministries and ministry-level
offices will be reduced to 16 or 17.
</P>
<P>
Presently, there are two deputy prime ministers, one in charge
of the economy and one responsible for national unification.
</P>
<P>
The presidential Advisory Council for Democratic and Peaceful
Unification will be put under the Ministry of National Unification.
</P>
<P>
The Office of First State Minister for Political Affairs, which
mainly handles government-party coordination, will be abolished.
</P>
<P>
Other agencies, which are to be abolished, include the Ministry
of Information and the Office of Legislation, whose functions will
be assumed by the Prime Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Government Administration will be canceled or
become a new ministry after merging with the Ministry of Home
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Environment, the Ministry of Labor Affairs and
the Ministry of Justice will remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The office of Second State Minister for Political Affairs,
which deals with women's affairs, will be changed into a ministry
or a presidential committee on women's policy.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education will remain unchanged or merge with
the Ministry of Science Technology or the Ministry of Culture and
Sports.
</P>
<P>
The committee, however, failed to reach an agreement on the major
contentious issues -- which agencies should control the office of
budget formation and the government personnel management
commission.
</P>
<P>
Some committee members suggested that the two organizations be
put under the presidential office, while others proposed that it
should be under the Prime Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
Government sources attributed the committee's failure to reach
a consensus to a tug-of-war between Kim's National Congress for
New Politics (NCNP) and his coalition partner, the United Liberal
Democrats (ULD).
</P>
<P>
The two parties have agreed to share power in the forthcoming
government by allocating the post of the prime minister to the
ULD.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Herbal Medicine Being Used To Heal Bone Fractures Faster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's Capital Bone Disease
Research Institute announced here today that it has developed a
powder that can help shorten healing time in fractures.
</P>
<P>
The powder was made using a traditional Chinese folk recipe
from 18 medicinal herbs, including radix notoginseng, flos
carthami, resina draconis, Chinese angelica root, and pyritum.
</P>
<P>
These ingredients are believed by traditional medicine doctors
to be able to stop bleeding, reduce swelling, and relieve pain .
</P>
<P>
Liu Haifeng, director of the institute, said that hospitals in
Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and other cities had found the medicine
effective for faster healing and some patients took less than a
month to mend. It normally takes at least three months for a bone
fracture to heal.
</P>
<P>
Yang Peisun, a pathology professor at Capital Medical
University in Beijing, said her studies have shown that the powder
promotes the secretion of growth hormone in human bodies to a
limited extent, and that research elsewhere has shown that growth
hormones play a vital role in the growth and mending of bones.
</P>
<P>
Shang Tianyu, president of the China Orthopedic Science Society,
said that the number of fracture patients in China is on the rise
as the number of migrant workers grows and the society ages.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, some 30 million Chinese suffer from
broken bones every year.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Parliament to Be Dissolved for Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho's parliament is
to be dissolved in mid-February to give way for the general
election in May, South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
"This is done to give political parties enough time to prepare
for elections," Lesotho's Foreign Minister Kelebone Maope was
quoted as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The election date is yet to be decided, but the poll would
have to take place within three months after the dissolution of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Independent electoral commission member Moriee Khaebana said
that so far only two parties, the Marematlou Freedom and the
Sefate Democratic Party, had registered for the election.
</P>
<P>
The commission had not decided on a deadline for party
registration because "it wants to bring everybody aboard", he
said.
</P>
<P>
Voters registration had begun and would take about six weeks,
Khaebana said.
</P>
<P>
A new registration method has been applied to ensure that
every voter has a new voter's card for the election, he said.
</P>
<P>
Only 55 percent of Lesotho's 2.2 million population, or 1.2
million people, were eligible to vote, although the country had
dropped the voting age from 21 to 18.
</P>
<P>
The incumbent parliament and government were inaugurated in
April, 1993 after a general election.

<HEADLINE> Iraq's Oil Export Resumes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has resumed exporting oil
from the Iraqi port of Al-Bakr and the Turkish port of Ceyhan
within the third phase of the oil-for-food deal between Iraq and
the U.N., the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted a source at the Iraq's Oil Marketing
Authority as saying that an oil tanker belonging to a French
company began Wednesday to be loaded with one million barrels of
crude oil in the Iraqi port of Al-Bakr, while an oil tanker
belonging to a Spanish company began to be loaded with one million
barrels of oil from the Turkish port of Ceyhan.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the next few days will see the arrival of
a large number of tankers to be loaded with Iraqi crude oil.
</P>
<P>
The INA said that Iraq exported more than 253 million barrels
of crude oil within the first and second phases of the
oil-for-food deal which came into effect on December 10, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The agreement allows Iraq to export 2 billion U.S. dollars of
oil over six months to buy food and other humanitarian goods for
its people hard hit by the seven-year-old U.N. sanctions imposed
on Iraq in 1990 for its invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Political Situation in Nepal Remains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The political situation in
the Himalayan kingdom of Nepal remains uncertain as King Birendra
is still undecided whether to dissolve parliament and hold
mid-term elections or to convene a special session of parliament
to discuss a no-confidence motion against the present government.
</P>
<P>
After days of consultations with advisors, legal experts and
party leaders, King Birendra on Tuesday referred himself to the
Supreme Court, the first time for the King to do so, and the court
has decided to hold discussions next Monday on the opinion it is
to offer to the King, dashing hopes of a speedy decision by the
constitutional monarch.
</P>
<P>
It is understandable that the King took this step as he bears
in mind that in August 1995, the Supreme Court overturned a
recommendation by then prime minister Man Mohan Adhikary of the
Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) to
dissolve parliament and hold fresh polls and reinstated the
dissolved parliament.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that dissolution was not allowed if an
alternative government could be formed from the existing
parliament.
</P>
<P>
But a year earlier, the same court held that then prime
minister Girija Prasad Koirala of the Nepali Congress (NC) was
within his constitutional authority to recommend dissolution of
parliament and holding of mid-term polls.
</P>
<P>
The petition by Prime Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa last
Thursday to dissolve parliament and call fresh polls and that by
the main opposition CPN-UML on the same day to convene a special
session of parliament to discuss its no-confidence motion against
the government are both constitutional, making it really hard for
the King to make a choice.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Thapa made the call for fresh polls after
learning that 87 MPs from the CPN-UML and nine from his own
National Democratic Party (RPP) had planned a no-confidence motion
against his coalition government formed by the NC, the RPP and the
Nepal Sadbhavana Party (NSP).
</P>
<P>
Thapa's is the fourth coalition government in Nepal since the
mid-term polls in late 1994. He came to power on October 7, 1997
after the NC brought down the former coalition government with a
no-confidence motion.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister claimed that his recommendation came out
hours before the opposition's, therefore should enjoy precedence
in treatment from the King.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML argued that it has mustered a majority of 103 votes
in the 205-seat Lower House needed to topple the government and
that its petition was made before the final dissolution of
parliament, so the Lower House must be summoned.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court on Wednesday issued directives to the Nepal
Bar Association, the Supreme Court Bar Association and the
CPN-UML, the NC, the RPP and the NSP as well as the government to
nominate legal advisers to serve as amicus curiae.
</P>
<P>
No one knows exactly when the court will come up with an
opinion. But the general public are fed up with the political
instability in the country, and hope that fresh polls might put an
end to the situation of a hung parliament and send a majority
government to power.

<P>
NEW DELHI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- India produced a record 805
million kg of tea in 1997, up by 25 million kg compared with that
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here Thursday, Percy Siganporia,
an official from the Consultative Committee on Plantation
Association, said that the real production could be a little more
than the estimate of 805 million kg. The record production was led
by a surge in harvest by south India, which produced 205 million
kg.
</P>
<P>
With production shortfall in African nations and renewed buying
interest from Commonwealth of Independent State (CIS) Countries,
India's tea exports increased by 34 million kg to 190 million kg
in 1997 against that in 1996.

<P>
PERTH, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese swimming delegation
hold a press conference here on Thursday following the four
Chinese swimmers tested positive in "A" samples in
out-of-competition doping checks.
</P>
<P>
The world governing body -- International Swimming Federation
(FINA) announced on Wednesday Chinese swimmers Cai Huijue, Wang
Luna, Zhang Yi and Wang Wei had tested positive in their "A"
samples for the banned substance diuretic in January 8 doping
checks.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Jiawei, secretary-general of the Chinese swimming
Association (CSA), said the CSA's anti-doping commission was going
to make its own investigation into the four positive cases.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to make an investigation to find out why the
samples of these four swimmers have traces of a banned drug," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"If they are proven that they have taken the banned drug, the
Chinese Swimming Association will impose heavy penalty on them,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Yuan reaffirmed CSA's stand against doping.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Swimming Association has been insisting on its
policy of strict stipulation, strict testing and strict
punishment," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to cooperate with FINA to ensure healthy
development of the sport," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the Swedish Swimming Federation's decision to pull
its swimmers out of the Beijing Swimming World Cup will do the
sport no good.
</P>
<P>
"The Swedish Federation regards individual cases as a
collective action. It's not fair," Yuan said.

<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin told a
group of provincial publicity departments officials today that
publicity departments should do a practical and active job of
holding the banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory high.
</P>
<P>
Building socialism with China's characteristics was the theme
of the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) and the Party's work theme.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee,
praised the publicity departments for their work in 1997 and their
contribution to the country's reforms, development, stability, and
material and ideological progress.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, he said, publicity departments should help promote a
new upsurge of studying Deng Xiaoping Theory among the masses, and
should ask them to sum up the experience they gained in their
efforts to combine the Party Central Committee's line and policies
with local realities, emancipating their minds, and seeking truth
from facts.
</P>
<P>
Jiang asked the publicity personnel to educate the masses with
better ideology, scientific theory, a lofty spirit, and correct
opinion.
</P>
<P>
"Comrades working in the publicity sector should fully
understand that yours is a highly glorious and very hard job," he
told the audience. "You should specially value and love it,
because of its glory, and you should always work diligently,
because of its difficulties."

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Praises Late Marshal Luo Ronghuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin attended
a forum today discussing the recently published Military writings
of Luo Ronghuan, who fought to expand the revolutionary bases and
the Communist Party of China's armed forces before 1949 and was
one of the founders of the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
Luo was born in Hengshan County, Hunan Province, in 1902, and
died in 1963. He became a marshal in 1955. He was the director of
the General Political Department of PLA, vice chairman of the
National People's Congress Standing Committee and a member of the
CPC Central Committee Political Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Jiang asked those attending the forum to learn from the late
Marshal Luo's glorious deeds, revolutionary thinking, and lofty
morals, and called him a faithful fighter, a tested proletarian
revolutionary and strategist, an outstanding Party, state, and
army leader.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of the New China in 1949, Luo held a
number of important state and army posts, and made a great
contribution to the socialist cause, Jiang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Both Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping praised Luo for his great
personality and faithfulness to the Party, Jiang said, calling the
late leader a model of faithfulness to the Party who adhered to
principles. As a political leader in the army, Luo always took
absolute leadership of the army by the Party as the principal task
of political work, he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Gov't to Revise Budget and Conduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
announced Thursday that the government will revise the State Draft
Budget for the 1998/99 fiscal year to include a review of the
predicted inflation rate, economic growth and government savings.
</P>
<P>
"The government has also decided to repeal the luxury tax and
import duty exemption granted to the Timor Putra National
(national car project)," the president told the press following a
meeting with visiting International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing
Director Michel Camdessus here.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto also announced the revocation of monopolies of flour,
sugar and soybean given to the National Logistics Agency (Bulog),
meaning the agency will only control the rice trade.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will establish a council to be charged
with stabilizing the economic, financial and monetary situation in
Indonesia. The president will directly control the council.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the revision of the budget plan in 1998/99 (from
April 1 to March 31), Soeharto said the government will review the
oil subsidy, which is projected to cost 10.1 trillion rupiah (1.3
billion U.S. dollars), even he knows it could be a burden to the
people.
</P>
<P>
The president added that the government will also change the
inflation estimate from nine to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the press conference, he urged private banks, particularly
those which may be in jeopardy, to merge with bank with a solid
record of performance.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no further liquidation," he stressed. In the
future, he said, banks experiencing a specific problem, like a
lack of capital, will be temporarily suspended and allowed to
resume operations after the problem is resolved.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Camdessus, Soeharto signed a letter of
intent, which is a statement that he will implement 50 specific
economic and financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto expressed his satisfaction that the IMF chief fully
supports the restructuring and reform programs.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement is aimed at solving economic and monetary
crises. It also seeks to restore public confidence in their own
currency and foreign confidence (in the Indonesian government),"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The State Draft Budget is not yet final and it should be
discussed with the House of Representatives (DOR)," he told the
press.
</P>
<P>
He added that his administration tried, while developing the
budget, to reflect governmental and national concerns.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto pointed out, "Indonesia, which is now apprehensive,
tried to reflect that apprehension in the State Draft Budget. But
they (the IMF, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank) have
decided that the budget does not thoroughly reflect the nation's
concerns."
</P>
<P>
The government, he said, kept trying to devise a four percent
growth rate in the budget, but the IMF insists it would be better
if the rate is zero per cent.
</P>
<P>
"Inflation is nine percent. but the IMF thinks the right figure
should be 20 percent," he said, adding that if the government sets
the exchange rate for the rupiah at 4,000 per dollar, the IMF
wants it to be 5,000 per dollar."
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, like other Southeast Asian countries, has been badly
hit by the current monetary crisis. The rupiah has lost more than
200 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar since July last
year.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, Indonesia agreed an IMF-led 23 billion
U.S. dollar bailout package. In exchange, Indonesia vowed to
dismantle trading monopoly, overhaul the financial sector, and
scrap or suspend costly infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF was reportedly dissatisfied over the
Indonesian reforms in past few months, so the IMF and U.S.
officials came here last week and resulted in a new agreement
which just announced by the IMF chief Camdessus here on Thursday.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina on Thursday inaugurated the one-day three-South Asian
nation business summit, which is aimed at accelerating economic
cooperation in the subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, India and Pakistan "share a common history and a
common heritage," and the meeting "reflects our shared commitment
to join hands ... for a better future for the 1.2 billion people"
in the three countries, Hasina told the inaugural session,
attended by her Indian and Pakistani counterparts, Inder Kumar
Gujral and Nawaz Sharif, and other government officials and
business leaders.
</P>
<P>
"We can overcome our poverty and bring prosperity to our region
if we can forge strong economic links," she said.
</P>
<P>
Hasina noted that South Asia provides excellent investment
opportunities for foreign investors and is collectively committed
to create a congenial environment for business.
</P>
<P>
Describing the three-nation summit as a "historic occasion,"
Gujral said, "We have come together ... to see how we can jointly
work together to usher in a new era of cooperation and prosperity
for our peoples."
</P>
<P>
He cited the European Union, the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations as
examples that a free trade area in South Asia should be
established.
</P>
<P>
For his part Sharif said Pakistan is committed to the idea of a
friendly and cooperative South Asia engaged in mutually beneficial
economic activities, and to the establishment of the South Asian
Free Trade Area, to liberalize trade and open up new vistas for
economic and commercial cooperation within the region.
</P>
<P>
"We need to develop collective positions in international fora
on issues of common concern," he said, emphasizing that the summit
"would lead toward greater economic and commercial cooperation"
within the region.
</P>
<P>
Following the inaugural session is a working session, at which
Bangladesh will present a paper on infrastructure, India on energy
and Pakistan on trade.
</P>
<P>
The summit will adopt a joint declaration to set a new trend of
economic cooperation in the South Asian Subcontinent, according to
Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the prime ministers of the three
nations to meet outside the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation forum to tackle exclusively economic issues among
them, keeping aside political differences and other disputes.
</P>
<P>
The summit between Bangladesh, India and Pakistan was
originally proposed by Hasina in May last year.

<P>
BRUSSELS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- European Union unemployment
rate fell slightly from 10.7 percent from July-to-August to 10.6
percent by the end of last November, Eurostat reported today.

unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Belgium, Luxembourg, Sweden, Finland, Britain, France, Portugal
and Ireland all registered decreases whereas Germany, Spain and
Austria retained the same rate in unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Spain's 20.8 percent was still by far EU's highest rate where
the lowest was Luxembourg's 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
A slight rise continued in Italy, where unemployment was up by
0.1 point to 12.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sweden posted the biggest drop to 9.2 percent from 9.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Garment, Textile Exports Soar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine garment and textile
exports in 1997 amounted to 2.95 billion US dollars, up by 5.41
percent from 1996 figure, data released by the Garment and Textile
Export Board showed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The data attributed this surge to high purchase of the United
States which accounted for 1.6 billion dollars, over 60 percent of
the country's total garment exports to the world.
</P>
<P>
The country's high exports to the United States had caused the
slight decline of the country's exports to Europe, which dropped
by 4 percent to 390 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Exports to Canada, meanwhile, improved by 7.4 percent to 60
million dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Data said sales to non-quota countries also plunged by 4
percent last year from 675 million dollars to 647 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Exports to leading non-quota countries were: Japan, 133.8
million dollars and United Arab Emirates, 91.1 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Demand for the country's apparel products remained high as
shipment reached 2.36 billion dollars followed by non-apparel and
textile at 357.8 million dollars and 213.6 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Minister Hails Egyptian-Syrian Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Labor Minister Ali Khalil
Thursday hailed the outcome of the summit held in Damascus between
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad on the latest developments in the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Cairo-based Voice of Arabs Radio, the
Syrian minister referred to the two leaders' keenness to maintain
consultations between them in the interest of the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak paid a brief lightning visit to Damascus on Wednesday
for talks with al-Assad on the current impasse in the Mideast
peace process and bilateral relations. The Egyptian leader
flew home later.
</P>
<P>
During their summit, the two leaders talked about the stalled
Mideast peace process, accusing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of being unserious in the peace march and seeking only
to gain land and peace together, Khalil said.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli logic runs contrary to history, people's will and
the international legitimacy resolutions," he added.
</P>
<P>
Syria has ruled out talks with Israel until Netanyahu accepts
full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, captured by the
Jewish state in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Syrian summit also dealt with the present
situation in Iraq, the Syrian minister told the radio. Both Egypt
and Syria seek to end the sufferings of the Iraqi people and call
on the U.N. to give up the double standard policy, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated the two countries' keenness to develop
bilateral ties and to accelerate the establishment of the proposed
Arab free trade zone as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
In Damascus, Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri and his
Syrian counterpart Mahmoud Zouebi co-chaired meetings, attended
by several ministers from both sides, on promoting economic ties,
and expediting the launch of an Arab common market.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Syria are members of the Damascus Declaration Group,
an eight-member organization also grouping the six states of the
Gulf Cooperation Council.

<HEADLINE> Donations Continue To Come In For Earthquake Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The China Charity Federation
(CCF) received a donation from a 14-year-old girl on the first
working day after the earthquake that hit Zhangjiakou in Hebei
Province on January 10.
</P>
<P>
The girl, Wu Yong, at Beijing's No. 4 Middle School, was one of
the first people in Beijing to offer help to quake victims in
Zhangjiakou 220 kilometers away. The earthquake, which measured
6.2 on the Richter scale, left 49 dead, 12,000 injured, and 44,000
homeless.
</P>
<P>
The CCF, which is China's largest humanitarian aid group, has
sent 1.3 million yuan (156,000 US dollars) in relief goods and
cash that was donated by Beijing residents, businesses, and
organizations, to the quake-stricken area.
</P>
<P>
One 72-year-old retiree rode his bike a long way to CCF
headquarters to make a 60-yuan donation from his tiny pension, and
one young woman, with her toddler in tow, braved the heavy snow to
add their 200-yuan donation.
</P>
<P>
"Some 30 young people have even volunteered to help collect
donations," according to Yang Tuan, vice-secretary-general of CCF.
</P>
<P>
And five college students who had final exams the next day took
bags of clothing and 1,500 yuan to the charitable organization in
the evening, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
CCF set up three places to make donations in downtown Beijing
for a week-long donation endeavor, on January 13. Some 8,000
woollen blankets, 1,000 quilts, and 1,000 boxes of instant noodles
from Hong Kong businesses, and tents valued at 5,000 US dollars
from a US company were sent to the quake-hit areas by train this
afternoon.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 750,000 people may be
fraudulently claiming income support and disability living
allowance worth 2 billion pounds (3.3 billion U.S. dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
A report, which was released by the National Audit Office
Thursday, said fraudulent disability benefit claims were estimated
at 500 million pounds (800 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
About 13 percent of disability living allowance claims in the
past year were excessive, and most overpayments to people with
disabilities resulted from exaggerated accounts of amounts spent
on care or mobility needs, it said.
</P>
<P>
Spending on benefits for the long-term sick and disabled has
doubled since the early 1990s. It is estimated by the Department
for Social Security at 23.9 billion pounds (383 billion dollars)
for the current financial year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Tony Blair started a nationwide tour
at Dudley in the West Midlands Thursday morning in a bid to rally
Labor support for his controversial campaign to modernize the
welfare state.
</P>
<P>
He said he was prepared to listen to concerns about the
program but was determined to press ahead with the benefit reform
which is at the heart of his governmental agenda.

<HEADLINE> IMF Head in Malaysia to Assess Monetary Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) will make a definitive judgment on Malaysia only after
it has assessed its fiscal and monetary policies, its Managing
Director Michel Camdessus said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus, who flew in from Indonesia earlier Thursday, had a
one-hour meeting with Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister and Finance
Minister Anwar Ibrahim here Thursday evening on the current
regional financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two sides discussed how the situation
since the attack on regional currencies began and the how policies
adopted by countries affected by the crisis have evolved,
particularly in South Korea and Indonesia, Camdessus told
reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said that he also sought Malaysia's perspective on the
issue, whose currency had depreciated by almost 96 percent to 4.88
against the U.S. dollar last week, but had since recovered
moderately to the 4.18 level.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Anwar, when approached by reporters on his meeting
with Camdessus, said "it was good meeting" and that Malaysia
would always use the opportunity to have adequate consultations
and explain the country's position to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The IMF head is scheduled to meet Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Friday and his IMF team will also hold
consultations with Malaysian officials from the State Bank and the
Finance Ministry on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said "At the end of the consultations, we will be
able to pass a definitive judgment."
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said the Washington-based agency welcomed steps taken
by Malaysia which were announced by Anwar last year to address the
fiscal situation.
</P>
<P>
The IMF head is visiting a number of Asian countries, including
South Korea, in efforts to mitigate the economic crisis facing the
region.
</P>
<P>
He will leave for Singapore later Friday.

<HEADLINE> Seoul's Foreign Reserves to Hit 24 Billion U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Despite increasing concerns about
South Korea's capacity to repay its debts, the nation can expand its
usable foreign reserves to 24 billion U.S. dollars before April,
said Minister of Finance and Economy Lim Chang-yuel Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lim told a news conference today that South Korea's full
implementation of the proposed International Monetary Fund reform
program will restore the nation's credibility in the world's
financial market and help further increase its foreign currency
holdings to 40.7 billion U.S. dollars by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
"Should the nation faithfully implement the IMF's recommended
reform programs and make continued efforts to regain international
confidence, the revised foreign exchange targets will be
achievable," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said the country's short-term debt rollover
rate surged from 32 percent last month to 78 percent now, while
the current-account balance, one of the key barometers in
upgrading international confidence, showed a surplus of 3.6
billion U.S. dollars last December.
</P>
<P>
The minister's upbeat forecasts came ahead of the
debt-restructuring talks between Seoul and international banks,
slated to open in New York on January 21.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Seoul's negotiation strategy, Lim said South
Korea will try to minimize the amount of government payment
guarantees to commercial bank short-term debts by converting them
into long-term debts.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's negotiation delegation, led by Assistant Minister
of Finance and Economy Chung Dok-ku and Kim Yong-hwan, an adviser
to President-elect Kim, will leave for New York Sunday.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister pointed out that the proportion of
short-term debt exceeds 58 percent, warning that the nation's
foreign exchange situations could deteriorate suddenly if reform
efforts slacken.

<HEADLINE> Iran Presents Islamic Books to Clinton's Daughter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A religious center of Iran has
forwarded a number of Islamic books, including the holy Koran, to
Chelsea Clinton, daughter of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Iran Daily Thursday reported that the books
were sent by the Islamic Science and Religious Center (ISRC).
</P>
<P>
The English language newspaper quoted ISRC head Faqih Imami as
saying that Chelsea Clinton wrote a letter to the center
requesting some Islamic literature books.
</P>
<P>
The ISRC, consequently, forwarded a three-volume interpretation
of the holy Koran entitled "Illumination of Koran in the
Interpretation of Koran," and a tradition book titled "a
Bouquet of Traditions and Narrations from the Garden of Prophet
and His Holy Household," Imami said.
</P>
<P>
The manager of the White House Gift Office has sent a letter to

<TEXT>
<P>
PERTH, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States underlined its
swimming prowess by winning three gold medals and breaking two
meet records at the world swimming championships here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
American veteran Jenny Thompson dampened Japan's hope to win a gold
medal as she out-touched Ayari Aoyama at the women's 100m butterfly
final, clocking 58.46 seconds, a new championships record.
</P>
<P>
Aoyama, runner-up to Thompson in the Pan Pacific championships last
year, had to settle for the silver medal, with Australian Petria
Thomas in third place.
</P>
<P>
The world top-ranked 100m backstroker Lenny Krayzelburg also won a
gold medal for the United States, winning his speciality event in a
time of 55.00 seconds.
</P>
<P>
His time was 0.17 seconds clear of second-placed Canadian Mark
Versfeld and a further 0.03 faster than Germany's Stev Theloke, who
got the bronze.
</P>
<P>
The American quartet anchored by Olympic silver medalist Gary Hall
shattered the meet record and snatched the United States' eighth men's
4x100m freestyle relay title in as many world championships.
</P>
<P>
Australia got the silver in 3:16.92, 0.28 seconds outside of the
U.S, time. Russia came third in 3:18.45.
</P>
<P>
Hungary's Agnes Kovacs grabbed the women's 200m breaststroke gold
by clocking 2:25.45, away from her 1997 world best time of 2:24.90
but good enough to break the meet record.
</P>
<P>
American Kristy Kowal finished second in 2:26.19, with her
teammate Jenna Street in third place in 2:26.50.
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion Penny Heyns came a poor sixth in the final.
</P>
<P>

Thorpe won the men's 400m freestyle event in 3:46.29, beating more
favored teammate Grant Hackett into second place.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen And Hong Kong To Increase Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The city of Shenzhen in
Guangdong Province and its neighbor Hong Kong have found each
other to be ideal economic development partners because they can
help each other overcome their weak points.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen's Mayor Li Zibin said here today that Hong Kong's
advantages are information, markets, funds, and a free port, but
that its economy centers on the service sector, which is not good
for long-term development, whereas Shenzhen has more land,
technology, and labor but is losing its attraction as the rest of
China opens wider to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
"Both Shenzhen and Hong Kong have close economic and trade
links but the bulk of economic and technical exchanges should be
in high-tech industry, to improve both economies," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen has a blueprint for a special 7.74 sq km zone along
the Shenzhen River for high-tech industry in conjunction with Hong
Kong, but it hasn't been approved by the Central government
because of border concerns.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen's high-tech industries in electronic information,
bio-engineering, and new materials had a total output value of
47.4 billion yuan in 1997, 35 percent its total industrial
output.

MANILA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso closed 1.9
percent higher at 41.571 pesos to the US dollar Thursday from
42.622 pesos Wednesday in its sixth straight day of gains.
</P>
<P>
Trading ranged from 42.30 to 41.35 to the greenback on a

<P>
Traders said demand for dollars was easing while the supply of

The peso has appreciated 9 percent since its average of 45.420
pesos on January 7, the day a currency risk protection facility
for companies with unhedged dollar obligations was launched.

Under the facility, foreign banks are apparently selling
dollars on the spot market and these transactions are included by
the central bank in the currency risk protection facility.
</P>
<P>
However, central bank governor Gabriel Singson attributed the
strengthening of the peso to the inflows of dollars of foreign

MACAO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior Macao economic official
said that Macao's exports still remain competitive after the
currency crisis brought favorable export environment for Southeast
Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
Maria Cesar, director of the Macao Economic Department, said on
Wednesday that the financial turmoil in Southeast Asia will have
some impact on the Macao export industry, but Macao exports are
still competitive, the Macao Daily News reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Although exports from the Southeast Asian nations will be much
cheaper, Macao's exports will not be affected much as they are
mainly garments and textiles, which are protected by the
quota system.
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said, Macao manufacturers are on time in
goods delivery, and their quality is time-tested. She believed
that foreign importers' confidence in Macao products will not be
toppled easily by lower prices.
</P>
<P>
About 85 percent of all exports in the first ten months last
year were garments and textiles. Total export value between
January and October last year reached 14.2 billion patacas (1.775
billion US dollars). The United States and the European Union are
its two leading export markets.

Since the earthquake happened in Hebei Province, the salvation
Army Headquarters received several hundred phone calls and
inquires about matters related to the donation every day.
</P>
<P>
About 107 service centers under the Salvation Army mostly
located in New Territories are collecting aid funds for those who
are suffering from the disaster.
</P>
<P>
An old man in his 70s from Yuen Long, the "New Territories,"
brought with him the newly-bought clothes and goods to the
headquarters of the Salvation Army for donation.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that up to Tuesday, a total of 20 million HK
Dollars (2.56 million U.S. Dollars) had been raised by Hong Kong
people from all walks of life, including five million HK dollars
donated by well-known industrialist Li Ka-shing.
</P>
<P>
A donation drive is unfolding throughout Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"In my personal view," Wong told Xinhua, "Hong Kong residents'
response to the donation is quicker than ever before. This is
because China is our own country, difficulties in inland areas
are ours."

<P>
HONG KONG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's index of
industrial production for the third quarter of 1997 edged up a
meager 0.5 percent over the same period in 1996, a survey by the
Census and Statistics Department showed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Output of the textiles (including knitting) industry and the

<HEADLINE> FAO: Lethal Epidemic Threatens Livestock in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The potentially lethal Old World
Screwworm livestock pest has been rampant in Iraq and threatens to
spread to neighboring Mideast countries, the UN Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) warned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Some 50,000 cases of Old World Screwworm were recorded in 12
out of 18 Iraqi governorates in December, compared to 31,000 in
the previous 15 months, said FAO's Cairo-based Near East Regional
Office in a press release faxed to Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Samples have been found in a diseased animal in Kuwait and the
pest has also been detected in Iran, FAO said.
</P>
<P>
Old World Screwworm, while generally affecting livestock,
particularly sheep and cattle, can also spread to humans and a
small number of cases affecting people have been reported.
</P>
<P>
The Screwworm Flies lay their eggs close to skin wounds and
when the grubs hatch they penetrate the flesh and feed on living
tissue, causing the disease myiasis which, if not treated, leads
to other infections and eventually death.
</P>
<P>
In December, FAO and the Arab organization for Agricultural
Development jointly organized a workshop in Damascus, Syria,
attended by representatives of countries affected and threatened
by the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
FAO has allocated 400,000 U.S. dollars to fighting the
infestation, and the Netherlands has donated 600,000 dollars, as
part of a two-year 7.3-million-dollar action plan to tackle the
pest using chemical insecticides as recommended by the workshop.
</P>
<P>
The Damascus workshop underlined the urgent need for concerted
efforts to control legal and illegal cross-border movements of
infested animals.
</P>
<P>
Risk analysis has identified Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Syria as
being seriously threatened, while the danger for Bahrain, Lebanon,
Qatar, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen is estimated to
be lower.
</P>
<P>
Between 1989 and 1993, FAO was closely involved in successful
efforts to rally international action to fight an infestation of
the very similar New World Screwworm in Libya which resulted in
the complete eradication of the pest.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Labor
Department will continue to improve the quality of services
offered to the public by adding five new pledges on performance
standards to its Performance Pledge 1998.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the department said Thursday that the five
additional pledges are under the service areas of careers guidance
to young people, employees' compensation, administration of the
importation of labor schemes and registration of trade unions.
</P>
<P>
"Other services already covered in 1997 are also included in
the Performance Pledge 1998," he said.
</P>
<P>
These include employment services for able-bodied and disabled
job-seekers, conciliation of labor disputes, promotion of labor
relations, adjudication of minor employment claims, protection of
wages on insolvency, occupational safety, licensing of employment
agencies, and attestation of contracts for employment outside Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the department's performance in 1997, the spokesman
noted that on average, over 99 percent of all the cases handled
met the pledged standards.
</P>
<P>
"No complaint on non-fulfillment of pledges has been received
in 1997," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to provide an efficient, courteous and
professional service to our customers in a clean and friendly
environment," said the spokesman.

<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official has
called for Taiwan authorities to return to the "one China" stance
and make substantial efforts to promote relations across the
Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
He Luli, chairwoman of the central committee of the
Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), made the
call at a Spring Festival reception held here today.
</P>
<P>
He, who is also vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference, said Taiwan authorities should proceed
from the fundamental interests of the Taiwan people and make a
sincere response to the Chinese Communist Party at the earliest
possible date.
</P>
<P>
She said the Chinese Communist Party and the central government
have continuously worked for the advancement of the relationship
between the two sides, which has foiled attempts to split the
country by creating "two Chinas", or "one China and one Taiwan",
as well as attempts by foreign forces to meddle in the Taiwan
issue.
</P>
<P>
"The efforts have helped to create a favorable situation for
the two sides to resolve political differences through
negotiations under the one-China principle," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
He Luli said the RCCK will continue to work for the
reunification cause.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Tibetan Villagers Elect Deputies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Baima, a nun in Nangkazi County
in the Tibet Autonomous Region, solemnly wrote the names of two
candidates on her ballot, Chinba and Binchong, the people she
believed would follow the will of the villagers.
</P>
<P>
Baima was voting for deputies to the county-level people's
congress along with several hundred residents in two villages.
Setting off at 5 a.m., she walked six hours to arrive at the
election site on time.
</P>
<P>
Among 400 residents of the two villages, 325 are qualified to
cast their ballots in accordance with China's Election Law. The
election began six months ago in the country's 2,800 counties
involving nearly 800 million voters.
</P>
<P>
Memar, a man in Wonko Village, nominated Chinba who is a
village deputy to the people's congress.
</P>
<P>
"He is very capable, and helped our village become well-off
from an impoverished condition," Memar said.
</P>
<P>
The villagers' per-capita income surpassed 900 yuan last year,
according to Memar.
</P>
<P>
One 50-year-old woman asked others to help her put down the
candidates' names because she cannot read or write. "My vote still
counts because I also have the right." she said.
</P>
<P>
At noon, they started counting the ballots. Chinba and Binchong
were elected.
</P>
<P>
The voters then put more than 20 hada, a long piece of white
silk traditionally used as a gift, around the necks of the winners
to show congratulations.
</P>
<P>
Chinba made an impromptu speech, saying he would try his best
to make the village prosperous, and convey the wishes of all the
villagers to the county government.
</P>
<P>
Sanggyai, who lost the election by 33 votes, conceded that "the
election reflected the wishes of the villagers."
</P>
<P>
"I respect the villagers' choice, and I'll try to be elected
next time." he said.
</P>
<P>
The election in the two villages in Tibet epitomizes those at
the same level across the country.
</P>
<P>
The Tibet Autonomous Region has completed its elections of
deputies to people's congresses at the township and county levels,
with more than 7,000 deputies selected.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 3,000 deputies to the Ninth National People's Congress
will be elected throughout the country by the end of this
month. One deputy will be elected out of every 880,000 people in
the countryside and out of every 220,000 people in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
This is also the first election of the county-level people's
congresses since the revised Election Law was released in 1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
slightly stronger Thursday amid mixed signals from the troubled
economies of Asia.
</P>
<P>
The local unit closed at 65.13 US cents, from 64.94 Wednesday
and 64.79 at the start of the session.
</P>
<P>
St George Bank manager of foreign exchange trading Stuart Moore
said the currency was consolidating its gains around the 65.00
level.
</P>
<P>
"There was good offshore demand and things overall are looking
quite positive for Asia at the moment," Moore said.
</P>
<P>
News that Indonesia Thursday signed a letter of intent with the
International Monetary Fund was seen as a positive step to avert a
worsening of the economic crisis there.
</P>
<P>
Locally, stronger-than-expected jobs data provided a boost for
the Australian dollar but did not set off a much needed rally.
</P>
<P>
Australia's unemployment rate was a seasonally adjusted 8.1
percent in December, from 8.4 percent in November, the Australian
Bureau of Statistics said.

<HEADLINE> Namibia's Major Daily to Close Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Windhoek Advertizer,
one of the oldest newspapers in Namibia, is on the verge of
closing down because of financial difficulties and staff
shortage, said a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The English-language paper, run by the Democratic Media
Holdings (DMH) group, was last year turned into Namibia's first
afternoon daily in an effort to rescue it from financial ruin.
</P>
<P>
DMH managing director Chrisna Greeff was quoted as saying that
the paper had been running at a loss, and faced a critical
shortage of qualified staff.
</P>
<P>
The paper was running at about 200,000 U.S. Dollar loss,
according to sources closed to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Besides, three journalists recently resigned from the
newspaper, leaving it with only three full-time news reporters.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper's staff were notified about management's
provisional decision to close the paper and incorporate its staff
into the Afrikaans daily Die Republikein.
</P>
<P>
Greeff said since there were many newspapers in circulation in
Namibia in comparison to the size of the readership, it was wise
to close down the Windhoek Advertizer to strengthen Die
Republikein.
</P>
<P>
The paper's management said a final decision would be taken
only after a board meeting scheduled for next Monday.

<HEADLINE> China Increases Funding for Social Sciences Academy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The central government has
allocated increased funding to support the prestigious Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), according to a CASS spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that academy funding from the central budget
has increased by average 18.3 percent annually in recent years,
with last year's figure of 177 million yuan (about 22 million US
dollars) doubling the figure for 1993.
</P>
<P>
The increased funding has enabled the institute to efficiently
conduct research programs, install computers, purchase additional
books and materials, repair facilities and improve housing for its
research staff.
</P>
<P>
A serious lack of funding over an extended period hindered the
smooth operations of the academy. The lack of funding, which
prevented many scholars from visiting overseas institutions, was
also the major problem faced by most research organizations and
universities throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that increased funding indicates that the
country is paying greater attention to the academic achievements
of scholars.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that China has a 5,000-year tradition of
respecting scholars and teachers, their salaries payment and
stature have declined sharply since the beginning of the "Cultural
Revolution" some 30-odd years ago.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the institute, which has 3,000 members,
continues to face a shortage of funds. Since 1998, the academy has
attempted to overcome shortages by operating companies,
attracting foreign subsidies and reforming its funds distribution
system.
</P>
<P>
The academy, established in 1977, leads the nations in terms
of liberal arts and social science research. CASS scholars were
the first to formulate concepts for China's market economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo
met with Henry Schacht, chairman of the board of US-based Lucent
Technologies, and his party here today.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the Chinese government attaches great importance to the
enhancement of scientific and technological cooperation with
Lucent.
</P>
<P>
The company, a leading manufacturer of communications
facilities, has established sound cooperative ties and has
actively participated in the development of China's communications
sector, according to Wu.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that Lucent has set up Beijing and Shanghai branches
for Bell Labs in China, and is preparing to jointly open a network
technology center with China's Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications (MPT). He expressed the hope that Lucent will
expand cooperation with China's communications sector.
</P>
<P>
Wu praised Lucent's efforts to improve Sino-US ties. He noted
that a visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin to Lucent during his
October tour of the United States ushered in a new phase in
bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the further development of political
ties between China and the US will promote bilateral cooperation
in fields of economy and trade, and science and technology. Wu
expressed the hope that Lucent will fully support and promote
related cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Schacht said that Lucent hopes to forge dynamic long-term
cooperative relations with relevant Chinese departments, and
introduce advanced technology to China's communications sector.
</P>
<P>
Lucent Technologies, one of the world's largest manufacturers
of communications facilities, was formed following the 1996
restructuring of American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&AMP;T).
</P>
<P>
Schacht and his party are visiting China as guest of the MPT.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Profit taking in resource
stocks after Wednesday's strong rises led the Australian share
market to a lower close Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index finished down 20.8 points at 2584.5.
</P>
<P>
"I just think there was a bit of profit taking in the resource
area after Wednesday being very strong," Steve Mayne from Nevitts
said.
</P>
<P>
Mayne said volume was low and the selling sentiment prevailed
from the start of trading despite an overnight rally on Wall
Street and stronger base metal prices.

many of the major stocks sold down.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> India's Auto Policy Must Be Reviewed: Parliament Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of Parliament P.A.
Sangma said Thursday that both the government and the auto
industry must review the country's automobile policy in order to
boost growth.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the "Auto Expo '98" here, Asia's largest
automobile show in the capital, Sangma said that the review should
be based on India's experience in the auto sector, given the
backdrop of phased liberalization, initially of the light
commercial vehicle segment and subsequently of the passenger car
segment.
</P>
<P>
The demand stagnation plaguing the industry has been caused by
several factors like restricted vehicle finance, slower cash flows
due to delayed payments by buyers, cut backs in government funding
and lack of export finance.

<HEADLINE> Index Measures Market Freedom in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The market freedom of Hong
Kong had been increasing over the ten years before June 1997,
announced a local research group here Thursday, whose conclusion
was derived from a free market index.
</P>
<P>
Based solely on objective data, the index value increased from
72 in the first quarter of 1987 to 100 in June 1997, the base
period for the index, said Prof. Richard Y.K. Ho, vice-chairman of
the Hong Kong Policy Research Institute (PRI), Thursday at a press
briefing.
</P>
<P>
The index, launched and developed by the PRI, measures Hong
Kong market freedom by seven factors -- the freedom of information
flow, degree of market competition, government involvement and
intervention, price flexibility, legal protection, mobility of
economic resources, and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
In addition to objective statistics, Prof. Ho said that the
research team also collected perception data from a survey of 300
senior executives randomly drawn to represent different market
sectors in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The index is expected to be updated every six months. Prof. Ho
said that a second survey now has gone underway to weigh the
degree of market freedom after the handover.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1995, PRI is a non-profit marking,
non-government organization.

<HEADLINE> New ECOMOG Chief to Focus on S. Leonean Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The new Force Commander of the
West African Peacekeeping Force (ECOMOG) has vowed to put the
Sierra Leone peace plan on top of his agenda, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"My priority is going to be on the implementation of the
Conakry Accord in Sierre Leone and to see to the peaceful
coexistence in the area," Timothy Shilpidi said Wednesday before
leaving for the force's headquarters in Monrovia, Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The peace accord, sealed in Conakry, Guinea last October,
stipulates that the junta, which ousted elected President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah in the May 25 coup, shall step down by Aprill 22
this year.
</P>
<P>
But the junta later threatened not to follow the plan, saying
that disarmament and the delivery of international aids had been
delayed.
</P>
<P>
Shelpidi was supposed to be in Monrovia last Thursday to take
over from his predecessor Victor Malu, who had returned here at
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
No explanation for Shelpidi's delay to assume office has been
given.
</P>
<P>
According to him, a lot of consultations are going on between
the Chairman of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) and the governments of Ghana, Togo, Guinea, Nigeria and
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to see to the implementation of the on-going
disarmament program and to ensure that the junta in war-torn
Sierra Leone will stick to the handover deadline, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shelpidi also pledged ECOMOG's readiness to train the Liberian
army if invited, although Liberia had opted to handle the
training itself.
</P>
<P>
During the inauguration of President Charles Taylor last
August, the tenure of ECOMOG in Liberia was extended to six
months so as to possibly allow ECOMOG to train Liberian army.
</P>
<P>
But due to logistics reasons, the training could not take
place, he said, adding that "the Liberian government wanted to go
ahead to train their own forces".
</P>
<P>
Whether ECOMOG should be involved in the restructuring and
training of Liberia's post-war armed forces has reportedly caused
friction between Malu and Taylor.
</P>
<P>
As ecomog's first step to pull out completely from Liberia, a
contingent of 1,205 Nigerian soldiers serving in the sub-regional
force was withdrawn last month.

<HEADLINE> Macao Official Denies Rumors of Bird Flu Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A Macao health official stressed
that no bird flu case had been detected here, denying rumors that
two people have died of the disease in Macao, the Macao Daily News
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Joao Claro, director of the Public Health Department, told the
newspaper that no people or animals had been found to be infected
with the H5N1 virus and reports that two people had died of the
bird flu in Macao were "mere rumors."
</P>
<P>
From now on, he said, the authorities will hold regular
briefings every week on the disease, and if confirmed, any case of
the bird flu will be announced immediately through the media.
</P>
<P>
He said a cross-department group was established last December
and has since held meetings regularly. The group is composed
mainly of doctors, health officials, economic officials and marine
police officers.
</P>
<P>
Since bird flu cases were found in neighboring Hong Kong, the
Macao government has been on alert and kept contacting the World
Health Organization (WHO). It has also taken measures to
strengthen checks at border passes and inspections of poultry
markets to prevent the disease.
</P>
<P>
The director disclosed that five people with symptoms of heavy
cold were tested for the virus this month, but all the results
were negative.
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated reassurances from doctors and officials, Macao
residents are eating less chickens. The number of imported live
chickens has dropped from 8,000 per day previously to about 500.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals to Macao in the
first 11 months of 1997 dropped 14 percent from the same period of
the previous year, latest statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Macao Census and Statistics Department
on Thursday show that the number of tourists arrived in Macao
added up to 6,429,767 between January and November last year, down
14 percent.
</P>
<P>
The biggest drop was from Japan, down 40.6 percent. Tourist
arrivals from Australia plunged 20.9 percent, from Southeast Asia,
20.8 percent, from, the Republic of Korea 19.7 percent, from two
Americas, 16.8 percent and from Hong Kong, 16.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of tourists from Taiwan surged 23.8
percent, and from Portugal edged up 0.9 percent, according to the
 statistics.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists to Macao reached a record 8.15 million
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the drop in incoming tourists in 1997 was a
joint result of a rising crime rate in Macao, less arrivals to
Hong Kong and the financial crisis in Southeast Asia.

LUSAKA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's Opposition the United
National Independence Party (UNIP) has finally handed over the
vehicle in which its leader, former president Kenneth Kaunda and
others were travelling at the time of the Kabwe shooting incident
last August.
</P>
<P>
The vehicle was given to the Permanent Human Rights Commission
(PHRC) which is currently investigating the incident in which
Kaunda and Liberal Progressive Front President Rodger Chongwe
were hurt at an abortive rally, the Times of Zambia reported today.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted the Commission Secretary Lavu
Mulimba as saying here on Wednesday that after the release, the
vehicle was driven to Kabwe where a mock demonstration of the
shooting was conducted.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration formed part of the preliminary evidence
before the public hearing is held.
</P>
<P>
Mulimba said logistics are being prepared including the
securing of international experts to help with the
investigations.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not disclose when the public hearing will be
held.
</P>
<P>
After the shooting the UNIP refused to hand over the vehicle
to the government for investigation, saying that it will hand it
over to an international investigation team.
</P>
<P>
The UNIP repeatedly accused the government of trying to kill
Kaunda but the government has denied the accusation.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong To Be First to Stand Up, Tung Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa Thursday
reiterated that the SAR will be the first to benefit when Asia's
financial crisis is over.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions put to him by the legislators on the work
of the SAR government at a plenary meeting of the Provisional
Legislative Council (PLC) in the afternoon, Tung said: "We have no
reason to believe that Hong Kong will be totally crushed by the
crisis."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's economic fundamentals remained sound, with massive
fiscal reserves and prudent fiscal policies, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"The storm has not yet blown over," Tung said. But when Asia's
crisis is over, "we will be the first to stand up again," he
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Tung said the plunge in Asian currencies and markets since last
summer has only strengthened his government's resolve to defend
the Hong Kong dollar's 15-year-old link to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The consequences would be "unimaginable" if the link to the
U.S. dollar was not firmly maintained, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's dollar is the only convertible Asian currency not
to have devalued in recent months. But the financial authorities
have had to raise interest rates to protect the local currency,
damaging the local stock market and property sector.

<HEADLINE> Unit 731 Survivors' Testimony Certified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Six eyewitnesses to crimes
committed by Unit 731, a Japanese germ warfare troop in World War
II, have recently obtained legal backing for their testimony in
Harbin, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The six eyewitnesses, four men and two women aged 63-to-75, had
their experiences with Unit 731 recorded and written down to serve
as a historical document.
</P>
<P>
Unit 731 conducted lethal pseudo-medical experiments on
thousands of prisoners and civilians during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Fang Zhenyu, a 75-year-old retired worker, was taken by force
to work in Unit 731 and not set free until Japan's defeat in 1945.
</P>
<P>
"It was a nightmare for me," Fang recalled. "I still remember
that one day I saw them (the Japanese aggressors) unload men, all
alive and two tied together by a rope, from a train and they
continued doing this for two hours till all the Chinese on the
train were unloaded.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't count the number of people, but I believed it must
stand at several thousand and I never saw them again."
</P>
<P>
Jing Fuhe, 63, lived on the outskirts of Harbin when he
encountered the disaster -- the bubonic plague which had been
spread by Unit 731.
</P>
<P>
Twelve people in his family died. His village, along with two
neighboring ones, lost 200 people within several days after the
plague. Jing is believed to be one of the few survivors of the
village.
</P>
<P>
The other four had similar experiences and are among 27
eyewitnesses across China, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The Unit 731 experiment site has become the Museum of the
Criminal Testimony of Army Unit 731, which receives more than
three million visitors each year.
</P>
<P>
"Those survivors who have provided ample and strong evidence
will be given a legal certificate, and the evidence will be
preserved at the museum," said Jin Chenmin, a researcher.
</P>
<P>
Unit 731 was a branch of the Japanese aggressor troops, the
Kwantung Army, with its headquarters in Harbin. During the war,
the troop became notorious for manufacturing germ weapons based on
experiments on living people.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 people were subjected to germ experiments by
Unit 731, according to a Japanese army official who was in charge
of germ experiments.

<HEADLINE> 82 Percent Zambian Firms Bought by Nationals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- About 82 percent of the
companies privatized in the country have been sold to Zambians,
the Zambia Privatization Agency (ZPA) has said.
</P>
<P>
ZPA Executive Director Valentine Chitalu said Wednesday on
Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC) that ZPA has
scored many successes in the privatization process since its
inception in 1991.
</P>
<P>
One of the successes, he noted, is the fact that many Zambians
have been able to buy companies through management buy out (MBO),
deferred payment, joint venture and public floatation schemes.
</P>
<P>
According to Chitalu, only 15 of the 300 privatised shops were
bought by foreigners while 40 of about 200 companies went to
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Zambians have not been able to buy big
companies because companies like the mines require much
re-investment. For other companies, priority is being given to
previous owners due to a pre-agreed agreement with the
government.
</P>
<P>
Other factors hampering the sale of companies to Zambians have
to do with technological requirement which some Zambians may not
possess, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zambians with no sufficient funds in the MBO scheme have been

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, EU to Forge Trade Accord by Yearend: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and the
European Union (EU) should have a bilateral agreement by the end
of the year which will pave the way for a free trade area,
outgoing EU ambassador Erwan Fouere said.
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping that many aspects of negotiations will be
completed by the middle of the year. I think the agreement
document will definitely be signed by the end of the year," he
was quoted by The Star newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the paper did not say when the remarks were made.
</P>
<P>
He said negotiations toward a comprehensive bilateral trade
agreement had been something like a hard long-distance run.
</P>
<P>
"I can now see the finish line," Fouere noted.
</P>
<P>
The two sides began talks in 1995 but the process had been
slow. Major progress was reported in the latest two rounds of
talks late last year when both sides for the first time submitted
specific proposals for tariff reduction.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that South Africa will reduce its tariffs at
a slower pace than the EU.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member EU block is South Africa's largest trading
partner, sucking up 40 percent of the nation's exports and
providing 33 percent of the imports. The EU is also South
Africa's largest foreign investor injecting over half of the
foreign investment to the country.

<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- With the steady improvement of
the relations between China and its neighboring countries, China's
border defense departments and army units have enhanced exchanges
with the counterparts of their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
In August 1995, the Chinese Ministry of National Defense and
Russia's frontier guard department signed an agreement of
cooperation on border defense. Since then, the frontier guards of
the two countries have had legal basis for their exchanges and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have had a frequent exchange of visits and often
informed each other of the border situation and their experience
on patrolling and drilling exercises.
</P>
<P>
Now the military commands of China's Jilin and Heilongjiang
provinces, and Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang autonomous regions have
set it rule to make an annual friendly exchange of visits with the
border defense departments of Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan,
Kyrghyz and Tadzhikistan.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Shenyang, Beijing, Lanzhou, Guangzhou and Chengdu
military commands organized and sent groups to visit the border

JOHANNESBURG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The king and queen of
Norway are to pay an official visit to South Africa in February,
a Norwegian Embassy official in Pretoria said today.
</P>
<P>
King Harald V and Queen Sonja will be the first Norwegian

Norway was unflagging in its support for the democratization

the struggle chapter, and the beginning of a new era of economic,
political and cultural cooperation between the two nations, said
the official.

government officials, are expected to meet South African

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Lifts Domestic Air Fares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 15 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's Asiana Airlines and
Korean Air Thursday raised their domestic air fares by 18.2
percent and 19 percent respectively due to the financial crisis
gripping the country since late 1997.
</P>
<P>
The two airline companies attributed the hike of domestic air
fares, the first time since 1992, to the rise in fuel prices
resulting from the South Korean won's sharp depreciation against
the U.S. dollar and the decreasing number of passengers.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's Constructions and Transportation Ministry also
has decided, from the coming March, to increase charges imposed on
air carriers for use of airport facilities, including landing fees
by 50 percent for international flights and 10 percent for
domestic flights, while charges for the use of security facilities
will surge by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the past months, the fares of buses and subway in Seoul have
increased because South Korea depends heavily on oil imports to
meet fuel demands.
</P>
<P>
Up to date, gas prices have jumped up by some 34 percent from
last August's to 1,113 won per liter.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Iran Consider to Cement Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Turkey are thinking of
taking measures to strengthen their cooperation on security
issues, local newspaper Daily News reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a senior official of the Iranian Embassy
in Ankara, who declined to be identified, as saying that these
measures are aimed at securing the tranquility on the border
areas of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that five security mechanisms have been put into play
in the forms of communication and cooperation on the levels of
interior ministry officials, intelligence departments as well as
border troops.
</P>
<P>
Contacts at higher level are expected to begin after the
ambassadors resume their work in Ankara and Tehran, according to
the official.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has reportedly appointed Sencar Ozsoy, a veteran
diplomat, as its new ambassador to Iran. While Hussein Levasani
will come to Ankara soon to fill the vacant Iranian ambassadorial
post.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish-Iranian relations have experienced a bitter period
since last February when they expelled each other's diplomats due
to disputes over sensitive religious issues.
</P>
<P>
Saying that border troops themselves can not completedly
prevent the infiltration of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK) to Iran, the Iranian official stressed the significance of
the cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We think that broad cooperation between Ankara and Tehran is
obligatory," he said, adding that the gendarmerie forces on both
sides have started information exchange concerning the border
security issues.
</P>
<P>
Despite the warming up of their relations, Turkey's powerful
military has not changed its former attitude that Iran is still a
major supporter of the PKK.
</P>
<P>
Iran, however, denied the Turkish charges, saying that the
Iranian government has never maintained a relationship with the
PKK.
</P>
<P>
The PKK, which is termed by Ankara as a serious threat to the
border security, has been fighting the Turkish government for
an independent Kurdish state since 1984.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the present Iranian government led
by President Mohammad Khatami, who is regarded as a moderate
statesman, might make it easier to improve the Iranian-Turkish
ties.

<HEADLINE> 2 Iraqis Sued for Attack on Iraqi Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Amman Court has charged two
Iraqi suspects with attempted murder against an Iraqi diplomat on
January 3 in Amman, semi-official Jordan Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Qasim Rajihi and Ja'afar No'uman were sued for attacking
Rahim Taher, Commercial Counsellor at the Iraqi Embassy in
Jordan, said Mohammed Harahsheh, a prosecutor at the court.
</P>
<P>
Taher's mother-in-law, Houriyah Abbas Kazim, who lives in
Iraq, masterminded the attack against her son-in-law for "family
and financial reasons," according to Harahsheh. However, her
extradition to stand trial in Amman is not expected, he said.
</P>
<P>
The court has ended the interrogation of four Iraqis involved
in the attack and Rajihi and No'uman are two of them, said the
prosecutor, adding that the other two were charged with complicity
in the attack.
</P>
<P>
The four Iraqis, who were apprehended in a police raid on an
Amman apartment last week, have been transferred to the High
Criminal Court, Harahsheh said.
</P>
<P>
On January 3, a single shot was fired at Taher when the
diplomat was leaving his Amman house for work. Taher was not
injured. The bullet only scratched his car.
</P>
<P>
Another suspect in the case is the diplomat's 14-year-old son,
Samir, who enjoys diplomatic immunity, said Harahsheh.
</P>
<P>
The criminal court will ask that the diplomatic immunity of
Samir be lifted to allow the interrogation on his alleged
involvement in the attack against his father, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear if the Iraqi Embassy will allow the lifting of
diplomatic immunity of Samir, he added.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to interrogate Samir because his testimony
will reveal new elements in the case," Harahshed said.
</P>
<P>
Taher has said that the attack on him aimed to wreck the ties
between Iraq and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries deteriorated sharply in
December when Iraq executed four Jordanians convicted of smuggling
car parts. Jordan recalled back its charge d'affaires from
Baghdad and expelled seven Iraqi diplomats.
</P>
<P>
However, the ties improved somewhat in late December when Iraq
renewed a contract to sell oil to Jordan at below-market rates.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Iran Consider to Cement Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Turkey are thinking of
taking measures to strengthen their cooperation on security
issues, local newspaper Daily News reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a senior official of the Iranian Embassy
in Ankara, who declined to be identified, as saying that these
measures are aimed at securing the tranquility on the border
areas of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that five security mechanisms have been put into play
in the forms of communication and cooperation on the levels of
interior ministry officials, intelligence departments as well as
border troops.
</P>
<P>
Contacts at higher level are expected to begin after the
ambassadors resume their work in Ankara and Tehran, according to
the official.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has reportedly appointed Sencar Ozsoy, a veteran
diplomat, as its new ambassador to Iran. While Hussein Levasani
will come to Ankara soon to fill the vacant Iranian ambassadorial
post.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish-Iranian relations have experienced a bitter period
since last February when they expelled each other's diplomats due
to disputes over sensitive religious issues.
</P>
<P>
Saying that border troops themselves can not completedly
prevent the infiltration of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK) to Iran, the Iranian official stressed the significance of
the cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We think that broad cooperation between Ankara and Tehran is
obligatory," he said, adding that the gendarmerie forces on both
sides have started information exchange concerning the border
security issues.
</P>
<P>
Despite the warming up of their relations, Turkey's powerful
military has not changed its former attitude that Iran is still a
major supporter of the PKK.
</P>
<P>
Iran, however, denied the Turkish charges, saying that the
Iranian government has never maintained a relationship with the
PKK.
</P>
<P>
The PKK, which is termed by Ankara as a serious threat to the
border security, has been fighting the Turkish government for
an independent Kurdish state since 1984.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the present Iranian government led
by President Mohammad Khatami, who is regarded as a moderate
statesman, might make it easier to improve the Iranian-Turkish
ties.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Democratic Party to Stay in Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The coordination committee of
Romanian Democratic Party decided here Wednesday that the party
will remain, for the time being, in the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
However, this was on condition that the present government must
resign by the end of next March and be replaced by a capable, new
government formed with the consultation of all the political
parties in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Peter Roman, president of the party said that the reform is
about the country's future and the people's living standard. The
Romanian people were greatly disappointed in the government's work
after making much sacrifices last year, Roman said.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party chose to remain in the coalition in order
to continue to work for the original goals set by the coalition
government and not to disappoint its voters.
</P>
<P>
Other parties in the coalition expressed surprised at the
Democratic Party's stand. At a news conference held soon after
Roman's remarks, the National Peasant's Party President Ion
Diaconescu said his party couldn't accept the Democratic Party's
stance, and reformation of the coalition would further worsen the
current political crisis.
</P>
<P>
The National Liberal Party President Mincea Ionescu Quintus
said he was greatly surprised that the Democratic Party had given
up its position which called for the resignation of Victor Ciorbea
and his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian political crisis was caused by the dismissal of
former transport minister Traian Basescu, who was also deputy
president of the Democratic Party. Basescu was fired on December
29 following his remarks that the Romanian government was
incompetent.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party, which is responsible for the nomination
of a transport minister, insisted on the reinstatement of
Basescu. This resulted in the intense fight between the two
parties.

HANOI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is facing a worsening
unemployment situation, with 6 percent of the urban population now
out of work, according to the Vietnam Economic Times weekly.
</P>
<P>
Hanoi, Hai Phong, Ho Chi Minh city, Vung Tau and Can Tho were
singled out for having particularly serious unemployment problems,
with Hanoi and Hai Phong posting jobless rates of 8.09 and 8.56

PARIS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Lionel Jospin Wednesday caused a
confrontation with the rightwing opposition at the National
Assembly by claiming that the French leftist force was the
supporter of the abolition of slavery 150 years ago, while the
French right was not.
</P>
<P>
The remarks by Jospin resulted in the departure of all
opposition deputies from the hall of the National Assembly in
protest. Meanwhile, historians said the view that French right
and left were divided over slavery 150 years ago is not backed
with evidence.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Algeria Wednesday rejected a mission of the European Troika
- the precedent, the present and the next presidency states of the
European Union - to investigate the massacres which have taken
place lately in the country, because Algiers judged the level of
officials to be represented to be too low.
</P>
<P>
-- Indonesia will sign on Thursday a letter of intention with
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the reforms it will carry
out to save its economy.
</P>
<P>
The currencies of Southeast Asian countries stopped falling
after the general director of IMF, Michel Camdessus, made a speech
to calm down the worries over the worsening of the situation.
Camdessus said that it is no longer possible for Asian countries
to hesitate and delay the implementation of reforms.

<HEADLINE> IMF, Indonesia Reach Agreement on Economic Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the Indonesian government reached an agreement here
Thursday on a much strengthened and reinforced economic program
aimed at restoring confidence in the country's currency and
economy.
</P>
<P>
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus told a news briefing
after holding talks with President Soeharto that the agreement was
reached following a series of discussions between an IMF staff
team and Indonesian authorities over the last few days.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus, who came here Wednesday for a two-day visit, said he
discussed many problems with Soeharto, especially the measures to
cope with Indonesia's current monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
Last October, Indonesia accepted an IMF-led 23 billion U.S.
dollars bailout package. Under the IMF reform program linked to
the package, Indonesia pledged to dismantle trading monopoly,
overhaul the financial sector, and scrap or suspend costly
infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF was reportedly dissatisfied over Indonesia's
reforms in the past few months. Last week, the Indonesian rupiah
plunged to a historic low of 11,000 to the dollar, prompting the
IMF team and American officials to visit the country and many
leaders of foreign countries to telephone Soeharto to expressed
their concerns over the situation.
</P>
<P>
According to Camdessus, the new program for accelerating and
deepening the much needed reforms includes seven items:
</P>
<P>
-- The first is about the broad macroeconomic framework. The
program is designed to avoid a decline in output, while containing
inflation to 20 percent this year, with the aim to bring in back
to the single digit level next year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the external current account balance is
expected to move from a deficit into a sizable surplus, thereby
generating additional foreign exchange to help the country to
repay its external debt which had reached 119 billion U.S. dollars
at the end of September last year.
</P>
<P>
-- Secondly, the two sides agreed to revise the 1998/99 budget
which was just unveiled on January 6, while adhering to
Indonesia's long-standing balanced-budget principle. The budget
would record a small deficit of about one percent of GDP, a level
that strikes an appropriate balance between the need to avoid an
undue fiscal deterioration, and the need to avoid a fiscal
contraction that would further depress economic activity.
</P>
<P>
To achieved this objective, serious measures will be taken to
curb energy subsidies. The government will phase out subsidies
gradually by raising both fuel and electricity prices in steps.
</P>
<P>
-- Thirdly, the government agreed on fiscal transparency. In
order to ensure that the public is kept full informed of all
government activities, the accounts of the reforestation and
investment funds will be brought onto the budget in 1998/99.
</P>
<P>
-- Fourthly, the government agreed to limit public spending
only to those items that are of vital importance to the country.
For this reason, development spending will be curtailed and the 12
infrastructure projects recently postponed or placed under review
will be canceled immediately.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, budgetary and extra-budgetary support and credit
privileges granted to the country's airplane projects will be
discontinued. All special tax, customs and credit privileges for
the National Car project will also be revoked immediately.
</P>
<P>
-- Fifthly, Monetary policy will need to be kept firm for a
sustained period until confidence in the currency is restored. As
the program measures take hold and confidence returns, market
interest rates should gradually begin to fall, while capital that
has moved overseas should return to the country, providing the
banks with sufficient liquidity to resume their lending activity.
</P>
<P>
-- The sixth point of the program is that the government will
announce specific plans to assist the banking system over the
coming days in a bid to restore the banking system to financial
health and to alleviate the difficulties of the corporate sector.
</P>
<P>
-- Under the seventh item, the government will push forward the
structural reforms. These include eliminating or limiting monopoly
over the import and distribution of some commodities such as rice,
wheat flour and sugar, abolishing all restrictive marketing
arrangements as of February 1, and leaving firms free to produce
and export their products as they wish.
</P>
<P>
They also include removing all formal and informal barriers to
investment in palm oil plantation and lifting all restrictions on
investment in wholesale and retail trade in order to encourage
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The program also envisages that measures should be continued to
alleviate sufferings caused by the current severe drought.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said that particular attention was being paid to the
proper financing of small and medium-sized enterprises and
exporters. To make funds available for this purpose through the
banking system, the Asian Development Bank is putting in place a
program whose details will be announced shortly, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Indonesian government recognizes the problems confronting
the country and is prepared to take the necessary measures to
overcome them, even if they are difficult and painful," the IMF
chief said.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that the chief of the World Bank will visit
Indonesia in the near future.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Conditions are ripe for the
creation of a free-trade zone within the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS), a senior Russian official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Anatoly Adamishin, minister of cooperation with CIS, said the
integration process among CIS members would be accelerated this
year and a free-trade zone should be established to speed up the
integration.
</P>
<P>
Adamishin said a free trade zone would create favorable
conditions for the free flow of goods and funds among CIS
countries.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that following the disintegration of the Soviet
Union, all of its former republics experienced severe economic
crises.
</P>
<P>
In view of the facts that no CIS country could get out the
crisis on its own, Russia stands for an economic integration of
the CIS, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
According to reports available here, the CIS summit, scheduled
to open in Moscow in mid March, will work out a specific time
table for the creation of the free-trade zone.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Host WB Conference on Global Knowledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad has disclosed that Malaysia will host the second World
Bank Conference on Global Knowledge next year.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government has agreed to host the biennial
conference which was initiated by the World Bank in Toronto last
year, Mahathir said Thursday after chairing the sixth meeting of
the National Information Technology Council (NITC) here.
</P>
<P>
The global knowledge conference was a new conference series
initiated by the World Bank because of the changing economic,
social and political structure of the world driven by the
knowledge paradigm.
</P>
<P>
The key issue at the first conference in Toronto last June was
that proper access and equity were vital in order to have a stable
world.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia was considered as an appropriate country to host the
next event because of its prominence in the Multimedia Super
Corridor (MSC) initiative, "so we have taken up that challenge,"
Mohamed Azzman, who is also the permanent secretary of the
21-member NITC, said on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
On the progress of the MSC, Mahathir, who is also the NITC
chairman, said the 15x50 km cyber zone located south of Kuala
Lumpur would not be affected by the current austerity measures
taken by the government.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said "What we are putting in is merely the
infrastructure and basic facilities while the rest will be the
investment on the part of those people who will take up a stake in
the MSC."
</P>
<P>
He said the MSC's International Advisory Panel (IAP) formed
last year would hold its next meeting here next month and 17 out
of a total of 41 members of the panel had so far confirmed their
participation in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The IAP last met in California, the United States.

MOSCOW, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
has ratified the country's first anti-drug law, an official of the

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Motor Industry Faces Pressure: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESUBRG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's National
Associaiton of Automobile Manufacturers (NAAM) has predicted that high
interet rates and sluggish economic growth will halt new car sales in
the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"It is the general expectation by the industry that the best one
can hope for during 1998 is for new vehicles sales to reach levels
similar to those achieved during the 1997, local daily the Citizen
quoted NAAM's announcement as reporting today.
</P>
<P>
NAAM said earlier that new vehicle sales fell 6.6 percent in 1997
to 366,859 units versus 392,980 the year before.
</P>
<P>
Blaming the "economic realities facing South Africa and in the
absence of interst rate relief," NAAM said the industry would be under
heavy pressure in the first six months of the year but forecast the
market likely to improve in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
"Conditions should improve during the second half of the year in
line with the projected reduction in interest rates," NAAM said.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, competion from Far Eastern producers would likely rise
due to the appreciation of the Rand, the South African currency,
against these foreign currencies, placing employment levels within the
industry under addtional pressure, it added.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Stock Exchange to Be Privatized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Beirut Stock Exchange (BSE)
is preparing to become the first public enterprise in the country
to be wholly privatized, local newspaper Daily Star reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The privatization, taking the form of a hand-over to brokers,
is expected to boost investor interest as more full-time
professionals are brought in to run the two-year-old bourse, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Trading on the bourse began in January, 1996. The exchange is
still reimbursing the government for its start-up costs.
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Sehnaoui, the chairman of BSE and the only full-timer
on the government-appointed exchange board, was quoted as saying
that the parliament is expected to approve a new law this year
passing ownership of the exchange to the licensed brokers.
</P>
<P>
He said that the law will also create an industry watchdog
modeled on the U.S. securities and exchange commission.
</P>
<P>
"Privatization will give us more flexibility and assist us to go
into activities other than stocks," said Sehnaoui.
</P>
<P>
The value of traded shares of the market took off from 65
million U.S. dollars in 1996 to 639 million dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the jump to increased buying by Lebanese
expatriates, and the drop in domestic interest rate since the end
of 1996. The composition of investors in the bourse is roughly
estimated at 45 percent local residents, 35 percent expatriates,
15 percent Arabs, and 5 percent foreign buyers, he added.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also quoted Nail Aoun, the president of the
country's brokers association, as saying that privatization will
maintain integrity, while leaving the state ultimately in control
through a regulator.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. and Europe have independent stock markets, why
should we be any different as an emerging market," he
added.

CANBERRA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- One weekly exercise workout is

Thursday by the Australian Associated Press as saying that he

intensity and for a suitable time would achieve the same results
as people have reported achieving in three exercise sessions in
the course of a week," he told a conference of the Australian
Council for Health, Physical Education and Recreation in Adelaide,
a coastal city in southern Australia.
</P>
<P>
The recently-completed findings from data collected in the
early 1990s go against conventional wisdom, which recommends
aerobic exercise at suitable intensity for 30-45 minutes three
times a week, and recent work showing shorter, more frequent
periods of activity brought the same benefits.
</P>
<P>
But Meaney said people needed to exercise for about two hours
in their weekly session and while the energy expenditure differed
among individuals, depending on size, study subjects were using
between 600 and 800 calories over the session.
</P>
<P>
He recommended that people go to a fitness center for help,
developing an appropriate, structured exercise program.
</P>
<P>
The study involved groups of middle-aged men taking part in an
exercise program once a week over six months, and data from about
40 to 50 subjects was used to deliver the findings.
</P>
<P>
The study found that resting heart rate, blood pressure and
percentage of body fat, all indicators of coronary heart disease
risk, were significantly reduced after the exercise program.
</P>
<P>
Cholesterol was reduced in 35 percent of subjects and
triglycerides, or fats, dropped in 43.5 percent of subjects.
</P>
<P>
"High density lipoprotein (HDL), a protective factor, showed a
statistically significant increase in 68.4 percent of the cases,
but the greatest improvements were seen in those subjects with
initial lipid levels regarded as hazardous," Meaney said.
</P>
<P>
But despite the findings, he urged people not to cut back if
they were already exercising more than once a week.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little concerned that people will seize on this to cut
down their three times a week to once a week and I think that the
more people can exercise, ... the better it will be for us,"
Meaney said.

<HEADLINE> Nobel Laureate Cites Correctness of No Depreciation Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Merton Miller, a prominent US
professor of economics, has praised the Chinese Government and the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for their
decisions to refrain from depreciating the Chinese RMB yuan and
the Hong Kong dollar.
</P>
<P>
Today's Shanghai Securities News reported that Miller, a
professor at the University of Chicago, expressed full confidence
in the future stability of the two currencies.
</P>
<P>
Miller, who is visiting Beijing at the invitation of the China
Society of Finance, expressed his views during a Wednesday speech
on the current financial turmoil in countries throughout Southeast
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Miller was awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics in October
1990 for his fundamental contributions to the theory of corporate
finance.
</P>
<P>
The professor expressed his belief that the current financial
turmoil is largely the result of human factors, coupled with the
influences of systematic shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
He said it is vitally significant for people to retain
confidence in their governments in situations involving
fluctuating financial market.
</P>
<P>
The fact that HKSAR has won the full confidence of the general
public for efforts to protect its exchange rate system pegged to
the US dollar has enabled the Hong Kong dollar to survive assaults
from speculators, said Miller. He emphasized that the adverse
effects of related activities should be held to an absolute
minimum, and noted that speculators will eventually retreat as
long as the HKSAR and general public stand firm.
</P>
<P>
He noted that depreciating currencies enables concerned
governments to gain temporary benefits from increased exports, but
warned that there are no long-lasting benefits. He said
depreciation policies not only result in the successive
depreciation of currencies in other countries and regions, but
also increase costs for imported commodities.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong which has a fair financial system with strict market
supervision and interior areas of China which offer vast market
potential will overcome temporary difficulties without the need to
depreciate the yuan and Hong Kong dollar. They will be rewarded
with stable currencies and healthy economic development as long as
their advantages are brought into full play, according to Miller.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Residents Protect Wildlife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Residents in China's largest city
Shanghai have developed a strong awareness to protect the wildlife.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion is based on a series of surveys recently carried
out in the city by the US-based Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS).
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of the residents surveyed said they believe that
excessive hunting and poaching are driving many wild animals to
the verge of extinction, and protecting the wildlife is most
important for maintaining a balanced ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-five percent of them said the government should
strengthen law enforcement and tighten up crackdown on those
who eat rare and endangered wild animals or sell their organs
for huge profits.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Zhang Endi with the WCS commented that Shanghai does not
have much wildlife. But since its residents are becoming more
conscious of wildlife protection, the demand for fur products and
medicines from wild animals would be lower.
</P>
<P>
Shi Xinquan, director of the Shanghai Zoo, said almost every
day, the zoo gets phone calls from residents who want to donate to
the zoo the wild animals they have bought at the marketplace or
happened to take captive.
</P>
<P>
Shi recalled that last summer, an old man sent to the zoo a
giant salamander which he bought with 3,000 yuan (about 350 US
dollars) at a rural free market.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Releases Maize Stocks to Stabilise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government
Wednesday directed the Grain Marketing Board (GMB) to immediately
release some maize from the strategic grain reserve (SGR) from
January 14 to April 30 to stabilise local maize market.
</P>
<P>
Maize shortage on the local market oiled by an unprecedented
demand for the staple grain countrywide has resulted in rising
prices on the Zimbabwe Agriculture Commodity Exchange (ZIMACE).
</P>
<P>
Retail mealie-meal prices also soared by over 30 percent
since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Lands and Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai said in a
statement that the grain release is meant to increase supply on
the local market and ensure an end to the "perceived shortage"
which had resulted from "undesirable speculation".
</P>
<P>
"The information we have is that there is still some tradeable
maize in the local market held by local traders, farmers and
millers," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The release of maize from the strategic grain reserve will
make more product available on the market," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
The GMB currently has 541,883 tons of maize in the strategic
grain reserve stocks.
</P>
<P>
It said it received only 248,000 tons of maize in 1997
out of the expected 600,000 tons from farmers for the 1996/97
crop.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is facing a threat of food shortages this year due to
drought brought by the El Nino weather phenomenon, which may have
fueled panic on the maize market.
</P>
<P>
The GMB has been battling to build up SGR stocks to 936,000
tons in case of drought.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, liberalisation of maize marketing
had led to more players on the market but speculation over
shortage of maize had resulted in unstable marketing and pricing.
</P>
<P>
He warned ZIMACE not to facilitate speculators as they would
be held responsible for the destabilization of the market.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Lianyungang, a port city in
east China's Jiangsu Province and the eastern head of the New
Euro-Asia Continental Bridge, has gained more attention from both
overseas and domestic investors with its geological resources and
industrial advantages.
</P>
<P>
Since the Bridge, a railway running from the city through
China's hinterland to Central Asia and Europe, was put into
operation five years ago, the city has expedited its utilization
of overseas investment, according to Wednesday's International
Business Daily.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the city has approved more than 1,000
joint ventures with 500 million U.S. dollars of overseas
investment, eight times the figure for the decade before the
opening of the railway, including investment from 28 international
corporations.
</P>
<P>
In the first 11 months of last year, the city approved 159 new
projects using 113 million U.S. dollars of overseas investment, an
increase of 49.94 percent over the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The economic and technological development zone of the city,
with the improvement of its investment environment in the past
decade, has introduced more than 1,200 foreign-funded projects
with a total contractual foreign investment of 500 million
U.S. dollars. More than 2,000 enterprises have gone into operation
here.

that the zone has attracted more investors from countries near the
two heads of the railway -- Japan, the Republic of Korea and
Europe, instead of Hong Kong and Taiwan, with a European
industrial park under negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The city also serves as a port for China's hinterland, and 11
provinces and regions in central and western China have
established 26 enterprises in the development zone.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years the city has strengthened its economic
and trade cooperation with the central and western areas.
</P>
<P>
At present, about 80 percent of the cargo exported from
Lianyungang came from other areas along the railway line.
</P>
<P>
The 11 provinces and regions along the railway line have opened
more than 1,200 enterprises and more than 30 representative
offices in the city. Most of these enterprises have found overseas
partners for economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The railway has helped the city boost its economy, according to
Vice-Mayor Cheng Zhipei, who said that in the past three years the
city's gross national product (GNP) has grown by an annual rate in
excess of 30 percent. The figure for its export-oriented economy
has grown by more than 50 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 the city's GNP exceeded 50 billion yuan, while the
figure more than a decade ago was only one billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Cheng expressed confidence that in the next five years the
city's economy would develop rapidly based on past achievements.

<HEADLINE> China's No.1 Auto Maker Undergoing Profound Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The First Automobile Works
(FAW) Group based in northeast China's Jilin Province has
undergone profound changes in its operation system due to
structural adjustments over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the changes, FAW's market adaptability has been
improved greatly.
</P>
<P>
Geng Zhaojie, General Manager of the conglomerate, said efforts
have been made to adjust product mix, and organizational, market
and asset structures in the past years.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the group company has realized transformation
in many aspects. Geng elaborated the transformation as a shift
from production of a few varieties to the production of a series
of many varieties, from a single economic manufacturing entity to
a large enterprise group, from relying on the domestic market only
to relying on international and domestic markets at the same time,
and from a single investor to a diversity of investors.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed as a "cradle of China's auto industry", the First
Automobile Works had been producing only clumsy "Liberation"-brand
trucks since it was established in 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Through adjustment of product mix in the past decade or so, FAW
now has four major production lines capable of producing
medium-sized, light trucks, deluxe sedans and ordinary cars in
many varieties and specifications.
</P>
<P>
FAW, which has the most advanced automobile technical
development center in China, has now grown into a large automobile
manufacturing conglomerate by practicing the policy of low-cost
expansion of merging and taking over 26 local factories.
</P>
<P>
So far, it has 35 specialized plants, 12 full-investment
companies, 11 share-holding subsidiaries, 14 share companies, as
well as 240 related enterprises.
</P>
<P>
China had long relied on auto import and in the past, FAW's
products could only be sold on the domestic market. Over the past
years, the FAW group has kept improving technical standards and
development capacity. While meeting the demand of the domestic
market, the conglomerate has now increased exports of automobiles
to the overseas market.
</P>
<P>
It has established three complete car assembly plants in
Africa. The conglomerate has been exporting complete cars and
spare parts to more than 20 countries and regions, with the annual
export volume of complete cars exceeding 5,000 cars.
</P>
<P>
The FAW Group has had a diversified investment setup. Instead
of the past practice of simply relying on the state for
investment, FAW group has three listed subcompanies which raise

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Private economy has boomed in
southwest China's Sichuan province, one of the country's populous
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the province had had 25,600 private
enterprises by the end of 1997, which turned in 3.2 billion yuan
(385 million US dollars) of taxes to the government.
</P>
<P>
These enterprises employed more than 2.2 million people, of
them 200,000 being laid-off workers from state-run enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that the booming private sector can be
attributed to the relatively free investment and legal environment
in the province.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the provincial government implemented several new
regulations to encourage the expansion of private economy.
</P>
<P>
Officials in charge of judicial work, taxation and industrial
and commercial administration have also made effective efforts to
protect the legitimate rights of private businesses.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Arab Fertilizer Joint Venture on Bohai Bay Profitable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINHUANGDAO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-Arab Fertilizer
Co. Ltd. based in Qinhuangdao, a port city on the Bohai Bay in
north China, produced 600,000 tons of phosphate fertilizers in
1997.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that sales of the company will hit 1.1 billion
yuan, and its pre-tax profits will exceed 100 million yuan. The
production-to-marketing rate of the company was 100 percent in the
past year, said local sources.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Arab Fertilizer Co. Ltd, a joint venture started in
1985 by China, Tunisia and Kuwait with an investment of 58 million
U.S. dollars, is equipped with equipment imported from France and
is capable of producing 480,000 tons of ammonium phosphate or
600,000 tons of nitrogenous-phosphate-potash compound fertilizer a
year.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture was thrown in the red because of problems
with prices and supply of raw materials soon after it began
production in 1991.
</P>
<P>
To improve efficiency of the joint venture, managerial
personnel from the Chinese side were designated to contract the
general operation of the Sino-Arab Fertilizer Co. Ltd. in 1993
after careful negotiations with all sides concerned.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the joint venture's fate has turned for the
better. It produced 480,000 tons of highly efficient phosphate
fertilizer in 1996, exceeding the joint venture's designed
production capacity for the first time.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Tea Prices Remain High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan tea prices, already
buoyant, could continue to surge as competitors in other countries
suffer the ill effects of the El Nino weather phenomenon, local
industry officials say.
</P>
<P>
Revenues could also rise sharply as drought in other parts of
the world contrasts with months of rainfall in Kenya's tea
growing areas, boosting Kenya's 1998 tea crop, the East
African Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
While coffee production has been hit by the excessive
moisture, the hardier tea plants only stand to gain from the
heavy rains, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"Although prices look better for January, February and March,
we're expecting some high crop figures in the second and third
quarter this year because of the rains," Norman Wilson,Managing
Director of Africa Tea Brokers (ATB) was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Weather experts have predicted that drought could hit tea
production in Tanzania, Malawi, south India and even Sri Lanka,
the largest tea exporter in the world, later this year.
</P>
<P>
Prices will continue to rise in anticipation of a shortage of
tea following gloomy production forecasts elsewhere in the world,
Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the main reason why prices are becoming increasingly
buoyant," he said.
</P>
<P>
The only problem for Kenya is that the country's fragile
infrastructure has suffered severe damage from the heavy rains
and many tea growing areas are feared inaccessible, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
According to ATB, Kenya exported 194.85 million kg of tea in
the first 11 months of 1997 at an average price of two U.S.
dollars per kg compared to 233.65 million kg in the same period
in 1996 at 1.42 dollars per kg.
</P>
<P>
In November, a total of 21.66 million kg of tea were sold in
the auction compared to 20.49 million kgs in November 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's parliament, the
Jatiya Sangsad, began its winter session on Wednesday, with the
major opposition Bangladeshi Nationalist Party (BNP) boycotting
it.
</P>
<P>
"The Jatiya Sangsad is the foundation of democracy and the
focal point of all national activities," President Shahabuddin
Ahmed told the parliament's first session this year.
</P>
<P>
"People have elected their representatives as members of this
Sangsad with much expectations... but we could not yet ensure the
fruits for the benefits of the masses," he said, referring to the
boycott of the BNP, which has been boycotting parliament
proceedings since August 30 last year.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the BNP Parliamentary Party on Wednesday,
however, 12 out of 13 party legislators addressing the meeting
spoke for taking part in the parliament session, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The session would discuss the much debated Chittagong Hill
Tracts (CHT) peace accord signed last December between the
government and the hill tribes, and was likely to adopt four bills
relating to the three hill districts of Khrachhart, Rangamati and
Bandarban and the proposed regional council in the CHT under the
accord, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
There might be 20 hours of general discussion on the
president's 100-minute address, but the session may lose much of
its significance if the BNP continue to abstain from the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear what would be the duration of the session,
officials said.

BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Olympic Committee
(COC) issued a statement on Thursday after receiving the report by
the Chinese Swimming Association on FINA's announcement of the
positive results of four Chinese swimmers in an out-of-competition
doping test at the current World Swimming Championships in Perth,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
The statement is as follows:
</P>
<P>
According to a report sent by the Chinese Swimming Association,
the International Swimming Federation (FINA) announced on January
14 that four Chinese swimmers tested positive in A samples in a
doping test at the Eighth World Swimming Championships and FINA
decided to provisionally suspend the four Chinese from the
championships pending a hearing after the test of B samples.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Olympic Committee was deeply shocked and its
anti-doping commission has held an emergence meeting and the
following decisions were made:
</P>
<P>
1. The COC supports the statement made by the Chinese Swimming
Association and its right attitude towards the case.
</P>
<P>
2. The COC has ordered its anti-doping commission to set up a
special investigation panel immmediately to investigate the case.
</P>
<P>
3. The COC will discipline the four swimmers according to the
sports law without mercy after the investigation.
</P>
<P>
The usage of banned substances by the athletes is immoral and
it is also against the Olympic spirit. The COC has always
condemned and opposed to the usage of banned substances by
athletes and will continue adhering to the policy of three
stricts, namely "Strict prohibition, Strict testing and Strict
sanction". The COC will continuously work together with the
international sports circles to carry on the struggle against
doping abuse.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The total number of the animal
species housed in the Animal Specimen Museum, under the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, has reached 3.9 million, the largest
collection in Asia, said a museum official.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Hongzhang, vice-director of the museum, said the
collection includes insects, birds, fish, mammals and many
invertebrates.
</P>
<P>
The museum, founded at the end of 1996, is a comprehensive
institute of specimen collection, research and education, which
includes laboratories of vertebrates, invertebrates and
insects. Recently, at the one-year anniversary of the museum's
founding, experts and zoologists gathered to discuss how to
further their research on animal evolution.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that, to a certain extent, animal specimen collection
reflects a country's level of zoology. He said the number of
animal species in China is between 150,000 and three million, and
only 50,000 are known to people.
</P>
<P>
"The bulk of the animals are unknown, and many of them may be
extinct before they are recorded and studied," said Zhou. "Efforts
should be strengthened to study the unknown species and their
living environment, and measures should be taken to protect them."

The troupe was established in 1991, and there are more than 60
members, some of whom had given performances in Vienna, Austria,
in 1996.

festival.

<HEADLINE> North China's Model Iron, Steel Company To Expand Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Handan Iron and Steel
Group Co. Ltd. in north China's Hebei Province will continue to
expand reforms and seek new ways to improve economic efficiency.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Liu Hanzhang, chairman of the
board of directors of the company, said in the year of 1998 they
would improve various reform measures and lay off more redundant
workers to improve efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The company, a state-owned enterprise, went public by the end
of last year. Because of the share issue, Liu said, the company
has been practicing a share-holding system.
</P>
<P>
Construction of a continuous casting and rolling production
line of sheet bars, the first of its kind in China, at a cost of
3.3 billion yuan, started in November. When construction is
completed, the company will replace outdated equipment.
</P>
<P>
Handan has merged Wuyang Iron and Steel Company, an enterprise
directly administered by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry,
and a local steel tube company.
</P>
<P>
The merged company made 503 million yuan of profits in 1997,
ranking second in China.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1958, the Handan Iron and Steel Company with a work
force of 28,000 had been on a losing track until 1990. After
replacing its method of counting costs and working out expected
interest levels before setting prices for its products, the
company was able to fix acceptable market prices, and work out its
own production costs.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the company invested 2.5 billion yuan in
technical upgrading from 1990 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
After the success of the Handan experiment, state-owned
enterprises have been urged to learn how to thrive in a
competitive market from the Handan company's operations as the
country is trying to invigorate its state-owned enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Weekend Schools for Female Workers Booming in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- China's leading industrial
city of Shanghai has witnessed the establishment of more than 250
weekend schools for women workers in which more than 210,000 women
have received technical training in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that over one million workers were laid off in
the past few years, among which more than 60 percent were
females. Women workers are encountering much more pressure in
employment and competition.
</P>
<P>
Du Yuying, Vice-Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council of
Trade Unions said the weekend schools are established by trade
union organizations in an effort to improve women workers' quality
and help with their reemployment.
</P>
<P>
The courses for female laid-offs include computer operation,
cooking, accounting, domestic electrical appliance repairing,
marketing as well as popular know-how of fresh flower arrangement
and household management.
</P>
<P>
Du said, as the courses are vary practical, at least 7,000
female laid-offs found new jobs last year after attending weekend
schools.
</P>
<P>
She said, to meet the growing demands of female laid-offs, the
city's trade union organizations prepared to increase the number
of weekend schools to 300 by the end of this year and over 300,000
women workers are expected to have a chance for technical
training.

<HEADLINE> Tangshan Exhibits Special Concern for Quake-Stricken Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Residents in Tangshan, a
city destroyed by a devastating earthquake some 20 years ago, have
donated large amounts of relief funds and materials to people in
Zhangjiajou Prefecture's Zhangbei and Shangyi counties which were
hit by an earthquake measuring 6.2 on the Richter Scale on January
10.
</P>
<P>
Tangshan, located north China's Hebei Province, was rebuilt
with help from people throughout the country. The devastating 1976
Tangshan earthquake, which measured 7.8 on the Richter Scale,
killed over 240,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Tangshan officials convened an urgent meeting upon learning of
the Zhangjiakou earthquake and called on all citizens to donate
money and winter clothing for victims in affected areas.
</P>
<P>
Tangshan sent relief funds totalling one million yuan (120,000
US dollars) to devastated areas on the following day. In addition,
the city's disaster relief team, headed by leading officials,
rushed 50 tons of food and 110,000 cotton-padded overcoats and
quilts to devastated areas.
</P>
<P>
Liu Li, 35, the general manager of a private real estate
company who lost his entire family in the 1976 quake, purchased
5,000 quilts valued at some 500,000 yuan from a local department
store and hired eight trucks to transport the items to Zhangbei.
</P>
<P>
Liu, the city's major individual donor, said he was orphaned by
the devastating earthquake at the age of 15 and he can now live a
happy life because of the care of the government and people
throughout the country. He said that he wanted to express his
appreciation by helping other people.
</P>
<P>
The Kailuan Coal Mine Administration donated 100,000 yuan to
two mines in areas hit by the recent quake, in addition to sending
cotton-padded clothing and quilts valued at 100,000 yuan to
victims.
</P>
<P>
The Tangshan New District, designed and constructed by
architects and workers from throughout the nation, sent a disaster
relief team to Zhangbei, along with rice, flour, tents,
pharmaceuticals and down coats valued at 300,000 yuan.

<HEADLINE> Indian Currency Rupee Crosses 40 Mark Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 15 (Xinhua)-- The Indian currency rupee
finally breached the psychological barrier of 40 rupees per U.S.
dollar and plunged to a historic low of 40.25 per dollar at the
interbank foreign exchange market in Mumbai on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) made feeble attempts to prop up
the rupee by pumping in 50-70 million U.S. dollars later on
Wednesday. Dealers attributed the fall of the rupee to rising
corporate demand for U.S. dollars matched by drying up of U.S.
dollar supplies.
</P>
<P>
Exporters continued to stay away from the market giving rise to
speculation that the RBI might take steps to force exporters to
bring in their remittances.
</P>
<P>
Union Finance Secretary Montek Singh Ahluwalia said on
Wednesday that authorities were not alarmed at the rupee's dip
below 40 rupees per U.S. dollar. "The U.S. dollar has hardened
against all currencies in the past few days and focusing on the
rupee-dollar rate gives an exaggerated picture of the situation,"
he said.

<P>
KATHMANDU, January 15 (Xinhua) -- After stabilizing for a
month, the Nepali currency Thursday weakened further by 0.76 rupee
against the greenback.
</P>
<P>
The Nepal Rastra Bank, the country's central bank, Thursday
refixed the buying and selling rates of the dollar at 63.76 rupees
and 64.36 rupees respectively from Wednesday's 63.00 rupees and
63.60 rupees.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Nepali rupee fell by 0.25 rupee against the
dollar, but rebounded the next day.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation of the Nepali rupee, pegged to the Indian rupee
at a fixed rate of 1.6:1, is inevitable as the Indian rupee
crashed to an all-time low of 40.15 rupees to the dollar on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali rupee began to tumble from August 27 after
maintaining an 18-month stability. Now it has fallen by 7.01

ISLAMABAD, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif left here Thursday for Dhaka to attend a one-day
tripartite "business summit."
</P>
<P>
The summit meeting, scheduled for Thursday, will also be

Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral.
</P>
<P>
Prominent business figures and private sector trade bodies of
the three South Asian nations will also attend the meeting.

Sharif was being accompanied by Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub
Khan, Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz, Commerce Minister Ishaq Dar,
Minister of State Siddique Kanju and Chairman of the Board of
Investment Humayun Akhtar.
</P>
<P>
Officials confirmed that Sharif would meet Gujral on the
sidelines of the summit to exchange views on bilateral issues,
particularly the Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India resumed their foreign secretary-level talks
in March last year after a hiatus of three years, but the dialogue
remains suspended since last September due to their differences on
the Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
After the summit, Sharif will make a two-day official visit to
Bangladesh and hold talks with Hasina.
</P>
<P>
Government officials have said the talks between the two prime

<P>
CANBERRA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Third-ranked Lindsay Davenport
suffered the upset by crushing against Serena Williams, failing to
make the semifinals of the Sydney International tennis on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Williams rallied from one-set down to beat Davenport 1-6, 7-5,
7-5, before her sister Venus Williams dispatched Maggie Maleeva
6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
The Williams sisters could meet Saturday in the final of this
tuneup for the Australian Open as Serena faces the winner of the
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and Zatasha Zvereva match, and Venus plays
either Barbara Paulus or Ai Sugiyama.
</P>
<P>
Serena, only 16, trailed 1-6, 2-5 against Davenport and faced
two match points at 15-40 but she eventually prevailed over with
great enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
After taking an injury timeout at 1-3 in second set, Serena
sailed to her victory by cutting down on the errors and ripping
winners down the lines and into the corners from both sides.
</P>
<P>
Serena beat Seles and Mary Pierce in Chicago last year before
twisting her ankle and losing to Davenport.
</P>
<P>
In the deciding set, Serena broke Davenport's service, lost
her two games to lag 2-4 before clawing back for 4-4 and 5-5.
</P>
<P>
Serena drilled a forehand crosscourt into the corner to break
Davenport and take a 6-5 lead and closed the match by winning the
final game at love.

<HEADLINE> Reforms Go Smoothly in Central China's State-Owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Anhui Province, a new spotlight
in central China's economic development, has made strides in its
state-owned enterprise reform.
</P>
<P>
This round of reform has been orderly and down-to-earth,
according to sources with the provincial government. Many
state-owned enterprises have not only escaped their financial
difficulties, but also have demonstrated large potential. Among
them, 15 have been appointed as key group enterprises and receive
preferential policies.
</P>
<P>
145 state-owned companies in Hefei, capital of the province,
and the cities of Bengbu and Wuhu have gone into bankruptcy, which
activated four billion yuan (482 million U.S. dollars) of idle
capital for their recovery. Among 170,000 involved laid-off
workers in six cities, more than 100,000 have been re-employed.
</P>
<P>
A share-holding system reportedly has been a major factor in
revitalizing dozens of state-owned enterprises and has assisted in
the formation of 50 group companies. This transformation has
reduced the debt rate in each of these companies by 10 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
Stock market listings also have been effective. 14 state-owned
companies have raised 12 billion yuan (1.4 billion U.S. dollars)
from China and abroad through stock sales.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Spends Foreign Funds on Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
committed 37 million European Currency Units (ECUs) to northeast
China's Liaoning Province for a comprehensive environmental
protection project.
</P>
<P>
The EU plans to spread the donation out over the next five
years. Liaoning will also provide 100 million yuan for the
project, said Chen Qi, director of the provincial environmental
protection bureau.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the project's aim is to reduce pollutants, increase
energy efficiency and restructure the economy.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning, one of China's major heavy-industry bases, has become
one of the most polluted areas in the country because of the
concentration of metallurgical, machinery, petrochemicals and
energy industries.
</P>
<P>
To control environmental deterioration, the province has also
introduced loans and donations from such international financial
organizations as the World Bank and the Asian Bank, as well as
from Japan, the United States, Canada, Germany and some European
countries.
</P>
<P>
Local statistics show that the province received 340 million
U.S. dollars in loans and accepted 5.55 million U.S. dollars in
donations from overseas countries and regions during the 1991-1995
period.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the World Bank granted Liaoning a loan of 110 million
U.S. dollars to improve the province's environment. At the same
time, the World Bank invited foreign experts to give lectures on
environmental protection for the province and organized technical
personnel to abroad for training.

MOSCOW, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said Wednesday Russia opposes any military solutions in
the standoff with Iraq over weapons production inspections.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone talk with United States Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, Primakov reiterated that any military showdown
would be unacceptable, Interfax news agency reported..
</P>
<P>
Interfax quoted Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Valery
Nesterushkin as saying the two sides also emphasized that Iraq
should cooperate with the United Nations Special Commission
(UNSCOM) on disarming Iraq, and should fully comply with the
relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Nesterushkin said any issues should be resolved through
dialogue. Russia proposed that the composition of the inspection
teams be more balanced, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq on Tuesday carried out a threat to bar a 16-member team
led by American Scott Ritter from Iraqi sites unless UNSCOM agreed
to change the composition of the team.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad protested that the team included nine Americans and
five Britons, and was unbalanced in favor of two countries which
took a hard line in prolonging U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, U.S. White House spokesman Michael McCurry
stressed that Washington still considered a military option
possible should Iraq refuse to back down.

COLOMBO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- General Secretary of the Lanka
Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) Batty Weerakoon, MP, was nominated by the
party politburo Wednesday to fill the vacant ministerial portfolio
created by the death of Science and Technology Minister Bernard
Soysa, the party source said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
All but one of the 14-member politburo voted for the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
The opposing member, Vasudeva Nanayakkara, said the LSSP, also
known as the Lanka Equal Society Party, should not accept the
cabinet portfolio because the government has broken all its
promises to the people.
</P>
<P>
Weerakoon said that his party disagrees with the government on
its free market and privatization policies.
</P>
<P>
These policies had been opposed by the party when its late
leader Soysa, who died of illness on December 30, 1997, was
holding cabinet office.
</P>
<P>
After he succeeds Soysa to be a member of the cabinet, his
party's position on the above-mentioned government policies will
not change, the nominee noted.
</P>

<HEADLINE> S'pore Faces No Danger of Banking Crisis, Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 15 (Xinhua) -- There is no danger of a
banking crisis erupting in Singapore, as its banks are sound and
in a strong position, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who
is also chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS),
said.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers reported on Thursday that Lee told Parliament
that only 3.2 percent of the six major local banks' total loans in
the five troubled regional economies -- Malaysia, Indonesia,
Thailand, South Korea and the Philippines -- were "classified"
loans at the end of last November.
</P>
<P>
"Classified" loans are those which banks consider questionable
or uncollectible. These amounted to 1.2 billion Singapore dollars
(about 689.66 million US dollars), or a mere 0.5 percent of the
banks' total global assets, the deputy prime minister said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the banks' total exposure in the five countries
was 41 billion Singapore dollars (about 23.56 billion US dollars),
or 17.6 percent of their total global assets at the end of last
November, he added.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the local banks were in a strong position
as they had adopted sound accounting practices and built up their
assets, all of which had prepared them well to deal with the
present crisis.
</P>
<P>
The capital-to-asset ratio exceeded 12 percent, higher than
those of most international banks, he said.

<HEADLINE> Italy Backs Revision of EU Anti-Dumping Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini said here Wednesday that Italy backs the revision of the EU
anti-dumping policies, especially the removal of China from the
"non-marketing economy" list.
</P>
<P>
Dini made these remarks in meeting with visiting his Chinese
counterpart Qian Qichen.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that China has taken note of discussion in the EU
Commission, the executive body of the EU, on removing China from
its list of countries pursuing a "non-marketing economy", a major
step in revising its anti-dumping policies.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the EU to change its discriminative trade policy
toward China as early as possible, which will be conducive to the
development of both China-Europe and China-Italy economic
cooperation," Qian added.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Dini said cooperation between Italy and
China in all fields was enhanced remarkably in 1997. In particular
the year saw the frequent exchange of high-level visits and
sustained development of economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Qian said: "We are satisfied with the promotion of bilateral
economic and trade cooperation and the exchanges of personnel." He
hoped that through joint efforts by China and Italy, the ties
between the two countries will be further enhanced in 1998.
</P>
<P>
On the financial turmoil in the Southeast Asia, Qian said the
crisis had little impact on China which last year enjoyed nine
percent economic growth, less than two percent inflation and 320
billion U.S. dollars of foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that since 1993 when financial system reform started
in China, the Chinese government had been adopting cautious
policies in opening financial market, which has enabled the country
to resist any financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Qian believed that through readjustment and reform, the economy
of those crisis-hit Southeast Asian countries would recover.
</P>
<P>
Dini agreed and stressed the importance of maintaining
macro-economic stability in a country.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two foreign ministers also exchanged
views on the situation in the Mediterranean region.
</P>
<P>
Winding up his visit to Malta, Qian arrived in Rome Wednesday
for a four-day official visit to Italy and San Marino.

<HEADLINE> Jaffna Public Library Reopened in Northern Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Jaffna Public Library in
Northern Sri Lanka was reopened in a make-shift building Wednesday
as a symbolic gesture of ethnic reconciliation and goodwill of the
government to the people in the north, news reaching here said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The original library in Jaffna town, which was considered one
of the best in the East, was destroyed by vandals in 1981 when
thousands of precious books, including some unique collections not
available elsewhere, were burnt.
</P>
<P>
On the opening ceremony, Tamil girls sang the national anthem
in Sinhala and then in Tamil as a gesture depicting understanding
and brotherhood among the two communities.
</P>
<P>
Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera who spearheaded the library
restoration project said the reopening of the library was a
historic step in correcting the injustice perpetrated on the Tamil
community.
</P>
<P>
It was also a symbolic gesture to demonstrate the intention of
the government and the people of Sri Lanka to re-establish harmony
among all communities, especially the majority Sinhala people and
minority Tamils.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Richard Pathirana who also participated in
the ceremony said the government had adopted measures to find a
just solution to the injustice and problems caused to Tamil
civilians.
</P>
<P>
He said the city of Jaffna devastated by the on-going civil war
will be re-built by year 2000.
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 books have been collected for the reopened library
in a three-storey building. It will be shifted to a new library
complex once construction work is completed.
</P>
<P>
The government has spent 55 million Rupees (900,000 U.S.
dollars) on the library project.

<HEADLINE> Australian Airline Suspends Some Asian Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Qantas Airways Limited, the
flag carrier in Australia, said Thursday it would suspend a number
of services between Australia and Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia
from late next month following a significant fall in passenger
demand in the wake of Asian economic and currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Qantas Chief Executive James Strong said the airline would
suspend its twice weekly services between Brisbane, capital of
Australia's Queensland state, Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur, and twice
weekly services between Melbourne and Jakarta from February 21.
</P>
<P>
Strong said Qantas would also suspend its thrice weekly
services between Brisbane and Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The thrice weekly Perth-Jakarta service will be converted into
Perth-Jakarta-Bangkok services from the same date, which will
increase the frequency of flights from Australia's western coastal
city of Perth to Bangkok by one per week, Strong said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the twice weekly nonstop Perth-Bangkok service will
be suspended.
</P>
<P>
Strong said the airline had been reluctant to reduce the number
of flights between Australia, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia,
but that the decision had been a commercial inevitability.
</P>
<P>
He said Qantas would continue to operate a total of 50 flights
a week between Australia and the three Southeast Asian countries:
23 of them to Jakarta and Denpasar combined, 24 per week to
Bangkok and three per week to Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
Qantas would continue to monitor closely the pattern of demand
for travel between Australia and the three countries with a view
to restoring services when demand returned.
</P>
<P>
Qantas announced earlier this month that it would suspend its
four-times-a-week service to the Republic of Korea (ROK) from
February 1, citing a drop in nearly 65 percent in demand for seats
on the route last month compared with the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Australia's second largest airline Ansett said on January 6 it
would suspend its bi-weekly flights between Australia and ROK from
February 6.
</P>
<P>
Ansett International General Manager Craig Wallace said the
economic crisis in Seoul meant that its Korean services,
inaugurated in 1996, were no longer commercially viable.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Four American neo-Nazis will
be charged of inciting racist hate in a Stockholm district court
next Monday, Prosecutor Ronnie Jakobsson announced Wednesday.

<P>
When the police went in to detain some 20 of them who had
committed the crime, the police were attacked by the crowd. Police
arrested 314 of them.
</P>
<P>
Most of the detainees were questioned and released later.

Alexis Herman is being investigated by the Justice Department for
allegedly accepting money in exchange for influence with the White
House, ABC News reported Wednesday.

YANGON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- At least 20 more members of

They brought in some arms and ammunition, the report said.

According to a latest official disclosure, a total of 15
anti-government ethnic armed groups have made peace with the

<HEADLINE> Rubber Price Decline Hits Sri Lankan Smallholders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A decline of rubber prices on
the international market has adversely affected Sri Lankan rubber
smallholders, officials of the Plantation Industries Ministry said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The average price of Ribbed Smoked Sheets (RSS) has come down
to 38 Rupees (0.61 U.S. dollars) per kilogram from 44 Rupees (0.71
dollars) per kilogram a few months back.
</P>
<P>
The drop was attributed to the depreciation of the currencies
in Southeast Asian countries, especially the major rubber
producers, such as Thailand and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Smallholders here complained that prices have dropped below the
cost of production. As a result, many of them have been driven out
of business.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministry said the price was still above the cost
of production, which it placed at 32 Rupees (0.52 dollars) per
kilogram.

<HEADLINE> Ice Storm to Slow Canadian Economy in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The recent ice storm that swept
across central Canada will reduce a third of a percentage point of
Canada's economic growth in the first quarter, reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The storm has already inflicted more than 700 million dollars (490
million US dollars) in property damage, and cost industries up to 5 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Canada's economic growth may have been shaved to an annual pace of
2.8 percent from an earlier forecast of 3.1 percent, according to
Sherry Cooper, chief economist at investment firm Nesbitt Burns.
</P>
<P>
That's assuming activities are back to normal by this weekend and
that there's rebound in economic activity next month.
</P>
<P>
The rebound is expected to recapture much of the lost production of
goods and services this month.
</P>
<P>
The severe ice storm in eastern Ontario, Quebec and the Maritimes
topped trees and power lines, shut down businesses and left millions
of residents without power.

MOSCOW, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The partnership charter to be

not directed against any third country and is unlikely to bring
about any negative impact on their relations with Russia, Estonian
Prime Minister Mart Siymann said Wednesday.

worsen the relations of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Siymann said that the charter is a manifestation of the
friendly relations between the Baltic countries and Washington,
the U.S. support for their demand for independence and their
desire to join the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
</P>
<P>
He noted that joining NATO has been a sensitive issue in their
relations with Russia. "But we have to proceed from our own

<P>
YANGON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A Singaporean-invested
galvanized corrugated iron sheet factory, built in the
Hlaingtharya Industrial Zone in Yangon, has gone into production,
official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The factory of the Myanmar Megasteel Industries Ltd of
Singapore, which began operation Wednesday, is set up on a
2.4-hectare plot in the zone and will run for an initial 30-year

tons of galvanized iron sheets annually for local sales and for
export, the report said.

The Hlaingtharya Industrial Zone, one of the five in the
capital, was first developed by local entrepreneurs with
industries like food processing, textile, engineering, electrical
goods, chemical, forest products and animal foodstuff setting up.

<P>
The development of the zone was later joined by multi-national
foreign companies including those from Britain, France, Singapore,

<HEADLINE> Chinese Banks Place Greater Emphasis on Risks, Profits (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last year the ICBC issued its increased loans of 163 billion
yuan last year mainly to 520 national key enterprises. Meanwhile,
it limited lendings to enterprises with credit ratings lower than
BB and ordered a checkup of loans to existing customers with poor
credibility.
</P>
<P>
The CCB has selected a batch of 435 large, well-performing or
promising enterprises as its chief clients. Last year it increased
its loans to these enterprises by 33.9 billion yuan, more than one
third of its total new loans that year. The ratio of bad loans for
these enterprises was merely 1.66 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ABC has drawn up a detailed plan to improve the quality of
its loan portfolio, including the launching of a comprehensive
examination of its present customers, stopping extending new loans
to unqualified enterprises and cutting lendings to enterprises
believed to have only dim prospects.
</P>
<P>
Banking experts say that the shift from focusing on expansion
in overall lending size to risk prevention and profit generation
indicates a significant step taken by China's state-owned
commercial banks to implement asset-to-liability and risk
management.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the banks have already benefited from such
a shift, as the business records of the big-four state commercial
banks all showed some improvement last year.
</P>
<P>
The CCB made 1.51 billion yuan in profits last year, the first
time since 1993 that the bank had a real profit. The ICBC's
profits reached three billion yuan last year, the largest in
recent years, and those of the BOC hit 6.03 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Northeastern Grain Producer to Raise Grain Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Jilin Province, a leading
grain base in northeast China, will take a series of measures this
year to further increase grain production.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government is to allocate 5.3 billion yuan in
grain production and increase the supply of chemical fertilizer to
3.6 million tons this year, said vice provincial governor Yang
Qingcai.
</P>
<P>
The state will provide 200 million yuan in discount loans
to assist the digging of 20,000 motor-pumped wells, which will
bring the irrigated area in Jilin to 333,300 ha.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the province will speed up progress of agro-science,
readjust structure of farm production and boost animal husbandry
development.
</P>
<P>
Jilin harvested 20 billion kg of grain last year, 3.2 billion
kg less than the previous year's figure owing to a severe
drought. The province has 40 million ha of arable land, one 25th of
the national total. It provides one tenth of commodity grain to
the state annually.

<HEADLINE> E. China Province Buys More Grain From Farmers in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Local authorities in east China's
Anhui Province, a major grain producer in the country, purchased
7.2 billion kg of grain from farmers, an increase of 1.6 billion
kg, or 28 percent, over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Last year saw another good harvest for local farmers as the
province's total grain output topped 28.5 billion kg, 1.5 billion
kg more than that of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
To protect the interests of local grain producers, the related
provincial departments made hard efforts to raise sufficient funds
and open more storages for the grain purchase.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the provincial government spent nine billion yuan to
buy grain from local farmers at protective prices.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts, local farmers earned 1.8 billion yuan
more than the previous year from selling their grain.

<HEADLINE> More Laid-off Workers in Guangxi Re-employed in Private Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- About 70,000 laid-offs in
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have been re-employed by
individually-owned or private businesses.
</P>
<P>
This represents a significant 50 percent of the unemployed who
used to work for the state enterprises in the southern Chinese
autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
In order to encourage the re-employment of the laid-offs, the
autonomous regional government has worked out a series of
preferential terms, including tax breaks, for the private firms to
provide jobs to the laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
If the laid-offs themselves want to open a business of their
own, they can also enjoy reduced taxes and fees and simplified
procedures.
</P>
<P>
The government also encourages markets of various sorts to
provide chances for the laid-offs to run business. So far, 460
markets have arranged 12,000 stalls, providing business
opportunities to the laid-offs.

<HEADLINE> Crime Rate Up in Czech Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Crimes in the Czech Republic
increased sharply to 404,000 cases in 1997, the highest in five
years, police chief Oldrich Tomasek said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tomasek told the press that the number of crimes last year
almost doubled the 1990 figure. The year 1997 also saw a big
increase in felonies such as murders, he added.
</P>
<P>
The government's premature abolition of capital punishment was
to blame for the rise in crimes, press here said.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey also showed a majority of the respondents
supported the resumption of death penalty.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the police is grossly short of manpower. In the
capital city of Prague alone, the police is 1200 men short
compared to authorized number. Only 41.9 percent of criminal cases
were solved last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Meteorological Agency
issued a heavy snow warning for Tokyo and its vicinity as snow
began blanketing the city early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The snow, the second heavy one to hit the metropolis in two
weeks, forced railway companies to cancel up to 40 percent of
regular services in a preventive step to avoid delays.
</P>
<P>
At Tokyo's Haneda airport, one of three runways was closed for
an hour from 7:00 a.m. due to snow-clearing operations, and 61
domestic flights were canceled.
</P>
<P>
The agency forecast that snow will continue to fall until
Thursday night as an approaching low-pressure area passes along
the Pacific coast of the Tokyo metropolitan area in the evening.
</P>
<P>
Snowfalls of up to 40 centimeters are expected in Nagano
Prefecture, the site of next month's 18th winter Olympic games,
while open fields of the Kanto region -- Tokyo and its surrounding
prefectures -- are likely to experience snowfalls of up to 15
centimeters, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> 200 Newspapers in Indonesia Face Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The dramatic rise in newsprint
prices following the plunge of the rupiah (national currency)
against the U.S. dollar is threatening about 200 Indonesian
newspapers, local press reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"According to ordinary business calculations, hundreds of
newspaper publishers in Indonesia should have halted publishing,"
Secretary General of the Indonesian Newspapers Publishers'
Association Leo Batubara was quoted as saying by the Kompas daily.
</P>
<P>
He said about 70 percent of the country's 286 newspapers
publishers are threatened with closure by the continuing rise in
newsprint costs.
</P>
<P>
Publishers had attempted to cope with the soaring newsprint
prices by raising subscription costs, reducing the number of pages
or copies, reducing publishing frequencies and cutting down on
news coverage, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the July-September period last year, newsprint prices in
the country stood at 1,530 rupiah per kilogram, including sales
tax. By January this year, prices had reached 4,855 per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Newsprint paper is supplied by a single company, PT. Aspex,
which bases its price on the rupiah equivalent of dollar prices
for the commodity.
</P>
<P>
The dollar has more than tripled in value against the rupiah
since July last year. On Wednesday, rupiah traded at 7,500 to
8,100 per dollar, compared to 2,450 per dollar in the pre-monetary
crisis period last July.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The banking industry of Shanghai,
China's largest economic center, maintained stable and healthy
growth in 1997, according to a senior central bank official here.
</P>
<P>
A moderately tight monetary policy was successfully followed
and financial supervision was effectively strengthened, said Mao
Yingliang, president of the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank
of China, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year the banking system of Shanghai had more
than 620 billion yuan in bank deposits and 416.2 billion yuan in
loans, with the yearly incremental value of loans reaching 64.3
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Increased financial supervision and electronification have
helped to curb the rise of non-performing loans and improve the
quality of credits.
</P>
<P>
The eight overseas banks allowed to deal in the Chinese currency
on a trial basis also reported good business last year.
</P>
<P>
There are 53 licensed overseas financial institutions and 163
representative offices in Shanghai. Their year-end asset value was
up 29 percent over a year ago, while their combined outstanding

<HEADLINE> Chinese Banks Place Greater Emphasis on Risks, Profits (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Increasingly risk and
profit-aware Chinese banks are getting more selective in granting
loans, making down-performing enterprises hard to linger on bank
money.
</P>
<P>
Experts here say that a relatively tight monetary policy partly
accounts for Chinese enterprises' amounting difficulty to get
loans from banks.
</P>
<P>
But the more important reason is that Chinese banks, which have
gained greater independence in a national commercialization drive,
are now better aware than ever of risks and profits, the experts
note.
</P>
<P>
Information from on-going annual meetings of the country's
big-four state-owned enterprises indicates that rendering greater
support to well-performing enterprises while limiting aid to
down-performing ones has become a guiding principle of the banks
in business operation.
</P>
<P>
China's four state-owned commercial banks are the Industrial
and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), the Agricultural Bank of
China (ABC), the Bank of China (BOC) and the China Construction
Bank (CCB).
</P>
<P>
Enterprises with sound business records now do not need to
worry about loans and have actually become targets eagerly sought
by the banks.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that a large part of the big-four's
incremental value of loans was issued in accordance with the
standard principles of the banking industry, which focus on the
combination of "safety, liquidity and profitability".

CARACAS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan government has
been on the alert because of the decline in the global oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Minister of the Energy and Mines, Erwin Arrieta, said that oil
prices may fluctuate between 14.2 and 14.5 U.S. dollars per
barrel, a reduction of more than one dollar over the 15.5 dollars

He said that the country would lose one billion dollars in oil
sales due to the drop.

Oil prices have been falling since last December, but
Venezuelan oil and derived products registered a slight rise on
Tuesday to 12.58 dollars per barrel, five cents higher than the
Monday price.
</P>
<P>
Taking as reference the average price of 15.5 dollars a barrel
envisaged in the 1998 budget, Venezuela lost 98.17 million dollars
in the first 13 days of this year because the actual average price
was 13.14 dollars a barrel.

<HEADLINE> Panama Rules Out to Keep U.S Troops Permanence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian President Ernesto
Perez Balladares said Wednesday that his government will not
negotiate with the United States the permanence of Military Bases in
the country after the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Balladares spoke during his weekly speech and asserted that
the only goal of negotiations with representatives of the White
House is the setting up of a body called Anti-Drugs Multilateral
Center(ADMC).
</P>
<P>
"In September 1995, I propose Presidents of the Rio Group
countries and the U.S. to create the ADMC at one of the military
facilities to be reverted by the U.S. to Panama in accordance to the
Torrijos-Carter Treaties", he said.
</P>
<P>
The accords, subscribed in 1977 by former Panamanian President
Omar Torrijos and U.S. former president James Carter, say the
U.S. must withdraw all his troops deployed in Panama before
December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"At the ADMC there will be no multinational forces nor
military bases and participating countries will be able to
include military personal, but the center will have eminently
civil purposes", he said.
</P>
<P>
Perez Balladares commented drug-trafficking "respects no
borders and Panama, a country which is not a producer nor a
consumer, endures the havoc of drugs, their upshot of violence,
corruption and moral impairment of the youth."
</P>
<P>
"That`s why I think it is convenient the setting up of a
multinational center against drugs", underlined the president.
</P>
<P>
The president stresses the convenience that the ADMC be
integrated by other Latin American countries, now that U.S. and
Panama have set up the juridical foundations last December 23 in
the city of Miami.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, Colombia and Mexico are the countries that have shown
themselves more interested in taking part at the ADMC and have
sent diplomats to Panama in order to know more about the body.
</P>
<P>
After their Monday meeting with Panamanian Foreign Minister
Ricardo Alberto Arias, the officials were reluctant to express
opinion about participation or refusal, until consulting their
government.

<HEADLINE> Motor Vehicles Sales Dip in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Total motor vehicle sales in
Philippines went down by 10.9 percent or a total of 144,378 units
in 1997 from 162,095 units registered in 1996 due to the lingering
currency problem in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc.
(CAMPI) said in a report published Thursday that both passenger
cars and commercial vehicles market suffered slackened demand
following the prolonged currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that the passenger car category dropped by
14.9 percent after selling only 75,707 units in the entire 1997.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, commercial vehicle sales slightly dropped by
6.1 percent to 68,671 units.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Toyota Motor Philippines Corp. gained
the biggest share of 24.9 percent of the entire market for motor
vehicles with total sales of 31,903 units.
</P>
<P>
CAMPI Secretary-General Mario de Grano was quoted as saying the
market contraction was largely due to the continuing depreciation
of the peso against the dollar that triggers the increase in
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The selective and slow approval of retail papers by banks and
other financial institutions have further caused the sales
slowdown.

<HEADLINE> Southwest China Province Records High Gas Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Sichuan Province in southwest
China reported an all-time high of natural gas output of 7.5
billion cubic meters in 1997, making it nearer to its goal of
eight billion by year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Sichuan Petroleum Administration Bureau increased efforts
to prospect natural gas reserves in Datianchi Gas Field in east
Sichuan. As a result, nearly 100 billion cubic meters of gas
reserves have been proven there, with an expected annual
production capacity of 3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
The bureau is responsible to provide gas for two million
households, and 700 major enterprises in Sichuan, Yunnan and
Guizhou provinces, and Chongqing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
Advanced well drilling and logging techniques, and some other
innovations were said to have a role in the good results. In Moxi
Gas Field, low percolation and output readjustment raised the
wells average daily production from 15,000 cubic meters to
20,000.

<HEADLINE> Old-age Insurance System Expanded in Liaoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province, a heavy
industrial center in northeast China, is to build a
market-oriented old-age insurance system by the end of this
century, Vice Governor Guo Tingbiao announced here today.
</P>
<P>
As an old industrial base, Liaoning precedes all the other
provinces and autonomous regions in China in the number of
industrial workers.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of 1996, the province has experimented with
a pension insurance system which combines social pooling of funds
with individual accounts.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, 3.6 million workers, or 62 percent of
old-age insurance policy holders in Liaoning, have opened
individual accounts.
</P>
<P>
This year, the province will lay emphasis on developing old-age
insurance system among self-employed businesses and foreign-funded
firms, Guo said.
</P>
<P>
About 30 percent of self-employed people and half of workers
hired by foreign-funded firms will become policy holders of
old-age insurance by the end of this year, he added.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Adopt New Employment Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
adopt a series of strategic employment plans next month as a lot
of overseas Filipino workers are expected to be sent home from
Asian countries affected by the currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos has called for a national employment
conference on February 4 to explore ways of coping with the
unemployment issue of thousands of overseas workers to be
repatriated home, local press reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The conference is intended to formulate specific and strategic
action programs by various sectors to cushion the effects of
economic reversals on employment and ensure the re-integration of
displaced workers.
</P>
<P>
Labor Secretary Leonardo Quisumbing was quoted as saying that
because of the worsening economic situation in other Asian
countries, many of the private companies will retrench foreign
workers, including Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
According to Quisumbing, some 5,000 Filipino workers -- 2,000
workers in construction and 3,000 in the hotel and tourism
industry -- are expected to be sent home from Malaysia this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 25,000 Filipino workers in South Korea will
lose jobs due to severe economic difficulties in that country, one
of the hardest-hit by the ongoing currency crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, Indonesia and Japan will also retrench Filipino
workers.
</P>
<P>
Ramos has directed the Department of Labor and Employment to
re-train the displaced workers, create jobs and provide assistance
to workers organizations.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has about 4.2 million overseas workers, who
sent home 5.7 billion U.S. dollars remittances through banks in
1997. The remittances accounted for 5 percent of the country's
gross national product (GNP) last year.

<P>
SHANGHAI, January 15 (Xinhua) --The export-import trade volume
of the Pudong New Area of Shanghai grew nearly 25 percent to more
than nine billion US dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that exports rose 18 percent to 3.7
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Computers, integrated circuit and components of micro
electronics were the major import items of the new area, a rising
financial and trade zone separated from downtown Shanghai by the
Huangpujiang River.
</P>
<P>
The major export items included machinery, electronics,
garments and woven products.
</P>
<P>
In another analysis, Japan, the United States and the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region continued to be the top three
trading partners of Pudong, which has been selected as a pilot
area where Sino-overseas trade companies are allowed. Currently
three joint-venture trade firms have been set up in the area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, government ministries and other areas of China have
established in Pudong 86 branch companies in foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Pudong's processing trade, which are mainly located in the
Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone, also reported hefty growth last year.

<P>
LIMA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori on Tuesday inspected the northern city of Tumbes where
heavy rains brought by El Nino have caused overflow of rivers.
</P>
<P>
During the inspection, Fujimori said that Peru will soon start
reconstrution of infrastructure damaged by the El Nino phenomenon,
which is most severe in the last 50 years in the country.
</P>
<P>
El Nino is entering its peak stage between April and June, and
then will go into a "Post-Nino" stage, according to the president.
</P>
<P>
The President said that the government will monitor any changes
in the development of the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The Tumbes River overflew on Tuesday and the river flow reached
2,000 cubic meters per second.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a border post between Peru and Ecuador was blocked
because a cross-border bridge was damaged by an overflow of the
Zarumilla river which flooded the Aguas Verdes town in Peru and
Huaquillas in Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross warned the residents in Tumbes that the rush
might have unearthed landmines that were deployed by Ecuador
during the bordering conflict with Peru in 1995.

<P>
MANILA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has reached an
agreement with the United States on the treatment of members of
the U.S. Armed Forces visiting the country, President Fidel Ramos
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly press conference, Ramos said the Visiting Forces
Agreement is still being reviewed by the different departments
concerned and the formal signing of the accord will be held after
the Senate shall have ratified it.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to give any details of the accord, which,
local reports said, would provide legal protection for U.S service
members visiting the Philippines for military exercises.
</P>
<P>
Ramos hailed the conclusion of the agreement as a positive step
towards enhanced Philippines-U.S. relations and said it will pave
the way for the resumption of the much-delayed joint military
exercises.
</P>
<P>
All military exercises were halted in December 1996 after
Manila ended a legal provision shielding U.S. military personnel
from prosecution by Philippine courts for crimes committed during
military maneuvers in the country.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Sandinistas Impugn Parliamentary Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Sandinista National
Liberation Front (FSLN) of Nicaragua said Wednesday it will file
next week a suit at the Superior Court against the January 9
election of the Parliament`s Board of Directors.
</P>
<P>
"We reiterate that the parliamentary elections were foul so we
will not recognize any directive authority or character from these
deputies who called themselves Directors", said the head of the
FSLN parliamentary group Victor Hugo Tinoco at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The Sandinistas, who have demanded two posts in the Board of
Directors, said the election "paid no respect to plurality and
proportionality stipulated in the inner law of the National
Assembly (Parliament)".
</P>
<P>
Sandinistas have disagreed that the ruling Liberal Alliance,
with 42 Congress seats, holds four pots in the Board of Directors
and the FSLN, with 36 Congress seats, holds only one.
</P>
<P>
"We are intended to talk to other representatives to figure
out a solution to this institutional problem" said Tinoco.
</P>
<P>
Sandinistas representatives have warned they will disturb all
the parliamentary sessions as they did last January 10 during the
President`s State address, if a new Board of Directors is not
elected.
</P>
<P>
Monica Baldonato, only FSLN deputy to win a place in the BD,
called for new protests against the government of President
Arnoldo Aleman.
</P>
<P>
"We hope all this problems move people to demand this
government their legitimate rights", said Monica Baldonato.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Legislator Rafael Barrios
Flores took office Wednesday as the President of Guatemala`s
Congress for 1998, replacing Arabella Castro.
</P>
<P>
Barrios, from the ruling National Advance Guard Party (known as
the PAN) was elected Wednesday with 56 votes against 14, reports
here said..
</P>
<P>
Out of the 56 favorable votes, 43 were from the PAN, six from
the New Guatemala Democratic Front, five from independent deputies
and two from the National Center Union.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Guatemalan Republican Front (known as the FRG)
voted against the PAN candidate.
</P>
<P>
After the poll at the Congress, the FRG President claimed that
the leadership of the Congress approved Wednesday was not
"representative".
</P>
<P>
But he hoped "the new head of the Congress will be more open to
dialogue and consider participation of all legislators in the
working commissions and the forging of new laws".
</P>
<P>
Deputy Arabella de Leon was elected First Vice President, Jorge
Barrientos Second Vice President and Mario Hugo Miranda was chosen

<HEADLINE> GM to Produce Light Trucks in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- General Motors Corporation
plans to clinch a truck joint venture with a major local auto
maker within 1998.
</P>
<P>
This is GM's second complete vehicle production project in
China following the 1.57-billion-US-dollar car venture founded
last year with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC).
</P>
<P>
A corporate official, though declined to reveal such details as
total cost of the project, said that "90 percent" of the
negotiation has been finished. With China's First Auto Works
Jinbei as the partner, the new agreements could be signed within
the year.
</P>
<P>
According to a well-informed source, the model to be produced
in the future venture could be the latest light pick-up developed
by GM's Chevrolet, which made debut in the North America Auto Show
held early this month.
</P>
<P>
Rudolph Schlais Jr., vice president of GM and president of GM China
Operation told Xinhua that the efforts are part of GM's China
strategy with the eventually target to "design and develop
vehicles in China for the China market."
</P>
<P>
On the proceeding of the Shanghai project, he said some 70
percent of the plant construction has been completed so that the
equipment could be installed in February. "It is even unbelievable
that some 60 percent of the local component suppliers have been
tracked," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Also part of GM's long-term commitment to China, Pan-Asia
Technical Center attached to Shanghai GM will provide its
research and development results to not only the SGM but all other
Chinese automakers.
</P>
<P>
Even though failed to gain the nod from China authorities on
Guangzhou car venture, Opel, GM's European subsidiary, will
continue its efforts to seek proper local partners for the
production of family cars is "one of the keys to GM's development
in China," Schlais pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In addition, GM also plans to start its auto-related
financial and distribution with relevant Chinese departments in
1998, he said.

The lifters were Derya Acikgoz, who won two gold medals and one
silver in the 83-kilogram class and broke the world record in the
process; Aysel Ozgur, who won gold and two silvers in the 76-kg
women's class; Nurcihan Unal, who won the silver medal the 83-kg
women's class, and silver medalist Sunay Bulut in the men's 91-kg
class.

as this was his second offense while the others would get two-year
bans.

<HEADLINE> China's Social Sciences Academy To Focus On Practical Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- China's Academy of Social
Sciences (CASS) has decided to make preventing financial crises
one of its major research goals, a spokesman told an annual
meeting Wednesday, and that suggestions will be submitted to the
government.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis in Southeast Asia and in Japan and the
Republic of Korea has caused concern in the Chinese government and
among economists, and the reforms in finance, state enterprises,
the pay system, insurance and welfare, politics, and the legal
system, and the opening up are related topics.
</P>
<P>
Some of the programs were designated by the central government,
according to Ru Xin, vice-president of the academy, and one
program will be to study of Deng Xiaoping Theory, and the academy
will perform its duty as a government think tank.
</P>
<P>
CASS was established in 1977 and now has 3,200 researchers. It
is the most influential liberal arts and social science research
institute in China. Its main effort last year was to help achieve
a soft landing in economic development and provide suggestions for
the return of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Ding Guan'gen, head of the Publicity Department of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee, and a member of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, told the academy that
he hopes the institute will have even greater success in its work
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Central government funds for the academy have doubled in the
past four years, sources say.
</P>
<P>
When the reform and opening up policy was adopted in the late
1970s, most Chinese thought that the natural sciences would be the most
important force for moderizing the country.
</P>
<P>
But, as the society develops, more people are thinking that the
social sciences are just as important, and are now helping China
develop harmoniously.
</P>
<P>
In another note, Li Tieying, a member of the Political Bureau
of the CPC Central Committee, asked researchers to further
liberate their minds, link theory to facts, explore boldly, and
pay attention to new phenomena and problems.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls on U.N. to "Stiffen Resolve" against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
on Wednesday that the U.N. Security Council members should
"stiffen their resolve" against Iraq in the standoff over the
latest weapons inspection crisis.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came as the Security Council issued a statement
after a formal meeting on Wednesday, deploring Iraq's barring of
an American-led U.N. weapons inspection team and its "subsequent
failure to fill its obligations" on providing inspectors with
"full, unconditional and immediate access to all sites."
</P>
<P>
"The council determines that this failure is unacceptable and a
clear violation of the relevant resolutions, including provisions
essential to the accomplishment of the object of the resolutions,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he was encouraged to get a "good statement out of
the United Nations Security Council,"
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that the international community knows that Saddam
Hussein is doing the wrong thing," the president said at a
gathering in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"We have got to remain steadfast in our determination to
continue the inspection process in a nonpolitical way where the
leader of Iraq does not get to determine who, when and what is
going on in that inspection process," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"We just need everybody to stiffen their resolve now so we can
go back and do our jobs and we have to absolutely resolute in
insisting that it be done," he added.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley also welcomed the
Security Council statement.
</P>
<P>
"It sends a very firm and unmistakable signal to Saddam Hussein
that, once again, his efforts to seek fissures and differences
within the Security Council have failed, that the Security Council
remains united, and reiterates its demand that Iraq must cooperate
fully and unconditionally with the UNSCOM (U.N. Special
Commission) inspection regime," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our patience is not limitless. We are giving high priority to
diplomacy at this moment, we want to see this situation resolved
diplomatically and peacefully, but at the same time we have other
options, formidable options," Foley added.
</P>
<P>
"We"ll have to see how UNSCOM Chairman (Richard) Butler's
mission goes next week and await his report to the Security
Council. And what we may or may not want to do in the event of
continued intransigence... remains to be seen," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the United
States was running out of diplomatic options.
</P>
<P>
"We are pursuing and increasingly exhausting the diplomatic
avenues that are available," he told a briefing.

In his letter to Herbert, Lombardi wrote,"All of us have times
in our lives when we say things we regret and wish we could
retrieve, but we cannot. This is one of those times for me."
</P>
<P>
Lombardi told reporters he regreted the words he chose to
describe Herbert.

Governor Lawton Chiles said today, "I just thought it was a
very unfortunate remark," Chiles said. "I'm delighted he has made

<HEADLINE> FAA Releases TWA 800 Air Traffic Control Tape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) today released a tape recording conversations
between the air traffic controller and planes on July 17, 1996,
when Flight 800 of the Trans World Airlines exploded that night
outside New York and killed all 230 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
The FAA made the recording public after receiving it from
the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) which is still
investigating the accident.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 747 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off Long Island
minutes after it took off from New York JFK International Airport
to Paris.
</P>
<P>
On the tape, Boston air traffic control asks the Eastwind
Airlines plane that first reported something: "...did you say
something else?"
</P>
<P>
"Ah we just saw an explosion up ahead of us here, about 16,000
feet (4,877 meters) or something like that. It just went down --
in the water," the Eastwind flight replies.
</P>
<P>
The tape shows that an Alitalia flight immediately confirmed
that it saw the same thing. A Virgin Atlantic plane also confirmed
that.
</P>
<P>
Then the Boston controller can be heard repeatedly calling for
Trans World Airlines Flight 800 to identify itself, but without
receiving a reply.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said that they believed TWA 800 was destroyed by
the explosion of fuel and air fumes in its nearly empty center
fuel tank.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Surprised by Israel's Decision on West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States was
surprised by the Israeli cabinet's decision to hold onto large
segments of the West Bank under any peace deal with the
Palestinians, U.S. officials said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We were taken by surprise and it's not helpful to our ability
to conduct diplomacy on this important subject in advance of the
meetings" next week involving President Bill Clinton and Israeli
and Palestinian leaders, they said.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Cabinet made the decision earlier on Wednesday because
it said the large segments of the West Bank Israel insists to hold
onto were "vital interests" to the Jewish country.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing, State Department spokesman James Foley,
asked about the Israeli cabinet action, said: "This document and
what it may include, as we've seen it referred to in the press,
has not been part of our discussions with the Israelis. And we are
not aware of whether Israel has shared it with the Palestinians."
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. officials were in the dark about the document even
though U.S. envoy Dennis Ross was in the region recently for talks
aimed at making the meetings with Clinton a success.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet Clinton at
the White House on Jan. 20 to discuss further Israel's troop
withdrawals from the West Bank under interim peace deals signed in
1993. Two days later, Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat will meet
Clinton at the White House.

WASHINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
said today that it opposes efforts to lift restrictions on the
sales of U.S. food and medicines to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular briefing, State Department spokesman
James Foley denied a report that there is a humanitarian crisis in
Cuba as a result of the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Foley said that economic pressure on Cuba is part of a
multifaceted strategy to force political changes in the country.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, joined by several
religious and humanitarian groups, called for an end of the ban on
food and medicine sales to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Foley said that the United States permits humanitarian
donations to Cuba as well as the sale on a restricted basis of
medicines and medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has licensed donations of more than 227 million U.S.
dollars in medicines and medical supplies since 1992 and more than
one billion U.S. dollars worth of donations of all types of
humanitarian assistance, according to the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Iraq: Unbalanced Make-up of Arms Inspection Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz said Tuesday night that the lack of balance in the
composition of the U.N. arms inspection team headed by American
Scott Ritter is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said at a news conference that the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction is dominated by the Americans and the Britons.
</P>
<P>
He alleged that the U.S. and British governments are against
the lifting of the U.N. sanctions on Iraq for their own strategic
interests.
</P>
<P>
"No matter what we do, what we implement of the Security
Council resolutions, the position they impose is that 'it's not
enough,'" complained Aziz.
</P>
<P>
"For seven years, we have been facing a situation that the
adversary is the judge," said Aziz. He termed the lack of balance
in the composition of the UNSCOM as "the core of the crisis in
last October and November."
</P>
<P>
Iraqi ordered the expulsion of American weapons inspectors on
November 13 in its standoff with UNSCOM, which was later resolved
after Russian mediation.
</P>
<P>
The situation has not changed since November 20 when the
Special Commission returned to its normal work in Iraq, said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the Special Commission would become
a genuine U.N. agency rather than a U.S. agency.
</P>
<P>
Aziz renewed his call for the use of surveillance aircraft from
other countries, saying the U-2 American spy plane is still
carrying out espionage activities in Iraq under the hat of the
U.N..
</P>
<P>
He alleged that "the fabrications of the American and British
intelligence agencies are still the main source of information of
the Special Commission."
</P>
<P>
"The inspection team that was sent lately is a flagrant
example of this unbalanced situation, the team is almost wholy
Anglo-Saxon, as if the Anglo-Saxons are the sole experts in the
world in the realm of disarmament," said Aziz, adding that "this
is not acceptable."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. arms inspection team which arrived here on Sunday was
composed of nine Americans, five Britons, an Australian and a
Russian. It has been blocked by Iraq from carrying out its work
for two days starting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the new inspection team would be allowed to work
until the balance of the composition has been achieved.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that U.N. chief inspector Richard Butler will
visit Baghdad on January 19 and he will hold talks with the
U.N. official.

JERUSALEM, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Israelis
gathered at the Rabin Square in Tel Aviv Wednesday evening to
protest against the government's plan for troop redeployment in
the West Bank, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators from different right-wing groups said the
Oslo Accords were against the national interests of Israel and the
government should not implement them.
</P>
<P>
They also urged the government not to pullback Israeli troops
from the West Bank.
</P>

So far, no final decision concerning the redeployment has been
worked out by the Israeli government, and the Israeli cabinet is
to meet again on Thursday to further discuss this issue.
</P>

Meanwhile, clashes erupted Wednesday in Hebron between the
Palestinians and Israeli security forces while the Palestinians
were demonstrating to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the
signing of the Hebron Agreement, which stipulates that Israel
complete its troop withdrawal from the West Bank in three stages
by mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators threw stones at the Israeli security forces,
while the Israeli security forces returned with firing of rubber
bullets. No casualties were reported from both sides.

CAIRO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Arab tourism ministers met here

<P>
The Arab Tourism Ministers Council convened at the Cairo-based
