ACTIVIST WANTS TO MELT GUNS FOR DAD'S DAY
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Al Dr. Roger Axford wants for Father's Day Sunday is the
world's largest gun collection.
</P>
<P>
   But the 78-year-old Arizona State University professor isn't
your typical collector. He is a gun control activist trying to
convince fathers that their families will be safer without guns in
the home.
</P>
<P>
   Axford is organizing a Father's Day Gun Meltdown for today at
Tempe City Hall. He hopes to collect 10,000 firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a perfect day this will be for fathers to set an
example,'' Axford said. ``If you're a good father, come down and
hand your gun in.''
</P>
<P>
   Two police officers will accept the weapons from 10 a.m. to 4
p.m. Those donating guns will not have to identify themselves and
will get a free meal at a local restaurant, Axford said.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe Police Chief Ron Burns said that most of the guns
collected will eventually be destroyed. A background check will
first be conducted to see if the gun has a criminal history.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get just one gun that could have been used to commit a
crime or cause an accidental fatality in someone's home,'' Burns
said, ``it will be a success.''
</P>
<P>
   Tempe Councilman Dennis Cahill, a gun owner, wants to promote
gun responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lack of responsible gun ownership,'' said Cahill,
who doesn't plan to hand in his guns but hopes others will as a
symbol of responsible ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear about things like Littleton, and it stimulates people
in different ways,'' Cahill said. ``It is my hope that people will
hand in their guns as a demonstration of their frustration with all
of the recent tragedies.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is so supportive of Axford's idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nonsense,'' said Joe Foss, a member of the National Rifle
Association board of directors who lives in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``A gun is a piece of art,'' he added. ``That's what Hitler did,
take the guns away. Mao Tse Tung said, `He who has the guns has
control.' I don't want to be directed by any group of clowns about
what to do with my gun. They won't get mine, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Axford, an author of 13 books, has been involved in
anti-violence movements for several decades. He founded the
Coalition for Peace and Justice, which will mark its 25th
anniversary this August.
</P>
<P>
   Axford said his children are his primary motivation for the
meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day there is an article in the paper about kids getting
shot and killed,'' he said. ``There are too many 13- and
14-year-old kids getting access to guns and then going and using
them. We have to stop this. Somebody's got to take initiative.'' &QL;

WHITERIVER RESIDENTS CONFRONT FIRE'S DEVASTATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITERIVER, Ariz. _ One Apache child said it looked like an
erupting volcano. A woman described a fireball that resembled a
``red-hot candy apple.''
</P>
<P>
   A week after a fast-moving fire raged through the Fort Apache
Indian Reservation here, devastating some and sparing others,
tribal members began to rebuild their lives as they sought a reason
for their loss.
</P>
<P>
   Verlinda James was struggling for explanations as she rocked her
3-month-old daughter in a car seat on the hotel bed.
</P>
<P>
   Her comfy four-bedroom house, with its white picket fence, was
gone _ incinerated in the inferno that charred more than 5 square
miles in its first five hours and destroyed more property than any
Arizona blaze since the 1990 Dude fire near Payson.
</P>
<P>
   It must have been the mysterious ways of God, James said. She
noted that the 100-foot wall of flame that roared down the ridge to
claim her house didn't even smudge the paint on the homes of her
three neighbors along Arizona 73.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe, James said, it was because she hadn't recently cleared
out the carpet of dead, dry pine needles around her house. Then
James' 17-year-old daughter, Yolanda Harvey, chimed in, blaming
firefighters for not spraying fire retardant on their house.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, James, a single mom of four, is among the
worst casualties. Her house wasn't insured, she has no job or car
and she said she receives no financial help from the former men in
her life.
</P>
<P>
   Her large supply of beads, with which she fashioned Apache
crafts, also was lost. The American Red Cross has put her up for a
week in the White Mountain Apache Tribe's motel. The tribe has
kicked in $500 and rent for one month in a house after the family
leaves the motel. But after that, what?
</P>
<P>
   It's the same bleak question facing the other 16 families who
lost homes, most also uninsured. A total of 30 structures were
destroyed during the 4,300-acre fire, which came dangerously close
to burning Whiteriver's hospital and the Alchesay National Fish
Hatchery north of town.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the tribe's business enterprises lost his home
to the flames. So did a 65-year-old woman who was caretaker for her
83-year-old mother. And so did a mother of five, a Whiteriver
minister and an elderly couple on public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the near misses.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Lavender and his family heard about the roaring blaze
while shopping 25 miles away in Pinetop-Lakeside. They raced home _
to be told at a roadblock that they had five minutes to get out.
</P>
<P>
   Nine-year-old A.J. Lavender, Albert's son, said it looked as if
a volcano had just exploded atop the 800-foot-high ridge behind the
home. The family members hurried together a couple of boxes of
pictures and heirlooms and tossed them into their pickup along with
their three dogs. They decided to leave their cats behind.
</P>
<P>
   But the truck wouldn't start.
</P>
<P>
   They saw the flames move into a neighbor's yard. Then the
firestorm moved into their back yard, burning a small pine tree,
cactus and their woodpile. Emergency workers sped past on the
highway but didn't stop.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the pickup's engine kicked in.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy and Velma Martel had no trouble getting their old school
bus started by their log cabin in the community known as Jurassic
Park. They loaded their children and possessions and picked up some
nearby kids as a fireball that Velma Martel described as a
``red-hot candy apple'' closed in from the south.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Martel said he never expected to see his cabin again.
After all, it was surrounded by large pines, firewood and scrap
wood he had used to fashion the eaves.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case, he left behind a long garden hose. Though still a
quarter-mile away, the fire shot out embers that ignited two small
fires in the trees behind his house. Firefighters put those out
with his hose.
</P>
<P>
   Velma Martel was counting her blessings days later as she drove
her children into Whiteriver for a tribal parade honoring the 800
firefighters who helped prevent the blaze from entering two
subdivisions.
</P>
<P>
   Bedsheets scrawled with praises for the firefighters lined four
miles of Arizona 73. Children waved streamers from a school bus in
the red and blue colors of local Alchesay High School. The Apaches'
all-woman firefighting team marched in formation with shovels and
picks. Slurry planes flew low.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been told all spring that a fire was going to come and
wipe out our school and homes,'' said White Mountain Apache
Chairman Dallas Massey. ``But given what could have happened here,
we feel very fortunate.'' &QL;

A COURSE THAT'S A FORCE OF PURE EVIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. - He felt like he had been locked in a light
saber fight against an orange-eyed warrior from the Dark Side.
</P>
<P>
   For almost five hours he battled for survival. His relentless
opponent tested his skill. His will. His courage. His patience. His
nerve.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, after he had bogeyed three holes in a row and
then found salvation with a heroic shot to the 18th green, Phil
Mickelson closed his eyes and filled his cheeks with air.
</P>
<P>
   He exhaled, a sigh of exhaustion and relief.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Open is like no other major sports event. The NFL
doesn't narrow the goal posts for the Super Bowl. Pro basketball
doesn't raise the rim for the NBA Finals. But the United States
Golf Association selects a challenging course for its national
championship and then does what it can to make the test even more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Wicked pin placements _ ``borderline sadistic'' one player
called them _ and swirling winds transformed Pinehurst No. 2 into a
force of pure evil.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kite, the 1992 Open champion, shot 80 Saturday. John Daly
who has won two majors, shot 81. Former Masters champ Larry Mize
shot 84.
</P>
<P>
   Par at Pinehurst is 70. The average third-round score was 75.9.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, players trudged off the course, heads bowed,
disheveled and defeated. Each survivor had his own story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm often asked what's the hardest golf course I've ever
played,'' Lee Janzen, the defending Open champion, announced after
shooting 76. ``Now I have the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Hank Kuehne, the 23-year-old amateur, played the first eight
holes in 10 over par. He ``rallied'' to shoot 81.
</P>
<P>
   Searching his memory, Kuehne said the last time he played nine
holes in 10-over par he was 11 years old. Tired? Kuehne smiled. ``A
double (bogey), a triple and a quad in nine holes pretty much zaps
you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played on a lot of golf courses, but this is beyond
extremely difficult. If I had to play golf like this every day I
don't know if I would.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandel Chamblee, from Phoenix, called the course ``Augusta
(National) on steroids.'' Pinehurst No. 2 played tougher than the
Masters course. Harder than Pebble Beach, Old Double-Bogey by the
Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see carnage out there,'' Chamblee confidently predicted
after his round. He was pleased his ordeal was over. ``I'm going to
go have a couple of beers and enjoy (watching) it.''
</P>
<P>
   For disaster lovers this was entertainment at its best. The
game's finest shot-makers saw iron shots hit their target and then
roll off the crowned, linoleum-hard greens. The fifth hole was
almost impossible to par. Chamblee's approach shot bounced off the
putting surface ``and ended up back there where they sell
popcorn.''
</P>
<P>
   The wind was vexing, to those easily vexed. ``It was doing
this,'' Gary Hallberg said, making a quick circular motion as if
his finger were a spoon and he were stirring cake batter. Like
others, Hallberg felt if he could just make three pars in a row he
could gain some ground.
</P>
<P>
   Kite won the Open at Pebble Beach in a gale. He found Pinehurst
just as challenging. because many of the pins were placed atop
knolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The golf course is wonderful,'' Kite said, ``but (the USGA)
has got to give us a chance to hit 7-irons that will stick on the
green.''
</P>
<P>
   But the USGA isn't going to oblige. Golf's governing body would
like to see par win the Open and 280 for four rounds may be good
enough. Only Payne Stewart is under par. Knickers holds a one-shot
lead over the former ASU star, who today finally will win his first
major championship or once again go home disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the course is playing very fair,'' Mickelson said
voicing a minority opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price provided the best line when asked how he felt about
the U.S. Open possibly returning to Pinehurst No. 2 in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be a great thing,'' Price said. ``I won't be
here.'' &QL;

GRIDLOCK ON CRASH COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ Saturday is known as ``moving day'' on the PGA
Tour. Of course, the U.S. Open doesn't fall into that category.
</P>
<P>
   This Saturday at the 99th national championship was more like a
heavy backup situation. When the pileups finally subsided at
Pinehurst No. 2, only Payne Stewart had the distinction of being
under par, and even his 1-under total for 54 holes was not without
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Seven players had begun the third round in red numbers, but one
by one they suffered a variety of fender benders. More calamities
can be expected today, as this storied layout is proving to be
golf's version of a stock car race.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval, one of those who suffered most in the wind and
occasional rain that spit through the tall Carolina pines, defined
today's strategy best.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy that backs up the smallest will be the winner,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, for one, will be trying to build on the momentum he got
on the final hole Saturday. He also hopes to reverse his fortune
from last year, when he led the Open at the Olympic Club near San
Francisco for three rounds before ending up 1 stroke behind Lee
Janzen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to it,'' said Stewart, who is 1 stroke in
front of Phil Mickelson, and 2 better than Tiger Woods and Tim
Herron, who like Mickelson hails from Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've wanted this opportunity, and now I've got to go out and
deal with it,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   There were times during Round 3 when Stewart looked like he
might not get a chance at redemption. Beginning at the eighth hole,
he was hit with three straight bogeys, and looked as if a fourth
was on the way at No. 11, where he faced a tricky, 10-foot putt to
save par.
</P>
<P>
   ``The saving grace of the whole round was the putt at No. 11,''
said Stewart, who ended up making a 10-foot birdie putt on the
final hole to grab the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the (bogey) train in a big way, and there's not many
stops around here where you can get off.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who captured the 1991 Open in a playoff over Scott
Simpson at Hazeltine National near Minneapolis, said he felt like
his 72 was ``even par.'' And considering the average score on this
torturous day was 75.97, and that only Steve Stricker broke par
with a 69, his point was well-taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such thing as a routine par out there,'' Stewart
said of Pinehurst No. 2, which seems to be a killing field built on
crowned greens that have been enhanced by brutal weekend pin
positions.
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, this Open remains wide open, with Mickelson,
Woods, Duval and Vijay Singh being the most likely challengers. But
Herron, and yet another Scottsdale pro, Billy Mayfair, also might
prevail in what basically comes down to a short game showdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I played poorly, but if that's my worst round, and I
can improve on it, I should be in good shape,'' said Mickelson, who
bounced back with a 6-foot birdie on the last hole to get to 73
after being stung by three straight bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who is coming off two consecutive victories, one in
Germany and one at the prestigious Memorial, also rebounded after
getting off to a double bogey-bogey start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tough day,'' sighed Woods, who managed to get back to 72 with
a birdie at the 15th.
</P>
<P>
   Even the birdie didn't come easy, as Woods flinched on a 5-iron
that somehow ended up 4 feet from the cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hoped I would be at par by the end of the day, but after the
start I got off to, I'll take it,'' he said. ``I just love this. I
love playing in the most intense pressure of the final day.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Duval, who was 5 over after nine holes, then ground out
nine straight pars coming home to finish at 75 and give himself a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a lot of bad shots, but I thought if I was lucky, I
might still be there,'' said Duval, who like Mickelson is looking
for his first major championship. ``I did what you have to do after
I got so far down, I hung in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is the theme of the week, along with Stewart's
never-wavering presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm playing better this year at the U.S. Open than
I played last year, and that I've got some unfinished business to
take care of,'' Stewart said. ``I could have crawled away and hid
after what happened last year, or I could build on what happened
and use it to strengthen myself. That's the avenue I have chose to
take.'' &QL;

FRIENDS OF SLAIN GIRL SEEK CLUES TO BULLET'S SOURCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURA TRUJILLO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Even as Keri Amrhein knocked on doors, handing out
fliers Saturday morning, she wondered if her effort would make a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   If telling people about her friend Shannon Smith would matter.
If anyone could really find out who fired the bullet into the air
last Monday, the bullet that fell from the sky, killing 14-year-old
Shannon as she stood in her central Phoenix back yard.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't think about those things, she reminded herself as
she walked the narrow, quiet streets along Central Avenue near
Camelback Road, where cute brick-box houses sit next to Spanish
villas and sprawling ranches.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to stay hopeful,'' she said, shuffling her thick
Doc Martens sandals along the asphalt. ``All we can do is pray and
hope. And getting out and doing this is better than just staying at
home and crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Keri, 14, was joined by about 200 others Saturday morning. They
were friends of Shannon and her parents. They were students who had
attended Madison Meadows Elementary School with her. They were
strangers, those who simply heard about the girl's death and wanted
to help.
</P>
<P>
   They came together at St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church to pass
out more than 6,000 fliers, asking for help. They wanted anyone who
may have heard gunshots or seen anything suspicious the night
Shannon was killed to call police. And when they delivered each
flier, to every house, apartment and business in a half-mile radius
of Shannon's home, they came back for more.
</P>
<P>
   The fliers told residents what happened last Monday night when
Shannon was talking to a friend on a cell phone in her back yard.
Between 9:30 and 10:30 p.m., a stray bullet that likely was fired
from within a half-mile radius from her home hit her.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon's dad found her about 10:40 p.m. She died later at a
hospital, where X-rays showed a bullet had penetrated her brain.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone looked at the photograph of Shannon on the flier
and saw themselves or their children. They could see themselves
standing in their own back yards, in the safety of their own
neighborhood where people push baby buggies and walk dogs at night,
just like Shannon. And it scared them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been my daughter,'' said Judy Meyer, 54, a
speech pathologist, whose daughter was a classmate of Shannon's and
who lives just a few blocks from the shooting. ``It just upsets
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer and her husband, Richard, and their 14-year-old daughter,
Tova, walked their neighborhood Saturday morning, passing out
fliers. And they plan to pass out more later this week.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Phoenix police detectives say, tips haven't led them any
closer to solving the case. But the investigation is continuing.
Sgt. Mike Torres, a police spokesman, says the flier distribution
is helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that can keep it out there in the public eye can't
hurt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon's parents, Otis and Lory, were heartened by the efforts
for their only child.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to thank everybody,'' said Otis' sister, Edie
Smith, 58. ``We are really touched by the outpouring of the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Edie Smith flew to Phoenix from to New York City for the funeral
this week, then helped deliver fliers.
</P>
<P>
   `We're never going to know why Shannon,'' she said. ``But it
would be of some small comfort, both to our family and our
community, to know who did this. The more you know about something,
the more you can avoid it.''
</P>
<P>
   Edie Smith had bought her niece an airplane ticket to visit her
in New York for the girl's 14th birthday. She was supposed to visit
in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be her first big trip to New York alone,'' said Edie
Smith, who teaches English as a second language. ``Kids evolve in
such interesting ways. I was so looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   After Shannon's funeral Thursday, family friends Dan and Kendis
Drake organized the canvass, printing out maps of the neighborhood
and fliers.
</P>
<P>
   The Drakes, who have known the Smiths so long that they got one
of the first calls when Shannon was born, say they are hopeful the
fliers will move someone who may have information about the
shooting to call police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do anything to help out, so it won't happen to
anybody else,'' said Dan Drake, 51, an assistant U.S. attorney.
``With the Fourth of July coming, and people shooting guns then, we
want to get awareness out there about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the shade of a palm tree in front of St. Francis
Xavier Church on Central, Drake smiled as volunteers showed up to
help Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   By noon, more than 200 people had stopped by.
</P>
<P>
   Milton Tweedy pulled up in his cab, offering to hand out fliers
to all his passengers this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work in the area, I live around here, so whatever I can do
to help,'' said Tweedy, 45, of Phoenix. ``I'll get the message out.
It's just so sad.''
</P>
<P>
   The cheerleading squad from Madison Meadows canceled their
carwash Saturday, instead delivering fliers. Phoenix firefighters
canvassed streets. Kinko's wouldn't allow volunteers to pay for
fliers. And AJ's donated water.

<P>
   ``The really cool thing is people seemed so thankful,'' said
Megan Bednarz, 39, a marketing manager. She walked more than a mile
in her K-Swiss tennis shoes, handing out fliers throughout the
morning. ``People just wanted to pass on their wishes to the
family. And they were grateful we are doing this.''

   PHOENIX - Give the dads a break today.
</P>
<P>
   Professional sports team bosses catch flack year-round for
everything from stadium issues to ticket prices to player and coach
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they're celebrating Father's Day amid the ascent of their
children to key positions in the Valley's pro sports scene _ and
the children could help leave a mark on sports for another
generation to come.
</P>
<P>
   From the Bidwills to the Burkes to the Colangelos, family
dynasties are in the making as the younger generation becomes more
prominent.
</P>
<P>
   At America West Arena, Jerry Colangelo is president and CEO of
the Suns and son Bryan is executive vice president and general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Across town at the Cellular One Ice Den, Coyotes owner and
governor Richard Burke's son Taylor is the assistant general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   And in Tempe, home of the Cardinals, team president and sole
owner Bill Bidwill has an even larger family presence _ son Michael
is a vice president and general counsel, Bill Jr. is a vice
president, and daughter Nicole is marketing manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real gift,'' the senior Burke said. ``Most parents lose
touch when their kids go away to college.''
</P>
<P>
   In these families, even when the kids did go away, they didn't
lose touch and eventually came home to the family business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a special joy in thinking that if you had a dream or a
goal it would turn out like this,'' Jerry Colangelo said. ``It's
somewhat of a dream come true.'' &QL; 
Back to the business &QL; 
When the Bidwills gather around the grill today for a cookout,
they'll be sharing that same feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up around the organization, I had always wanted
someday to be involved with the team and my father,'' Michael
Bidwill said. ``I looked forward to it as a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Cardinals would lose?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a challenge growing up and the team wouldn't win,
hearing things from other kids,'' Michael said.
</P>
<P>
   His father encouraged him to go away to law school, and he did.
And even while serving as a federal prosecutor in Phoenix for six
years, Bidwill stayed close to the team by charting opponents from
the press box.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's a key figure, leading the effort to get a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that visible and controversial position, Michael is
pleased to be working with dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' he said. ``It's great to work with him.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about his dad, a sometimes mysterious figure to Valley
residents?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have them here because I know they've grown up in
the business,'' Bill Sr. said. ``They have the background and
history and are really interested in the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Dad has a sense of humor many in the Valley might not know
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always fun to see what new jokes he has going on,''
Michael said. ``Most people don't see that side of him.''
</P>
<P>
   That photo you see accompanying this story that includes
Michael's brother, Tim, a lawyer who doesn't work for the team?
</P>
<P>
   Dad's practical joke was sending Tim home to get dressed up for
the photo, complete with tie, on a hot day. Much to the family's
delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of fun working with him, and I wish him a happy
Father's Day,'' said Michael, who's been with the team since 1996. &QL; 
Learning the trade &QL; 
Bryan Colangelo has been with the Suns for 11 seasons now, four in
his current job.
</P>
<P>
   He went away to school at Cornell University in New York and
then lived and worked in New York City, but somehow he and his dad
knew he'd be back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought someday it would be terrific,'' father Jerry said.
``He grew up with it, so it was ingrained in him. When I thought it
was an opportune time, I called.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bryan, who has three sisters, returned to his native
Phoenix, home to all the Colangelo children and eight
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bryan had some reservations at the time because of the
perception that he would be joining us just because of me,'' Jerry
Colangelo said. ``But that wasn't even a concern of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Bryan used to rip his father when he didn't like a
particular Suns trade pulled off by dad. It was just part of
learning by osmosis. Now Bryan's the one who gets ripped _ or
praised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The education of growing up around him prepared me for the
job,'' he said. ``All the relationships and positive situations in
the NBA have fortunately carried over for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colangelo relationship has been scrutinized and criticized
more than the others, but father and son are unequivocal about the
arrangement. The job is earned, not a handout.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan previously was a scout, assistant director of player
personnel, and vice president/assistant general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows he's being judged by his job performance and the
results and doesn't expect anything more,'' Jerry Colangelo said.
``He didn't get any special favors. In fact, I was probably harder
on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Bidwill can relate to that. The only girl in the family,
she grew up with four brothers and joined the Cardinals 10 years
ago when they moved to the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually did have to send my resume in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, she was attending graduate school in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   And like Bryan with his dad, Nicole says her dad expects _ and
gets _ a lot of hard work.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Colangelo acknowledges he could be fired or leave the job
on his own someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gives me enough leeway to prove myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Each Colangelo has a strong personality, and they respect that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a hard head, he's a harder head,'' Bryan said. &QL; 
Respecting boundaries &QL; 
Taylor Burke, 26, is the youngest of these three sons making a mark
on Valley sports. Bryan Colangelo is 33, Michael Bidwill 35.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Colangelo and Bidwill, Burke, one of five children, is
somewhat sheltered from the storm because of a layer of management
between him and his owner/dad. Burke reports to Coyotes General
Manager Bobby Smith, whom he met while both were attending graduate
school at the University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``My situation is a little bit different with Bobby in
between,'' Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father gives me the business perspective, Bobby gives me
the hockey perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   But he and his father are able to put family aside when business
calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respect the boundaries,'' the younger Burke said. ``You
have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke, heading into his fourth year with the team, decided after
graduate school that he wanted to do something in business with his
father rather than head to the financial world in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many businesses where this might not be as
appealing,'' his father said, citing the medical companies he has
run as an example.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is a unique business. Sports has a glamorous and fun
aspect to it.'' &QL; 
Emotional bonds &QL; 
The moments of fun can be especially meaningful to a family such as
the Bidwills, who endured years of losing and public ridicule
before last season's playoff run that featured a win over the rival
Dallas Cowboys at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so much fun and so rewarding to be able to celebrate
that as a family,'' Nicole Bidwill said. ``It was so great to see
my father that happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have been in the Bidwill family longer than Jerry
Colangelo, 59, or Richard Burke, 54, have been alive.
</P>
<P>
   It all began when Bill Bidwill's father, Charles, bought the
then Chicago Cardinals in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   And Bill, 67, has kept alive the family tradition.
</P>
<P>
   As the team passed from his father, who died in 1947 when Bill
was 15, to mother Violet for 15 years, and then on to sons Bill and
Charles Jr. before Bill became sole owner in 1972, Bill did just
about everything you could imagine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a ballboy, I was in scouting, I signed players,'' Bill
Sr. said. ``I did a little bit of everything. I was sort of the
assistant everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's able to share that past with the present generation.
And it's not always as easy or glamorous as one might think.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in an emotional contact sport, and there are times when
some of that comes out privately,'' Bill Sr. said.
</P>
<P>
   Bidwill's private persona has somewhat puzzled the Valley over
the years, but his children defend his privacy and clearly enjoy
him in a way not many can in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a private person, and I respect him for that,'' Michael
Bidwill said.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Bidwill wishes more people could hear about her dad as a
father.
</P>
<P>
   She fondly recalls him carpooling around St. Louis, driving her
back and forth to college, taking her to ballgames.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the only girl in the family, and growing up with all boys
in a male-dominated sports was interesting,'' she said. ``He always
included all of us in the team. Dad used to take each child to one
away game each year.''
</P>
<P>
   Each family shares its memories, its victories and losses.
Privately and publicly, prominent sports business figures and their
kids endure through the potshots and barbs _ whether deserved or
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his turn to take some of the bullets,'' Jerry Colangelo
says with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   And Bryan smiles, knowing his dad is right. And knowing he's
almost as hard-headed as his dad. &QL;

LADY LUCK SMILING ON KERR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO - Steve Kerr knows all about The List, and he breaks
into a sheepish smile, smart enough to know there is no logical
reason for the company he keeps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like that game you play when you're a kid: One of these
things is not like the other,'' Kerr said. ``John Havlicek. Bill
Russell. Sam Jones. Steve Kerr.''
</P>
<P>
   The List is relevant and where you'll find Kerr's latest kiss of
good fortune. And as a dreadful series moves to New York for an
inevitable conclusion _ unless you think the Knicks can win four of
five games against a team that has won 44 of its past 50 _ Kerr is
about to become the 11th man in NBA history to win four consecutive
NBA championships.
</P>
<P>
   So The List is floating around these NBA Finals, littered with
ex-Boston Celtics, a team that won 11 championships in 13 seasons.
But it hasn't had a new addition in 33 years, and that's about to
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of shocking, really,'' Kerr said. ``To think I'm in
my fourth Finals with four years left on my contract.''
</P>
<P>
   With a team in San Antonio that could rattle off a few more
titles in the very near future.
</P>
<P>
   The smile becomes serene. After all, there is already a
safe-deposit box in Chicago stuffed with three championship rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I ever wanted to impersonate Liberace,'' he said, ``I'll
just wear them all at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, good things happen to good people, and this is about
as much an explanation as you'll find for Steve Kerr.
</P>
<P>
   When he graduated from Arizona in 1989, one year after current
teammate Sean Elliott, he was already reflecting on his luck, how a
player with obvious limitations had managed to compile a wonderful
career at a major college program. Now, if he could just taste a
piece of fruit from the NBA tree, to say he made it, if for only a
day, he would really be blessed.
</P>
<P>
   A new century is approaching, and if he plays to the end of his
contract, Kerr will have authored a 15-year career.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, a wonderful life, even for a man whose father was
assassinated overseas so many years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell myself that every day,'' Kerr said.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, it is bittersweet, all this attention for doing very
little. Like every other ex-Bull, with the exception of Jud
Buechler, Kerr has struggled in a new locale. His three-point touch
is missing, his playing time is down, and there are times when he
appears frighteningly overmatched.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no jealousy among the Spurs, a room full of
wonderful human beings. And there is very little talk about Kerr's
paycheck (he signed a five-year, $11 million deal in the
off-season) outweighing his value (he shot 31 percent from beyond
the three-point line this season and has not been a postseason
factor).
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, Kerr is treated more like a good-luck charm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans are very nice to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Through all of his success, Kerr's greatest feat is that he has
remained one of us. A millionaire athlete who knows that the value
of celebrity is shaky, shallow and better suited for others.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, just before the Spurs won their 12th consecutive
playoff game, a writer from ``Sports Illustrated'' sat down next to
Kerr. Tabbed as one of the NBA's smartest players, Kerr rattled off
answers to a quasi-intelligence quiz, listing the latest book he's
read, pondering who he'd most like to have dinner with, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Then came his most embarrassing moment, and the sheepish smile
returned.
</P>
<P>
   One day, Kerr pulled up to a gas station. He got out of his car,
leaving the door open. He bought a paper, reading it on his way
back to the vehicle. He got into the car and shut the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put the paper down, and I realized I was in someone else's
car,'' Kerr said. ``I looked up and in the store, and the person
was looking at me, like I was about to steal her car.''
</P>
<P>
   Laughter. And then the last question: What happened at the
Alamo?
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost,'' Kerr said.
</P>
<P>
   True, but this is not the Alamo. This is not even a battle. This
is a series in desperate need of an ending, a coronation and not a
competition.
</P>
<P>
   And, as his smile will tell you, just the latest stop in the
charmed professional life of Steve Kerr. &QL;

NBA CONSIDERS TRANSFUSION OF RULE CHANGES TO SPARK OFFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like Austin Powers, the NBA needs to go back in time
and reclaim its potency. Something evil _ lax defensive rules,
better athletes or a worse work ethic _ has stolen the league's
offensive mojo.
</P>
<P>
   With this year's Spurs-Knicks Finals yet another example of how
defense wins championships but loses fans, the league will meet
here Tuesday to consider drastic rules changes aimed at returning
the game to the wide-open, high-scoring style of the '70s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring averages have plummeted 16 points per team since 1990,
15 of the past 16 Finals games have seen both teams held under 100,
and the Knicks are averaging just 29 field goals in this series,
the same amount of ``rebounds'' that Boston's Bill Russell averaged
in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've basically gotten away from basketball,'' said Denver
Nuggets general manager Dan Issel, who played for some of the
league's highest-scoring teams when Doug Moe coached Denver. ``It's
more one-on-one, two-on-two, and other guys stand around and watch.
We have to come up with some rules changes to get back to playing
team basketball again. And some of them have to be drastic.''
</P>
<P>
   A committee that will include, among others, commissioner David
Stern, Issel, Boston Celtics coach Rick Pitino, Houston Rockets
coach Rudy Tomjanovich, Miami Heat coach Pat Riley, Phoenix Suns
owner Jerry Colangelo and Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, will come up
with proposals to present at the next the Board of Governors
meeting. If approved, the proposals might be implemented as early
as summer-league games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for something less physical, with more points
and less offensive repetition,'' deputy commissioner Russ Granik
said. ``We don't want to alter the fundamentals of the game, but
it's time for a fresh look at some real problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes being considered:
</P>
<P>
   International lane. Two feet wider at the baseline, the lane
makes centers post up farther from the basket. In theory, this
makes big men harder to double-team while also allowing more room
for cutters toward the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Isolation violation. Like college, closely guarded players could
only hold the ball for five seconds. This would eliminate Charles
Barkley pounding the dribble for 15 seconds, trying to coax a
double-team and find an open 3-point shooter.
</P>
<P>
   Zone defenses. There are proponents of allowing any type of
defense, including zones. The thinking is that it would persuade
offenses to push the pace before defenses could set up, and would
keep games from following the monotonous
dump-to-the-post-and-spot-up pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Clock tinkering. Some want a 30-second shot clock, others 20.
Either way, this Finals will probably be the last of the 24-second
era. A longer clock, say its backers, would give offenses more time
to probe for a better shot, while supporters of the quicker clock
reason that teams would be forced to play at a faster tempo.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see a much different game next season,''
Colangelo said. ``We've got to open things up. If it works, teams
may actually score 100 points again.''
</P>
<P>
   What the league wants is basketball light on the 3-point set
shot and heavy on the slam dunk and transition jumpers perfected in
the late '80s and early '90s by Magic Johnson's Lakers and even
Larry Bird's Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics scored 148 points in Game 1 of the 1985 Finals.
Friday night in San Antonio, the Knicks and Spurs combined for 147.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ugly basketball, there's no way to hide it,'' Spurs
center Tim Duncan said. ``We're not the prettiest team to watch.
But even if they change the rules, it'll still be about putting the
ball in the basket. Defenses are physical and very aggressive, and
that's why you see so many missed shots. Right now, defense is the
name of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   There's more than enough evidence to suggest the league's
offensive meltdown requires a complete reboot.
</P>
<P>
   This season, scoring was at it lowest since the inception of the
shot clock in 1954-55. It has been four years since two teams (the
Rockets and Orlando Magic) topped 100 in the same game of the
Finals. Allen Iverson's 28.6 average was the lowest for a scoring
champ since 1956-57 and his 41.2 shooting percentage the lowest
since 1949-50.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, actually considered an up-tempo team, are on pace to
break Finals record lows for points per game (80.1 by Utah last
year), field-goal percentage (33.9 by Syracuse in '55), field goals
per game (29.5 by Syracuse) and assists per game (16.8 by Seattle
in '96).
</P>
<P>
   In the past seven quarters, New York has scored a whopping 117
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, it's boring a lot of the time,'' said Spurs
Hall of Famer George Gervin, whose team once scored 82 points in
the first half of an American Basketball Association playoff game.
``Where's the style? Where's the originality? It looks like
everybody's doing the same thing and none of them are doing it too
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for Sacramento's flashy up-tempo game and Utah's
trademark pick-and-roll sets, the rest of the league's offenses are
cookie-cutter schemes designed to draw double-teams in the post to
set up 3-pointers. In a Rockets-Mavericks game early this season,
Houston had 67 offensive possessions. On 53 occasions, they dumped
the ball into Barkley or Hakeem Olajuwon on the low left block.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days of Gervin's creative finger roll or Julius
Erving's swooping reverse layups. Instead, the two most dominant
moves in today's game are Shaquille O'Neal's monster dunk and Allen
Iverson's crossover dribble, which, ultimately, still requires him
to make a 15-foot jumper.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys today are athletes, but not skilled basketball
players,'' Gervin said. ``They spend too much time in the weight
room looking in the mirror or at the tattoo parlor and not enough
time in the gym working on dribbling with their left hand or
shooting bank shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as it's difficult to envision the Warriors of Don Nelson,
now the Mavericks coach, producing four 50-point quarters in 1991,
it's harder to stomach the Spurs easing into a 2-0 Finals lead
without making half their field goals, missing 35 percent of their
free-throw attempts and failing to score 90 points.
</P>
<P>
   But of all the glaring numbers, the one that hurried the league
to act now was that Game 1 was the least-watched Finals opener
since 1986. Low-scoring, defensive tug of wars may be exciting and
popular in the NHL, but in the NBA they are a problem that will
soon be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game has lost something, and there needs to be something
inserted to meet the demands of the TV viewers and the players,''
new Lakers coach Phil Jackson said. ``For the good of the game, we
can't continue to be regulated by individual play. I'm glad we're
admitting a problem and addressing it. That's the first big step.''

STEWART TAKES U.S. OPEN LEAD AS COURSE TAKES ITS TOLL

<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ Payne Stewart separated himself from his U.S.
Open pursuers Saturday by a single stroke, provided by a 15-foot
birdie putt on the final hole of the third round at Pinehurst
Resort and Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not the shot the SMU graduate singled out as most
significant in allowing him to sit on the 54-hole lead at the Open
for the second consecutive year and third time since 1991. Instead,
Stewart pointed to a 10-foot putt at No. 11, which allowed him to
rescue par from a greenside bunker after three consecutive bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got on the bogey train and I had to get off,'' said Stewart,
who took seven pars and a closing birdie over the final eight
holes. ``Until you stop the bleeding, anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Few among the 68 cut survivors found ways to avoid Pinehurst's
magnetic attraction to bogeys and double bogeys during the third
round, setting up a logjam on the leader board that shows Stewart
(1 under par) as the only player remaining with a sub-par total.
</P>
<P>
   By virtue of his third-round 72, a score bettered by only two
players, Stewart carved out a one-stroke lead over Phil Mickelson
(even par) and a two-stroke margin over Tim Herron (1 over) and
Tiger Woods (1 over) heading into Sunday's final round. A dozen
players remain within six strokes, including David Duval (2 over),
Steve Stricker (2 over) and PGA champ Vijay Singh (2 over).
</P>
<P>
   That sets up a world of possibilities for Sunday's conclusion.
Stewart, 42, could complete what he called some ``unfinished
business'' by winning the title a year after frittering away a
final-round lead to 1998 champ Lee Janzen. Duval and Woods, the
world's two top-ranked players, could swap positions in the
rankings, depending on Sunday's outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson, whose wife is due with the couple's first child,
could become a father and a major champion on Father's Day. Or he
could withdraw, regardless of his place on the leader board, if he
receives word that his wife has gone into labor during the round.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what hole I'm on. If the beeper goes off,
I'm out of here,'' Mickelson reiterated Saturday, after a 73 moved
him into position to play in the final group on Sunday at a major
championship for the first time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins might not need many birdies, Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I love about this tournament is that par is
rewarded, no matter how you make them,'' he said. ``If I can make
18 of them (Sunday), I'd like my chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on Saturday's scoring conditions, that would be a
high-percentage play. Among the 68 cut survivors, 19 failed to
record a third-round birdie. Included was Duval, who soared to a
75. Also shut out were past major champions Justin Leonard and
Steve Elkington.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Verplank, a Dallas native, described playing conditions as
``a perfect Open Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind was blowing hard and the pin placements were
borderline sadistic,'' said Verplank, who shot a 74. ``You knew it
was going to be incredibly hard when you got to the first tee.''
</P>
<P>
   If not for afternoon showers that caused 25 mph wind gusts to
abate for the leaders, Tom Lehman said it would have been much
worse than the 75.97 scoring average _ a half-stroke per player
higher than during the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it would have stayed bright and sunny, like it was early in
the day, you would have seen the highest scores in the history of
the U.S. Open,'' said Lehman, who shot a 73 while playing in the
second group of the day. ``That's how tough the course was.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Pinehurst layout proved forgiving enough that Stricker,
who ranks next-to-last among Open participants in driving accuracy,
managed to scramble his way to a 69. It marked the day's lone
sub-par round, an achievement that fellow competitor John Cook
called ``the round of the year on the PGA Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Stricker downplayed his achievement, which was highlighted by a
136-yard bunker blast for eagle at No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like I shot the round of the year,'' Stricker
said. ``I just feel like I gave myself another opportunity, and
that's all you can ask going into the last day.''
</P>
<P>
   That's enough for Stewart, who has a career batting average of
.500 as the third-round Open leader. He won in 1991 and finished as
the runner-up last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm playing some pretty decent golf. And, at my age,
I'm coming to the back end of my chances to win another U.S.
Open,'' Stewart said. ``I plan to use that to motivate myself. I'm
back in the final group with another chance to win. So, I want to
go out and make the best of it.'' nn

U.S. AMATEUR CHAMP EXPERIENCES ``FUNSTRATING'' DAY AT OPEN
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ Hank Kuehne, the reigning U.S. Amateur
champion from Southern Methodist University, created a new word to
describe Saturday's round of 81 that included a double bogey,
triple bogey and quadruple bogey in his first eight holes:
``Funstrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuehne, the only amateur to make the cut, said it is fun knowing
he will be the low amateur in his Open debut regardless of what he
shoots in Sunday's final round. But it is frustrating trying to
keep the ball in play on a layout that Kuehne described as ``beyond
extremely difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played in a lot of golf tournaments. And I haven't been
10 over after eight holes since I was 10 or 11 years old,'' said
Kuehne, 23, who will turn professional tomorrow. ``The incredible
thing is, I'm not even in last place.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Kuehne will not be in Sunday's first group off the tee
because Ted Tryba, winner of last week's FedEx St. Jude Classic,
soared to a third-round 82 and Bob Burns ballooned to an 84.
</P>
<P>
   Kuehne, however, reached his high number in a more dramatic
fashion. He pulled his first tee shot out of bounds at No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know there was out of bounds on this course. I
found out, though,'' Kuehne said. That set up a triple bogey, his
second consecutive seven at the par-4 hole.
</P>
<P>
   Kuehne followed with a quadruple bogey at No. 8. He pushed his
tee shot into the right woods, hit a tree, chipped to the fairway,
then flew the green with his approach. His fifth shot checked up
short of the green and Kuehne chipped on and two-putted for an
eight. On his final 10 holes, Kuehne carded a birdie, two bogeys
and seven pars.
</P>
<P>
   But the first eight holes were brutal. Even with a birdie at No.
4, Kuehne shot a 45 on the front side _ highest nine-hole score in
the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to play golf like this every day, I don't know that
I'd play,'' Kuehne said. ``It's neat that I'll be the low amateur
in the Open in my last amateur event. But it's very frustrating to
shoot 81, regardless of where you are.'' SIZING UP PINEHURST
</P>
<P>
   Freed from the Pinehurst perseverance test, where players
averaged 75.97 strokes per man in Saturday's third round, golfers
took turns offering kudos to the course for its degree of
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been asked many times, `What's the hardest golf course
you've ever played?' I now have the answer: Pinehurst No. 2,'' said
Lee Janzen, the defending Open champ, after a 76.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its sloping greens, former University of Texas golfer
Brandel Chamblee described Pinehurst as ``Augusta on steroids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was total carnage,'' said Chamblee, who shot a 74. ``But I
still enjoyed myself, because everyone was in the same boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Verplank, a Dallas native, said pin placements were
``borderline sadistic,'' especially with 25 mph wind gusts. After
the first hole, Janzen said he quit paying attention to the par
figures printed on the course scorecard.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, I played every hole as a par-5,'' Janzen said.
``That way, I knew I'd have a decent chance to make some birdies.''
STRICKER STRIKES QUICKLY
</P>
<P>
   Boosted by a 40-foot birdie putt and a bunker blast for eagle
during his first three holes, Steve Stricker turned in the only
sub-par effort (69) of the third round and climbed into contention,
at 2 over for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start like that at the Open, it leads to a good
day,'' said Stricker, who drained a 40-footer at No. 2, then holed
an 8-iron for eagle from a fairway bunker at No. 3. ``You know
you've made up some ground. But I tried to get a little too greedy
at the end. I tried to stuff in a couple of shots that I
shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Those shots resulted in bogeys at Nos. 16 and 17, leaving
Stricker three shots off the lead. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Tim Herron, on recording one of only two birdies at No. 6, a
222-yard par-3 with a well-tucked pin: ``I hit it to about three
feet and, luckily, the ball stayed. With that pin, that might have
been a skin.''
</P>
<P>
   _ No birdies were recorded at No. 12, a 447-yard par-4, during
the third round. But there were 34 scores of bogey or higher. nn

STARS IN POSITION TO EVOLVE INTO A TEAM FOR THE AGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Postcards from the ledge:
</P>
<P>
   There's a perception among some members of the national media
that because the Stars have so many older players, this team has
been assembled ``for the moment,'' as one reporter phrased it to
coach Ken Hitchcock on Saturday, and not for the future.
</P>
<P>
   That couldn't be further from the truth.
</P>
<P>
   As Hitchcock has pointed out on numerous occasions, the Stars'
core features plenty of youth, including offensive stars Mike
Modano, 29, Joe Nieuwendyk, 32, Jere Lehtinen, 25, and Jamie
Langenbrunner, 23, and defensemen Derian Hatcher, 27, Richard
Matvichuk, 26, Darryl Sydor, 27, and Sergei Zubov, 29.
</P>
<P>
   That said, there will be a changing of the guard over the next
two or three seasons as veterans such as Brian Skrudland, Craig
Ludwig and Guy Carbonneau are phased out, and the team, of
necessity, gets younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a terrific opportunity to have a smooth transition,''
Hitchcock says. ``That's why when we made our moves (at the trade
deadline), they were minor ones and not major ones, because we felt
like we were already set up with what we wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team really revolves around the Modanos, the Hatchers, the
Matvichuks and the Nieuwendyks. Our older players are basically
role players.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons why the Stars will gradually get
younger, not the least of which is financial. The payroll can't
continue to grow. Younger players are cheaper players.
</P>
<P>
   But there's also a trend in the NHL to more speed and offensive
firepower, and that means younger legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's looking for ways to get more scorers on the ice,''
Hitchcock said. ``It's easier to take a young player who knows how
to score and teach him to check, than it is to teach someone how to
score. In today's game, you just can't afford to have people on the
ice who score just four or five goals a year, even if they're great
checkers.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no reason to think that the Stars, if they're willing
again to make the physical and emotional commitment it takes, can't
be back in the Stanley Cup Finals next year. But there will be some
fine tuning and changes between now and then. ADD-A-CUP TATTOO
</P>
<P>
   Craig Ludwig's left shoulder, above the biceps, features the
Grim Reaper and his red-eyed devil dog. Clutched in the dog's
teeth: A Stanley Cup. The tattoo is a souvenir of the '86 Cup that
Ludwig helped Montreal win (along with Skrudland, Carbonneau and
Stars' GM Bob Gainey).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to add another cup to it,'' Ludwig says. ``It was
actually worse. They toned it down a lot. There were lot of things
behind it at one time. I just keep those things inside now. I don't
let 'em out.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time I got it, there wasn't a lot of thinking that went
into it. Actually I think (Dennis) Rodman was in the chair next to
me, so you know where that was coming from.'' JUST FLIRTING, OR ...
</P>
<P>
   Don't look now, but TCU and SMU both sent representatives to the
Conference USA meetings a couple of weeks ago. Why? Because both
schools would drop the Western Athletic Conference in an instant if
they thought they had a chance to switch to Conference USA.
</P>
<P>
   It's much more appealing geographically and both schools are
concerned that when the new super football conference shakes out,
they won't be included. The thinking is, they'd have a better
chance if they were aligned with Conference USA, plus it's a great
basketball conference with the likes of DePaul, Marquette,
Cincinnati, Memphis, Louisville, South Florida and UNC Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned. FRAN AT PEBBLE BEACH
</P>
<P>
   During the first week of June, Horned Frogs coach Dennis
Franchione vacationed at Pebble Beach. Here's the lowdown on his
golf game:
</P>
<P>
   First day: Spanish Bay _ He shoots a very respectable 85.
</P>
<P>
   Second day: Spyglass Hill _ A not-so-smooth-running 92 (I'd take
it).
</P>
<P>
   Third day: Pebble Beach _ Closing out with a bang, he rings up a
nifty 83.
</P>
<P>
   I propose a coach's shootout: Franchione, the Cowboys' Chan
Gailey and the Stars' Hitchcock. I'll drive the beer cart. A HUFF
AND A PUFF
</P>
<P>
   TCU punter and wide receiver Royce Huffman, drafted and signed
by the Astros, will play for their rookie team this summer and is
debating about whether to return to TCU for his senior football
season (he has used up his baseball eligibility). The Astros have
been hinting that if he does come back to the Frogs, they'd like to
see his role reduced to punting only. NICE TO SEE YOU, TOO
</P>
<P>
   Toronto manager and long-ago Ranger Jim Fregosi got into a
barroom brawl at a sports bar in south Philly last weekend and
showed up at the ballpark last Sunday with cuts around his left
eye. As the story goes, Fregosi, who once managed the Phillies, was
introduced to another man in the bar, reached out to shake hands
and got clocked.
</P>
<P>
   No official word on what the guy's beef was. Maybe he was still
upset that Fregosi had Mitch Williams in the game when Joe Carter
hit that game-winning home run for Toronto in the '93 series.
Baseball is investigating amid rumors that the attacker and a
friend who also jumped in might have had mob connections. NOT SO
PRO
</P>
<P>
   Rangers manager Johnny Oates, who prides himself on his
professionalism, lost his cool in the worst possible place last
week, blowing up at Yankee Stadium over a question being posed by
our Johnny Paul after another Rangers' loss there.
</P>
<P>
   Players easily overheard his postgame temper tantrum and weren't
impressed. ``Immature,'' is how one characterized it.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional outburst was definitely out of character for the
normally self-controlled Oates, who explained the next day that he
was reacting to the buildup of frustration at the Rangers' futility
against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he should let off steam more often. The Rangers snapped a
four-game losing streak the next night and won the final two games
there, the first time they've won consecutive games at Yankee
Stadium in six years. SLAP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   New Orlando Magic coach Doc Rivers had former Mavs coach Jim
Cleamons in for an interview last week. ... The annual Jim
Reeves/UTA Celebrity Challenge golf tournament is scheduled for
Aug. 17 at Great Southwest Golf Club. Call UTA for more info. ...
Stars linemates Joe Nieuwendyk and Jamie Langenbrunner have been
roommates since Langenbrunner was called up from the minors. ... In
Chicago, rumors abound that Michael Jordan is moving his restaurant
to more high-toned Michigan Avenue and that Sammy Sosa will be
putting ``his'' restaurant into Jordan's old building on LaSalle.

STOTTLEMYRE TO BEGIN THROWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 and TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Todd Stottlemyre's con job didn't work. The
right-hander wanted to throw for the first time on Saturday since
suffering a partial tear of his rotator cuff and labrum on May 17,
but Diamondbacks officials wouldn't allow it.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre will get his wish soon enough, however.
</P>
<P>
   He is scheduled to throw lightly off flat ground on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm stronger than I've ever been at this time of year from the
(weight) lifting,'' Stottlemyre said.
</P>
<P>
   He admits he has been and is anxious, ``but on the first day,
I'm going to take it easy. How long will I throw? How far? there is
no right answer. We'll just have to see how it feels. The good
thing is that I'm a week ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have maintained a positive outlook. I've had the arm in the
throwing motion, an easy motion, and there has been no sharp pain,
no stiffness afterward. I think that's a good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some who might say that surgery would have been the
best route. Others think that even without surgery, Stottlemyre
likely won't pitch again this season after posting a 4-1 record
with a 3.59 ERA in nine starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are a lot of skeptics who say I probably won't
pitch this season,'' Stottlemyre said. ``But I've pitched with it
before and I'm in the best shape I can be.'' &QL; 
Finley has MRI &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Steve Finley, who has been bothered of late by
tenderness and stiffness in his lower back and hip area, had a
magnetic resonance imaging test on Saturday. It revealed a slightly
bulging disc in the lower back.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known when the injury originally occurred, but Manager
Buck Showalter said it should not keep Finley from playing. He is
expected to return to the lineup today. &QL; 
Look out, Babe! &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OK, so he's not ready to be the next Babe Ruth and go from the
mound to the outfield and fame as one of baseball's great hitters
ever.
</P>
<P>
   But Randy Johnson is at least becoming respectable at the plate,
considering he entered this season with five lifetime hits and a
.091 average.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, he's the Diamondbacks fourth leading pitcher at the
plate behind Todd Stottlemyre, Armando Reynoso and Brian Anderson.
Johnson, who is today's starting pitcher against Atlanta, has a
.170 average and eight hits and two doubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything you put your name on you want to put some pride in
and do the best you can,'' Johnson said. ``Obviously, hitting is
going to help me out in the game, too, and after not doing it for
such a long time I think I'm doing pretty well. I also realize I
have to get better at it and I'm working hard on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Short stops &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Erubiel Durazo and third baseman Jarrod Patterson
have been promoted from the Double-A El Paso affiliate to Triple-A
Tucson. Both were among the Texas League leaders in batting
average.

   In honor of Father's Day, the Diamondbacks will have their
annual family baseball game before today's game. &QL;

DREAM MATCHUP: JOHNSON VS. GLAVINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - As matchups go, they don't get any better than the one
fans will see at Bank One Ballpark today: The Diamondbacks Randy
Johnson vs. Atlanta's Tom Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Glavine is off to a struggling start, backing up last
season's Cy Young winning 20-6 season with a 4-7 record and a 4.78
earned run average to date.
</P>
<P>
   But you're still talking about two Cy Young winners and two of
the most dominant lefthanders the game has seen in this decade.
Glavine served notice in his last start at Houston, giving up five
hits and striking out eight in an eight-inning winning effort, that
the slow start has aberration written all over it.
</P>
<P>
   Both Glavine and Johnson, who has won a club record five
consecutive starts and is 9-2 while leading the National League in
strikeouts (151), realize what they will be up against.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always going to be focused on the game no matter who's
pitching for them,'' Johnson said. ``But when I'm going up against
a pitcher of that caliber I know there is a super good liklihood of
him pitching a good game against our team, than there would be
against a younger or inexperienced person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to get the nine guys out that I'm facing and that's the
way I approach it. There's really nothing I can do against who I'm
facing. I just have to bear down myself. You can pitch against a
kid who gets called up from Class AA who nobody knows and he can
pitch a shutout against you just as easily as Tom Glavine can, so
you just have to bear down and pitch your own game.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, the only active NL pitcher with four 20-win seasons
under his belt, admits that squaring off against Johnson means a
bit more. Especially considering Johnson came away with an 8-3 win
in Atlanta in their only meeting this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You anticipate the match up a little bit more than you
probably do in a normal start,'' said Glavine, who owns a 3-1
liftime record against the Diamondbacks. ``You're always pumped to
go out and pitch because we only do it every four or five days. But
when you're facing another pitcher who is one of the elite pitchers
in the game, it definitely brings a different feel to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You anticipate going out there that your team isn't going to
get a lot of opportunities to score runs, so you better do the same
thing to their team because you want to give your guys a chance to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   That, Glavine said, can be a double-edged sword, because a
pitcher easily could find himself trying to be too fine in such a
scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``You definitely have to fight that tendency,'' Glavine said.
``The No. 1 thing you have to keep in mind is I'm not going out
there facing Randy, or Randy facing me. That's only going to happen
three times a game maybe. You're going out there to get their guys
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tendency is to try to be a little bit better or sharper.
Most times you'll go out and think if I hold them to three runs or
less, I have a pretty good chance to win the game. Against a guy
like Randy you lower that to two runs or less. You still can go out
there and bear down without hurting yourself by trying to be too
fine and trying to do too much.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' Greg Colbrunn has had the opportunity to play
behind both Johnson and Glavine during his career, claims the
matchup is a fan's delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last six, seven years they've been the most
dominating lefthanders in baseball,'' he said. ``Their pitching
styles are a big contrast, Randy being a power pitcher and Tom more
of a finesse guy.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a bottom line playing behind each of them, Colbrunn
said.

CHO SHOWS THE WAY FOR RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-RANGERS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ On a couple of occasions during Saturday's 7-4 victory
over the Texas Rangers, the Red Sox' starting pitcher could have
hit the Jin Ho Cho Trail.
</P>
<P>
   A three-run homer by third baseman Todd Zeile in the second
inning and a two-on, one-out jam in the fifth were moments for
pause, but Cho, dedicating his first major league victory to his
late father, helped stop Boston's two-game skid by pitching six
tough innings before Pudge Rodriguez's solo homer in the seventh
ended his day.
</P>
<P>
   Cho's effort with help from the bullpen, including two scoreless
innings by new closer Tim Wakefield (save No. 4) enabled the Sox to
eek out a much-needed win and keep them 1 1/2 games behind the
Yankees in the American League East.
</P>
<P>
   The win also featured a 15-hit Red Sox attack led by Nomar
Garciaparra's 3-for-4, two-RBI day. Garciaparra and first baseman
Mike Stanley padded the lead with seventh-inning solo homers.
</P>
<P>
   Cho, 7-1 with a 3.41 ERA at Pawtucket prior to his June 14
call-up, had pitched well but did not figure in the decision in his
first start against Minnesota Tuesday, going six innings and
allowing six hits, two earned runs, and no walks with three
strikeouts in a 4-3 Red Sox win.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts Saturday had Cho's fastball topping off at 92 miles per
hour, though Cho didn't think he spotted it well early in the game.
He also had good movement with his slider and changeup and scouts
were impressed with his poise and the way he rebounded from
adversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy and excited,'' said Cho. ``I wished my father (who
died last year at age 63) could have seen this. I wanted to show
him my first major league win.''
</P>
<P>
   He said on the eve of Father's Day that he had kept a promise to
his father to make it to the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Cho is one of the Band-Aids being used by the Red Sox while
starters Bret Saberhagen and Juan Pena recover from injuries. The
win continued to illustrate the job done by Red Sox call-ups, who
are now a combined 13-0 (Brian Rose 4-0, Pena 2-0, John Wasdin 6-0,
and Cho 1-0).
</P>
<P>
   Cho credited being familiar with his teammates as the key reason
he's been successful this time around after going 0-3 with an 8.20
ERA in four starts with Boston last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I didn't understand things, but this year I'm able
to communicate with players and I'm able to fix the problem,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cho retired the first four batters before singles by Lee Stevens
and Rodriguez set the stage for Zeile's first-pitch homer, a
403-foot shot over the screen in left. But instead of the
23-year-old Korean righthander losing his poise, he set down the
next nine batters until Luis Alicea's fifth-inning single was
followed by a walk to No. 9 hitter Jon Shave. Again, instead of
buckling, Cho got Rusty Greer and Roberto Kelly on fly balls to
right.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the first four batters in the Rangers' order went 0 for
13 against Cho.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like he's much more comfortable out there,'' said
Garciaparra, who extended his hitting streak to seven games, during
which he's hitting .423 with five doubles and two home runs. ``It
seems that he's been through situations now that he's worked on in
the minors and knows how to get through them better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox looked at 31 pitches before scoring their first run
in a first inning when seven batters came to the plate. A Brian
Daubach double advanced Jose Offerman (3 for 5) to third, and after
starter Mark Clark, who lasted just 1 1/3 innings and was placed on
the 15-day disabled list after the game with soreness in his
pitching elbow, pitched around Garciaparra to load the bases,
Stanley's hard-hit grounder to Zeile at third handcuffed him,
allowing Offerman to score.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile more than made up for his error, giving the Rangers a 3-1
lead with his blast, but the Sox responded immediately with RBI
hits from Offerman, Daubach, and Garciaparra in the bottom half of
the second for a 4-3 Boston lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lead Cho cherished and held until the sixth, when it
expanded by one as Trot Nixon doubled in Damon Buford. It was
Nixon's second RBI and extra-base hit in his last 36 at-bats since
a June 1 seventh-inning homer.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was the first batter of the seventh and he scorched
the 0-1 offering, Cho's 91st pitch.
</P>
<P>
   After Kirk Bullinger and Mark Guthrie got the Red Sox through
the seventh, Wakefield and his personal catcher, Jason Varitek,
entered the game and shut down the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked I got to come in in the eighth,'' said
Wakefield, who hadn't pitched in four days. ``It's great they feel
I can do that and I'm grateful for the opportunity. I don't want
this to be my permanent job because I want Tom Gordon back, but I'm
just glad to be able to contribute to the team.''

US LOOKS DREAMY IN CUP OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It was everything they'd fantasized
about when they were playing youth matches on lumpy soccer fields
in front of moms, dads, and bored kid brothers. The opening match
of the Women's World Cup in their home country. The largest crowd
ever to watch a women's sporting event anywhere in the world. And a
sound and satisfying triumph over Denmark that got the Americans
off and winging in their quest to reclaim the trophy they lost four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unbelievable,'' declared Mia Hamm after she scored the
first goal and set up the second in a 3-0 victory Saturday
afternoon before 78,972 star-spangled spectators inside Giants
Stadium. ``This is what we always dreamed the World Cup would be.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe a little more. After months of ``Watch Me Play''
promos and an ocean of printer's ink, this was the Americans'
moment to take the stage in full stride. But until Hamm put them on
the board with a spectacular leftfooted roof shot in the 17th
minute, the Americans were wooden from stage fright.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the 1996 Olympic final against China had they played
for so much in front of so many. ``They were a little nervous,
which is understandable,'' said US coach Tony DiCicco. ``I just
wanted us to settle down and knock the ball around and make the
Danes chase it. I figured eventually one of our personality players
would step up.''
</P>
<P>
   Who else but Hamm, the world's best player? At Olympus, she set
up both gold-medal goals on a bum ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, with the Danes pressing her teammates in their own end
and knocking the wind out of keeper Briana Scurry, Hamm took a long
service from Brandi Chastain, deked defender Katrine Pedersen, and
stuck the ball in the back of the net for her 110th career goal,
afterward sprinting all the way to midfield in celebration.
``Awesome,'' DiCicco said. ``Mia was awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, who are now 7-3-1 against the Danes lifetime and
have outscored them 11-0 in their last three meetings, wanted to
deliver the knockout early. But it wasn't until the 73d minute,
when Hamm set up Julie Foudy with a lovely soaring cross, that the
US could let out a great sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   It could easily have been 6-0 by then, but the Yanks (who
outshot Denmark, 24-9) kept misfiring wide, clanging balls off
woodwork, or putting them over the bar. Kristine Lilly missed three
gorgeous chances. She couldn't handle Hamm's deft cross in the 20th
minute, put a shot off the crossbar in the 56th, and missed a
breakaway with keeper Dorthe Larsen out and down in the 69th. And
Cindy Parlow put a feed from Hamm off the post in the 24th and
watched Larsen tip her shot over the bar in the 60th.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. The Americans didn't need another goal and history
told them if they kept running and passing and shooting, they'd get
at least another one. ``We were throwing everything but the kitchen
sink at them,'' said Scurry. ``You just knew it was going to come
crashing down.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no reason to press or panic, DiCicco insisted. No
reason to have people caught upfield and allow the Danes to counter
and salvage a draw. ``The key thing is, we're up 1-0,'' he said.
``We don't need to score another goal. Let's be smart. I was happy
when it was 3-0, but if it was 1-0 I'd be just as happy.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the Americans wanted to make a statement while holding
the stage. When they won the inaugural Cup in China in 1991, nobody
but their relatives and the US Customs people knew they'd been
abroad. Three years ago, NBC didn't show their gold-medal match.
They were more than one goal better than the Danes and they wanted
to prove it. ``We know that we're one of the favorites,'' said Joy
Fawcett, ``and we have to play to our ability.''
</P>
<P>
   The hosts not only want to win the Cup, they want to win it with
style. Foudy's goal, a leftfooter with a Hollywood pose afterward,
was highlight-reel material. And Lilly's blast from the top of the
area in the 89th minute was a tasty bit of frosting. ``They played
well,'' conceded Denmark's Mikka Hansen. ``They played with a lot
of confidence. They had a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm and Foudy and Lilly and the rest of them had waited years
to show their country and the world how they'd been playing even
when only a few hundred were watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen the other side and we know how far this team has
brought the game,'' DiCicco said after his squad ran an exuberant
victory lap around the field. ``Just a decade ago, this game would
have been played in some local high school stadium. I don't have
words for this.''

ARIZONA HOUSE SPEAKER'S ETHICS AGAIN QUESTIONED  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE MCCLOY  
 and CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The most powerful man in Arizona's House of
Representatives is at it again, his critics complain, stretching
ethical standards as if they were rubber bands. And this time, even
some members of his own party say Jeff Groscost has gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   They say Groscost, a Valley jeweler with a history of financial
troubles, has made money as a consultant for groups that stand to
benefit from his power as speaker of the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer and fall of 1998, Groscost was paid at least
$10,000 by a plumbing trade association to do what he calls
``membership development and relations,'' mainly involving the
recruitment of new members. During the closing hours of the 1999
legislative session, he made a procedural ruling that helped a bill
that would have benefited the trade group.
</P>
<P>
   The bill remained alive in the House, but died in the Senate a
few hours later.
</P>
<P>
   A financial-disclosure statement also shows Groscost was paid
more than $10,000 by Southwest Gas subsidiary LNG Energy Inc. to
lobby for liquefied natural gas franchises in Utah, New Mexico and
Wyoming in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Although Groscost has been a champion of bills supporting the
natural gas industry in Arizona, he said the work was outside the
state, so there was no conflict with his legislative role. But he
was introduced at a Utah legislative committee meeting as ``chair
of the Ways and Means Committee, Arizona Legislature'' when he made
a pitch for a subsidy to provide natural gas service to the town of
Panguitch on July 16, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Groscost, R-Mesa, says the consulting jobs were legitimate. He
denies pulling any legislative tricks, or taking any improper
benefits. He boasts that he knows the legislative process better
than anyone, a point that just about any legislator readily
concedes. If he wanted to manipulate the process, he probably could
have done it without anyone realizing what was going on, he says.
</P>
<P>
   But to Dennis Burke, executive director of the government
watchdog group Arizona Common Cause, Groscost's actions involving
the plumbing contract were ``wildly inappropriate'' and deserving
of an ethics inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to be offering a precedent where special-interest
groups can hire legislative leaders during the summer and fall for
large sums of money and then do their bidding during the
legislative session. It's disheartening to see that precedent being
set by the speaker of the House,'' Burke says.
</P>
<P>
   Groscost says he's scrutinized his business dealings to avoid
even the appearance of a conflict of interest, consulting with
House attorneys and filing a letter listing bills he couldn't vote
on. If other House members have a problem with his actions,
Groscost says, then let them file an ethics complaint. But no one
has.
</P>
<P>
   Groscost argues that his outside work is no different from jobs
other lawmakers hold. He says virtually all lawmakers vote on bills
that affect their employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had anyone come tell me that to my face . . . I've
never had a member raise that issue,'' he says. ``I don't see any
more of a problem with that than the fact that we let teachers hold
a teaching job and still work here. . . . If it's a legal job, then
it is legal for the person to hold it and serve down here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Burke isn't the only one who disagrees with Groscost.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mike Gardner, R-Tempe, who would like to become speaker
when Groscost's term expires in 2001, says it's absolutely
inappropriate for any lawmaker to seek consulting contracts with
groups that lobby the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is what's legal and what's appropriate. I don't
think it is. Other people think it's fine,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many legislators may be skirting the intent of the
state's conflict-of-interest law.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner's wife, Patricia, for example, works for lobbyist Stan
Barnes. Yet Gardner declared no conflicts on any of the bills
Barnes was pushing. Last year, he offered floor amendments on an
insurance bill supported by Barnes. Gardner said he opposes most of
the bills Barnes lobbies.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Senate President Brenda Burns, R-Glendale, has
repeatedly backed legislation that passed this year to expand the
scope of practice for optometrists. Her husband, Bruce, is an
optometrist.
</P>
<P>
   And state Sen. John Huppenthal, R-Chandler, who works for Salt
River Project, voted on a deregulation bill last year that was
sought by SRP. Then-House Minority Leader Art Hamilton, an SRP
employee, and Sen. Chris Cummiskey, whose wife works for SRP, both
recused themselves from voting on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   All said they did nothing wrong _ that their actions remained
safely within Arizona's ethical guidelines. According to state law,
lawmakers have a conflict of interest when they support legislation
that benefits them financially. However, they are permitted to vote
on a bill that affects their professions or businesses, as long as
it equally benefits at least 10 other members of the same
profession or interest.
</P>
<P>
   The ethical cloud continues to hover over Groscost, partly
because of his blotchy background in business and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Former Attorney General Grant Woods reprimanded Groscost in 1992
and 1994 for failing to meet filing deadlines for campaign reports.
But Woods said in an interview last week that he had no problems
with Groscost after the rebuke.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's learned. He was hurting his credibility by attracting
attention to things that ultimately got in the way,'' Woods said.
``I believe he has matured. He's shown he's probably intellectually
superior to many of the other people down there. He enjoys the
process and he's learned it well. That gives him a leg up.''
</P>
<P>
   But fellow House Republicans remain critical.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve May, R-east Phoenix, says Groscost's actions in
accepting the consulting contracts were inappropriate even if they
were not illegal.
</P>
<P>
   May argues conflict-of-interest laws should be tightened so that
the threshold would be much lower. For instance, he says, it should
be illegal for lawmakers to declare a conflict and abstain from
voting, but still lobby for a bill.
</P>
<P>
   He believes lawmakers should be very careful about accepting
work from groups with business at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is their connection to these pieces of legislation
is through the people who gave them jobs,'' May says. ``When a
lobbyist or interest group gives you a job, you do feel an
obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   Groscost would not say how much he was paid by LNG Energy Inc.,
to lobby for the liquefied natural gas franchises. His financial
disclosure statement in the Secretary of State's Office lists the
compensation as more than $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Because Groscost has been a supporter of alternative fuels from
his first day in the Legislature, he disavows any conflict in
working for LNG. Dick Foreman, lobbyist for LNG's parent Southwest
Gas, offered him the job, Groscost says.
</P>
<P>
   Groscost adds that he checked with attorneys at the Arizona
House before accepting the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman says LNG's contracts with Groscost were between
legislative sessions, so Groscost was not being paid while bills
affecting Southwest Gas were considered. Foreman says he did not
recall whether Groscost asked for the job, or LNG offered it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure he has approached people saying, `If you know of any
options, I'm trying to make a living,' '' Foreman says. ``I made
introductions for Jeff.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if there was even the inkling of a quid pro quo, that is
just not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The allegation that Groscost helped out the plumbers' trade
association surfaced in May when lawmakers were considering a bill
to speed up payments to plumbers and dozens of other construction
subcontracting groups.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was strongly supported by the Arizona
Subcontractors Coalition, a group of about 400 individual members
and more than a dozen trade associations. One of those groups is
the Piping Industry Progress and Education Trust Fund, a
Tempe-based lobbying and education group for plumbers. PIPE
officials said the bill was not part of their legislative agenda.
But they supported it through the Subcontractors Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Groscost had a consulting contract with PIPE during the summer
and fall of 1998. He says he got the job after meeting PIPE
executive director Carl Triphahn either at the Capitol or through
activities with the Boy Scouts. Triphahn did not return calls
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to his 1999 financial-disclosure form, Groscost was
paid at least $10,000 for the work, which was at least 25 percent
of his income in 1998. Groscost declines to specify how much PIPE
paid him.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before the Legislature adjourned, the subcontractors'
prompt-pay bill appeared to be headed for defeat, falling one vote
short of the 31 required for final passage in the House.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly after the vote, the proposal became snared in
parliamentary warfare. Rep. Mike Gleason, R-Sun City West, made a
motion to reconsider the bill the following week, long after
adjournment, a routine maneuver that kills legislation. Another
motion was made to table the bill instead, and a third motion was
made to adjourn to a House caucus.
</P>
<P>
   A 45-minute delay ensued while Speaker Pro-Tem Joe Hart,
R-Kingman, conferred with House clerks. Groscost remained in his
office, working on other matters, he says, until he emerged to
invoke an obscure procedural rule to wipe out the three motions.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a move to table the issue was adopted. Hours later, the
bill was voted out of the House only to die in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Several House Republicans were outraged. House Majority Leader
Lori Daniels, R-Chandler, and Gardner made repeated trips to the
dais to argue Groscost had kept the bill alive improperly.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner assumed Groscost had declared a conflict on the bill
because he had not voted on the measure previously and he was not
on the floor when it was considered. Groscost never declared a
conflict. But he kept the bill alive and voted to move it on to the
Senate while lobbying fellow House members for support, Daniels
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's any connection between the people that are pushing
the bill and the person implementing the rule to keep it alive,
that is a problem,'' Gardner says.
</P>
<P>
   Others think Groscost acted properly.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Marilyn Jarrett, R-Mesa, a close Groscost ally, points out
that Daniels' husband is a subcontractor, and thus she should have
recused herself from the vote. Daniels scoffs, noting she opposed
the bill, while most subcontractors supported it.
</P>
<P>
   A leading House Democrat, Rep. Ken Cheuvront, also says Groscost
did nothing wrong. ``I don't know why he would have had to recuse
himself,'' says Cheuvront, who is a construction contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Groscost says some members are angry simply because he beat them
at their own procedural game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point was we had done exactly what they had tried to do,
and we had done it about as tightly within the confines of the
rules so there couldn't be any question,'' he says. And Groscost
says he made sure he had no conflict of interest on the bill,
pointing to a ruling from House attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the session, he filed a conflict-of-interest letter
with the House clerk's office declaring he would not vote on any of
four bills on PIPE's agenda. Groscost was the only House member to
file such a letter during the session. ``I was the only one who
complied with the law,'' he says, contending that others surely had
conflicts of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Groscost explains that technically, he didn't have a conflict
even on the four PIPE bills because his contract with the group had
expired, and so he had no financial interest in the bills.
</P>
<P>
   According to a ruling by House attorneys, the prompt-pay bill
posed no conflict for Groscost because plumbers were only one of
dozens of groups that could have been affected.
</P>
<P>
   Groscost also denies any conflict in working for LNG Inc. But he
acknowledges his job as a lawmaker helped get him the contract,
which he received before he was elected speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (LNG) would have had a clue who I was if I
wasn't a lawmaker. However, I'll point out there are 89 other
lawmakers who didn't get that opportunity . . .'' Groscost says.
``I don't think there's any question that I've got fairly good
political skills and that I'm a halfway decent salesman, and that's
what they needed. . . . Every now and then, the stars come into
alignment for a good reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Groscost, who is married and has four children, notes most
lawmakers cannot live on their legislative salaries alone.
</P>
<P>
   He sold a restaurant before he took office because he didn't
have the time to run it. His gem business suffers, he says, because
he misses many of the most lucrative holidays like Valentine's Day
and Mother's Day because of the legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   And Groscost puts in as many hours as anyone at the Capitol,
routinely staying well into the night during the session.
</P>
<P>
   He points to the fact that the so-called ``citizens''
Legislature isn't a very diverse body: It includes many members who
are supported by spouses who work, or are retirees or the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have one complaint, it's that we don't have enough
citizens down here, people who have tried to meet a payroll or put
themselves at risk financially,'' Groscost says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a legislator shouldn't mean you sacrifice your kids'
ability to go to college. . . . The first few years I was down here
we went through the savings accounts, the CDs, and the IRAs. I
don't think anybody has ever said that somebody who works here
should not be able to have any other job. Certainly . . . $24,000
is not sufficient. This is supposed to be public service, not an
unmanageable sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   Groscost says at least two of his future clients will have no
business pending at the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, it was announced one of those clients is Sen. John
McCain, who hired Groscost to help run his Arizona presidential
primary campaign. The announcement follows Groscost's unsuccessful
efforts in the closing days of the legislative session to delay the
primary balloting in Arizona by a month.
</P>
<P>
   McCain supporters backed the date change to avoid the
possibility of losing Arizona before competing in states like
California.
</P>
<P>
   Groscost's contract with the campaign runs through Dec. 31,
about two weeks before the next session begins. He declines to say
how much will be paid. &QL;

STEWART IN DRIVER'S SEAT AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ Not that the 68 golfers remaining in the hunt
for the 99th United States Open championship can say they haven't
been warned. The large sign is stuck into the grass directly across
from the practice putting green on Pinehurst No. 2, for all eyes to
see.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obviously the function of the championship course to
present competitors with a variety of problems that will test
competitors with a variety of problems that will test every type of
shot which a golfer of championship ability should be qualified to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   The sign is signed by Donald Ross. It is the credo of Pinehurst
No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Which, for the third day, whittled and whittled and whittled
down the Open field more and more, Saturday's shavings leaving only
one golfer able to better par for three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   That golfer is Payne Stewart, whose birdie on the 18th hole left
him with a 2-over par 72 for the day, but with a three-round score
of 209, 1 under par, and a shot better than a struggling Phil
Mickelson (73), and two shots ahead of Tiger Woods (72) and Tim
Herron, winner of the 1996 Honda Classic, the 1997 LaCantera Texas
Open, and the 1999 Bay Hill Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's deja vu is all too real, and a bit too painful. Last
year at Olympic Club in San Francisco, Stewart also was the only
golfer entering the final round with an under-par score. Indeed,
his four-stroke lead entering Sunday play was the second-largest
lead by an Open non-winner, second only to the five-shot lead Mike
Brady had at Brae Burn in 1919 before he lost in a playoff to
Walter Hagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've wanted another serious opportunity to win the Open,''
said Stewart after Saturday's round, ``and now that I have it, I've
got to make the most of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart became stymied at the 12th hole last year when his tee
shot landed in a divot and he delayed while seeking a ruling on
whether he was entitled to relief. Instead of relief, he was given
extra pressure as United States Golf Association rules guru Tom
Meeks placed Stewart ``on the clock'' for slow play.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart bogeyed two of the next four holes and ended up losing
the Open to Lee Janzen by a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do like the way I played,'' Stewart said of Saturday's
round, despite his touring Pinehurst 2 over par. ``To me, a 72 was
a par round. You knew very few birdies were going to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson kept the media waiting for two hours after his round
for more pressing matters _ work on his swing at the practice
range. ``I hit the ball awfully sloppy,'' said the southpaw. At the
start of his round, he was nervous ``and I felt I was steering the
ball a lot. The swing was getting a little longer and sloppier.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he was one of many who struggled Saturday, though,
Mickelson would not take a shot at the course. ``It's a testament
to how great this golf course is that only one player is under
par,'' said Mickelson. What is so demanding about Pinehurst, he
went on, ``is that even on a very good ball-striking day, the best
golfers are still going to miss five or six greens.'' Thus, the
secret is get up and down as quickly and as well as possible, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. In an amazing display of the effect of Ross's Pinehurst
No. 2 and the refining of the course by the USGA, an amazing 20 of
the 68 golfers played 18 holes without notching even one birdie.
Even more, a miniscule number of 80 birdies were made by the 68
golfers, compared to 406 bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the snide comments by some golfers were these of
Australia's Chris Perry, who shot a 79 Saturday: ``Boys, they say
an object of this game is to land the ball on the green,'' said the
Aussie. ``You hit the ball on the green and the ball will stay on
it. But not here. Here is the only place in the world where you hit
a 7-iron into the green and it rolls another 25 yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Rees Jones, the ``course doctor'' for the Open and the USGA,
merely smiled when he was told of the comments of Perry and others
that Pinehurst was unfair by saying, ``That's the rub of the
green.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite scoring over par, Stewart was not alone among those
golfers who felt pleased leaving the 18th green despite scores that
groaned. Along with Stewart, Mickelson was able to birdie the 18th
(``I was able to hit my only cut shot of the day there''), while
Woods was superbly pleased with his recovery from a disastrous
first two holes, on which he frittered away three strokes to par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that players, especially those near the lead, were
going to make some bogeys out there,'' said Woods, who was 1 under
for his 16 final holes. ``I knew I just had to make some birdies,
but I also knew I couldn't get aggressive on this golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   There are eight golfers within five strokes of Stewart and
Sunday's final round should be a pulse-quickening show for many,
many reasons. Mickelson, of course, is trying to win his first
major; Stewart wants redemption from last year; Woods needs to show
he can be a major competitor in the majors; and Vijay Singh, three
shots behind at 2 over and whose golf has been superb, can make a
breakthrough move with a victory. Then, of course there also is the
world's top-ranked player, David Duval, who has yet to win a major.
Starting the day tied for the lead, he struggled to a 5-over 40 on
the front nine before regrouping for nine straight pars for a 75.
He is also just three behind Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, though, it will be fascinating to see how pressure
of winning the Open dovetails with the incredibly fine standard of
golf needed to conquer this Ross masterpeice.

CUBS EATING CROW  
 NOMO, NOW A BREWER, TURNS HEADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whenever the subject of  &UR; Hideo Nomo comes up on Chicago's north
side, the local baseball officials become slightly touchy and
combative. After all, the Cubs had Nomo in their grasp but refused
to take the final step of calling him up to the majors back in
April.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo walked away from the Cubs and the possibility to be paid
$2.8 million, which was his right under the terms of his contract,
and instead accepted a $200,000 deal to pitch for the Milwaukee
Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   Most embarrassing for the Cubs was losing to Nomo on Tuesday
night in Milwaukee. Cubs Manager  &UR; Jim Riggleman was asked by a
Japanese reporter if the Cubs would like to have Nomo back now.
</P>
<P>
   ``How would you like to eat that microphone?'' he said with a
strained laugh. ``How can I answer that? He pitches for them now.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to this weekend, and Nomo is 4-1 (which should be
at least 6-1) with a 4.01 ERA. He has 46 strikeouts in 51 innings
and took no time in establishing himself as the Brewers' best
starter. In eight starts, Nomo has given up more than two runs just
twice.
</P>
<P>
   All of this leads to Nomo's future. Since being released by the
Mets during spring training and the Cubs in early April, the 1995
NL Rookie of the Year who took the country by storm that summer has
found his niche in the small-market haven of Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Brewers seemingly having no shot at competing for
the National League West title and their ability to keep Nomo next
year very much in doubt, talk has begun circulating about how much
longer Milwaukee will hang onto Nomo, who pitches in front of
several scouts whenever he starts. An attractive deal from a
contender for Nomo's services is a scenario that very well could
develop soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very needed here, and I really appreciate that
feeling,'' Nomo said. ``The surroundings are very good for me. I am
very happy to be here, and I hope to come back. But management has
to consider different things, so I can't be sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee Manager  &UR; Phil Garner, who has little to work with when
it comes to a rotation, is aware of the possibilities. He remains
focused, however, on trying to right the Brewers' ship and keep his
own job.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be true at some point, but now now,'' Garner said of
the speculation surrounding Nomo. ``I don't think we need to be
throwing in the towel.'' &QL; 
Trivial question &QL; 
The recent interleague games saw Cleveland's  &UR; Dwight Gooden hit the
eighth home run of his career, the highest total among active
pitchers. Who holds the records for home runs by a pitcher in each
league? &QL; 
Hey Abbott! &QL; 
Milwaukee pitcher  &UR; Jim Abbott reached a significant milestone last
week, one that should have caught the attention of baseball and
life fans everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott collected his first major league hit last Tuesday. So
what, you may ask? Well, let's remember Abbott was born without a
right hand. The mere fact that he made it all the way to the major
leagues is worthy of praise alone.
</P>
<P>
   But to finally get a hit, while basically holding the bat with
one hand, deserves high praise, indeed. Since he played his entire
career in the American League before this year, Abbott never had an
official at-bat in a game before April.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday night, in his 14th at-bat and 17th plate appearance
(he also has three sacrifice bunts), Abbott drove a single over the
head of Cubs shortstop  &UR; Jose Hernandez. On top of everything, it
was an RBI single. The Brewers managed to lose the game, which took
away any luster Abbott could feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what you play the game for _ moments like that . . .''
said Abbott, who is 1-5 with a 6.87 ERA this season. ``I was
wondering if I ever was going to get a hit. I just want to hold my
own up there and not be a complete liability.'' &QL; 
Voodoo in Queens &QL; 
The National League office may have a scandal on its hands if it
deems New York Mets catcher  &UR; Mike Piazza is using an illegal
substance on his bats.
</P>
<P>
   It seems reliever  &UR; Turk Wendell performs a mystical ceremony on
Piazza's bat from time to time. After putting his magic spell on it
Tuesday night in Cincinnati, Piazza belted a monster 443-foot home
run.
</P>
<P>
   The next night in St. Louis, Piazza delivered a pair of doubles
to extend his hitting streak to 19 games. He raised it to 22 in
Saturday's game at St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza knows to use the power sparingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go to the well too often,'' said Piazza, who is
batting .325. ``You don't want to dilute the mystical powers.'' &QL; 
Tampa Bay Buccaneers? &QL; 
These days, little appears to be standing in the way of the Tampa
Bay Devil Rays' out-of-control spiral toward the worst record in
the majors.
</P>
<P>
   But if their farm system is any indication of what's on the
horizon, then it appears a football mentality will be setting in
with this ballclub in the coming years. The Devil Rays sport five
players, all quarterbacks, who were either headed to major college
football programs or currently there.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cal Crawford, slotted to become Nebraska's next great option
quarterback, instead accepted a $1.55 million signing bonus last
week to give up football for baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Already in Tampa Bay's system are  &UR; Doug Johnson, the starting
quarterback at Florida who spends his summers hitting baseballs;
 &UR; Kenny
 &UR; Kelly, listed at the top of the University of Miami's depth chart
at quarterback, who is batting .392 at Class A St. Petersburg;
 &UR; Jason
 &UR; Standridge, a right-hander, who turned down a scholarship at
Auburn; and  &UR; Marquis Roberts, another pitcher, who had a full ride
at Fresno State before taking the Devil Rays' baseball offer. &QL; 
I left my heart . . . &QL; 
 &UR; Chris Speier, the Diamondbacks Triple A manager at Tucson,
indicated recently how much of a pull he still feels for the San
Francisco Giants' organization, where he broke in as a solid rookie
in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy where I am, but I'd love that opportunity to be back
at the big-league level with the Giants,'' Speier said before
ceremonies to honor the all-1970s Giants team. ``There's a special
place in your heart for your first organization.'' &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL; 
 &UR; Wes Ferrell, who bounced from Cleveland to Boston to Washington and
the Yankees during a 13-year run in the American League from 1927
to '39, hit a major league-record 36 home runs as a pitcher. Hall
of Famer  &UR; Warren Spahn holds the National League record with 35.
Ferrell also holds the single-season record with nine, hit as a
member of the 1931 Indians. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE HIT LIST &QL; 
 &UR; Forget the guy who popped him, we want to meet his wife: Toronto
Manager  &UR; Jim Fregosi was involved in a bar brawl last week when the
Blue Jays visited Philadelphia, a club he managed for years. ``I'm
very fortunate that when I came home with this black eye, my wife
didn't blacken the other one,'' Fregosi said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Eerie, very eerie: Houston Manager  &UR; Larry Dierker's seizure
last weekend occurred just hours after former Astros All-Star
pitcher  &UR; J.R. Richard, who suffered a career-ending stroke before a
game in 1980, tossed out the ceremonial first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Tito Fuentes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Maybe a dismissive
 &UR; wave of the hand was all he needed: Since Baltimore Manager  &UR; Ray
Miller cast aside his right fielder in the dugout more than a week
ago,
 &UR; Albert Belle has been on a tear, going 13 for 29 (.448) since then
entering the weekend series.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; And they wonder why fans think they're out of touch
 &UR; with reality: The Chicago White Sox decided to give their players a
half-share of road meal money for games played across town at
Wrigley Field last weekend, amounting to $103.50 for each player.
One reason? ``We just felt that it shouldn't be out of the players'
pockets to go over and pay the clubhouse man for his services,''
Sox General Manager
 &UR; Ron Schueler said. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL; 
With the addition of second baseman  &UR; Craig Counsell, Los Angeles
has the same number of 1997 World Champions on its roster as the
Florida Marlins, who won that series. The Dodgers have  &UR; Kevin
Brown, &UR; Gary Sheffield,  &UR; Devon White and Counsell. The Marlins have
 &UR; Antonio
 &UR; Alfonseca,  &UR; Alex Fernandez,  &UR; Cliff Floyd and  &UR; Livan Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Since Mets GM  &UR; Steve Phillips fired pitching coach
 &UR; Bob Apodaca, New York starters were 7-0 with a 3.20 ERA entering
the club's weekend series against St. Louis.  &UR; Al Leiter, who was
2-5, is 3-0 with a 1.71 ERA since  &UR; Dave Wallace took over as
pitching coach.
</P>
<P>
   Inconsistent in his 15 starts, Seattle Manager  &UR; Lou
 &UR; Piniella has decided to move  &UR; Jeff Fassero, the Mariners' opening
day starter, to the bullpen. Fassero is 3-7 with a 7.23 ERA and has
given up a major league-high 25 home runs.  &UR; Melvin Bunch will
replace him.
</P>
<P>
   Since Belle's consecutive games streak stopped at 392 after a
benching last week and Colorado's  &UR; Vinny Castilla saw his streak
stopped at 307 because of a prolonged slump, the new active leader
for games played is Orioles outfielder  &UR; B.J. Surhoff, who had
appeared in 226 straight games entering Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City relievers had saved nine games entering the weekend
series at Toronto and blown 15. No club has ever blown more games
than saved in a full season. The 1994 Dodgers blew 21 and saved 20,
but that was a strike-shortened season.
</P>
<P>
   Since CF  &UR; Lance Johnson landed on the disabled list because of
injuries, Cubs leadoff hitters have not fared well. Entering the
weekend, Cubs leadoff hitters are batting a combined .105 (4 for
38). &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL; 
In what would amount to a blockbuster deal, Detroit is mulling over
the possibility of making an offer to Toronto for first
baseman &UR; Carlos Delgado, one of the premier power hitters in the
game who may be falling out of favor in Toronto. One trade
possibility would be Tigers first baseman  &UR; Tony Clark.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis is showing a strong interest in acquiring Chicago
White Sox starter  &UR; Jaime Navarro, who is finally starting to pitch
well. One obstacle is Navarro's guaranteed $5 million salary in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Former Cy Young Award winner  &UR; Jack McDowell, who has undergone
several surgeries on his arm, threw 46 pitches in a simulated game
last week. McDowell is scheduled to start an exhibition game for
the Angels on Monday against their Class A affiliate in Erie (Pa.)
and, if all goes well, could return to action for Anaheim within a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati and Toronto, which continue to fall out of
contention, are talking about a deal that would send  &UR; David Wells
back to the Reds (he was there for half a season). If a deal for
Wells cannot be worked out, look for the Reds to still make a trade
for a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City, which is in the market for a first baseman, is
trying to make a run at Cincinnati, where former Royals outfielder
 &UR; Michael Tucker remains mostly a bench player. Tucker began his
career as an infielder. But if the Reds continue to hold out for a
young pitcher, no deal will be made.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's  &UR; Paul Sorrento is a player seeking a change of
scenery. The experiment to move him to left field has failed and
Sorrento is barely playing since the club called up  &UR; Bubba Trammell
last week. Sorrento, who is being paid $3 million this season and
has another $3 million club option for next season, may not be
marketable. &QL; 
THE RANKINGS &QL; 
 &UR; TOP OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. ClevelandAll this offense and the Indians lead the AL in stolen
bases, too.  &QL; 
2. NY YankeesSS  &UR; Derek Jeter is the best all-around player in the
game.  &QL; 
3. Atlanta &UR; Tom Glavine and  &UR; Greg Maddux finally put together solid
consecutive outings.  &QL; 
4. Arizona &UR; Vladimir Nunez, you're the next contestant on ``Can
You'' ``Close the Game''?  &QL; 
5. HoustonAstros vowed to keep the club in first place while &UR; Larry
Dierker recovers.  &QL; 
6. TexasFuture superstar CF  &UR; Ruben Mateo was called up. Will it be
for good?  &QL; 
7. BostonScary but true: Knuckleballer  &UR; Tim Wakefield is the new
temporary closer.  &QL; 
8. NY MetsThe Mets seem capable of winning games only when chaos
rules.  &QL; 
9. San FranciscoAll the Giants want to do is stay within striking
distance of Arizona. &UR; BOTTOM OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
30. FloridaBig news!  &UR; Kevin Orie takes over as first baseman.  &QL; 
29. Tampa BayThe state of big-league ball in Florida is completely
rank.  &QL; 
28. MinnesotaThe starters' 6.43 ERA ranks 14th among 14 AL clubs.  &QL; 
27. San DiegoAt least there's  &UR; Tony Gwynn's march toward 3,000
hits.  &QL; 
26. MontrealSeven players have had their shot at leading off.  &QL; 
25. MilwaukeePitcher &UR; Cal Eldred is yanked from the rotation and put
in bullpen.  &QL; 
24. Kansas CityRoyals fever has given way to a royal case of
sickness.  &QL; 
23. DetroitThey're finally admitting they may be a year behind
schedule in Motown.  &QL; 
22. Anaheim &UR; Terry Collins goes from extension to the hot seat
within two weeks. ON THE RISE &QL; 
 &UR; Colorado Rockies: A victory Wednesday would have pushed the Rockies
to the elusive .500 mark. But a 15-2 loss knocked those plans by
the wayside. Still, Colorado had lost just four times in its
previous 13 games entering the Rockies weekend series against
Florida. Colorado has seen the evolution of  &UR; Pedro Astacio, who has
decided to take on the role of staff ace. After starting the season
0-3, Astacio is 6-2 in his past nine starts. &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL; 
 &UR; Chicago Cubs: Nine games over .500 less than two weeks ago, the
Cubs have seen their record drop and their deficit increase in the
NL Central standings. During a stretch that included six losses in
seven games, Cubs pitchers combined for a 9.00 ERA. Starter  &UR; Steve
Trachsel, expected to be one of the better starters, fell to 2-9
after losing Wednesday. Rookie starter  &UR; Kyle Farnsworth, has
started to struggle also. &QL; 
OVERHEARD &QL; 
Cincinnati Manager  &UR; Jack McKeon decided to have a little fun with
Cleveland Manager  &UR; Mike Hargrove last weekend. When the two met
with umpires at home plate to discuss Cinergy Field's ground rules,
McKeon pointed to a new bright yellow line of paint that had been
applied to the second deck, high above the playing field, and
quipped, ``That yellow line way up there? Cleveland's home runs
have to hit above that line. Ours just have to clear that yellow
line on top of the wall.'' &QL; 
OUT OF LEFT FIELD &QL; 
In this case, it's out of the rotation. Left-handed pitcher &UR; Ryan
Mills, a former All-American at Arizona State, has been taken out
of the rotation at Class A Fort Myers (Fla.) while Minnesota's No.
1 pick in last year's draft works on his mechanics. Mills was 2-5
with an 8.17 ERA before he was lifted from the Miracle's rotation.
He has 22 strikeouts, but had issued 36 walks and hit eight
batters. Twins officials hope to straighten out Mills' delivery and
thought process. &QL;

U.S. DOMI NATES DEN MARK  
 HAMM'S GOAL ERASES SLUGGISH START BY AMERICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM THOMAS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ When U.S. star Mia Hamm drilled the ball
into the net, it sent an emphatic message to the Danish team and
the 14 others gathered in this country for the international
women's soccer championships:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our World Cup and you're not welcome to it''.``''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm's goal in the 17th minute turned the momentum in the U.S.
national team's favor and sparked the Americans to a 3-0 victory
over Denmark in the opening match Saturday of the Women's World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The win, in front of 78,972 fans at Giants Stadium _ the largest
crowd to watch a women's sporting event of any kind, anywhere _
gave the United States three points in Group A and clearly
emphasized that the Americans deserve the role of tournament
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a tournament like this, you really want to start off on the
right foot,'' Hamm said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm got the U.S. team started with both feet. The forward
gathered a long pass from Brandi Chastain, touched it deftly past a
defender with her right foot and blasted a left-footed shot into
the upper part of the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little nervous in the first half and didn't play our
game,'' U.S. forward Cindy Parlow said. ``But fortunately we got
the 1-0 lead and that really helped us. Mia was outstanding. She
was out there telling us to settle down, settle down, play our
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Denmark was surprisingly in control at the start with an
aggressive counter attack and physical play at both ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm satisfied,'' Denmark Coach Jorgen Hvidemose said. ``We
should have scored a goal or two, especially in the first half. If
you score the first goal, often you win the match.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm's goal seemed to deflate the Danes, who became flat-footed
at midfield and disorganized on defense. The United States created
three more good scoring chances in the first half, the best being a
shot by Parlow that hit off the right post in the 24th minute. The
forward also had a shot that tipped just over the crossbar early in
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like I've been hitting the bar all week (in
practice),'' Parlow said. ``It's become a joke with the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Parlow wasn't the only U.S. player to be frustrated by missed
opportunities. Kristine Lilly had one shot hit the crossbar and
missed wide left on another while going one-on-one against Denmark
goalkeeper Dorthe Larsen.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly was finally able to convert in the 89th minute, dribbling
across the top of the box before hitting a left-footed shot into
the left corner of the net to finish the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   That goal came after Julie Foudy gave the Americans a 2-0 lead
and what at the time was some much-needed breathing room. Again, it
was Hamm who was the catalyst, sending a pass through the box that
Foudy hit high and hard past Larsen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mia was awesome,'' U.S. Coach Tony DiCicco said. ``She wanted
the responsibility, wanted the ball, wanted to make the shot or get
it to someone else for the score.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We created some good chances up front, and when we needed to
finish, we did so,'' said Hamm, the world leader in career goals
with 110 and counting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense played really solid throughout.''
</P>
<P>
   Denmark managed only three shots, two that tested U.S.
goalkeeper Briana Scurry. The first came on a corner kick moments
after Scurry had the wind knocked out of her in a collision with
Denmark's Mikka Hansen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hurting, but I had to get up,'' said Scurry, who
struggled to her feet. ``I didn't want to, but the ball was still
loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Scurry's final save came with only seconds left in the match.
Janni Johansen Lund broke through the defense and fired at Scurry
from close range, but the goalkeeper hugged the ball and earned a
standing ovation from her teammates on the bench as time ran out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting the three points was very important for us,'' Hamm
said. ``Everyone was really excited in the locker room. It was a
very, very proud moment for us. It's only the first day, but this
was a great start.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team will play Nigeria in Chicago on Thursday in the
second of its three Group A matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we did a good job against a quality team,'' DiCicco
said. ``We're delighted with the win and the three points, but this
is only the beginning. We'll enjoy it now, then start to focus on
Nigeria.'' &QL;

<P>
   PHOENIX - The Coyotes are expected to interview candidates for
two assistant coaching positions this week in Boston at the NHL
Entry Draft and should have both hires in place by July 1.
</P>
<P>
   One coach will be responsible for working with the defensemen
and the other for working with the forwards. The Coyotes retained
goalie instructor  &UR; Benoit Allaire.
</P>
<P>
   Two candidates identified before the club hired  &UR; Bobby Francis
as head coach are New York Islanders assistant  &UR; Wayne Fleming and
former NHL player-turned-broadcaster  &UR; Ryan Walter.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager  &UR; Bobby Smith has met with both men, but at the
time, it was about possible assistant coaching positions for
then-Coach  &UR; Jim Schoenfeld. Smith did not rule out either, however,
from joining the staff under Francis, who was hired on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Other potential candidates include  &UR; Dave Farrish, the head coach
of the Springfield Falcons, the Coyotes' top minor-league affiliate
in the American Hockey League and possibly  &UR; Peter Laviolette, who
guided the Providence Bruins to the AHL's Calder Cup championship
in his first year on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Francis coached Providence for two seasons and then spent the
past two years as an assistant with the parent Boston Bruins. The
Coyotes would need permission from Boston management before
interviewing Laviolette, 34, who is close to Francis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby (Francis) called after we won the Cup just to say
congratulations and I said the same thing to him after word got out
that he was going to coach the Coyotes,'' Laviolette said. ``We
didn't talk about anything else and nobody's talked to me about a
job in Phoenix. Right now, I'm under contract with the Boston
Bruins as the coach in Providence and I love my job. I'm here and
that's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another coach Smith and Francis may decide to target is former
Roadrunners player &UR; Bruce Boudreau, a longtime minor-league scoring
champion who has since made a successful switch to coaching.
</P>
<P>
   Boudreau guided the Mississippi Sea Wolves of the East Coast
Hockey League to the Kelly Cup championship this past season and
previously, coached the Fort Wayne Komets to the International
Hockey League's Turner Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Sea Wolves have a bit of connection with the Coyotes.
Springfield has a working agreement with Mississippi and constantly
shuttles players back and forth when needed.
</P>
<P>
   But Boudreau has already received interest from elsewhere. He
may have an opportunity to coach the Los Angeles Kings' new AHL
affiliate, the Lowell Lock Monsters, and has been contacted by the
Atlanta Thrashers about a similar job in the NHL expansion team's
system. &QL; 
Contract talks &QL; 
The Coyotes have had preliminary discussions with unrestricted free
agent  &UR; Mike Sullivan, one of their better defensive forwards last
season, and it's possible the center/left wing could agree to terms
on a new contract by this week.
</P>
<P>
   Smith indicated it appears doubtful the team will re-sign center
 &UR; Bob Corkum, also an unrestricted free agent. The New York Rangers
and Los Angeles Kings are expected to make him an offer after July
1. &QL;

TIGER HAS EARNED BATTLE STRIPES 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ Double bogey, bogey. Nice start, Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this had happened last year,'' he shrugged, ``I probably
wouldn't have handled it as well.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is the slowly-maturing Tiger Woods. He knew there was a
difference between blowing three shots to par in the third round of
the US Open at Pinehurst No. 2 and blowing three shots to par at,
say, the Phoenix Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I started out double bogey, bogey on a regular tour
event,'' he pointed out, ``I'd probably lose about five shots.''
</P>
<P>
   But in this tournament, on this course, under these conditions,
there was no need to panic. Tiger Woods knew that before too long
his competition would also make a mistake or two. Or three. Or, in
the case of the imploding John Daly, 11. The slowly-maturing Tiger
Woods didn't throw or slam down a club. He just reminded himself
that the object of the game is to shoot par here and that there
were 16 holes to go. He settled down, picked up a stroke to par
with birdies on Nos. 4 and 15, bogeyed just one more hole (14) and
put a 37-35_72 on the board.
</P>
<P>
   And guess what? Eldrick ``Tiger'' Woods has just as good a
chance to win the 1999 United States Open as anybody. He is only
two strokes behind Payne Stewart. And doesn't NBC like that.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger hasn't compiled a very good dossier in this tournament
during his young life. He played it twice as an amateur,
withdrawing in 1995 after an opening round 74 at Shinnecock Hills
and finishing in a tie for 82d with a 14-over 294 at Bloomfield
Hills in '96. As a professional, he placed 19th (Congressional) and
16th (Olympic CC). He has never been a factor.
</P>
<P>
   But he came here as one of the favorites, as much for his
performance in winning The Memorial two weeks ago as anything else.
For en route to his 15-under score of 273 Tiger was forced to
demonstrate a Houdini-aspect to his game that most people feel
would be necessary for success here at hallowed No. 2. Tiger won
that tournament with a variety of great salvaged pars and superb
birdies resulting from creativity around the greens. In picking
Tiger to win, many people cited the apparent convergence of man,
course, and time.
</P>
<P>
   It may all turn out to be true.
</P>
<P>
   He is definitely in a winning frame of mind. ``I'll take it,''
he said of his 2-over score on a day when only one man, Steve
Stricker, could break par. ``After the start I had, I'll certainly
take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger continues to marvel at Pinehurst No. 2, particularly the
amazing greens. ``My game plan here is very simple,'' he says. ``I
want to hit the fairways and the greens. I hit a lot of greens
today. The ball didn't stay on them, but I hit 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   He then laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, that's the way it is here,'' he explained. ``You've
got to spin the ball to make sure it stays on the greens.''
</P>
<P>
   That astonishing Masters victory now seems like it happened a
very long time ago. Tiger is now such a towering presence on the
American (and, indeed, international) sporting scene it always
seems he's been around as long as Arnold Palmer. So much was
expected of Tiger after that explosive Augusta domination in 1997
that it is possible to frame him as an underachiever if you are so
inclined.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is Tiger's then unpolished game meshed perfectly with
Augusta. That particular confrontation was unfair, a total
mismatch. The US Open is different. This tournament presents
different challenges for all golfers, and particularly difficult
challenges to young ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what you guys are thinking,'' said the man who
won't turn 24 until the end of this year, ``but I am still young.
I'm learning how to handle myself and how to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people thought the Memorial was a better preparation for
this tournament than Tiger does. ``It really didn't matter,'' he
declared. ``This is something I've been preparing for my entire
life. Anyone watching me play since I was a kid would attest to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even people who didn't have that pleasure understand that Tiger
was a Mozart-like golfing prodigy who has no recollection of a life
spent without a golf club in his hand. Earl Woods raised his boy to
be the greatest golfer of all-time, and one of the ways that
designation might some day be his is if he has a string of US Opens
to brag about.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he some day manages to challenge Jack Nicklaus and
Willie Anderson for Open titles (4), he is likely to remember any
championship won at Pinehurst No. 2 with more fondness than
anything else. Consider this: Asked just how much of a legitimate
target there is on virtually every green if you'd like to have a
reasonable birdie putt, he replied, ``2 yards by 2 yards.'' And
then, he added, ``you've got to have the correct spin.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he's complaining. Pinehurst inspires awe, not anger.
``It's fair.'' he said. ``The gold course is set up fairly. If the
USGA had set the rough up to the greens, I don't think you'd hear
guys saying such nice things, but they haven't. Most US Open
courses require you to grab a lob wedge and hack your way out. Here
you need a plethora of shots.''
</P>
<P>
   He has all anyone can rightfully ask for here in Sunday's final
round, and that is a fair chance. ``You're gonna make mistakes
here,'' he said. ``Everyone's gonna do it. Hopefully, you don't
make them down the stretch on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Tiger said he was off for a brief stint at the
practice tee. Then he was going to watch the Sabres and Stars. He
was feeling good. He can win the US Open before his 24th birthday,
which is pretty much what Earl Woods had in mind.

SCURRY BARES HER CUP HOPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM THOMAS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ U.S. goalkeeper Briana Scurry is on her
way to leading the team to another international championship. But
don't expect an encore to her performance ``after'' winning the
gold medal in the 1996 Olympic Games in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping a promise she made while only half-awake, Scurry ran
naked through the streets of Athens, Ga., where the gold-medal game
was played.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a lot of long hours and not a whole lot of sleep,''
Scurry explained this week. ````Sports Illustrated'' called me at 8
a.m. and asked me what I would do if we won. I'm a woman of my
word, and I did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Scurry is making no such promises now that the U.S. team has its
first World Cup victory and is favored to win it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no predictions for this World Cup,'' she said. ``I just
want to win and keep my clothes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Scurry recorded a well-deserved shutout in Saturday's opener
against Denmark, a match the U.S. team won, 3-0, at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Briana made some big saves,'' forward Mia Hamm said. ``She
dominated her box, and the defense has to be happy with the
shutout.'' &QL; 
Stage fright &QL; 
Women's soccer has yet to catch on in Denmark, where handball is
the most popular sport among females. The soccer national team had
hoped that a good showing in the World Cup would help change that,
but the Danes drew the unfortunate assignment of playing the United
States in the opener.
</P>
<P>
   Denmark Coach Jorgen Hvidemose said the players had been nervous
before the match but settled down once they took the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing the United States was a very special match for us,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sellout crowd of 78,972 had to be intimidating to the Danes.
They had never before played in front of a crowd larger than
20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider it from this perspective: There are an estimated 7.5
million females playing soccer in the United States. The entire
population of Denmark is 5 million. &QL; 
Thoughts of home &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican national team dedicated its World Cup opener
Saturday against Brazil at Giants Stadium to the victims of the
earthquake Tuesday in central Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The 6.7-magnitude quake left at least 19 dead, dozens injured
and destroyed numerous buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all feel very sad about what happened,'' Mexico Coach
Leonardo Cuellar said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexicans were clearly overmatched against Brazil _ perhaps
the top team in Group B _ losing, 7-1. &QL; 
Corner kicks &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Sonia Denoncourt was the referee in the United
State-Denmark match, her second straight World Cup opener. All the
referees in this Cup are women, a first for the event.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous Brazilian, and the best-known of all soccer
players, was in attendance at Giants Stadium. Pele was spotted
cheering on Brazil in its match against Mexico. &QL;

TWINS TOWER OVER NHL DRAFT  
 SWEDISH PAIR EXPRESS DESIRE TO STAY TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are the Twin Peaks of the 1999 NHL entry draft, the two
highest-rated brothers ever to enter the same draft class. But
Swedish twins Daniel and Henrik Sedin might be more Double Trouble
than Dynamic Duo.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the mirror-image 18-year-olds aren't awesome
talents. They are the top two-rated players among Europeans,
according to the final release by the Central Scouting Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel, a 6-foot-1 left wing, is a dynamite, can't-miss
prospect. Henrik, a 6-foot-2 center, is a hungry, tougher version
of his twin who also is a sure thing. All scouts agree they will be
future stars in the NHL for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the catch. The twins don't want to be separated. They
want to play in the same organization when they come to North
America in another year. If it doesn't happen, both of them figure
to be impossible to sign and, for the first time, it's being
whispered they may opt to remain in Sweden indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we're starting to hear,'' one scout for a
Canadian-based club said. ``It makes you wonder how much their
stock is really worth now.''
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, doesn't bode well for any of the first five
teams picking in Saturday's draft at the FleetCenter in Boston. If
one team picks Daniel, it will be under intense pressure to swing a
draft-day deal or a later trade to pick up Henrik as well. A costly
gamble? You bet. But whichever team does it will be the most-talked
about club in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not saying they won't play on separate teams in the
NHL,'' said Michael Barnett, the twins' agent, ``but time is on
their side because neither of them is playing in the NHL next
season anyway. We think there's an obvious advantage for a team
with one of the twins to try and get the other one, and some teams
have expressed an interest in doing that. We'll do everything we
can to try and make that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most likely candidates to make a pitch for both Sedin
brothers are the Atlanta Thrashers, who pick second overall, and
the Vancouver Canucks, who select third. But don't count out the
next two teams in the order, the Chicago Blackhawks and the New
York Islanders, both of whom have scouted Europe thoroughly and are
in desperate need of signing young, explosive talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to have them both,'' Thrashers General Manager Don
Waddell told ``The Hockey News.'' ``One would be terrific. Two
would be fantastic. Although I'm confident they'll be excellent
players whether they're together or apart in the NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel scored 21 goals and 42 points in 50 games last season for
MoDo of the Swedish elite league. Henrik had 12 goals and 34 points
in 49 games. But which twin do you pick first?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you like a scorer, Daniel is is the better player,'' said
Per Beckman, the twin's coach with MoDo. ``But if you like a worker
on the whole ice, Henrik is better. Henrik is good in both ends and
always plays for the team. Daniel plays for the team, too, but he
wants to score.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect the Coyotes to get involved in the Sedin
sweepstakes. They pick 19th overall and have targeted a handful of
other prospects that should be available when NHL Commissioner Gary
Bettman calls them up to the podium.
</P>
<P>
   The first team to stand up from the draft table will be the
Tampa Bay Lightning, which will be picking first for the second
straight year after nabbing consensus No. 1 overall pick Vincent
Lecavalier last June.
</P>
<P>
   While the Sedin twins interest Coach/General Manager Jacques
Demers, he no longer is calling the shots in Tampa, and it is
believed the Lightning will take Pavel Brendl, the high-scoring
wing for the Calgary Hitmen of the Western Hockey League, who
scored 73 goals and 134 points in 68 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech Republic native added 21 goals and 46 points in 20
playoff games to help the Hitmen advance to the Memorial Cup. He
tends to skate some invisible shifts from time to time, and he
isn't always much of a factor away from the puck, but his numbers
are simply too good to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised, I'm shocked,'' Paul Henry, the director of
player personnel of the Florida Panthers, said of Brendl. ``The
biggest thing is, he has emerged as a pure goal-scorer. He has
game-breaking ability that all great NHL players have.''
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1-rated player in North America, however, is Patrik
Stefan, a 6-foot-1{, 205-pound center who missed half of last
season with the Long Beach Ice Dogs of the International Hockey
League because of two major concussions. Another Czech-born player,
Stefan appears the most ready to step into to the NHL element right
away, but his health concerns are an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Other top prospects expected to go high in the first round next
Saturday include Moose Jaw center Jamie Lundmark (40 goals, 50
assists, 90 points), Calgary center Kris Beech (26-41-67), Seattle
forward Oleg Saprykin (47-46-97), Erie center Tim Connolly
(34-34-68), Sudbury left wing Taylor Pyatt (37-38-75) and Barrie
right wing Denis Shvidki (35-59-94).
</P>
<P>
   ``His ice vision and his passing ability are second to none,''
Barrie Coach Bert Templeton said of the Ukranian-born Shvidki.
``He's already at the NHL level with those.'' &QL;

ROOKIES' CON CENTRATION AT CAMP PLEASES TOBIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Cardinals Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin pronounced his
fourth rookie and free-agent camp his best ever on Friday. Then, he
and his coaching staff closed up shop for brief vacations until
preseason camp opens July 30 in Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an excellent camp,'' Tobin said. ``They really
concentrated on the tasks at hand, which was to learn the offense,
defense and special teams. In terms of concentration, it's probably
the best camp we've had in the four years we've been here. It's a
group of rookies that want to make this football team, and they did
everything in their power to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The only damper on the two-week camp was the limited physical
roles of first-round picks  &UR; David Boston (shoulder) and  &UR; L.J.
Shelton (orthoscopic knee surgery), but even that didn't affect
Tobin's impressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really weren't assessing athletic talent in this camp,'' he
said. ``The main thing we were trying to do was teach our system
and plays. Shelton was in every meeting, so mentally he hasn't lost
anything. And, what he has lost physically, is very minimal because
the way the camp was structured.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that hurt Boston the most was NCAA rules. He missed
a week of the insertion. But as long as they were in the meetings
they'll pick it up. It was mostly mental and the physical part was
secondary.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston, from Ohio State, missed the first week of camp because
of an NFL rule prohibiting participation until a player's
graduating class holds commencement exercises.'' &QL; 
Eye catching &QL; 
While Tobin wasn't stressing the physical aspect of play, one
player who did catch his eye was middle linebacker  &UR; Mel Bradley
from Arkansas, one of two sixth-round picks who is making the
transition from the defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy who was the most unanswered question coming in was
Bradley,'' Tobin said. ``He showed us he has the athletic ability
to play middle linebacker. He has good speed, an ability to change
directions and to get outside.
</P>

that, and right before she was totally delivered he told, ``OK,

but it doesn't compare to this.'' &QL;

   PHOENIX - On Father's Day, the Mercury is thinking ahead to a
four-game homestand in late July when it expects the chance to
salute its impending mother.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Michelle Griffiths, who started 25 games at power forward last
season but is on maternity leave awaiting the fall birth of her
first child, is planning a visit July 23-29. Phoenix is hosting
Orlando, Washington, Utah and Minnesota during that week in its
longest homestand of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Griffiths, 6 feet 1, will be the first Mercury player to give
birth since the WNBA launched in 1997.  &UR; Edna Campbell and
 &UR; Merlelynn
 &UR; Lange-Harris came to the team already with children.
</P>
<P>
   Griffiths plans to return next season when she and Australian
teammates  &UR; Michele Timms and  &UR; Kristi Harrower will use the WNBA as
preparation for the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Other Australian
national-teamers in the league are:  &UR; Sandy Brondello, Carla Porter
and
 &UR; Rachel Sporn with Detroit;  &UR; Trish Fallon and  &UR; Annie LaFleur with
Minnesota; and  &UR; Jenny Whittle with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Australian national-team head Coach  &UR; Tom Maher was here for the
Mercury home opener vs. Sacramento. His assistant coach,  &UR; Carrie
Graf, is a Mercury assistant.
</P>
<P>
   The entire Australian national team, called the Opals, will be
in San Diego on Sept. 9-12 to play in the U.S. Olympic Cup vs. a
WNBA team, Brazil and Poland. Brazil and Australia were silver and
bronze medalists behind the United States at the 1996 Olympics
while Poland won the European Championships earlier this month. &QL; 
Olympic bid loses &QL; 
Poprad-Tatry, the Slovak Republic home of Mercury
guard/forward &UR; Andrea Kuklova, was one of the losing cities in
Saturday's decision to award the 2006 Winter Olympics to Turin,
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Poprad was one of four cities first eliminated when the field
was reduced to Turin and Sion, Switzerland. Turin then won in a
53-36 upset vote.
</P>
<P>
   Kuklova, 27 and a 1992 Olympian, stayed at home playing for
Kosice during the off-season. &QL; 
No reunion &QL; 
Cleveland center  &UR; Chasity Melvin expected her first trip here to be
reunion with  &UR; Umeki Webb. The two were teammates at North Carolina
State, then Webb was a graduate assistant in 1997-98 when Melvin
and the Wolfpack reached the NCAA Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   But Melvin was the only 1998 Kodak All-American to sign with the
American Basketball League, thus missing the second WNBA season.
And now that she's in the league, Webb is out, having been one of
the Mercury's final cuts. &QL;

CARDS RECEIVER STARS IN EU ROPE  
 MCCULLOUGH BE COMES A FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget joining the Army or Navy, Andy McCullough became a pro
football player and found a better way to se the world.
</P>
<P>
   Since signing a contract out of the University of Tennessee a
year ago, McCullough has already made NFL stops with New Orleans,
Miami, Detroit and the Arizona Cardinals. He now finds himself
lighting up the NFL Europe as a wide receiver for the World
Bowl-bound Frankfurt Galaxy with hopes of finding a permanent home
with the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Entering today's season-ending game against the Barcelona
Dragons, McCullough leads all NFL Europe receivers in yards per
catch (18.4) touchdowns (nine), and ranks second in receiving yards
(793) and is fourth in receptions (43).
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, he has proved something to himself and the
Cardinals coaching staff, which sent him to Frankfurt for further
schooling after signing him late last season and carrying him on
the practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been very productive over there,'' Cardinals Coach
Vince Tobin said. ``He has shown he can catch the pass over the
middle and make big plays in that league. He has run well after
making the catch, too. He has done what we wanted to find out if he
could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We picked him up late and had him on the scout team, and this
has really helped him and given him an excellent chance to compete
for a spot on our football team, whereas if he hadn't gone over
there he probably would have been just a camp member. He has a
chance. As a coach you like to see what a guy does in the heat of
battle, and he has shown he can come through.''
</P>
<P>
   McCullough, whose Galaxy has already clinched a World Bowl spot,
believes his European experience has opened doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the coaches told me they were sending me here I was
really excited about it,'' said McCullough by telephone on Friday.
``I hadn't played in a game in so long I just wanted a chance to
prove what I'm capable of doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had confidence, but now my confidence is
astronomical. Before I was always afraid of making a mistake, but
now I know I'm not perfect and am ready to play receiver and play
through mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6-foot-3, 210-pounds, McCullough could become a welcome
addition to the Cardinals as a physical receiver or on special
teams. When he returns from Europe, he plans to work out with
Vikings receivers Cris Carter, Randy Moss and Jake Reed in Florida.
Still, he credits much of his improvement to a pair of Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a problem getting off bump coverage after
getting knocked around every day by Aeneas Williams and Corey
Chavous,'' he said. ``What I've been working on is getting out of
my cuts faster and doing something with the ball after I catch it.
I've always been good at running the deep routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Cardinals receiver) Frank Sanders really helped me last year,
too. He was like a big brother to me and helped me out running
better routes and by making me a better man off the field. There
are a lot of great people on the Cardinals. I was with three teams
last year because I kept getting caught in the numbers game, and
they made me feel at home.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough said when he went to Europe, he had concerns about
playing an 11-game schedule and then going straight to a much
longer NFL schedule with little rest. He has put those fears to
rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about it at first, taking a lot of hits and the toll
it would take,'' he said. ``But I've been taking care of myself and
do a lot of little things like taking vitamins and getting a lot of
rest at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game here is a step under the NFL, but the coaching staff
is good, and the practices are just like the NFL. I've been doing
the same things I did in Arizona to prepare myself for games. The
crowd here is unbelievable. They get 40,000 to every game.''

MICKELSON EXPECTS SILENCE FROM BEEPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BY BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _  &UR; Phil Mickelson is not quite a father yet, but
he knows the perfect gift for Father's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking about it, yeah,'' he said, referring to the
possibility of his first major championship after winning 13 times
on the PGA Tour. ``But there's a long way to go. I hit the ball
poorly (Saturday), but my swing is off just a smidgen. That's why
I've got to go hit balls.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, the Scottsdale pro was off to the range, trailing
 &UR; Payne Stewart by 1 stroke going into today's final round at
Pinehurst No. 2. Only three things seem to be standing in the way
of him clearing his biggest career hurdle:
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that Stewart or another of the leaders might
post a great score.
</P>
<P>
   The chance Mickelson won't play well.
</P>
<P>
   A beeper that could go off, telling him his baby girl,  &UR; Amanda,
is on the way. He has said on several occasions this week that if
he gets the call from his wife,  &UR; Amy, he's ``outta here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked with her already (on Saturday), and things are going
well,'' said Mickelson, who at one point held a 3-stroke lead at 3
under before he needed to birdie the final hole just to finish with
a 73 and at level par. ``I'm really not all that concerned about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experts tell us (the baby) still is a week or two off, and
I believe them.'' &QL; 
Arizona connection &QL; 
Mickelson is not the only Arizona pro who could walk away with his
first major championship. Fellow Scottsdale residents  &UR; Billy
Mayfair and  &UR; Tim Herron also are knocking on the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, the U.S. Open probably isn't my style of golf,
because I don't drive it real straight,'' said Herron, who is 2
shots behind Stewart after a 70 _ the day's second-best round.
``But this week I'm driving it good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only missed one fairway (Saturday), although I missed it by
a huge margin. I just hope I can continue to keep lagging the ball
well around the greens.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfair, who shot 74, was stung by three straight bogeys on the
back side, the result of approach shots that would not settle down.
The statistic that killed him was only eight greens in regulation,
but he still is right there, 4 shots off the pace.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's other three survivors fell farther back, as  &UR; Tom
Lehman (73, 10 over),  &UR; Jim Carter (74, 11 over) and  &UR; Brandel
Chamblee (74, 11 over) can only hope for a top-15 finish that would
get them into next year's Open at Pebble Beach. &QL; 
In the red &QL; 
Hard to believe a round of 1-under in a U.S. Open could command
such attention. Even the guy who did it,  &UR; Steve Stricker, was a
little mystified to be the only player to break par in Round 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like I shot the round of the year,'' Stricker
said of the 69. ``But getting off to that start, you really don't
expect something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Stricker holed a 40-foot birdie putt at the second hole, which
he called ``the longest putt I've made in I don't know how long.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I holed an 8-iron out of the bunker at No. 3,'' he said
of the 136-yard eagle. ``All of a sudden I'm 3 under through three
holes, and the crowd is going crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   From there he rode it out with four bogeys and two more birdies,
jumping from 20th place to a tie for fifth, 3 strokes away from
Stewart. &QL; 
How hard was it? &QL; 
Everyone felt Pinehurst No. 2 was way too difficult on Saturday,
but several players took their potshots to new levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played this as a par 88. I made 12 birdies and a bogey,''
said  &UR; John Cook, whose 77 pushed him to 14 over. &QL;

LEHMAN WILL TEE OFF EARLY  
 STREAK OF PLAYING IN LAST GROUP ENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ For the first time in four years, Tom Lehman
won't be paired in the final group of the U.S. Open today. His
record-tying streak came to an end Saturday at Pinehurst No. 2,
where a 3-over 73 shoved him to 10 over and the middle of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how it felt to be out of contention for the first time
since the 1995 Open at Shinnecock, when Lehman began the string
that equaled Bobby Jones' feat, the Scottsdale pro shot back:
``What do you mean I'm out of contention? I'm going to shoot 59
(today).''
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter responded, ``Which nine?'' Lehman just laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty brutal, but fairly accurate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman said that a stiff breeze and some pin placements that
``seemed to be suspended in air'' are making the old course more
treacherous by the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``My prediction is that someone might be under par at the end of
(Saturday), but there won't be anybody under par (tonight),''
Lehman said. ``For starters, the course is a par 72, not 70. And
when you put those pins on those little ledges, it seems like
they're sticking out of nowhere. It's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, who has not finished out of the top-five in the past
four Opens, said his goal now is a top-20 finish. But that wouldn't
be bad on the ``toughest Open course I've ever played.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said once that Augusta National was a chamber of horrors,
but I found a new one,'' he added. ``(Pinehurst No. 2) almost makes
Augusta look easy.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean Lehman feels the course should not be used
in the Open rotation. In fact, he likes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great old golf course,'' he said. ``But I prefer the
courses where the rough is up. You know, six-inch hay. This is more
like Augusta, no rough, but much tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, Lehman's 73 during the third round looked pretty
good. He only got beat up once, at No. 2, where he left a 5-iron
short, then failed to get his chip up the hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Easy 6,'' he said. ``There will be a lot of those there.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past four years, Lehman posted third-round scores of 67,
65, 68 and 68, but he never came close to lapping the field on this
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I shot 73, and I definitely think that was under par,''
he said. ``My problem has been that I've made just three birdies in
three days, and one of those was a chip-in. It's a great course to
have a lead on, but it's just too darn tough to play catch-up.'' &QL;

STATE AT PEACE WITH DOVE SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - In the early 1970s, Arizona still was in its heyday
for dove hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities such as John Wayne, who had a couple of ranches in
Arizona but didn't live here often, came to Arizona with buddies to
shoot doves during opening weekend.
</P>
<P>
   It was more like a slaughter. The ``hunters'' would take a limit
or so in the morning and return in the evening for another.
</P>
<P>
   Great deal: Cook doves, drink whiskey and have a heck of the
time.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Game and Fish Department didn't have nearly enough
officers to enforce the law. They could catch only a few offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Then Arizona began to grow quickly in population. Agricultural
areas began to dwindle in favor of development. Dove habitat took a
dive.
</P>
<P>
   With dwindling habitat and still a large number of hunters, the
dove population began to suffer. Then hunter numbers dropped.
Arizona became less than a party place to shoot doves, although
Californians, who have rotten game management, kept coming because
of the agricultural areas around Yuma, a dove mecca.
</P>
<P>
   In the years before 1989, the Arizona Game and Fish Department
decided it had to do something about the dwindling dove and dove
hunter populations.
</P>
<P>
   Since the dove is a migratory bird, it is under the auspices of
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which sets up hunt guidelines
for the states.
</P>
<P>
   Long ago, it had decided on split seasons, opening Sept. 1 with
a two-week season and then resuming the season in November. Almost
all the doves in some areas were killed in the first few days of
the first season.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the department instituted a two-week opening season
that lasted only half a day each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year, mourning doves did better,'' said Tice
Supplee, game chief for Game and Fish. ``In 1990, white-wings began
improving in numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past decade, doves posted a modest increase _ despite
the fact habitat still was shrinking except in the Yuma area.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's also a growing quality of hunt in the late season,''
she said at an Arizona Game and Fish Commission meeting Saturday in
Phoenix. ``The number of hunter-days (number of days utilized by
hunters) is increasing in the southern part of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, dove numbers have stabilized in Arizona, and so have
the number of hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Some groups were asking commissioners Saturday to liberalize the
seasons. Game and Fish biologists presented several different
season scenarios. They preferred the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioners made only one change.
</P>
<P>
   During the early season, juniors, those 15 and under, can hunt
all day in the southern zone. That means hunting after school,
giving them more opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Since juniors account for only about 2.3 percent of the dove
kill, the change will have little impact.
</P>
<P>
   The commission did a pretty good job on this one. Once stability
is reached on a declining population, why liberalize it?
</P>
<P>
   Also, the band-tail pigeon limit was raised to 4 from 3. &QL;

RIVER GUARDIANS DISCUSS SETBACKS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ga., S.C., N.C., Maine, Fla., Alaska, Calif., Canada)   (nk) 
 BY JOHN T. MCQUISTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAG HARBOR, N.Y. _ Billy Joel took the helm of his new
65-foot-long boat, the Redhead, and with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at
his side in the pilot's seat, led 50 environmentalists who keep
watch on the nation's waterways on a tour of Peconic Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when you're heading in from Block Island, you can
almost imagine how pristine it was here when the first explorers
arrived hundreds of years ago,'' Joel said as he maneuvered the
Redhead away from the dock at the Sag Harbor Yacht Club early
Friday, gave a warning blast on the boat's horn and headed out into
the bay.
</P>
<P>
   It was Joel, long an advocate for the dwindling number of
commercial fishermen and baymen on Long Island's East End, who
helped win congressional approval of the bay as a national estuary
in 1993, providing it with protection from pollution under the
Clean Water Act.
</P>
<P>
   Adopted by Congress a quarter-century ago, the Clean Water Act
gave citizens broad powers to enforce environmental laws through
private lawsuits. It led to hundreds of suits filed by citizens
that produced millions of dollars in penalties paid to the
government and scores of court orders to stop pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, more of the suits are being turned back by
rulings by the Supreme Court and lower federal courts, greatly
diminishing the power of environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past decade, right-wing jurists have eroded or
dismantled many of the environmental protections and citizens'
rights that Congress wrote into the environmental statutes passed
after Earth Day in 1970,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These decisions are being written just as many of the nation's
rivers and beaches are recovering from decades of abuse and are
being reopened for fishing and swimming,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Water Keeper Alliance, all grass-roots river and
bay advocates from across North America, gathered Thursday at the
Southampton College of Long Island University for a four-day
conference to discuss their legal rights and form a strategy to
respond to the legal challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was organized by Kennedy, a founder of the alliance,
an umbrella group of 35 keeper programs in the United States and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The keepers cast themselves among the most aggressive and
litigious members of the environmental movement. While there is no
current legal action involving Peconic Bay, groups like the San
Francisco Baykeeper and the Hudson Riverkeeper maintain more than
40 lawsuits against environmental polluters at one time, according
to Kennedy, who also is the supervising attorney for the Pace
Environmental Litigation Clinic at the Pace University School of
Law in White Plains.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the Upper Chattahoochee Riverkeeper in Georgia
recently won a $1 billion judgment against the city of Atlanta for
violating clean water laws at its sewer treatment plants. But the
recent losses in court, he said, were the primary concern at this
week's conference on Long Island, which is scheduled to end Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The first keeper program was started on the Hudson River by a
coalition of commercial and recreational fishermen who came
together in 1996 to reclaim the river, Kennedy said. Since its
incorporation in 1984, Hudson Riverkeeper has brought over 150
successful lawsuits against river polluters.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery of the Hudson inspired similar keeper groups from
Cook Inlet in Alaska to the St. John's River in Florida, and from
San Diego Bay in California to Casco Bay in Maine. Kennedy said he
christened the 35th riverkeeper and the first Canadian keeper
program a week ago on the Petitcodiac River in New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, the keepers, buoyed by encouragement from a
rock-and-roll legend, were back at work at the Southampton campus
absorbing the finer points of legal standing in a court of law from
a lecture by Karl S. Coplan, a lawyer with the Pace Environmental
Litigation Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the Congress has said in the Clean Water Act that
any person can sue, the courts are now saying there are
limitations,'' Coplan said. ``The courts are now saying you have to
show an actual injury that you can point to and perceive. It may be
true that a plant may be putting pollution in water and breaking
the law, but when you get to court you have to point to something
tangible that proves the water has been affected.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted a ruling June 2 by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Columbia, S.C., in a lawsuit brought by the Friends of
the Earth, a citizens environmental group, on behalf of the
operators of a canoe trip company. The lawsuit was filed against
the Gaston Copper Recycling Corporation, which sits aside Lake
Watson in Gaston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that the plaintiffs had no standing because they
failed to prove that the canoe business suffered because the
recycling plant had once discharged lead and copper into the lake.
The canoe company argued it could sell more trips if the water did
not have a history of pollution. The court said this was not good
enough, Coplan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get standing, the courts are insisting that we get very
personal and specific about how we are affected by pollution, and
this can be tough to litigate,'' he told the keepers.

 DAY-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Before he or she arrives, you ponder the sacrifices you
will make, whether you're ready for the changes in lifestyle some
say are inevitable. Yet at birth, something amazing happens: Your
heart and soul become linked, and the little one determines the
state of both. So much so that her smile makes you feel as if you
will live forever, his sadness spurns dark depression, her
curiosity sheds new light on the dullness around you.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, you realize that of all the things you ask of The
Creator, children are the greatest answer. And, of all the things a
child asks of you, the greatest gift you render is your presence.
Time to use your ams as a security blanket. Time to be a hero. A
cheerleader. A chauffeur. A coach. A compass. A friend.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of pondering how much time spent with your child (or
children) causes sacrifices in the rest of your world, you consider
the inverse. For there is only one first step, one first day of
school, and only so many piano recitals and Little League games.
The only memory more firmly etched than that of being there is that
of wishing you had been.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sunday is Father's Day, and Red Sox pitcher Bret Saberhagen, a
father of three, has to work. There is something unjust about that.
Perhaps some fathers don't think so. In fact, some dads might be
present at Fenway for Sunday's Sox-Rangers game because of a gift
from their offspring, an outdoor alternative to soap-on-a-rope.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine, except that plenty of those dads work 9-to-5
shifts. They see their children every day. Saberhagen is a
professional baseball player, one whose occupation makes him as
stationary as a deer in hunting season.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday is Father's Day. It is bad enough Saberhagen and other
Red Sox dads cannot always be there to enjoy their childrens'
proudest moments. They have to make amends for missing their own
designated day in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost seems like you're a part-time dad at times,'' said
Saberhagen, whose three children, Drew (13), Brittany (12), and
Dalton (7), live in California with his ex-wife, Janeane. ``The mom
has to have two roles, being mom and dad, the disciplinarian and
the one who gives them the pat on the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew was born the day before the seventh game of the 1985 World
Series, as Saberhagen and the Kansas City Royals met the St. Louis
Cardinals. Both he and Dalton play baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get a chance to see too many (of his children's)
baseball games,'' said Saberhagen. ``I don't get a chance to see
piano recitals. So you see a lot of videotape. The good thing is
that you get four months during the offseason where you don't have
days where you have to be anyplace so it makes up for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once baseball is all over and done with, too, you're going to
have a lot of time. But unfortunately you miss a lot of their
childhood growing up. And as anybody knows, with kids it seems like
they grow up awfully quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen empathizes with fellow Red Sox pitcher Mark Portugal,
who announced his retirement in early June after 18 1/2 years of
pro ball to spend more time with his kids, who also live with his
ex-wife. He changed his mind a few days later and returned to the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Both say that for a professional athlete, being away from family
is something you put up with but never fully adjust to.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I spent Father's Day with them was two years ago
in Philadelphia,'' said Portugal. ``I had surgery on my knee and I
came back to Rhode Island right after surgery, so I was home for
Father's Day. Prior to that, I don't remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal's move is far from unusual. Many pro athletes/fathers
become so bothered by the time away from their kids that they do
something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Often their solutions are temporary: The Celtics' Kevin McHale
once skipped a Christmas Eve flight to New York for a Christmas
afternoon game with the New York Knicks so he could spend Christmas
Eve with his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed to watch my kids open presents (Christmas Eve) and
then I caught a flight out the next morning,'' said McHale, who has
five children. ``The coaching staff was upset, but later on Red
Auerbach came up to me and said, `Aww, you did the right thing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Often the solutions are permanent. Former Bruins player Dave
Poulin walked away from the game in 1995, when he could have played
at least another season, and subsequently became hockey coach at
Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   He has three daughters, including 12-year-old twins who were
born so prematurely they had to spend three months in intensive
care. He was in training camp at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, because you don't realize it early on in your
career (how much you sacrifice),'' said Poulin. ``It's like any
other job; you realize that in order to be successful, you have to
make sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play golf with doctors, and they'll tell you they've
sometimes missed 8-12 years of their children's lives, from medical
school to residences to practices. They don't know about music or
movies or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why Red Sox outfielder Darren Lewis said Portugal's
decision is one most every athlete/father faces before his playing
days are over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if it hasn't come to the point where you are asked to
leave,'' he said, ``there might be a time where you're like Kirk
Gibson, who said, `I'm retiring to my family.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lewis relishes things some fathers who work 9 to 5 take for
granted. Making breakfast for his son, 5-year-old Austin. Driving
him to school. Often when they're en route, Austin points to
certain objects along the road and asks, ``Daddy, what's that?'' or
asks the meaning of certain words in songs heard over the radio.
</P>
<P>
   Those moments are treats for Lewis. He tries to drive his son to
school at least twice a week, but often it's difficult because he
arrives home so late from the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he makes the effort, knowing full well that once those
moments are gone, they're gone for good.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was not there when Austin took his first steps. The
youngster was crawling when dad, then playing for the San Francisco
Giants, embarked on an extensive road trip. When Lewis returned,
Austin had already gotten the hang of one foot before the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came home, and the flight got in kind of late,'' said Lewis.
``My mom and dad were over, and I was talking, probably about
baseball. And my mom said, `Darren look.' And I looked over, and
there he was, running across the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough because sometimes you feel like you're not
contributing as much as you would like to, and it's not by choice.
It's tough not having the daily contact with (Austin) like the
average father who works 9 to 5 has.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin was born in 1994, the year of the baseball strike, so
Darren got to spend a portion of the summer with him. He said his
son is at the age now where he understands the nature of pro
baseball. And despite the downside, there are advantages to having
a father who plays ball.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal said his children enjoy the celebrity of having a
father in the major leagues. McHale said he played a final year
with the Celtics because his sons pleaded for one more year of
being the team's ball boys and getting into games free.
</P>
<P>
   The financial aspect doesn't hurt, either.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, children learn to make the adjustment. ``I
think they realize (dad won't be home often) as soon as they're
able to walk and start hanging out with dad out in the yard or
whatever,'' said Portugal. ``They say, `Mommy where's dad?' and she
says, `Daddy had to go to work. He'll be back.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job requires us to travel and there's no getting around
it. After a while they accept it as part of their lives; they know
it's going to happen and there's nothing they're going to do to
change it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes having children during a key point of a season can be
a blessing in disguise. Saberhagen said his son's being born during
the World Series took the pressure off the games (he left the
Series to witness the birth of his son). ``Plenty of people still
ask about him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the more time you spend with your kids during the
offseason, the more you miss them during the season. ``I went
through a divorce, and that makes it even tougher,'' said
Saberhagen. ``They live in California. They come out four different
times during the season, and we're usually in California two
different times. We try to make up a lot of times during the
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there was a time during the divorce that was kind of ugly,
where I pretty much gave her everything and I came to a point where
I was coming back from surgery and I said, `It's kind of nice being
home, and I get a chance to see the kids a little bit more. If we
can't come to a reasonable agreement between her and I, I won't be
playing anymore.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids weren't really happy about that. They really wanted
to see dad play some more if it was possible. It's tough. You miss
a lot. You miss an awful lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen smiles when he considers what it will be like when
his playing days are over, when he can do all the things he's
wanted to do the last 17 years while playing professionally. Until
then, he doesn't spend time mired in regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have three great kids who are well-behaved,'' said
Saberhagen. ``They get great grades in school. My oldest is going
to finish with honors this year. It would have been nice to be
around 9 to 5.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Poulin is among many who have taken an added interest in this
weekend's US Open golf tournament because of Phil Mickelson, whose
wife Amy is due June 30 with their first child (a girl). There was
speculation that he would not play in the Open.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson is one shot out of the lead at Pinehurst, N.C., but
ready to leave if he gets a call. ``It's not worth a tournament,''
he said. ``This is the most important thing as far as our family is
concerned. I would be very disappointed if she were to go in labor
and not call me.''
</P>
<P>
   Some might say that Mickelson's conviction is a far cry from
that of years past, when fathers assumed the role of breadwinner
and were not expected to play a huge role in the day-to-day events
of their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the role of the father has increased tremendously over
the last 15-20 years,'' said Poulin. ``You've seen an increase of
fathers in the birthing room to fathers being there for the primary
responsibilities of fatherhood.''
</P>
<P>
   McHale, now vice president of basketball operations for the
Minnesota Timberwolves, said he now hears current players voicing
the same parental concerns he did when he was a Celtic. ``Oh yeah,
especially as guys get older,'' he said. ``With younger players,
you don't get it as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as you get older you realize you really are missing out on
some things. It gets harder and they're a little more demanding.
They keep growing and it's like, man, they're 12, 15 now, soon
they'll be going off to college, and you start becoming aware of
what you've missed.''

'TIS THE DRAFT SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With only 10 shopping days left before the NBA Draft lands on
us, an over-aged kid holding the first pick remains perched on
Santa's knee.
</P>
<P>
   (Skit warning.)
</P>
<P>
   SANTA: Hurry up and tell me whatcha want already. The over-sized
kid from Vancouver's flipping me the bird.
</P>
<P>
   KID: Aw, the kid from Vancouver doesn't know what he wants
either. By the way, that cheesy beard can't fool me ... I know
you're commissioner David Stern.
</P>
<P>
   SANTA: Well, since Jordan abandoned us, I thought it might be
wise to have another income.
</P>
<P>
   KID: Amen, Santa.
</P>
<P>
   (Skit over.)
</P>
<P>
   So who's the over-aged kid?
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Krause is the name, attempting to bamboozle other NBA
personnel executives for the betterment of the Chicago Bulls is the
game. Jerry, you may have heard, is the rascal blamed for huffing,
puffing and blowing Phil Jackson out of the Windy City.
</P>
<P>
   His general popularity is somewhat minimized, because he appears
to be a candidate for the kind of face-lift that could attract a
hernia. Among his NBA peers, he's the guy wearing eight watches on
his arm.
</P>
<P>
   He also is the guy who thought Phil
</P>
<P>
   Jackson would be a dandy coach for the Chicago Bulls. Hurts,
doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Krause also realizes the first overall draft pick he
earned by casting a staggeringly awful 1999 Bulls team has been
sabotaged by timing. Believe it. He wouldn't mind trading it to
Toronto for a lower lottery pick and Raptors swingman Tracy
McGrady, but Raptors GM Glen Grunwald realizes McGrady still may be
a better prospect than anyone in this months's draft.
</P>
<P>
   History will have its say, but the 1999 draft-lottery candidates
offer more question marks than a ``Jeopardy'' transcript.
</P>
<P>
   There is not one factory-installed, Nike-sponsored messiah in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   No, the two alleged candidates for No.1 are Maryland's Steve
Francis a 6-foot-2 acrobat with point-guard skills that may be
repressed by the insensitivity of a shooting guard and reluctant
Rhode Island deserter Lamar Odom.
</P>
<P>
   Odom is a 6-9 southpaw who's been defined as the millennial
edition of Earvin Johnson and, for once, the comparison holds
water. Nah, really? Well, like the retirement-model Magic, the kid
doesn't seem to know if he wants to step into the NBA spotlight or
stay put. Since the end of his college season, we've been tripped
by frequent resets on this versatile small forward's Odom-eter. He
could be the league's first come-and-go-to guy.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, the school declared it would not file an appeal to
restore Odom's NCAA eligibility, leaving him with little
alternative beyond making $3 million or so in the NBA next season.
</P>
<P>
   Although his actions certainly smell like Bull, will they cause
the otherwise well-intentioned Odom to slide a spot or two down the
selection board? One GM suggested that overlooking him could be as
catastrophic as the NFL's fear of drafting Randy Moss.
</P>
<P>
   However, unlike Moss, the only laws Odom has broken involve
those of unwritten NBA protocol. He skipped the pre-draft camp
measuring stick in Chicago, and missed private workouts for the
Bulls and Hornets. He had been scheduled to dance for the Clippers
on Monday, but they haven't exactly started the music.
</P>
<P>
   All of this means the 1999 NBA Draft offers more trepidation and
uncertainty than the front porch at the end of a first date.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, there's always more.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend in Chicago, Elton Brand the taped crusader from
Duke was measured at 6-8. Without shoes. His agent is David Falk,
so Brand won't be shoeless much longer. Is checking in at 6-8
important? Boy howdy yes. See, before this intriguing measurement,
Brand was believed to be, oh, 6-7 assuming the requisite callouses
on his feet. That would have rendered him altitude-challenged as a
candidate for the job of NBA power forward.
</P>
<P>
   NBA personnel types had labeled him more suspect than prospect.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Chicago measurement'' could push Brand back into the top
three, which might be good news for the Clippers, who had been
worried that point-guard favorite Baron Davis of UCLA will be a
goner by then.
</P>
<P>
   The Charlotte Hornets, another franchise with rumored
point-guard fever and previous reservations vis-a-vis Brand, is
picking third. Vancouver, with no power in its forwards, is second.
</P>
<P>
   Is that all? Hell, no.
</P>
<P>
   According to more than two and less than 20 NBA personnel
hounds, Davis' famous left knee continues to make everyone except
Davis and power agent Arn Tellem nervous. The knee was checked out
in Chicago, where normal rehab progress was noted, but absolute
blessings for a trouble-free career were not given.
</P>
<P>
   This could be little more than self-preservation by doctors, or
it may be pre-draft scare tactics.
</P>
<P>
   We hired a fortune teller to get a better handle on June 30, but
she said the entire evening will be up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   MAGGETTE UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   After last week's cameo workout in Chicago, the Corey Maggette
Road Show came west.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-Duke grasshopper worked out in Vancouver on Thursday
morning, did Seattle the same afternoon, and dined with the
Clippers in L.A. that night.
</P>
<P>
   He worked out for the Clips on Friday morning at USC's Lyon
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you haven't been through it,'' Maggette said of the
audition process, ``there's no way you can mentally prepare. But I
think these workouts have been going well.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite dragging a slight groin pull into the Clipper test, the
6-6 small forward (tip to future coach: don't be silly and put him
at guard, like Philly did with Jerry Stackhouse) demonstrated
quicker defensive reactions than a husband who forgot to tell his
wife he'd be home a bit late.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the release on his jumper looks as smooth as your
first beer tasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do need to improve the technique on my jump shot and work on
my ballhandling,'' said Maggette, who was a baseline wonder at
Chicago's Fenwick High just 15 months ago. ``But I think I've
already come a long way since leaving Duke.''
</P>
<P>
   After a season with the powerhouse Blue Devils, would playing
for the Clippers bother him?
</P>
<P>
   Maggette demonstrated that one year at Duke provided enough
schooling for the lottery X-factor to issue the right answer. ``Not
at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Would picking an inexperienced (but splendidly athletic) small
forward at No.4 bother the Clippers? Probably.
</P>
<P>
   THE BULL MARKET
</P>
<P>
   Toni Kukoc, the last Bull, has one year remaining on his
contract and has been shopped by Krause to teams with high lottery
picks. Acquiring Kukoc means living with the threat that he'll go
back to Europe when his contract expires. Krause also has miles of
cap room, but may save most of it for the free-agent class of 2000.
One target for the class o' '99 may be 20-year-old, college-dodger
Jermaine O'Neal, a lively 6-11 forward who's on the last fumes of
his three-year deal in Portland. The Blazers realize O'Neal is on
the verge of goodness, but if Rasheed Wallace isn't moved, O'Neal
realizes he still may be on the verge of more time on the pine.
</P>
<P>
   SHOT-CLOCK VIOLATIONSThe Minnesota Timberwolves have put center
Dean Garrett and Laker alum Anthony Peeler on the market to woo
backboard help for Kevin Garnett . ... Chicago pre-draft camp
busters include New Mexico power forward Kenny Thomas and Kentucky
center Jamal Magloire, who has until Wednesday to hustle back to
Lexington where he probably belongs. Pre-draft camp surprises
include George Mason point guard Jason Miskiri and 6-10 Taymon
Domzalski, a strong and athletic power-forward prospect who died on
the vine at Duke while Coach Mike Krzyzewski was proving Chris
Burgess has little inside game (so far). ... Speaking of
Krzyzewski, will losing Brand, Maggette and sophomore point guard
William Avery lead to the nickname ``Coach Y2K?''

WILLIAMS GIVING SAINTS, FANS NEW INCENTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Ricky Williams has yet to gain a yard in the NFL, but
according to Saints president Bill Kuharich, he's already become a
cult hero in the Big Easy because he did what few professional
athletes do. He gambled on himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans here already love the guy because of what he did,''
Kuharich said recently. ``Ricky signed a contract where the better
he plays the more he gets paid. The fans love that because that's
how it should be. That's how it is in their lives. They don't get
paid if they don't produce, and Ricky Williams is saying that's how
he wants it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes he's a great player and if he is, he's going to
become one of the highest-paid running backs in football. That was
good enough for him. Before he signed the deal I asked him if he
was happy. He said he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Rival agents say the incentive-laden eight-year deal Williams
signed was a huge mistake that could cost him millions. However,
because many of those incentives are so high, he will, in fact,
have to be one of the game's greatest runners to earn the money,
and even if he is, he could still miss out on much of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky doesn't care what anyone else has to say,'' Kuharich
said. ``He's happy and he's confident in himself and in us.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously so, but many rival agents point out many things can
happen from signed contract to fully-funded stock portfolio, and
the sad fate of Patriot running back Robert Edwards is ample proof
of that. Yet Williams believes he will collect all or nearly all of
his potential $68.5 million contract rather than the minimum $11.1
million if things work out as he and the Saints plan.
</P>
<P>
   What Williams ended up with was an $8.84 million signing bonus,
of which he collected $3.6 million May 14. He'll collect another
$3.6 million May 14, 2000, and the remaining $1.6 million Nov. 14,
2000. There are various scenarios by which Williams might have to
refund some of that bonus if he is not still playing for the Saints
voluntarily or because of violations of NFL rules.
</P>
<P>
   But the real kickers are escalator clauses based on the first
four years of his production and 26 incentive clauses worth $50,000
each. Williams is able to earn only 10 of those a year (there is a
$500,000 cap on possible incentives per season) but the escalator
clauses based on his beating three of four numbers put up by
Denver's Terrell Davis in his first four seasons could skyrocket
Williams's salary if he runs the way he did while winning the
Heisman Trophy at Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the particulars.
</P>
<P>
   Between 2000 and 2002, if Williams rushes for 1,600 yards, he
earns $1 million in salary the next season. If he rushes for 1,800
yards, it's $1.5 million. If he hits the magic 2,000-yard mark, he
earns $2 million the next season. If he gets to 2,100 it means an
additional $2.5 million in salary, and if he reaches 2,105 yards,
he earns a $3 million salary the following season.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, his salary in years 2003-05 will depend on his
acheiving three of four goals: rushing for a total of 6,413 yards,
producing 7,594 total yards, averaging 4.8 yards a carry, or
scoring 366 points. These numbers would match Davis's production in
his first four seasons with the Broncos, who won two Super Bowl
titles during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   What this means is that Williams will earn only $175,000 in
salary this year (on top of his $3.6 million share of his signing
bonus), but next year he could earn as much as $3.5 million against
a minimum salary of $250,000. In 2001, his potential earnings range
from $325,000 to $3.5 million, in 2002 $350,000 to $3.5 million,
2003 $375,000 to $8.6 million (now there's a raise for you), 2004
$400,000 to $11.03 million, 2005 $400,000 to $13.46 million and
2006 $400,000 to a potential $15.89 million.
</P>
<P>
   The agents say that the way his contract is structured, Williams
could be one of the league's best backs and still miss the
incentives that would swell his salary, pointing out that if he
rushed for 1,599 yards, averaged 4.4 yards a carry and scored 11
touchdowns in three of his first four seasons he would not trigger
the escalator clauses.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Williams is on the Saints' books to make his minimum
salary every year if he doesn't hit his escalator clauses or his
incentives. Williams understands this, but he also understands he
can run, and if he's right, he'll run all the way to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the greatest runner in college football history,''
Kuharich said. ``He believes he can do the same thing in the NFL.
We do, too. That's why we gave up so much to get him. He's betting
on himself and we're betting on him, and the fans in New Orleans
love him for it.''

   Mike Ditka was on WEEI recently talking about life, the Saints,
Williams's dreadlocks, and his banning of any jewelry worn by his
players while in uniform. That included the silver stud Williams
wears through his lower lip (ouch!). He wore it in the team's first
minicamp but was told to remove it at the second camp, and the
opening closed within two hours. Now Williams will have to get his
lip pierced again. Or maybe he could take the hint from his lip and
leave well enough alone . . . Speaking of Williams, you can e-mail
him at Dreaded34(at)aol.com . . . Bill Parcells reports 58 of the
59 Jets on his roster completed the full offseason workout program
and the other player did 75 percent of it. That included
quarterback Vinny Testaverde, who flew up to Long Island from
Florida on a private plane each week to get his workouts in without
disrupting his family. When linebacker Bryan Cox was in danger of
coming up short of the required 40 workout days, he stayed an extra
two weeks after the program was to have ended to get them all in.
Even late-signee Scott Zolak, the ex-Patriot backup QB, completed
24 workouts after he signed on . . . Speaking of focusing on your
job, Packer quarterback Brett Favre has decided to cut back on
personal appearances, autograph sessions, and even his Milwaukee TV
and radio show to devote more time to football and family this
season . . . Is this un-American? The NFL has outsourced its
instant replay system to a Toronto-based company, Leitch
Technology. The league will use Leitch's high-speed digital
recording system to instantly record every play this season as well
as all network replays for use in the league's instant replay
challenge system. The NFL sorted through at least a dozen proposals
from various companies before buying 31 Leitch systems, one for
each NFL stadium. Leitch will have its logo prominently displayed
on the monitors in the replay booth and on the sideline monitors
the officials will consult, so every time there is a challenged
call, they'll get a minute of free advertising on national TV _
even though most viewers will have no idea who they are or what
they sell . . . San Antonio Spurs big man David Robinson is
inspiring more than basketball fans these days. Recently, 49ers
All-World receiver Jerry Rice said he finally sees the end of his
career approaching and intends to take a page from Robinson's book
on how to handle it. Rice has promised the 49ers he will not
continue griping about getting the ball more as he did a year ago,
when he got into a public spat with coach Steve Mariucci. Rice
often complained he was not being used properly as the ball more
and more went to younger receivers Terrell Owens and J.J. Stokes.
Upon reflection, Rice says he sees times have changed and so has
his place in the Niners' offense. ``It's hard to step away, but
I've just got to let go,'' Rice said. ``I want to go out feeling
good about my career. Basically, it's coming to an end and I don't
want to go out on a sour note. I'm not going to be able to carry
this team like I used to.'' Rice doesn't have to. Owens led the
club with 14 touchdown catches last year and two weeks ago signed a
$3.5 million tender offer for this year with hopes of negotiating a
long-term deal before the season begins. Stokes also signed a new,
long-term deal for big bucks, so the two of them are clearly the
pass-catching future in the Bay Area. Rice, who may well be the
greatest receiver of all time, seems to have finally accepted this
after fighting it much of last year, and he said that acceptance
came from watching the way Robinson embraced his diminished role in
the Spurs' offense after the arrival of Tim Duncan.

   Shed no tears for former Redskins owner John Kent Cooke, son of
the late owner Jack Kent Cooke. The younger Cooke couldn't muster
up the cash to outbid Daniel Snyder for the team after his father
died, but he stands to collect about $60 million as his share of
the sale and is using some of it to move to Bermuda. Cooke won't be
allowed to work there because he's not a British citizen, but he
also doesn't have to pay taxes. Not a bad trade off. Although Cooke
will still have to pay federal income tax, he beats the District of
Columbia's 9.5 percent income tax, which will save him millions . .
. The Denver Broncos received their new Super Bowl rings at a
recent ceremony at the toney Breckenridge Resort in Colorado
Springs, and they may have needed a Bronco just to carry their new
hunk of jewelry home. The 120-diamond ring was 46 pennyweight and
included Australian orange diamonds that filled the two horses
manes and eyes on the ring. It also included two Lombardi Trophies
on one side and six diamonds on the other to represent the six
Super Bowl appearances by the Broncos. Last year's rings cost
$15,000 each. This year's were closer to $20,000 each. What do you
do with a ring bigger than your finger if your name isn't Dennis
Rodman? . . . The Falcons did something historic last year by
reaching the Super Bowl for the first time. Now they want to do
something else to make history. They want to move their practice
facility into Stone Mountain Park, the most visited state park in
Georgia. The new facility would cost an estimated $10 million and
would be built for the Falcons by a Missouri company that
specializes in theme parks.

SPLENDOR ON THE GRASS AT WIMBLEDON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Monday is not just another day, despite what the
backhanding Scarlett O'Hara used to say. Not around here anyway.
This Monday hasn't happened for 100 years: the first day of the
last Wimbledon of the century.
</P>
<P>
   All right, so, for once, let's lay out the Big W's formal
designation: The Lawn Tennis Championships at the All England Lawn
Tennis &AMP; Croquet Club. A mouthful even for a babbler like Eddie
Andelman. But just-plain Wimbledon suffices anywhere across the
globe, though curiously mispronounced as ``Wimple-ton'' by most
Americans, including several who have won it.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Sampras has got it right after a few misses, while becoming
the resident maestro in weeding the grass of rivals. He and ruling
associate Jana Novotna, granted first and fifth seeds,
respectively, would dearly love to kiss the century goodbye by
winning as two locals, Reggie Doherty and Blanche Bingley Hillyard,
did in 1899.
</P>
<P>
   As the first and foremost fiesta of the fuzzy ball, launched in
1877 in the lawn-proud southwestern London suburb called Wimbledon,
Wimbledon is alone among the four majors in preserving God's own
sod as the mysterious, tricky terrain. The US and Australia,
preferring green only in the color of their pavement, abandoned
grass in 1975 and 1988, respectively. Trusting little that is
embraced by speakers of English, the French have stuck with red, as
in clay and wine, throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Californian Stan Smith, the victor in 1972, muses, ``Grass is
pretty strange to the players now. When I was coming up all the
important tournaments _ except the French and Italian _ were on
grass. But now, for a tournament of this importance to keep this
surface, it's sort of like the Indy 500 being run on a rutted dirt
road. But . . . tradition is pretty strong at Wimbledon.''
</P>
<P>
   So, ladies and gentlemen, start your internal engines, and get
those sneakered wheels moving. It's going to be a bumpy 13-day ride
even though groundskeeper Eddie Seaward's emerald rectangles,
foremost the revered throne room, Centre Court, look innocently
placid and untroubled today.
</P>
<P>
   The house is silent, sunswept. You can hear the birds kibbitzing
amid the decor of plentiful ivy, roses, petunias, and hydrangeas,
and the scent of freshly mowed lawns. Yet dawn will bring thousands
besieging the gates, though patiently lining up in that peculiarly
civilized British way, the vanguard of almost 300,000 patrons for
the fortnight.
</P>
<P>
   As the tempests in rectangles begin, a triangle with Graf,
Agassi, and Sampras at the corners takes shape to hold tremendous
attention. Even though there may not be another championship within
Staffi Graf (she has seven), Pete Sampras, or Andre Agassi, champ
in 1992, they are the story line _ with offshoots in several other
directions, of course.
</P>
<P>
   For the homefolks: Can 1998 semifinalist Tim Henman, a 7-1 shot
with London bookmakers, make the prominent statue of Fred Perry
blink by becoming the first Englishman to triumph since Fred
himself 63 years ago?
</P>
<P>
   For casual observers who judge tennis players by their pictures:
Might the Glitter Girl, 18-year-old Anna Kournikova, semifinalist
in 1997, keep photographers in ecstacy for two weeks as the
big-hitter girl in the winner's circle? At 33-1 she's a terrific
wager.
</P>
<P>
   For the sociology-minded who love a ghetto-to-gravy story: Is
this the moment for Venus Williams, just turned 19, and 5-1 with
the bookies, to make her major breakthrough? (Unfortunately kid
sister Serena, ranked No. 10, has pulled out with the flu.)
</P>
<P>
   For the Down Under-looking and those mindful of the Aussie-US
Davis Cup clash headed for Boston: Will Patrick Rafter, twice US
Open champ, pull himself together at 12-1 to renew his country's
bygone stranglehold on the Big W?
</P>
<P>
   For supporters of the aging and infirm: Has the champ, Novotna,
edging toward 31, recovered enough from an ankle injury in Paris,
to display her splendor on the grass one more time and pay off at
14-1?
</P>
<P>
   For Dutch treat fans: Couldn't 1996 champ Richard Krajicek, the
only man to beat Sampras here over the last six years, crank up his
right elbow again to delight every Heineken sipper and bettor (8-1)
in his homeland?
</P>
<P>
   For ``children should be seen _ and heard'' _ believers: Has the
champ of 1997 and 3-2 favorite Martina Hingis, whose behavorial age
at the French matched her world ranking (1), gotten over her
Parisian petulance?
</P>
<P>
   Still, the compelling trio are the reconstituted Graf and Agassi
(both 4-1) plus the unraveling Sampras. Are Steffi and Andre
writing new acts in their dramas? Can Pete dig himself out of an
avalanche of ``a terrible, disastrous year for me if I don't win
here or the US Open''?
</P>
<P>
   Pete remains No. 1 into a seventh successive year only because
the guys with the opportunity to seize his lottery-winning digit _
Rafter, Carlos Moya, Marcelo Rios, Henman, Greg Rusedski, Petr
Korda, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Krajicek, Mark Philippoussis _ swooned
at the opportunity. Kafelnikov, Moya, and Rios did get there for a
few minutes but found the throne as comfortable as an electric
chair.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, still the prohibitive favorite (11-8) is well aware of
his rendezvous with history, despite the buffeting he's taking in
this his worst season. ``I feel like I'm home again,'' he says. ``I
know the grass, and how to win. Look, I never dreamed I'd win five
times. One more would be great, but it wouldn't be like I didn't
win my share if I lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning would make him the man of the century, edging Laurie
Doherty, a long-vanished Limey (1902-06) and Swede Bjorn Borg
(1976-80) with whom he's lodged at five. He'd also pull abreast of
Aussie Roy Emerson (1961-67) at the male record of 12 major singles
titles.
</P>
<P>
   Two behind the female record of 24, belonging to Margaret Court
(1960-75), Graf is suddenly a contender again after winning the
French, her first major in three years. Also she's two behind
Martina Navratilova's Wimbledon record of nine (1978-90).
</P>
<P>
   But Steffi says, ``I never give it a thought. I'm just happy to
be playing again, out on this wonderful grass. After my knee and
back injuries two years ago, Wimbledon again didn't look
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   After losing to distantly ranked Doug Flach here two years ago
and callow Tommy Haas in 1998, possibilities for Agassi could be
seen maybe only in a cracked crystal ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have written that Paris scenario of mine _ too
crazy,'' grins the improbable champion, who kept rebounding from
near defeat to the only major that had eluded him. ``And if I had
nobody would have bought it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now I'd believe in anything. How about a Sampras-Agassi
all-American final on July 4?''
</P>
<P>
   That's a long tomorrow away, as even Scarlett O'Hara would
agree. But at least Andre's no longer gone with the wind, and Pete
just might hang on in the current gale.

GRANT OUTPOINTS SAVARESE UNANIMOUSLY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ His handlers have anointed Michael Grant the future
heavyweight champion of the world. And he just may be, if he could
somehow manage to start each of his fights in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   It was another slow start for Grant against Lou Savarese before
3,583 at the Theater at Madison Square Garden on Saturday night.
Grant (30-0) tossed away the first couple of rounds like
yesterday's garbage before his interest was piqued. Unfortunately
for Savarese (39-3), Grant began punishing him with well-placed
uppercuts once he got going, and that paved the way for Grant to
score a 10-round unanimous decision. Judges Melvina Lathan and
Steve Weisfeld both scored the fight 98-90, and Judge Joe Dwyer
scored it 97-91.
</P>
<P>
   Lennox Lewis, the World Boxing Council heavyweight champion, was
sitting at ringside, scouting Grant as a future opponent. Lewis
might take heart that Grant gets hit often and is an inviting
target. But Lewis might not like the fact that Grant's jab, when he
decides to use it, lands with the authority of a jackhammer.
</P>
<P>
   Grant tried to finish off Savarese in the final round, throwing
his entire arsenal at him. He managed to score two knockdowns in
the round, but he could not knock out Savarese. On the first
knockdown, Grant landed a barrage of punches that sent Savarese
through the second rope and onto the ring apron. Savarese managed
to climb back into the ring and get to his feet by the count of
seven.
</P>
<P>
   Savarese, who received a cut along the outside of his left eye
from an unintentional head butt in the third round, was no
pushover. He tried to bully Grant and rough him up as best he
could. But Grant proved too powerful, completely controlling the
fight from the third round on.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Savarese was bleeding from the cut over his
eye, one on the bridge of his nose and another at his mouth. It was
testimony to how heavy the 256-pound Lewis's hands are.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the co-featured bout, heavyweight Maurice Harris (15-9-2), of
Newark, pounded out a 10-round unanimous decision against Jeremy
Williams (34-3) of Long Beach, Calif. Harris said he thought he
broke his hand in the third round, but it did not stop him from
battering Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The pounding began in the fourth round when Williams walked into
a big right hand that left him stumbling about the ring. Williams
never recovered and was operating on wobbly legs for the rest of
the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was a last-minute replacement for Hasim Rahman, who
pulled out of the fight on Tuesday with what he said was a
backache. Lathan scored the fight 99-89, Weisfeld scored it 98-90
and Judge Fred Ucci scored it 98-91.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough to close him out, because I wasn't in the best of
shape,'' Harris said. ``I took this fight on four days' notice.''
</P>
<P>
   In his last fight, on the undercard of the Oscar De La Hoya-Oba
Carr welterweight bout in Las Vegas, Nev., last month, Harris
stopped Louis Monaco in a first-round technical knockout.
</P>
<P>
   On the undercard, the welterweight contender Vernon Forrest
(29-0) knocked out Ed Goins (16-13-2) at 2 minutes 57 seconds of
the fourth round. The lightweight contender Vivian Harris (14-0) of
Brooklyn won an eight-round unanimous decision over Damian Brazoban
(12-5) of the Dominican Republic. The welterweight John Molnar
(11-0) of Middletown, N.J., knocked out Claude Staten (4-8) at 1:59
of the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Vaden (28-2), a former junior middleweight world champion,
scored a sixth-round technical knockout of Jorge Luis Vado (16-7-1)
when Vado did not come out of his corner for the seventh round.
Elvir Muriqi (8-0) scored a technical knockout when Thomas Barker
(1-2-1) quit after he was hit with a body shot at 2:03 of the
second round. &QL;

FOOD INDUSTRY SEES MOVIE SNACK BAR AS NEXT FRONTIER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Tired of Junior Mints and popcorn? Don't
worry. Coming soon to a theater near you: buffalo wings,
cappuccino, jalapeno-cheddar pretzels, Creamsicle Candy Twists and
Bavarian cream-filled churros.
</P>
<P>
   With bigger and flashier theater complexes seemingly opening
daily, operators have turned their attention to concession stands
in an effort to distinguish one megaplex from another down the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time of major experimentation with new items in
movie theaters,'' said Susan Cross, spokeswoman for the National
Association of Concessionaires, during the recent two-day Snack Bar
University trade show at the Disneyland Hotel. ``We're trying to
enhance the experience for customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as Michael Kulka, sales director for pretzel maker J&AMP;J Snack
Foods, put it: ``We think people are looking for new kinds of
finger foods.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a natural caution among theater operators who
fear killing the goose that's lays the golden eggs. Concessions
already make an awe-inspiring contribution to the bottom line from
$3 billion in annual sales at U.S. theaters. Wall Street analysts
believe AMC, for example, profits on snack bar sales in the
astronomical range of 82 to 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of return, it's little surprise the chains are
hesitant to make major lineup changes. ``We're constantly testing
new items, but we can't say what they are for competitive
reasons,'' AMC spokeswoman Brenda Nolte said. The chain offers a
standard menu with a few regional variations, such as pretzels in
California and pickles in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an industry where people are pretty tradition-bound
since snack bars work pretty well,'' said Lee Kopulos, chief of
Kansas-based Regal Distributing. ``On the other hand, you really
are starting to see a move toward restaurant-style foods. We've
noticed that operators are having to look at the problem of
customers leaving chicken wings on the theater floor, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   American moviegoers will spend around $7billion on movie tickets
this year and, for many of them, the experience won't be complete
without some kind of snack. Newer megaplex theaters feature the
combination of staggered starting times and massive concession
stands, both aimed at luring customers to the snack bar before they
go into the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``The staples will always be there but customers are starting to
expect more sophisticated menus,'' Cross admitted. ``On the other
hand, you don't want the experience of going to the snack bar to
get unwieldy.''
</P>
<P>
   Popcorn remains the undisputed No. 1 seller, followed by soda
and candy. Milk Duds, Red Vines, Junior Mints, Raisinets and
Goobers are among the top items. Nachos, pretzels, coffee, bottled
water, hot dogs, pizza and self-serve bulk candy occupy a second
tier _ somewhat popular but not pervasive.
</P>
<P>
   But those pitching offbeat items, such as Sheriff Blaylock's
chili, face resistance from theater operators wondering why they
should fix something if it's not broken. The answer, according to
Rick Kellum, vice president at the Texas-based chili company, is
that customers want something better and will pay for the
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're emphasizing that this is real chili, not wannabe chili
like you get at most places,'' Kellum said as he showed off a
temperature controlled dispenser that squirts out a cheese-chili
mix over three ounces of nacho chips. The suggested retail price is
$3.75 to $4.25. ``This tastes so much better than what you buy in
most places.''
</P>
<P>
   A pair of Sheriff Blaylock executives, whose first success came
in Southwestern convenience stores, traveled from Fort Worth to the
Anaheim convention to woo theater owners and persuade other
suppliers to switch over. ``What you're seeing here is the new wave
of how nachos are sold,'' the company president, Terry Awalt,
proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Even more ambitious at the trade show was Vernon-based J&AMP;J Snack
Foods Corp. Nearly a dozen staffers offered new versions of Super
Pretzel, Funnel Cake, Mrs. GoodCookies, Tio PepeChurros, Luigis
Italian ices, Icees and Shape Ups frozen deserts. Sales director
Kulka admits that the challenge of weaning moviegoers away from
popcorn is daunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get so much more for your money from our pretzels than you
do from popcorn, which they have to serve in a bucket to give it
value,'' Kulka said.
</P>
<P>
   J&AMP;J counts the four big Los Angeles chains _ Mann, Edwards, AMC
and Pacific _ as customers and is pitching the idea of selling
fresh-baked goods at snack bars. For example, J&AMP;J's frozen pretzels
are dipped in browning soda, then heated up in small ovens.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition industry's biggest innovators are opening cafes,
usually specializing in desserts and coffees, in theater lobbies to
snag customers before and after shows.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-screen Loews Cineplex in Universal City offers a cafe
with a spectacular view of L.A.'s San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thought is that people don't necessarily want to rush out
of the theater once the movie's over, but you can't really sell
people cake and coffee from the snack bar,'' said Lee Josselyn,
vice president of the Galaxy Theaters chain. ``So we're putting the
cafes in every new project.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rosenberg, president of New Jersey-based Promotion in
Motion and Ferrara Pan, source of the Creamsicle twists, agrees
that in-theater cafes makes sense because Americans increasingly
place more of a premium on spending their time efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theaters have come to realize that they have to have
alternatives for customers, just like supermarkets sell
home-replacement meals,'' he said. ``You want more food items
because you want people there longer.''
</P>
<P>
   But AMC's Nolte said her chain has not adopted the in-theater
restaurant concept. ``We are in the exhibition business,'' she
said. ``Our prototype is to be part of an entertainment-themed
center with places that are in the restaurant business.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, though, is that customers want more options,
according to entertainment analyst Kevin Skislock of Laguna
Research Partners. So it's crucial that theaters diversify, even on
such a basic level as what's available at a snack bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have something different to choose, it makes the
experience of being at the theater much less mundane, even if you
still pick popcorn when you get to the front of the line,'' he
said. ``The fact that people have a choice to buy nachos or
pretzels makes it better, even if they exercise it only 10 percent
of the time. Exercising choice is appealing because if it's not
there, you feel like the snack bar's operated for the theater's
convenience instead of yours.''

STARS WORK (TRIPLE) OVERTIME TO WIN CUP
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ The day before the Dallas Stars won the Stanley
Cup with a goal in triple overtime by Brent Hull, Pat Verbeek was
talking about the dreams of childhood. At 35, Verbeek has played
almost half his life in the National Hockey League without ever
before skating with the big, silver trophy. Like many of his Dallas
teammates, Verbeek is a scarred old pro. And, like many veteran
athletes, his outlook is part man and part boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the things that you always enjoyed when you are
out on your pond or out on your backyard rink,'' Verbeek said.
``You always enjoyed doing this, just being on the ice and playing
the game and loving to play the game. And now we are just really
grown-up kids right now and we are just trying to achieve the same
thing we did as kids in our dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night was not a dream, but at times it seemed surreal.
It was a 2-1 victory over the Buffalo Sabres, the fourth for the
Stars in six playoff games that were passionate and closely
contested. It was the first cup for the Stars, who began their
history as an expansion team in Minnesota in 1967 and moved to
Texas six seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   The winning goal was scored by Hull on a rebound at 14 minutes
51 seconds of the third overtime period. He knocked the puck past a
sprawled Dominik Hasek, the Sabres' star goalie, at 1:30 a.m.
Sunday to end a game that took more than five hours to play. Jere
Lehtinen and Mike Modano got the assists.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second-longest game in the history of the Stanley Cup
finals, falling just 22 second short of the longest finals games
ever; that one ended at 15:13 of triple overtime in 1990 when
Edmonton defeated Boston, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Conn Smythe trophy for most valuable player in the
post-season was won by the Stars' Joe Nieuwendyk.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres had 54 shots on goal and the Stars had 50.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, son of the Hall of Famer Bobby Hull, missed almost two
games of this series with what was called a groin injury. Playing
under obvious limitations, he passed up several shooting
opportunities earlier in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Jere Lehtinen scored in the first period for Dallas, and Stu
Barnes scored in the second for Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were the first team since the 1994 Rangers to win both
the regular-season championship and the Stanley Cup. Victory came
with a price. Many of the Stars played with injuries, including top
scorers like Mike Modano and Hull. Modano discussed why so many
athletes break into tears in such moments of triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you have been pushed to the limit,'' he said. ``Pushed
to the edge. It does not get any more emotionally or physically
draining than this run. And I think this is where you see a lot of
guys just break down when it is all done.''
</P>
<P>
   The winning goal ended a match of excruciating tension and tight
checking. Of the six games between these teams, three have ended
with scores of 2-1. In six games, the two teams have combined for
22 goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres had an 11-5 edge in first-period shots and had the
best scoring chances in the first 20 minutes. But the Stars held a
1-0 lead at the first intermission on a goal of the sort that
goalie Dominik Hasek does not usually allow. It was scored at 8:09
by Lehtinen, whose short shot got past Hasek between the post and
his stick. It was set up by Modano, who carried the puck over the
blue line and took a hit to make a play. Lehtinen scored despite
being checked by two Sabres. Modano entered the game with 5 points
this series, the most of any player, all of them assists. He also
had 21 points in the playoffs, tied with Nieuwendyk for the team
lead.
</P>
<P>
   After dominating the second period, Buffalo tied it, 1-1, on a
goal by Barnes shortly before the second intermission. Barnes, who
finished a rush by shooting from the right-wing circle over a
sliding Craig Ludwig, beat Belfour on the far side at 18:21.
</P>
<P>
   The contrasting technical styles were interesting. Choosing to
protect their early lead, the Stars fell back into the neutral-zone
trap and iced the puck frequently. The Sabres countered with speed
through the neutral zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars rarely threatened in the second session, although
Dallas defenseman Sergei Zubov had two great chances on a power
play, one a low wrist shot after a rink-length rush, the other a
high slap shot. At the other end, Buffalo's Aleksei Zhitnik clanged
a post.
</P>
<P>
   The third period was tense and edgy. Belfour was knocked down
twice, first when he was tripped by Miroslav Satan, later when
Vaclav Varada crashed into him. Belfour punched Varada and later
complained to the officials while the crowd roared. Zubov, a Ranger
on the 1994 cup team, played well and extensively, setting up
scoring chances at one end and breaking them up at the other.  &QL;

DESPITE POLITICAL GAINS BY WOMEN, MEN GET BIGGEST PAYCHECKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID PARRISH  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Women may run the state Capitol, but men still pull in the
biggest paychecks in Arizona government.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 34 highest-paid state employees there are no women,
and just five make the top 100.
</P>
<P>
   While women form more than half of the workforce within the
state agencies and universities, they have but 15 percent of the
nearly 800 jobs that pay $100,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics and other minorities fare about the same. Although 30
percent of the state's population are minorities, they compose only
14 percent of those paid $100,000 or more, according to a state
workforce review by &UR; ``The Arizona Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   At stake is not just money, but equity issues and bringing
diversity of backgrounds to the uppermost decision-making
positions.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kathryn L. Reed, a professor at the University of Arizona's
College of Medicine, is the highest-paid woman in state government,
drawing an annual salary of $201,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assumption has been that women would be there by now, but
they are not,'' Reed said. ``There are reasons, but there are
barriers.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the state's 800 six-figure jobs are held by key
non-elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   They include influential university deans and professors who
shape future leaders, as well as agency department heads and
deputies who establish policies affecting people statewide. Also
among them are senior staff members in both the Governor's Office
and the Legislature who craft Arizona's laws and determine where
tax dollars will be spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diversity is important because we serve a diverse
population,'' said John Clayton, newly appointed director of the
Department of Economic Security and the only African-American to
head a state agency. ``We have to know the people that we serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout state government, from clerks to Gov. Jane Hull,
there is general agreement that women and minorities are
underrepresented in the highest echelon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see both of those higher,'' Hull said.
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns seemed out of place last Jan. 4 as she and four
other women made national news when they were sworn into the top
five positions in state government.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Fab Five,'' as they were called, projected an image that
Arizona was on the cutting edge when it came to gender equality.
</P>
<P>
   So why, overwhelmingly, are White males in state government
getting the big paychecks?
</P>
<P>
   Hull and other state officials said the state is making progress
but acknowledged that there is still a significant way to go. Women
and minorities are being hired in increasing numbers, they said.
Those women will have to work their way up the ladder to the upper
echelon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take time,'' Hull said.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office in September 1997, she has appointed four
women to key state positions, including Mary Peters, the first
female director of the Arizona Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made 16 judicial appointments _ three Hispanics and three
women,'' Hull said. ``You have to continue to reach out and
continue to give people a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hispanics make &UR; up more than 20 percent of Arizona's
population, they hold 5 percent of the jobs paying a six-figure
salary at the University of Arizona and 6 percent among workers in
state agencies and at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State University and Northern Arizona University refused
to release ethnic background information on their highest-paid
employees, even without names attached, citing privacy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the demographics of the state government's nearly
63,000 employees reflect Arizona's population, both in gender and
ethnic background. But the higher up the job, the less likely a
woman or a minority holds the position.
</P>
<P>
   Women professors at the medical school who are paid $100,000 or
more annually still earn, on average, $34,500 less than their male
counterparts. More than 90 percent of UA full professors are White.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised that we don't have more than 10 percent minority
professors,'' said UA President Peter W. Likins, who, at $195,000
annually, is tied for 44th on the pay list.
</P>
<P>
   Many reasons were cited for the pay disparities in interviews
with more than two dozen employees throughout the ranks of state
government. Rarely was intentional discrimination mentioned as the
cause for the disparity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a conspiracy or malice in male behavior,'' Likins
said. ``Why do we still find ourselves not advancing women to
leadership positions? My own guess is human beings are very slow to
accept change.''
</P>
<P>
   State employees cited two major reasons for the disparity: the
``mommy track'' that women sometimes are on, and White male
executives not looking beyond their friends when they hire or
promote.
</P>
<P>
   ``You appoint people you feel comfortable with, who hold your
own views,'' said Deborah Brouhard, chairwoman of the Commission on
the Status of Women at ASU.
</P>
<P>
   Because White males dominate the top positions and often promote
or hire other White males, the status quo is maintained, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not be a conscious decision; it's a comfortable
decision,'' Brouhard said.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton said he was hired 16 months ago as deputy director at
the Department of Economic Security because then-Director Linda
Blessing did a nationwide search, seeking the most qualified
person.
</P>
<P>
   A similar search for the best candidate would over time increase
the number of minorities and women in elite positions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must look at quality first, then diversity,'' Clayton
said. ``I'd be offended with a policy that allowed people to just
come in strictly on race.''
</P>
<P>
   At $115,000, Clayton is ranked 454th on the state's payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Women throughout the ranks of state government said that
building a career often takes second place to raising children.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman sometimes makes choices that make it less likely they
will get one of those top jobs,'' said Heather E. Campbell, an ASU
assistant professor in the School of Public Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   When women gravitate to a job that allows them to spend more
time with their children, that may limit the extra time needed to
push a career forward, Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Meeks, an accountant at the Department of Administration,
said that over the past 14 years she had to sacrifice career plans
while she raised her child and tried to squeeze in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got my bachelor's degree. I took one course per
semester. It took almost 14 years to do it,'' Meeks said. ``I see
men as old as I am in much higher positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeks plans to become a certified public accountant shortly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to move up to the managerial level,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even those women who have reached significant positions in
government said it was not easy to have both a career and a family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have made a lot of conscious decisions that have hurt my
career, but I wanted to choose my family,'' said Margie A.
Emmermann, a Hispanic who was appointed by Hull as the state's
policy advisor for Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think women feel more of a responsibility to hold the
family together,'' Emmermann said.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, an obstetrician and gynecologist at the University of
Arizona's medical school, said the long hours necessary in the
highest positions at the university often conflict with the needs
of family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are looking for more of a balance; they do care how
their family lives are going,'' Reed said. ``I know women who have
said, `I can't turn away from my family to give what it takes to
succeed in academic medicine.' ''
</P>
<P>
   State institutions may have to rethink the demands they place on
their executives at the expense of families, Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   At the UA College of Medicine, Reed is one of only a handful of
women who hold the rank of full professor; men account for 92
percent of those faculty.
</P>
<P>
   This is in contrast to the students in the medical college,
where half are women.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of women doctors increases, so will the number of
women full medical school professors, said Dr. James Dalen, dean of
the College of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Among the associate professors in the medical college, 18
percent are women. Women make up 36 percent of assistant
professors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in 10 years we will see a significant increase,''
Dalen said of female full professors at the College of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, about 7 percent of doctors nationwide were
women. Today, women make up about 21 percent of physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in medical school there was one woman in my
class,'' added Dalen, who is 17th on the pay list at $264,450
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the pay disparity between men and women
at the medical school can be traced back to the types of medicine
that women choose to practice, Dalen said.
</P>
<P>
   Fees from patients generate much of a professor's pay at the
medical school. Surgeons generate the most income, and the
overwhelming number of surgeons are men, Dalen said.
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons also put in the longest hours at the medical school,
which Reed said makes that specialty less attractive to some women.
</P>
<P>
   To address the disparity of women in the top ranks, UA is
developing a study to determine if women are being discriminated
against, and, if so, then how, President Likins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus right now is on gender bias, but the lessons are
transferable (to minorities),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said that sometimes women can contribute to the disparity
in pay or promotions by not speaking up for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four to five years ago, I did bring up (that) there was a
discrepancy with my salary and the men who did the same work,''
Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   She gave university officials a choice: Raise her salary or
lower the men's.
</P>
<P>
   ``So they raised my salary,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That style of aggressive career card play was alien to her, Reed
said, as it is to many other women. Often women assume that good
work will be rewarded, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to be taught by my business friend, you have to ask for
a raise,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Reed is now working with College of Medicine administrators to
establish a program where women professors at the medical school
will receive leadership training to help them progress up the
academic ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love for us to be gender- or ethnic-blind,'' Reed
said. ``I wish it would happen overnight, but I know there are
still barriers.'' &QL;

DODGERS WIN WITH PLAN B
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Turns out the Los Angeles Dodgers really do have
this nifty little team, it was just on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   With a lineup that would look familiar during a spring training
road game, the Dodgers pushed the Philadelphia Phillies around on a
hazy Saturday afternoon for an 8-1 victory before a Dodger Stadium
crowd of 32,315.
</P>
<P>
   For one day, all things went right. Runners were advanced, plays
were made, mistakes by the opponent were taken advantage of, hits
fell and fell, and Darren Dreifort made like the dominating
right-hander everyone keeps waiting for.
</P>
<P>
   A Dodgers squad that had lost six of its past seven and been
feeble at the plate punched out 13 hits on the way to a three-run
third and a five-run fifth. As though there were nothing to it.
Only most of the big hits came from the likes of Todd
Hollandsworth, just seconds off the disabled list; Craig Counsell,
making his first start as a Dodger; Tripp Cromer, Dave Hansen,
Angel Pena and Trenidad Hubbard. Not the guys the $84-million
Dodgers normally push in their marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Young dubbed them the ``rescue team.'' Inspired part by
nagging injuries and part by desperation, Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson shook things up, waited to see how they fell, and then
basked in the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``They scored more runs than I think I've seen in a month,''
Johnson said. ``That should take some heat off the regulars, or put
some pressure on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson probably wouldn't be too upset if the regulars did feel
some pressure. Four of the regulars who sat _ Eric Karros, Devon
White, Jose Vizcaino and Young _ were a combined 9 for 51 (.176)
during the opening four games of the homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Vizcaino has a sore hamstring, White a sore groin, Young a sore
ankle and Gary Sheffield a sore knee. Fortunately, they were not
sorely missed. Hubbard continued his recent hot play (10 hits in
his past 23 at-bats) with three hits; Hollandsworth struck the
day's biggest blow with a two-run, two-out double in the third;
Cromer singled in two and Counsell added two hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously this won't be the team to take us forth, but who
knows, it might be the team to spark us,'' Hubbard said.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort was out of the rotation for one day last week, or at
least until the Carlos Perez-inspired demise of the bench water
cooler. Dreifort's whole season has been a struggle. He was tied
for second in the NL in wild pitches (eight) and fourth in walks
(46), and had seen his ERA swell to 6.42. But Saturday, he made
like someone who had undergone an amazing transformation.
</P>
<P>
   For three innings, he did not allow a hit. Through five, he had
allowed only two. He finally gave up a run in the sixth on a Ron
Gant single and Scott Rolen double, but when he left after 62/3
innings, he had surrendered only six hits, struck out five and
walked only two.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a pretty good statement for why he deserves to
start,'' Johnson said. ``He actually pitched. He didn't overthrow.
He actually threw quite a few changeups and stayed in a nice
rhythm. That was a good pitching performance.''
</P>
<P>
   For a team hungry for positive news, it made for a good day. The
Phillies didn't help their cause, giving right-hander Robert Person
_ who began the year as Toronto's closer _ just his third start of
the year. After he surrendered three runs (one earned) in four
innings, right-hander Mike Grace took over and the game got out of
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort singled off the wall, Counsell dropped a hit and
Hubbard's RBI single to center was overrun by Doug Glanville for an
error. Raul Mondesi doubled off Rolen's glove at third to score two
and Grace hit Adrian Beltre and Hansen with pitches before getting
pulled. Cromer singled in two off right-hander Amaury Telemaco, and
the Rescue Rangers had the Dodgers cruising.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mills got the only batter he faced, and Jamie Arnold held
the Phillies to two hits in the final two innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a team,'' Mondesi said. ``You can't just play one group
all the time. That's why they call it a team.''

DREIFORT PITCHES LIKE HE BELONGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was Darren Dreifort, pitcher under control.
Darren Dreifort, pitcher with control.
</P>
<P>
   After Dreifort gave up seven earned runs in his last start, Los
Angeles Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said he was moving the
talented but frustrating right-hander to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Then left-hander Carlos Perez, who actually leads Dreifort in
the frustration department, blew up and Dreifort was back in the
rotation before he even had a chance to be skipped.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday he pitched like someone who was trying to make it
known he wanted to stay in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really, I just felt like I had to make pitches and let the
defense work behind me, and they did,'' Dreifort said.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort (6-5) went 62/3 innings, allowing one run on six hits
in the Dodgers 8-1 victory. He walked two and struck out five. Of
his 98 pitches, 65 were for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pitching today, instead of throwing,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way I felt, too,'' Dreifort said.
</P>
<P>
   With an off-day Monday, Johnson can continue to use Dreifort as
his No.4 starter and not need a fifth starter until Friday in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   B-team power: After using only two starters _ Raul Mondesi and
Adrian Beltre _ from the opening-day lineup and watching the
Dodgers score their most runs since a 9-3 victory at Cincinnati on
May 26, Johnson didn't sound like a man ready to scrap success.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few of 'em would be in the lineup again today,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see,'' he said. ``I've been scratching around, trying to
get something more exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, the only Dodger to start every game this season, said
he expects to be rested today. Sheffield (inflamed knee) will also
likely held out again.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was able to start three left-handers (Craig Counsell,
Todd Hollandsworth, Dave Hansen) to put some flexibility in his
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter honored: The Dodgers retired the No. 1 media credential
of Bob Hunter, former sports writer for the Daily News and the Los
Angeles Examiner, in a ceremony prior to the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also honored Hunter with an exhibit at their Dodger
Experience, an interactive museum on the club level.
</P>

ROSE BOWL SHOWCASES SECOND DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM BARRERO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ There won't be 78,000 screaming fans inside
the Rose Bowl today, but that shouldn't detract from what figures
to be two attractive matchups on the second day of the 1999 Women's
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Less than half that fan total likely will show up to watch
Germany face Italy at 4 p.m., followed by Nigeria and North Korea
at 6:30 p.m. in the only matches the Rose Bowl will host until the
championship and third-place games on July 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Group B matchup between Germany and Italy figures to be one
of the most intriguing of the tournament's first two days.
</P>
<P>
   Both are traditional European powers and both will be trying to
keep pace with Brazil in what is known as the ``Group of Death.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil got off to a rousing start with a 7-1 win over Mexico in
East Rutherford, N.J., Saturday where 78,000-plus fans also watched
the U.S. knock off Denmark 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take a very tight midfield,'' Italy forward Patrizia
Panico said of the key to today's match. ``We've going to have to
push a lot in the midfield and counter-attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy usually plays a deliberate style and is content taking its
time in building an attack.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders up front are Panico and Rita Guarino, both of whom
roam freely and constantly change sides.
</P>
<P>
   Midfielders Antonella Carta and Federica D'Astolfo are the
primary ball handlers, but the Italians also are boosted by a
strong back line, featuring Damiana Deiana and Roberta Stefanelli,
along with veteran goalkeeper Giorgia Brenzan.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, the runner-up at the 1995 World Cup in Sweden, needed
to win a playoff against the Ukraine just to make it to the U.S.
But now that the Germans are here, they loom as a possible dark
horse.
</P>
<P>
   They are bolstered by one of the world's best defenses,
featuring Doris Fitschen and Steffi Jones, which should make
Italy's penetration difficult. Up front, Germany has its own
quality tandem, led by Sandra Smisek and Birgit Prinz.
</P>
<P>
   As with Italy, Germany also has two veteran midfielders, Martina
Voss and Bettina Wiegmann, to help distribute.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1991 World Cup in China, Germany beat Italy 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria will be eager to show the world its time has finally
arrived. A victory also would give the Super Falcons huge
confidence heading into Thursday's match against the U.S. in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In two previous World Cup appearances, Nigeria has one tie and
five losses. Coach Ismaila Mabo said that record should change.
</P>
<P>
   ``By our predictions, even though we are in a very tough group,
I believe we shall be able to go beyond the first round,'' Mabo
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marvelous'' Mercy Akide and Patience Avre lead the charge up
front for the speedy Nigerians, who at times can be suspect on the
back line.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea, appearing in its first World Cup, is one of the
tournament's mystery teams, doing its best to not be distracted
while in the U.S., shunning interview requests and tourist
attractions.
</P>
<P>
   What is known is that the North Koreans are physical and known
to ``win ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Kum Sil, who scored six goals during the Asian Cup, is the
weapon up front. Teammate Kim Sun Hui is the team's best defender,
representing her country at the FIFA World Stars match in February.

U.S. WINS WORLD CUP OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ They came by the thousands, in pony
tails and soccer cleats, to see the best in the world. Mia Hamm was
all of that and more.
</P>
<P>
   In front of the largest crowd to ever witness a women's sporting
event at Giants Stadium, Hamm led the United States soccer team to
a 3-0 Women's World Cup victory over Denmark on Saturday afternoon
with a goal and an electricity that stirred 78,972 fans every time
she touched the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm's goal, the world-record 110th of her career, came just 17
minutes into the first game of the three-week tournament that
concludes July 10 at the Rose Bowl. It also set a tone for the U.S.
team favored to regain the title it lost four years ago to Norway.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team, which won the gold at the 1996 Olympics in
Atlanta, plays Nigeria on Thursday in a Group A game at Soldier
Field in Chicago. Later in the tournament, it could face an
improving Brazil, which routed Mexico 7-1 in the second game at
Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful way to start the tournament,'' Hamm said.
``This is what we always dreamed the World Cup should be. To see
the crowd and the atmosphere was phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   The response by the crowd, many of them girls and young women,
was overwhelming to the team, which started slowly before Hamm's
goal. Many players admitted after the game that the sight of the
waving American flags brought the team to tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great atmosphere to play soccer,'' said Julie Foudy,
who scored the second U.S. goal. ``But this is our event. In the
locker room, we were saying, `This is our party. Welcome to our
party.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And the party always goes through Hamm, whose brilliant
playmaking always has been the hallmark of this team.
</P>
<P>
   She is a reluctant star who has appeared in ads with Michael
Jordan, but who often deflects the attention to teammates. And like
Jordan, Hamm seems to play one gear above the competition.
</P>
<P>
   On her goal, Hamm settled a ball that deflected off a defender
as she tried to push it through with her right foot. She beat the
defender to the ball and, with her left foot, drilled a 30-foot
dipping volley over the outstretched hand of Denmark goalie Dorthe
Larsen and into the top of the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``That changed everything,'' said Denmark's Mikka Hansen. ``They
started slowly, but you could see their confidence building. After
that they took off.''
</P>
<P>
   The proof might have been on defense, which pretty much went
untested after the first eight minutes. U.S. goalkeeper Briana
Scurry recorded her 50th career shutout and had to make just two
saves.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the U.S. team wasn't so precise at the outset.
Cindy Parlow and Kristine Lilly each hit the crossbar. Lilly also
missed a wide open shot in the second half, but capped the scoring
with a goal with three minutes left in the match.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm's nifty pass across the middle set up Foudy's goal in the
73rd minute. After scoring, Foudy raced to the U.S. bench, then
struck a pose that was equal parts show business and Heisman
Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, she must have been doing an Austin Powers
thing,'' Hamm said.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly, who grew up in Wilton, Conn., also displayed a little
American brashness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was caught up in the emotion of the thing,'' she said. ``I
was fouled just before I scored and when I scored I told the Danish
player, `this one is for you.' This was awesome and unbelievable.
You can't compare this to the Olympics. This was so much better.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was better, too. In fact, it was the largest crowd
ever to see a sporting event in Giants Stadium history, beating the
78,817 that watched an NFL playoff game between the New York Jets
and Jacksonville Jaguars in January. The stadium record was set in
1995, when the Mass held by Pope John Paul II drew 82,948.
</P>
<P>
   Women's World Cup CEO Marla Messing estimated a $4 million gate
for Saturday's doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   ``People outside soccer know this stadium, the name Giants
Stadium, and that what happens here is great events,'' midfielder
Brandi Chastain said. ``And women's soccer now can be put right up
there.''

DUNCAN NBA'S NEW POSTER BOY 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The NBA's next goodwill ambassador lives here. He
is everything the league should want in a player. He's talented.
He's self-disciplined, the anti-Antoine on the court. He should be
the guy around which the league builds its marketing campaign in
the next century.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA ought to revisit its scheduling situation so that each
city gets to see Tim Duncan a little more. It's a treat to watch
him. It's a treat to listen to him. He simply shows up for work,
does his job without fanfare or hoopla, and represents all that's
good about the game.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan isn't the sole reason the Spurs lead the NBA Finals, 2-0,
but he's a very, very, very big reason. But what's so refreshing
about him is that he stands out for all the right reasons: he's
fundamentally sound and schooled on the floor _ watch his footwork
some time _ and he's not a crotch-grabber, chest-thumper,
high-fiver, finger-wagger, or body wiggler.
</P>
<P>
   His coach, Gregg Popovich, likes to say there's ``no MTV'' in
Duncan. There isn't. There isn't even any VH-1 in his game, not to
mention any shindig or even Lawrence Welk.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real strange bird in the sense that he's uncommon for
someone his age,'' Popovich said. ``He's got this natural
disposition. I always say he's on island time because nothing fazes
this guy. It doesn't matter if he does something real well or he
makes a bad turnover. He will compete on the very next play. He
doesn't get excited about anything and I don't think there are too
many guys like that.''
</P>
<P>
   It goes without saying that Duncan got the best arrangement
possible when the lottery delivered him here. There was a good team
in place. There was a superstar in place. He could blend in, be
allowed to grow, and not have to worry about being a savior. That
would not have been the case in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   He fits in well with the relaxed pace here. The frenetic,
frantic East would have been horrifying to him. He's content with
playing in a small market in a city with one major pro team and
with an amenable climate that probably reminds him of his native
St. Croix.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, he will start feeling the tugs and pressures of
stardom now that he's front and center in the NBA firmament. ``If
it comes, it comes,'' he shrugged, referring to the marketing
opportunities sure to come his way. ``I have a lot of fun with what
I do. But I'm still pretty boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to us. We'd like to see many more of him. That's the problem
_ there aren't any. So enjoy him when and where you can.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Would someone please explain what the New Jersey Nets are doing?
OK, they took a shot at Phil Jackson, who, it might be argued, used
them to get the Lakers off the proverbial schneid. (Jackson
reportedly told the Nets owners that he didn't plan to coach this
season.) Now what? Don Casey, who knows what it's like to twist in
the wind, is, well, twisting in the wind. (He also had surgery this
past week.) The Nets' coaching staff will be at work Monday for a
mock draft meeting, even though the team has no first-round pick.
But they have no official head coach as Casey waits for ownership
to make up its mind. (Did Donald Sterling take over here when we
weren't looking?) There could be a rebound effect at work; once
Jackson has gone off the screen, it's an understandable
psychological hit to have to go to the next name, whoever it is.
(The Knicks will face that same dilemma should they let Jeff Van
Gundy go.) Is there another name? Well, Chuck Daly has been calling
people _ to boost Casey. People representing the interests of Mike
Fratello inquired and were told to forget about it. The only other
name that has surfaced is Van Gundy, which makes little sense. The
new owners of the Nets missed out on Jackson, which would have been
a home run. That doesn't mean they have to revert to Knucklehead
Mode in going to Plan B. Jackson left them high and dry. Why should
they then turn around and do the same thing to Casey? Either hire
him or tell him he's not the guy . . . As The Penny Turns, Episode
XXVXLMXCCLXM: The latest Penny Hardaway rumor has the Orlando
guard, thought to prefer a warm, Western Conference clime such as
Phoenix, instead moving north to Toronto as part of a
sign-and-trade deal. The Raptors would part with Doug Christie,
maybe one of their lotto picks, and, perhaps, another body. But
they could absorb some of the extra money because they have cap
room. Why Toronto? Well, Hardaway is pals with both Tracy McGrady
and Vince Carter, although he wouldn't solve the Raptors' need for
a real point guard. But should he do it, the move would put Toronto
on the NBA map for years to come. What seems more and more
inevitable is that he's played his last game in Orlando. But
knowing Penny . . . There's still a lot of speculation and talk,
but with 10 days left before the draft, the only player anyone is
mentioning in terms of actually wanting is Steve Francis. Oh, and
by the way, Elton Brand did measure 6 feet 8 inches at the Chicago
pre-draft camp . . . Johnny Davis and Sidney Lowe are in the
running for the No. 2 assistant's job in Orlando. Dave Wohl, as we
mentioned last week, has the No. 1 spot. Don't be surprised if
Butch Beard resurfaces in Washington as an assistant to new coach
Gar Heard. And while we're on the topic, how did the Wizards manage
to time their announcement the same day as Jackson's coronation in
Los Angeles? Heard has had one coaching assignment and went 9-44
with the hopeless, pre-Quinn Buckner Mavericks. Isiah Thomas's
chances in Washington apparently were torpedoed when he went
directly to ownership and then didn't exactly get ringing
endorsements from either Pistons owner Bill Davidson or former
Toronto owner Allan Slaight . . . Dominique Wilkins not only has
been waived by the Magic (which owed him a small guarantee), he's
also switched agents _ again _ and is selling his spectacular home
in Dover, which backs up to the Charles River. Wilkins has latched
on with Chicago's Mark Bartlestein, who will need his considerable
skills to find employment for Wilkins, who turns 40 in January. If
you're interested in the home, it's on the market for a paltry $2.5
million, about double what Wilkins paid for it in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jackson may eventually be terrific for the Lakers, but he
inherits the same problems Kurt Rambis had: no point guard, no
power forward, no chemistry. The Scottie Pippen-Glen Rice rumor
makes sense from the Lakers' standpoint because Pippen knows how to
bring up the ball and get the triangle offense in gear. He's also
miserable in Houston. Rice is not all that keen about being the
third option in LA and would be a risk keeping around if not
extended. Whether it happens, of course, is another matter.
Jackson's real strength in Chicago was managing the team, rather
than coaching it. He knew whose button to push and when to push it.
He had a real feel for the dynamics of a team and what it needs to
make it through those interminable NBA seasons. The challenge in LA
will be to institute such an atmosphere and also get the players to
play defense. They don't have a serious defender on their roster,
although they have several players capable of doing so when the
spirit moves them. There also will be greater pressure on the
Lakers to get it done with Jackson aboard. But the team also is in
a very similar state as Chicago was when Jackson succeeded Doug
Collins. That Bulls team had talent, but was frustrated by its
inability to get over the hump. Jackson soon got them there . . .
Here's one rumor to keep in mind: Ron Mercer for Jerry Stackhouse.
The Celtics would have to add one of their many undesirables for
salary cap purposes, but those two would be the principles.
Stackhouse has never blossomed as projected and those are the kind
of projects Rick Pitino likes. But Stackhouse also is prone to
making unwise decisions at critical times, which is why Detroit
often had him on the pine at crunch time. From a financial
standpoint, he's under contract for several more seasons, so that
would be a benefit . . . Tough Luck Dept: Sixers president Pat
Croce, a real motorcycle kind of guy, started off this past week
for what he called an ``ocean to ocean'' bike trip with some
buddies. But while pulling off the road to change into rain gear,
Croce's left leg got in the way of a skidding bike. You know who
wins those collisions. Croce suffered multiple fractures in the leg
and underwent surgery at the University of Pennsylvania. He'll need
a second operation as well and, in the best of cases, will be back
to normal in three or four months. Allen Iverson said Croce has to
exercise more responsibility in the offseason . . . Tougher Luck
Dept: Former Celtic Derek Strong almost died last week after
routine surgery to fix his oft-broken nose. Strong had a bad
reaction to the anesthesia. His heart started racing moments before
he was to awake and his temperature shot up to an astonishing 107
degrees. He was wrapped in ice, injected with fluids, and given
dantrolene, which probably saved his life. While still unconscious,
he was airlifted to a second Orlando-area hospital. Strong had
thought about having the nose operation done at an outpatient
clinic. The fact that he chose a hospital may have saved his life .
. . Utah owner Larry Miller has a lot of work to do this summer.
His immediate concerns: re-signing Karl Malone, John Stockton, Jeff
Hornacek, Shandon Anderson, and lighting a fire under the comatose
Greg Ostertag. He said he expects Stockton and Hornacek to sign
one-year deals, although he added, ``If we had won, I think John
would have retired.'' Malone? ``There's no doubt Karl will return
to the Jazz for four more years,'' Miller said. He noted that
Malone is a neighbor and friend and that the Mailman's wife has
opened a bed and breakfast in the area. ``He's doing the things
that entrench you in a community,'' Miller said. ``I know four
years for a guy Karl's age is scary. But if I'm going to bet on a
guy that old playing well for four years, it's going to be Karl.''
Now, Larry, what about Ostertag? He showed up for one of the Jazz's
11 playoff games. That's not a good percentage. ``When does he
learn? It's really disconcerting,'' Miller said. ``At some point,
you gotta question what's inside of him.'' He said the Jazz have
one clip of Ostertag blocking Hakeem Olajuwon three times in one
stretch. ``That's the Ostertag we're trying to find,'' Miller said.
``But the defense and rebounding weren't there and he was getting
into foul trouble. Right now, for me, it's hard to see where we are
with him.'' Miller is committed to re-signing Anderson, although he
said, ``There were times when he was terrific for us and there were
times when you didn't even know he was on the floor. But that was
the story of our season. Our problem wasn't Karl, Jeff, and John.
Our problem was that our other guys didn't show up on a consistent
basis.'' One final Jazz moment: Jerry Sloan. ``I don't know anybody
else I'd rather have coach this team,'' Miller said. ``I think he's
looking forward to coaching beyond John and Karl.''

 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ By choosing Turin over favored Sion as its 2006 winter
site Saturday, the International Olympic Committee was merely
following its recent preference for big cities (Salt Lake City and
Nagano) over cozy hamlets (Lillehammer and Albertville). Even
though the Lords were forbidden to visit the Italian city (they'd
seen the Swiss resort during the 2002 bidding), they knew enough
about it from the IOC's detailed evaluation report to conclude that
Turin could easily handle the massive carnival the Winter Games
have become.
</P>
<P>
   Though Sion would have had excellent venues in a charming,
compact setting, the Games are now as much about spectator access
and comfort (and corporate entertaining) as they are about the
athletes. Turin simply has many more hotel rooms and restaurants
and better overall transportation links than Sion. It also has the
usual big-city downside _ the venues are scattered. Only the ice
events will be in Turin. The Nordic events will be in Pragelato (a
two-hour drive), the Alpine in Sestriere (75 minutes away), the
freestyle in Sauze d'Oulx (60 minutes), and the bobsled/luge in
Beaulard (55 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not there was an anti-Swiss backlash against Sion
from the IOC voters (Swiss member Marc Hodler blew the whistle on
his colleagues during the Salt Lake payoff scandal), there may be a
Swiss backlash against the IOC. Swiss sources say their Parliament
may take a harsh view of the perks (including tax-free status) that
the Lausanne-based committee has always taken for granted . . .The
chief Lord of the Rings in a federal clink? It could happen if the
US government decides that Juan Antonio Samaranch broke the law by
taking gift firearms from the Salt Lake bidders out of the country
without a permit. The feds are looking at everything from customs
violations to money laundering as part of their investigation into
the scandal . . . Double-secret probation for beleaguered IOC
member Phil Coles of Australia. After already getting the ``most
severe warning'' for taking a Super Bowl trip from the Salt Lake
organizers, he received an additional reprimand from his colleagues
last week for compiling dossiers on them for the Utahns. He also
had to step down from the Sydney organizing committee and can't be
part of any IOC commission or working group for two years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fact that it took someone (i.e. Maurice Greene) more than a
decade to match the drug-tainted 100-meter mark set by Ben Johnson
shows one thing: steroids work. Johnson, meanwhile, is running into
roadblocks in his quest to run again at 37. While he's appealing
his lifetime ban (a Canadian arbitrator ordered him to be allowed
to compete domestically), he can't find a race to run in to post
the sub-10.6 he needs to qualify for the national championships.
Under the international track-and-field federation's contamination
rule, anyone who runs against Johnson is ineligible. So he's hoping
he can run a solo timed race before or after a meet and beg
Canadian officials to accept it. ``All I'm looking for is someone
to fire the gun and let him take off from the blocks,'' says Morris
Chrobotek, Johnson's agent. ``Ben can't contaminate a clock, can
he?'' . . . The inaugural Track and Field Association pro meet on
Long Island, which drew barely 3,000 a fortnight ago, was a
financial bust, costing its backers an estimated $1.5 million.
Their plan is still to have between five and eight meets next year
_ and make a profit in four or five years . . . What drug did Irish
swimmer Michelle Smith take to get her banned? Andro, the same
``diet supplement'' that will send Mark McGwire to the Hall of
Fame. Besides the four-year international suspension (for pouring
whiskey in her urine sample), which has pushed her into retirement
at 29, Swim Ireland is considering taking away Smith's national
records . . . Though the International Skating Union has suspended
the Russian and Ukrainian pairs judges who colluded during the
world championships in Helsinki, it won't change the results.
Sviatoslav Babenko and Alfred Korytek were caught winking and
blinking by Canadian TV before the marks for China's Shen Xue and
Zhao Hongbo were posted. Babenko and Korytek put Russian
competitors first and third, while most of their colleagues had
them second and fourth. So Babenko is banned for three years,
Korytek for two. Korytek, by the way, was the swing judge (and
father of Oksana Baiul's first coach) who gave Baiul the 1994
Olympic gold medal over Nancy Kerrigan.

   SEOUL _ Dousing each other with champagne, leaping in the air
and cheering in the lobby of a luxury hotel, Italians celebrated
their surprise victory Saturday in the bid to host the 2006 Winter
Olympics, the first Games awarded in a controversial new selection
process since an influence-peddling scandal broke late last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Fiat car-producing capital of Turin, Italy's third largest
city, trounced the odds-on favorite for the Games _ the tiny Swiss
mountain hamlet of Sion _ in a 53-36 secret ballot cast by members
of the International Olympic Committee at the IOC's 109th meeting
here in South Korea Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But while Turin loyalists rejoiced and praised the new selection
process as a fair one that allowed an underdog bidder to prevail,
the second-place finishers lost sorely. Sion boosters accused the
IOC of bias and vindictiveness and the Turin committee of shameless
lobbying or worse. The fact that Turin won _ even though Sion had
the best rating from a technical evaluation committee _ was proof
that the IOC is still a corrupt and high-handed group that must
clean up its act, Sion committee members charged.
</P>
<P>
   The site selection was more significant and closely scrutinized
than perhaps any in history, coming as it did on the heels of
revelations that Salt Lake City, host of the 2002 Winter Games,
spent more than $1 million in gifts, trips, ``scholarships,'' and
other bribes to win its bid. The dirty dealing was apparently part
of a larger culture of greed and graft in which some IOC members
expected to be wined, dined, and bought off by prospective Olympic
hosts. Ten IOC members have resigned or been expelled in the
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's selection was a test of a temporary new system, which
barred IOC members from visiting bid cities to avoid impropriety
and created a selection committee of 16 that narrowed the field
from six candidates to two before the full IOC voted on the winner.
For the first time athletes were included in the selection process.
</P>
<P>
   But far from clearing up any suggestions of crookedness and
inequity, Turin's upset victory provoked fury and accusations from
the runner-up bidder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were robbed,'' spat out a bitter Jean-Loup Chappelet,
technical director of Sion's committee. He credited Turin's win on
``factors that had nothing to do with winter Olympics . . .
obviously lobbying was very important. You should investigate. This
(vote) margin is suspicious _ like the one Salt Lake won with.''
</P>
<P>
   Chappelet accused IOC members of voting out of vindictiveness
against a Swiss IOC member, Marc Hodler, the main whistleblower in
the scandal that sullied the Olympics' name. Chappelet said the
Sion committee had begged Hodler ``to keep quiet.'' Asked if Hodler
had not been right to expose the graft, Chappelet said, ``Certainly
other people could have done it.''
</P>
<P>
   IOC members cast a payback vote to prove ``they are masters of
the world,'' he complained, adding that votes should be public so
IOC members can be held accountable for their decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss sour grapes aside, there was no evidence Saturday that
Turin had bought the vote or that Sion's loss _ given the huge
margin _ was entirely the result of an anti-Hodler backlash.
</P>
<P>
   Some IOC members may also have avoided picking the ``shoe-in''
bidder for fear of creating an image of a rigged deal. Turin's
video presentation was arguably more innovative and less corny than
Sion's. And voters may have passed over the traditional model of
hosting a Winter Games in a charming mountain village of 26,000
people, in favor of a new trend of hosting them in cities that can
accommodate the behemoth that the Games have become. The last two
Winter Games selections _ Nagano (1998) and Salt Lake (2002) _ are
urban centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IOC had to decide between two very different bids. Sion
was an old-fashioned one . . . (Ours was) a big city. I think we'd
win all the same, even without the said ``Hodler effect,''' said
Marco San Pietro, a Turin member.
</P>
<P>
   The decision shatters the myth that cities must bid a few times
before getting the gold. Sion played heavily on the sympathy
factor, reminding judges it lost two bids, one to a corrupt Salt
Lake committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Winter Games will go to Italy for the first time since 1956,
when they were in Cortina D'Ampezzo. Those were the last
untelevised Games, before a new era of sponsorship and big money
began to transform the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Turin, though not known for winter sports, has hosted numerous
world sporting events, including the Soccer World Cup in 1990.

WOLF COMES HOME TO DODGER STADIUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS COCOLES  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One spot in the Philadelphia Phillies' rotation
prevented Randy Wolf from getting the start today at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   On Father's Day, no less.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would have almost been too ironic,'' Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Wolf passed away in 1994 when Randy was a high school
senior. Dodger Stadium was a favorite retreat for father and son,
and Randy played there twice in helping El Camino Real High to
back-to-back City Section championships in 1993 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The second of those titles was won three months after Jim Wolf
suffered a fatal heart attack in March, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bottled most of it up after it happened,'' said Wolf, who
won his first two major-league starts after the Phillies called him
up 10 days ago. ``Two days after he died I was out there pitching
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite playing with a heavy heart, he finished his senior year
at ECR with a 12-3 pitching record, a .443 batting average, six
homers and 28 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the Conquistadores defeated Chatsworth 7-6 in
the City finals that Randy let his emotions out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did change as a person (when Jim passed away). When that
happens it's going to change you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Wolf said such a tragedy can have either a positive or
negative impact on a teen-ager's life. Jim's death made him more
focused on following his baseball dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something that's really important to me is how I carry
myself,'' he said. ``It's easy for somebody to be a nice guy when
things are going well for you. But I try to be the same person when
things are going bad. I try to have a good positive attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   He had a standout collegiate career at Pepperdine, was a
second-round pick of the Phillies in 1997 and reached the majors
just three years into his professional career at the age of 22.
</P>
<P>
   His colleagues and bosses rave at Wolf's polished demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You watch him and you get the impression he's been groomed to
do this his whole life,'' Philadelphia first baseman Rico Brogna
said. ``It looks like he's been here for two or three years
already.''
</P>
<P>
   Added manager Terry Francona, ``We kind of expected this out of
him. We've known about him for a while. He's got a good head on his
shoulders and I think that's why he's here already.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf (2-0, 1.32 ERA) was called up from Triple-A
Scranton/Wilkes-Barre and made his debut June 11 at Veterans
Stadium against the Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's rabid and sometimes unforgiving fans, 26,541
strong, served as Wolf's critics. One batter into his major-league
career he was given an emphatic thumb's down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't take me long to get booed. I walked the leadoff
guy,'' Wolf said with a grin. ``I just think they're really good
baseball fans. When you're good they'll let you know about it.''
</P>
<P>
   When he rebounded to toss a solid 52/3 innings (one run, six
hits, six strikeouts) Wolf left the field to a standing ovation, a
tribute he'd never before experienced.
</P>
<P>
   When he watched highlights of the 8-4 victory, Wolf noticed a
sign in the left-field bleachers bearing the slogan ``Wolfpack''.
</P>
<P>
   One game into his major-league career and the kid had his own
Veterans Stadium fan club?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say that just yet,'' he cracked. ``There's already
a (teammate Paul) Byrd Cage.''
</P>
<P>
   And it didn't take long for the rookie to make believers out of
his teammates. Wolf showed his mettle when he struck out two Blue
Jays in his first big-league inning after that leadoff walk,
including fanning Shawn Green on a fastball clocked at 91 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a batter making your major-league debut at least
you have seven other hitters behind you,'' Brogna said. ``But when
you take that mound for the first time everyone is watching you.
You are the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a cautious optimism with guys like Randy. We'd heard
of him. We know he's a prospect. Once he started throwing strikes I
knew he was going to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf made sure there was even less anxiety in his second outing
last Wednesday in San Diego. He lasted eight innings, giving up one
earned run on five hits with seven strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf arranged for 20 guests on the Qualcomm Stadium pass list.
Twice that number made the trip from the Valley, including his mom
Judy, who planned on watching his debut in Philadelphia before her
flight was delayed by inclement weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see that many people come down was great. I tried not to
think about it but once the game started I could hear them,'' said
Randy, who is sure Jim Wolf was watching too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he's here to share all of this with me.''

WHO'LL GET JIGGY WITH ZIGGY? 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO _ Whither Ziggy?
</P>
<P>
   Word broke early last week that the Islanders and Rangers cut a
deal that had Ziggy Palffy headed to Broadway for a package that
included former first-round picks Patrik Sundstrom and Todd Harvey
heading to Uniondale.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a week later, the music is still playing, and Islander
general manager Mike Milbury is still fiddling with offers from
around the league. Other than the Rangers, word is that the Kings
and Panthers have shown the most interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about our best player,'' said Milbury, here for
the GM meetings Tuesday. ``And he's a good, good guy, to boot. It's
not easy on anyone. But, hey, it's part of the reality of today's
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation on Long Island borders on the surreal. The club's
owners want a new stadium and Nassau County has responded with a
show of long faces and empty pockets. To avoid bleeding more from
the bottom line, owners Steve Gluckstern and Howard Milstein
instructed Milbury weeks ago to trim payroll way back, while at the
same time he was searching for a new coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Butch was fully apprised of the status of the franchise before
he signed on,'' said Milbury, referring to former Boston coach
Butch Goring, named some six weeks ago as the new Islander bench
boss.
</P>
<P>
   So what uniform will Palffy wear next season?
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it could be the league that has the final say. Not
long after the Isles shipped Trevor Linden to the Canadiens for the
No. 10 pick in Saturday's amateur draft, the NHL made it clear that
VP Colin Campbell would assess any move(s) the Isles made and
ultimately would be the one to OK all trades. The league wants to
avoid the appearance of the Isles essentially cashing out at the
poker table, stripping assets, and running what amounts to a minor
league franchise while charging major league ticket prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that names have been mentioned,'' said
Campbell, ``but so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Milbury and Kings GM Dave Taylor huddled briefly at the meetings
here and by mid-week LA appeared the primary suitor, believed to be
offering up relatively unknown prospects Scott Barney and Josh
Green _ both forwards _ and defenseman Mathieu Biron (the
6-foot-6-inch brother of Sabres netminding prospect Martin Biron).
Only Green has NHL experience, appearing in 27 LA games this past
season.
</P>
<P>
   Like the proposed Islander-Ranger deal, there would be some cash
involved, likely much more than the $2.5 million the Rangers
offered. The Blueshirts also were going to send prospects Patrick
Leahy and P.J. Stock and a first-round pick (No. 11 overall) to the
Island. Chances are, the Kings offered substantially more cash. But
the league, with its main interest keeping the Isles competitive,
would have to look more favorably upon the Ranger offer _ first and
foremost because Sundstrom and Harvey are legitimate NHLers who
could produce now for the Islanders, as opposed to prospects who
might never make it to the show.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers, who cut the biggest deal of 1998-99 when they
swapped for Pavel Bure, have a number of interesting young players,
especially forwards, to spice a trade. Milbury's top priority there
could be 24-year-old center/wing Rob Niedermayer, with the rest of
the parts to be arranged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of GMs dealing strictly with GMs on trades, other
than when it's a third- or fourth-liner, are just about gone,''
said Milbury. ``When you're getting into seven-figure contracts and
multiple-player exchanges _ well, it's not for me to make decisions
about (the owners') money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our owners have said they're not prepared to keep losing tens
of millions of dollars. They're not in the position of having
players retire comfortably while they lose their shirts. Have we
made mistakes? Yes. But my fondest wish now is that we stay the
course, stay on a path with the new players we'll have, get a new
building and in three or four years those assets will make for a
much stronger, healthier franchise on Long Island.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis GM Larry Pleau on the Blues' decision to make Group 2
free agent Pierre Turgeon a qualifying offer for next season:
``Pierre was a leader for us in the playoffs _ it seemed like he
was trying to make a difference out there every shift. We'd like to
see more of that, in the regular season.'' . . . The Blues and the
Kiel Center remain up for sale. Goldman Sachs has been shopping
around for a suitor since the start of the year . . . When the
league finally gets around to modifying the man-in-the-crease rule
(revision No. 1,345,867), look for something that resembles life
before replay. The bet here is that replay will exist, but referees
will be encouraged only to go to the tape when blatant interference
has taken place (i.e., games won't be decided on the tip of Tim
Taylor's toe). A little bit of common sense and a healthy dose of
modern technology could be just the right mix _ finally. Among the
many faults of the existing system: goals go under review far too
often, leaving a crowded arena and a television audience in a state
of suspended animation; the game's flow gets lost in the whir of
technology . . . LA GM Dave Taylor boiled his head coach candidates
down to Andy Murray and John Van Boxmeer and ultimately chose
Murray, who most recently was coaching prep school hockey in
Minnesota. ``I like his intelligence, his discipline, the fact that
he's a hard worker,'' said Taylor. ``I hope people around the
league aren't surprised by the pick. They shouldn't be. In LA, it's
not a traditional hockey market, and some people might say, `Andy
Murray? Who's that?' But that would be almost anyone we chose. I
think people in LA will like the choice.'' . . . The best player in
today's game? Look no further, says Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock,
than Colorado center Peter Forsberg. ``We won the series (against
the Avalanche) and it was a great feeling. But as a hockey person,
to see a player like that is amazing. Once he ran out of gas, it
was to our advantage. There were times he'd keep it in our end for
40 seconds and we couldn't get it away from him _ that's 40 seconds
with three guys, 200 pounds or more, who couldn't get it away from
him. You can play him anywhere, any situation. And he gets this
really strange look in his eyes, like there's something really
scary going on in there.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the topics when GMs met last week in Buffalo was the
troublesome seamless glass above the boards that has led to head
and shoulder injuries in some NHL rinks. The Molson Centre in
Montreal already has switched to a new design, glass with some
give, and the GMs could mandate other buildings be retrofitted.
``The new stuff is more like the glass at the old Garden,'' said
Islander GM Mike Milbury, the former Bruins defenseman. ``It's more
like the WWF stuff.'' The old Buffalo Auditorium had the most
spring in its glass, providing almost a slingshot for battles
between the likes of Jim Schoenfeld and Terry O'Reilly. ``Yeah,
those were definitely Taz's battles _ I stayed away from Schoeny,''
said Milbury . . . The AHL's four-on-four format for deciding games
in OT has received decent reviews by the NHL. The big league hasn't
approved it, but the Lords of the Boards are giving it some
consideration . . . Until otherwise informed, Jacques Demers
remains the GM/coach of Tampa Bay, although he now reports directly
to Rick Dudley, the ex-Ottawa GM who is now running the show for
the Bolts. ``I don't think it's very complicated,'' said Demers,
the last coach to lead the Canadiens to the Stanley Cup (1993).
``The new owner has never said that I wouldn't be part of the team.
And I've said before that I don't want to do both jobs _ GM and
coach _ for very long. We've made a lot of changes in Tampa. We've
got the youngest team in the league now, and we've cut payroll. I
think everyone likes the direction of the club.'' Demers has three
more years on his contract. He'll remain in Tampa, but look for
Dudley to channel him more toward scouting duties . . . Ron Salcer,
agent for Bruins netminder Byron Dafoe, said late last week that
he's had a few ``exploratory'' conversations with management about
a new deal for his client, who becomes a Group 2 (high
compensation) free agent July 1. ``We're hopeful to come to an
amicable conclusion,'' he added. Dafoe has until July 15 to file
for salary arbitration. The Bruins haven't come up with a figure,
but assistant GM Mike O'Connell has made it sound as if the Bruins
are pegging Dafoe for around $2 million a year. He's far more
likely to seek nearly double that.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ailment that sent Houston Astros manager Larry Dierker into
seizure and later last week led to brain surgery _ an arteriovenous
malformation _ was similar to the condition that brought permanent
paralysis to Normand Leveille at the start of the '82 season.
Leveille required life-saving brain surgery that night in Vancouver
when his AVM ruptured. Last seen in Boston for the Bruins' final
game at the Garden, when teammates helped him around the ice,
Leveille now lives in Montreal, his speech limited, and he gets
around with the aid of a cane . . . Oiler boss Glen Sather remains
hopeful that the NHL will increase its number of playoff teams from
16 to as many as 20. ``We equate success in this league with making
the playoffs,'' said Sather, the former Boston forward. ``And
making the playoffs equates to selling season tickets.'' Look for
the idea to gain momentum with the approach of fall 2000, when
Minnesota and Columbus open for business . . . Atlanta now has
interviewed three prospective coaches: Don Hay, Ron Low, and Curt
Fraser. GM Don Waddell late last week had plans to interview Bill
Barber, the former Flyer who now coaches the AHL's Philly Phantoms
. . . O'Connell on Providence goalie John Grahame's readiness for
the NHL: ``He's close. He's an athletic goalie, and that
athleticism gets him in trouble at times. He skates well. He uses
those skills to take some unnecessary risks at times. We've got to
get him to play within himself a little more.'' . . . NHL GMs don't
like to see Dominik Hasek repeatedly drop his stick in the crease _
yet another way he has changed the game. But Campbell admitted last
week, following the GM meetings here, that coming up with a rule
change to legislate against it would be tricky . . . The Bruins
signed free agent Jeff Zehr, who finished the season with the
Sarnia Sting in the OHL, Thursday. Drafted 31st overall by the
Islanders in '97, Zehr never came to terms with New York and now,
at age 20, was able to cut his own deal. He finished with 24 goals
in 57 games last year, traded at midseason from Erie to Sarnia.
He's 6-3, 203 pounds, and has a strong shot, making him a potential
power forward. In April, he needed an arthroscopy to clean up a
bone chip in his right knee. ``I'm not going to Boston thinking
that I'll play a year in the minors,'' said Zehr. ``I'm thinking
I'll make the club. I play a feisty game. I like to be involved out
there, in all key situations. And this is great, the Bruins are
keying on me, telling me I'll get a chance _ and now it's up to me
to make the most of it.''

HAMM LIVES UP TO HYPE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Mia Hamm stood in front of a huge wall
with ``GIANTS'' scripted on it in red and blue letters. Hamm, who
stands 5 feet 5 inches, actually looked like a shrimp standing
there. But as I listened to her speak Saturday _ after watching her
play _ I immediately wanted to compare her to the greatest champion
of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   I will try to get through this report without mentioning that
man's name. Really, it would be very superficial of me to compare
Hamm to a certain bald basketball player who is now retired. What
does his success have to do with hers? So what if they were both
born in North Carolina. Who cares if both attended the University
of North Carolina and won at least one national championship while
at Chapel Hill. Both have done commercials. They even did one
together, but that was probably coincidental. He was born in
February; she was born in March. He made shots that suggested that
he carried a gravity exemption card in his wallet. She recently
made a leftfooted shot that made her say to herself, ``Are you
kidding me? Are you kidding me? (Teammate) Michelle Akers only
makes shots like this.''
</P>
<P>
   That, I think, is as far as I will take it. I will be contained.
There will be no more references to that retired player.
</P>
<P>
   Against that towering wall Saturday, Hamm looked straight ahead
and said, ``The majority of the time, frontrunners fail.''
</P>
<P>
   She's right. That's why Hamm is the best soccer player the
women's game has ever seen. She is a frontrunner who doesn't fail.
She entered Saturday's World Cup opener as the game's all-time
leading scorer with 109 goals. She wasn't the only reason more than
78,000 people packed Giants Stadium for the United States' match
with Denmark, but there were a lot of people wearing jerseys with
her name on them. Many of those people have also seen the
commercials and read the stories about how great this forward named
Hamm was supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   You know what happens in situations like that, right? A movie is
hyped and it's never as good as you expected. A player is hyped
and, on the day you plan to watch them, they have an average game.
Saturday, Giants Stadium held the largest crowd to ever witness a
women's sporting event in the world. In front of that crowd, Hamm
waited 17 minutes before scoring the first goal of the tournament.
It was that leftfooted goal, the one that made her talk to herself.
You can watch a lot of soccer and you won't see many goals like
that. Those goals are not normal. Unless you are Mia Hamm.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm's goal was much more than a creative play. It was a
nerve-loosener for the US. The American women came into this game
as Cup favorites. But in the first 15 minutes, they looked tight
and rusty (they hadn't scrimmaged against anyone in two weeks).
Although the final was 3-0, the Danes probably should have beaten
Hamm to first-goal honors in the first few minutes. Denmark's Gitte
Krogh found herself standing in front of the net while goalkeeper
Briana Scurry was in a defenseless position. Krogh kicked and
missed. It was the best opportunity the Danes would have. They
could have increased the American tension. Instead, they helped
fulfill a script: the best player on the best team in the world
helped bring a victory in the opening match.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was bouncing the ball off her body and I didn't think she
would get it,'' midfielder Julie Foudy said of Hamm's goal. ``When
she made the goal, I think we were all like, `Yeah, yeah. We're
going to be OK.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Now Hamm has 110 goals in her career. For some reason, we don't
hear a lot about her assists. But the US wouldn't have had its
second goal if it hadn't been for Hamm's passing. She drew a couple
defenders toward her as she dribbled in the 73d minute, as they
went for the ball, she made a cross pass to Foudy, who in turn
found the net.
</P>
<P>
   After all of that, I still haven't talked about Hamm's speed. In
soccer, the rule, ``No cheering in the pressbox'' is kind of
liberal. You hear people shouting and screaming when a goal
situation unfolds. So I found myself saying aloud, ``Why aren't
they marking Mia? They're leaving her wide open. What's wrong with
them?'' And then it became obvious that the Danes were marking Mia;
they were just not fast enough to keep pace with her. Someone asked
Hamm's teammate, Kristine Lilly, if Saturday's match was one of the
best she had seen Hamm play. She said no. ``She'll probably play
her best one in her next one,'' Lilly said. ``That's how she is.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm shrugged off all the compliments. ``I am only as good as my
teammates,'' she said. She was then asked, inevitably, about the
other guy. You know, the retired basketball star who will not be
mentioned by name here. Nope. We are much more responsible than
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have so much respect for him,'' she said. ``You watch him
play and you're speechless.''
</P>
<P>
   She talked of their filming commercials together for five and
six hours at a time. In one segment, she picked him up and threw
him to a mat in a judo scene. ``He helped with that,'' she said.
She knows that kids talk about her the way she talks about him.
Both are innovators of their sports. He wore his shorts long and
his socks short. Saturday, she had her left toenails painted red
and the right ones painted blue. Some kids noticed that. They will
do what she did.
</P>
<P>
   There were young boys wearing her No. 9 jersey here, but there
were more girls with them on. ``I feel good about that,'' Hamm
said. ``When they leave the stadium, they want to play in the World
Cup. That's what it was about.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she moved away from that wall and walked away from
the people asking her questions. All you could see was the No. 9 on
her back. Yes, it was the same number the retired guy wore in the
1984 Olympics.

TIRED REVOLUTION HANG TOUGH

<P>
   TAMPA _ The Revolution had many reasons to celebrate their 3-2
victory over the Tampa Bay Mutiny Saturday &UR;  &LR; night. But they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just exhausted,'' defender Dan Calichman said. ``We're
excited, yes, but I think we're just too tired to appreciate it.
We'll see things better later.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution locker room was subdued, the players feeling the
effects of having three games in seven days. This one was against a
physical opponent in 85-degree heat, extreme humidity, and a brief
tropical storm.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution deserved the victory, showing enough
resiliency to pressure the Mutiny and capitalizing on mistakes.
They also showed some of their most fluent midfield play of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Joe-Max Moore scored twice, including the deciding goal in the
81st minute, combining with Ivan McKinley after a throw-in.
McKinley, who was cautioned in the first half and will be suspended
for the team's game at Dallas Saturday, returned the ball to Moore
on the edge of the penalty area, and Moore sent a leftfooted shot
off the inside of the far post.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought hard for 90 minutes and we were disappointed to go
in at halftime at 1-1,'' Moore said. ``I don't think anyone would
have been happy if we didn't get 3 points out of this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the game, though, I was tired. This is a big
field and if you don't stay compact and organized, you can get
spread out, and there was a lot of room out there. My boots were
heavy, my jersey must have weighed an extra three pounds. All the
games we've been playing and the weather took their toll.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinley, John Harkes, and Jair keyed an effective midfield
which made the Revolution dangerous offensively throughout the
contest. Jair scored a highlight-film goal in the 62d minute,
taking a pass from Moore, holding the ball on his left foot, and
causing two defenders to collide just before he converted past
Scott Garlick.
</P>
<P>
   Moore gave the Revolution the lead in the fourth minute, as
defender Chad McCarty sent a clearance directly to him inside the
penalty area. Moore took a touch and buried a shot into the far
corner of the net.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution controlled the pace, but failed to increase their
lead as the Carlos Valderrama-led Mutiny retaliated. In the 34th
minute, Musa Shannon shielded Brian Dunseth from a Steve Trittschuh
through ball, then ran 50 yards into the Revolution goal area
before tying the score, 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   After Jair's goal, Mutiny substitute Pete Marino finished an
excellent move started by Valderrama, then continued through a
Marino backheel and Paul Dougherty return pass to tie the game,
2-2, in the 75th minute.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Harkes (left hamstring) and Jair had been substituted
for and the Mutiny had momentum. But the Revolution remained
resourceful, surprising the Mutiny with the deciding goal as Moore
continued to press.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just toe-poked the ball and didn't even know Ivan was
there,'' Moore said. ``And he sent a nice ball into my run. I
didn't even hit the ball that well, but it went in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution now have 15 points in 14 matches, good for third
place in the Eastern Conference.

STARS' CUP IS FULL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO _ The Stanley Cup is now a 10-gallon trophy.
</P>
<P>
   It also has an embarrassing asterisk.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Stars, who had the National Hockey League's best
record during the regular season, captured their first Stanley Cup
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night when Brett Hull lifted home a doorstep forehander
with 5:09 remaining in the third overtime to capture the Cup in six
games.
</P>
<P>
   Unnoticed by referees Terry Gregson and Bill McCreary was the
fact that Hull's left foot clearly was in the crease, by nearly
half a skate length, and the goal should not have been allowed. But
the goal was never reviewed, either, by on-ice officials or by
Scott Brinkman, the video goal judge, or Bryan Lewis, the
supervisor of officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted Bettman to answer my question,'' said Buffalo coach
Lindy Ruff, who stormed out of the Buffalo locker room soon after
the game ended and asked Commissioner Gary Bettman why the goal was
not disallowed. ``I asked, `Why was it not reviewed?' He turned his
back on me. No review. No answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory (), which came 54:51 into overtime, was the second
longest game played in Stanley Cup finals history. The Bruins went
55:13 into OT in Game 1 of the 1990 finals, losing to the Edmonton
Oilers on a Petr Klima shot.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nieuwendyk, who scored a record-tying six winning goals
during the playoffs, won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the series' most
valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it,'' said an overwhelmed Nieuwendyk. ``I
can't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres were even more overwhelmed. Because of Hull's foot
foul, they felt the game shouldn't have ended, the Cup shouldn't
have been hoisted. According to Ruff, Lewis explained the goal was
allowed because Hull never lost possession of the puck after making
a first attempt to score on netminder Dominik Hasek. But replays
clearly showed Hull lost possession, and his left skate blade
clearly was in the blue crease area when he regained possession and
fired home the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some will say he had full possession,'' said Dallas coach Ken
Hitchcock. ``Some will say it wasn't full possession. Whatever. He
scored the goal. And when it all comes out, Brett Hull is just an
incredible story, what it took for him to play.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Hitchcock, Hull played with a left knee torn apart
and both major groin muscles pulled. With proper rehabilitation,
said Hitchcock, Hull might be able to start the season in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played on one leg and no groins,'' said Hitchcock. ``On the
winning goal, he limped to the corner and he limped to the front of
the net. With the left knee blow and both groins finished. Tough
shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull was brought to Dallas in the offseason as a free agent,
signing a three-year deal for some $17 million, based on years of
scoring prowess with the St. Louis Blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have all the other ones,'' said Hull, asked to put the
trophy in context with all his other awards. ``This is the biggest
for me. It's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars took a 1-0 lead with 8:09 gone in the first on a Jere
Lehtinen strike that did not have the Sabres looking sharp. Most
surprising of all, it was Buffalo's pillar of strength, Hasek, who
looked the worst. Lehtinen turned by defenseman Darryl Shannon low
in the circle and shoveled off a seemingly harmless shot as Randy
Cunneyworth came racing in to cut the angle. Hasek slid to the near
post for what should have been an easy block, but he didn't cover
enough of the post. The shot squeezed by Hasek's hip and dropped in
for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 32 minutes, through the end of the second period,
the Sabres went on to outshoot the Stars, 22-12. Finally, with only
1:39 to go before the second intermission, Stu Barnes hammered home
the equalizer with a slapper off the rush from the right circle.
Set up by linemate Wayne Primeau, Barnes ripped a one-timer for his
seventh goal of the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   As the overtimes progressed, good scoring opportunities
decreased.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, limping and exhausted, Hull moved in front for the
kill. Brian Holzinger, skating ferociously through the crease, just
missed stripping Hull of the puck. Perhaps the greatest scoring
sniper in the game's history, Hull held his ground, tiptoed in and
out of the crease area and finally shoveled home the biggest goal
of his career.
</P>
<P>
   The league now will have to explain to the hockey world how it
let stand a goal that should not have counted. The league is
expected in the next few days to modify the man-in-the-crease rule,
in order to let stand the type of goal Hull scored _ a goal where
his encroachment in the crease was insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, in a postgame news conference, maintained the goal stood
because Hull maintained possession of the puck the entire time he
was in the crease area.

   COLOGNE, Germany President Clinton headed for a two-day swing
through the war-torn Balkans, after agreeing with Russian President
Boris Yeltsin Sunday to rekindle long-stalled efforts to reduce
their nuclear arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   The two men met here during a day of personal diplomacy that
wound up the annual summit of the leaders of the so-called Group of
Eight industrial powers. They pledged to mend U.S.-Russia relations
-- worn threadbare by disagreements over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a meeting of renewal,'' said Sandy Berger, the White
House national security adviser. ``The two countries are back in
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton travels Monday to the former Yugoslav republic of
Slovenia, to showcase democratic and economic reforms in that tiny
Balkan state and to spotlight plans for massive foreign aid to help
rejuvenate a region reeling from nearly a decade of war.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he is scheduled to visit Aviano Air Base in Italy to
address U.S. pilots and air crews that participated in the NATO air
campaign and to make a hop across the Adriatic to visit refugee
camps in Macedonia, along its border with Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when the last of Serbia's armed forces pulled out of
Kosovo, Yeltsin invited Clinton to Moscow and agreed to reopen a
Nixon-era treaty that limits missile defense systems. The offer
satisfies a months-old Clinton request.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the fighting is over, we need to make friends
again,'' Yeltsin told reporters as he arrived here to attend the
G-8 summit and to meet separately with Clinton. ``This is the most
important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reciprocated by consenting to reopen talks on the START
III treaty, a potential roadmap to the next generation of nuclear
weapons cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin surprised Clinton with an unexpected gift: a thick
report, in Russian, on Soviet-era intelligence reports on former
President John F. Kennedy and his 1963 assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton beamed as the two leaders sat across from each other at
a rectangular table, aides at their sides, and said, ``You know,
this is the 17th meeting that we've had.''
</P>
<P>
   As Yeltsin urged that a high-level U.S.-Russia commission be
revived, after three months of Kosovo-related dormancy, Clinton
nodded enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let them get together as fast as they can and get down to
business, and help Secretary Albright,'' Yeltsin said, as Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright sat smiling at Clinton's side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Clinton said. ``Yes. Da.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told Yeltsin that the Kosovo conflict had sorely tested
U.S.-Russian ties and that the relationship ``survived the test,''
said Berger, who called the hour-long session ``one of the best,''
ever between the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton defended Yeltsin against assertions that he
looked bloated, often appeared to slur his words and suffered a
gait to uneven he had to be steadied by aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was strong, forceful and looking toward the future,''
Clinton told CNN shortly after his meeting with Yeltsin. ``He was
clear, concise and direct and strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Yeltsin met following the adjournment of the annual
summit of leaders from the G-8 countries. Besides the United States
and Russia, the group includes Britain, Canada, France, Germany,
Italy and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-Russia thaw hasn't completely melted months of
contention over NATO's 78-day air war against the Serbs. Moscow
bitterly opposed the military strikes by an alliance formed half a
century ago to defend Western Europe against the former Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo has left some scars,'' Berger said, ``presumably on
both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Yeltsin, however, deliberately avoided talk of the
Kosovo disputes including Russia's precipitous troop deployment to
the airport at the provincial capital of Pristina in advance of
NATO peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders decided to skip over that incident, which
threatened to pit Russian forces against NATO troops on the ground
and raised still unanswered questions about Yeltsin's control over
his military.
</P>
<P>
   ``It simply would have diverted this meeting into a rehash of
recriminations on both sides,'' said Berger. ``The president was
determined ...to focus on rebuilding the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting appeared to have broken the ice on what many U.S.
analysts regard as the single most critical area of the
relationship: the reduction and safeguarding of Russia's nuclear
arsenal. How far the thaw goes toward bringing about actual change,
however, remains dependent upon the domestic politics of both
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin agreed to reopen the Anti-Ballistic Missile, or ABM
treaty, originally negotiated by President Richard Nixon. The
treaty, as later amended, permits each country to have only one
site, with no more than 100 launchers, for missiles capable of
knocking down attack rockets from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   That flies in the face of a plan making its way through Congress
for the United States to build a broad-based anti-missile defense
system, which could deploy thousands of weapons from sites around
the country for protection against incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Congress are looking toward developing the details
of such a system by next June.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton agreed to move forward with working level
talks over START III (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) before the
end of the summer. But the White House was vague on the import of
the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said decisive negotiations on the treaty would remain on
hold until Russia's legislature ratifies the START II treaty. The
expert-level talks, however, could grease the rails for swift
action on START III once the earlier treaty is ratified, said
Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Later, though, Clinton said he and Yeltsin expected to engage in
START III negotiations before the end of the year, ``even as we
work to get START II ratified.''
</P>
<P>
   That appeared to raise the prospect that the next treaty could
be prepared, if not formalized, before Duma ratification of START
II.
</P>
<P>
   Signed by the Bush administration just two weeks before Clinton
took office, START II was ratified by the Senate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, the Russian Duma has yet to ratify the
treaty, which some Russians believe would cost the country money
while reducing its security. The Duma stalemate on START II has, in
turn, put U.S. negotiations on START III on hold.

<P>
   KOSOVO-RDP (Podujevo) _ The last of some 40,000 Serb forces left
Kosovo on Sunday a few hours ahead of NATO's deadline for
withdrawal, leaving in their wake new scenes of jubilation among
the province's Albanians, as well as new acts of retribution. With
the withdrawal completed, NATO's secretary-general, Javier Solana,
announced that he had lifted the alliance's threat to resume
bombing, formally ending an air war that lasted 78 days and
culminated with the occupation of Kosovo by NATO-led peacekeepers
over the last eight days. By Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-SUMMIT (Cologne) _ Leaders of the G7 nations and Russia
outlined on Sunday a plan for ending eight years of war in the
Balkans through a massive program of aid and political support for
the region, but said Yugoslavia must undertake ``democratic and
economic reforms'' to be part of the process. At the end of a
three-day summit meeting, the leaders of Britain, France and
Germany said democratic reform in Yugoslavia involved the departure
of Milosevic; but in deference to Russia no explicit reference to
the Serbian leader was included in the final statement. By Roger
Cohen.

CLINTON-YELTSIN SUMMIT SETS STAGE FOR THEIR SUCCESSORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ President Clinton and Russian President Boris
Yeltsin set the cornerstone Sunday for future U.S.-Russian
cooperation and to rebuild Russia's ties with the West to allay an
anti-western backlash in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The presidents raced through their first meeting, the first
since a near break-up over Kosovo, and made tradeoffs on nuclear
arms control, economic ties, debt relief and steps to spotlight
their understudies and possible successors.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Russian television, Clinton underscored
U.S. efforts to address Russia's concerns and declared that the
United States remains committed to ``a strong, successful,
democratic Russia, fully participating in world affairs and a
leadership role.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Yeltsin, at their 17th meeting since April 1993,
deliberately skipped mention of Russian troops' defiant seizure of
the airfield in the Kosovo capital of Pristina that led to a
week-long impasse over Russian participation in the 50,000-strong
international security force.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to the U.S. embassy staff in Bonn, Clinton said:
``The summit gave us a chance to work on what we have in common.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's waxen appearance, his clumsy body movements and
slurred speech during a photo session fanned continuing questions
over his health. Yeltsin coughed deeply and loudly. He slipped his
arm through the arm of German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder for
support after being greeted with a bear hug by Schroeder, the host
of the Group of Eight nations' summit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a post summit interview with CNN, insisted that
Yeltsin ``was neither erratic nor shaky today,'' adding: ``He was
strong, clear, forceful and looking to the future.''
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger said Clinton
and Yeltsin acknowledged their partnership suffered ``some scars''
during the NATO-led 78-day bombing campaign against Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, a Russian ally.
</P>
<P>
   But the leaders agreed ``it was now time to turn to the future
and spend the remaining period'' in their terms to ``getting things
done for the United States and Russia,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Berger added: ``The two countries are back in business,''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Yeltsin summit coincided with the completion of
Serbian troop withdrawal from Kosovo. That enabled NATO to formally
declare an end to the air campaign that had been a thorn in the
U.S.-Russian relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian leader appeared to respond to Clinton's focus on the
future and extended a surprise invitation to Clinton to visit
Moscow this fall. White House officials said Clinton hoped to
accept even though, by tradition, it is Yeltsin's turn to visit the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Both Vice President Al Gore and Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin won boosts to their future political fortunes with
Yeltsin's decision to immediately resume twice-yearly U.S.-Russian
meetings of the Cabinet-level commission led by the vice president
and the Russian prime minister. Officials said Gore and Stepashin
will convene their first meeting since the Kosovo crisis in July.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin, a Yeltsin protege named to power in May, could seek
the presidency in Russia's June 2000 presidential elections.
Stepashin also could be thrust into leadership if Yeltsin becomes
disabled, governing the country for three months until a new
president is elected.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders agreed on a broad range of issues.
</P>
<P>
   _ ARMS CONTROL _ Clinton responded to Yeltsin's eagerness for
quick action on a cost-cutting START III treaty by agreeing to
intensify expert-level discussions on a warhead-cutting accord even
before the Russian parliament ratifies the START II.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has been unable to win ratification of the
seven-year-old START II treaty from the communist-controlled
Russian parliament despite approval by the U.S. Senate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin is so eager for action that he insisted that
U.S.-Russian experts report back to respective Cabinet ministers by
July 30.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Yeltsin agreed to begin discussions with Clinton at
their next summit on U.S. proposals to overhaul the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty (ABM) to permit U.S. deployment of a
limited anti-missile defense system to counter missile launches by
rogue nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration plans to decide next June on whether
to begin deployment of a limited anti-missile defense by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War-era ABM accord limits the United States and the
Soviet Union to single anti-missile sites with no more than 100
anti-missile launchers.
</P>
<P>
   _ KOSOVO: Clinton agreed to Yeltsin's request that a greater
share of day-to-day European security-related affairs _ including
civilian reconstruction of Kosovo _ be handled through the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the
U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has rejected western allies' insistence that Russia deal
with the U.S.-dominated 19-nation North Atlantic Treaty
Organization where Russia has only consultative, non-voting status.
</P>
<P>
   _ ECONOMICS: On economic issues, Clinton offered to examine with
allied leaders Russia's request for an eventual write-off of
Russia's $69 billion in Soviet-era debt _ 48 percent of the $145
billion owed by Russia to western creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told Yeltsin that even if he was unable to win allied
agreement ``we at least would be able to reschedule the debt,''
Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also promised Yeltsin that he would go back to Congress
to seek repeal of the Cold War-era Jackson-Vanik amendment that
restricts U.S. economic assistance to Russia. Clinton told Yeltsin
that Congress will resist repeal until the Kremlin discourages
anti-Semitic actions and rhetoric by Yeltsin's political rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin replied: ``Provide me with all of the material you have
(on anti-Semiticism) and I will really sit on them.''
</P>
<P>
   _ KENNEDY ASSASSINATION: Yeltsin turned over to Clinton a packet
of declassified Soviet-era documents unearthed in an extensive
search of Kremlin military and civilian archives that relate to the
assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Harvey Oswald, identified by the Warren Commission as the
lone gunman who murdered Kennedy, had once lived in the Soviet
Union.

 &HT;    Southern attitudes are changing, poll shows
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While the South has long been viewed as a crucible of
racial intolerance, a recent poll shows a majority of whites in the
region saying they favor integration. But white Southerners'
support still lags that of whites in other regions and of black
Southerners who continue to overwhelmingly endorse a racially mixed
society.
</P>
<P>
   In The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Southern Focus Poll taken
this spring, 56 percent of Southern whites voiced their approval of
integration. In a similar poll eight years ago, 47 percent of
whites said they approved of integration.
</P>
<P>
   Also significant: Southern whites seem less ambivalent about
their feelings toward integration. In 1991, 42 percent of whites
said they favored ``something in between'' integration and strict
segregation.The number of whites who now say they feel that way has
dropped to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, however, Southern whites were less likely to favor
integration than whites living in other parts of the country, where
71 percent said they supported the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Among Southern blacks, support for integration _ which for many
was seen as a way of securing racial equity _ has remained
steadfast. Sixty-seven percent of blacks who participated in the
earlier poll said they favored integration, compared to 69 percent
in the poll this spring.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of integration, the poll also found a wide
disparity between natives and newcomers to the South. About 55
percent of lifelong Southerners, black and white, support
integration compared with 70 percent of respondents who have lived
in the South 10 years or less. Like sex and money, race is still an
issue some people find hard to talk about openly and honestly.
Taking that into account, many of the questions in the race
relations poll were framed to provide respondents with ``wiggle
room'' _ an opportunity to express themselves candidly without
feeling pressured.
</P>
<P>
   While pollsters say taking the racial pulse of the South is a
difficult task because people find it hard to talk about the topic
openly and honestly, there are numerous signs of change, what some
might even call progress:
</P>
<P>
   A vast majority of blacks and whites in the South said they felt
either ``very, or pretty comfortable'' interacting with people of
other races.
</P>
<P>
   While 35 percent of Southerners say the racial makeup of their
neighborhoods remained stable, about a quarter of respondents said
their communities were becoming more racially and ethnically mixed.
</P>
<P>
   About 84 percent of Southerners now say they favor teaching
children about diversity to eliminate racism.
</P>
<P>
   More results from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution Southern
Focus Poll and an online forum can be found at www.ajc.com.

 &HT;    A comfort zone at arm's length
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ We believe in integration, but the reality still
eludes us.
</P>
<P>
   We claim to be comfortable with other races, but for many that
comfort is usually at arm's length.
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to interracial dating and marriage _ the most
ancient of America's racial taboos _ our aversions have diminished,
not disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   As part of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's ongoing Southern
Focus Poll, we asked more than 1,300 people in the South and other
parts of the country about their racial attitudes, hoping to
discover how race affects their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was an Alabama man who considers blacks and whites a
different species, and says they should simply avoid each other.
</P>
<P>
   In Memphis, a black college student views whites differently now
after a roommate turned her on to the head-banging lyrics of a
white rock band.
</P>
<P>
   Churchgoers and clerics in Mississippi and Atlanta follow a God
who sees no color, but trying to integrate his flock has tested
their faith.
</P>
<P>
   There was an interracial couple in suburban Atlanta who says
they are raising colorblind kids, while also teaching them to be
proud of their diverse heritage.
</P>
<P>
   In the South, where American slavery took root, the history of
race is marked by centuries of oppression and brutal conflict as
well as periods of progress, tolerance and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that we are still evolving, due in part to an influx
of transplanted Southerners who are slowly reshaping the region's
distinctive racial topography.
</P>
<P>
   But how far has the South really come?
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on four main areas of Southern life _ community,
workplace, church and marriage _ the stories behind the AJC poll
statistics illustrate a tantalizing racial paradox where racial
attitudes and actions have come closer, but still only rarely
intersect.
</P>
<P>
   Community
</P>
<P>
   She grew up in all-black neighborhoods and attended all-black
schools, so Rocena Taylor's crash course in race relations came as
a freshman at the University of Memphis last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was living in a dormitory that was predominantly white,''
says Taylor, 19, a Southern Poll respondent. ``I remember one day
my white suitemate walked in and saw this big jar of Vaseline on my
desk and she said, `Omigod, what do you do with that?' She didn't
know that black people put Vaseline on their skin when they get
ashy.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't much but the incident got them talking, and they still
are. During the semester break, they have written to each other,
and Taylor says the experience has opened her eyes _ and her ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I couldn't stand alternative (music) or rock and
roll, but my roommate was always listening to Aerosmith and I would
listen to it too, especially that one about Armageddon. That's one
of my favorite songs now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor admits her racial attitudes have changed only
slightly. She has few other white friends on campus, still
preferring the company of her black schoolmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think change is slow. We've got a long way to go but at
least we've come this far.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Robb of Jonesboro considers herself a child of ``the
movement'' and says she's come far enough. A former civil rights
activist, she once believed integration would solve America's
racial dilemma, but her idealism has faded. Robb was among 19
percent of Southern blacks polled who favored ``something in
between'' segregation and integration, saying she's no longer sure
a racially blended society is such a great idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think integration as a whole has done more to hurt blacks
than to help us,'' said Robb, 55, who works for a computer
technology company. ``My friends in the movement didn't die so you
could drive a Mercedes, and turn up your nose at other black folks.
We were supposed to be helping each other.''
</P>
<P>
   For Fred Schofield of Dothan, Ala., integration was an outright
mistake, and he doesn't mince words when expressing his feelings
about blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of a small construction company, Schofield, 48, says
his neighborhood is more integrated than he'd like. He's in the
small minority of Southern whites (3 percent) who in responding to
the poll favored segregation.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the poll found that lifelong Southerners tended to
be less enthusiastic about integration than newcomers. About 55
percent of respondents who lived in the South all their lives
favored integration, compared with 70 percent of respondents who
had lived here 10 years or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I'm from the old school,'' Schofield says. ``I don't
personally like blacks and they probably don't like me. I have
three black neighbors within hollering distance of me, but we don't
talk and we're fine just as long as they stay on their side of the
fence and I stay on mine.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sarah Johnson's hometown of Seagoville, Texas, outside
Dallas, race relations don't necessarily translate in black and
white.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says about 70 percent of her neighbors are white, 20
percent Hispanic and 10 percent are black. Her racially
mixedcommunity represents the roughly 70 percent of poll
respondents _ in the North and South _ who say they reside in
integrated neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it may sound like a cliche, but my very best friend is
Hispanic,'' says the 36-year-old public school teacher who
participated in the poll. ``I have friends of all races who have
spent the night with us and I've been to their house for parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said her white neighbors typically express racial views
similar to hers in public. Privately, she suspects they feel much
differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people sometimes pretend that they are
open-minded about race, but they are not really genuine and they
are passing that along to their children,'' Johnson said. ``I know
because my kids have talked to me and told me their friends can't
have a black or Hispanic person in their home, and it just breaks
my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The semi-rural community of Covington, Ga., is less integrated,
but newcomer Bill Hyatt says he likes everything else about the
town where he has recently re-located with his family.
</P>
<P>
   The 47-year-old driver for Federal Express estimates only about
10 percent of his neighbors are black, but he says their race is
unimportant. His opinion was also expressed by 71 percent of fellow
poll respondents living in the South, and 78 percent of those in
other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   A native of an integrated town in New Hampshire who moved to the
South recently, Hyatt also represents 55 percent of newcomers who
said they felt ``very comfortable'' around people of other races,
compared with 45 percent of lifelong Southerners.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how I know I'm not a racist?'' Hyatt asked. ``I could
have a black neighbor and he could be a jerk or a sweetheart, and
I'd tell him how I felt, no matter what race he was. And if he did
that to me, I wouldn't think he was racist because I can be a jerk
sometimes too.''
</P>
<P>
   Race in the workplace
</P>
<P>
   Robert Harding of Dale City, Va., is a 42-year-old information
resources manager for the federal government. He is among the 79
percent of poll respondents who was pleased with their employer's
diversity training program, even though he says such programs are
only ``window dressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Harding said he is one of two black people in his 12-member
department who hold a master's degree, but despite his advanced
education he's paid $7,000 less than white co-workers who have only
high school diplomas. He has filed a complaint with the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission that is pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love for life to be totally fair, and maybe
affirmative action hurts some white people. But huge masses of
black people have already been hurt so I don't have any sympathy
for those arguments.''
</P>
<P>
   Harding says he thinks his office is typical of others around
the country where blacks and whites, at best, maintain a water
cooler cordiality that rarely extends beyond the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't listen to the same music and we don't watch the same
TV shows,'' says Harding. ``We go out to lunch and stuff, but that
doesn't lead to us going out socially, or really being friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Callahan of Dublin, Ga., is a 28-year-old bartender at
Peg Leg Patty's, a local hangout he describes as a melting pot of
different races that get along well with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Although he supports diversity training and other workplace
programs aimed at improving race relations, he has doubts about
affirmative action. He was among the 56 percent of white Southern
males in the poll who say it leads to reverse discrimination
against white men.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan, who was born in Savannah, also echoed the sentiments
of 48 percent of lifelong Southerners who said affirmative action
hurts whites compared with 39 percent of newcomers who agreed.
</P>
<P>
   race isnt a factor in HOPE scholarships; it's strictly grades;
either this guy's ignorant or he just meant a regular scholarship
``White men don't scream that it's unfair; we're willing to work
hard and pay our own way,'' says Callahan. ``I think affirmative
action deals more with the problem than the cure.''
</P>
<P>
   Church
</P>
<P>
   Episcopal bishop James A. Pike once dubbed Sunday at 11 a.m.,
when many people are in worship services, ``the most segregated
hour in American life.'' Thirty years after his death, that seems
to be changing.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 721 Southern respondents who attended religious services,
about 70 percent of whites and 60 percent of blacks said they
worshipped with people of other races.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Kathi Martin of Stone Mountain says these poll results
sound promising, but she has a problem: ``I don't believe it,'' she
says bluntly. ``I just don't believe it's that high.''
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons for her doubts. Two months ago, Martin founded
the God, Self, Neighbor Ministries at an established church in
Virginia-Highland, where she is hoping to attract a racially mixed,
multicultural congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who is black, hired a white music director and began
reaching out to whites and blacks through newspaper ads and
pamphlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some whites who came the first week, but they haven't
come back on a consistent basis. It's disheartening because that's
not our vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin pins those difficulties on history and culture: Black and
white churches tend to have different styles of worship, and those
traditions are passed on through generations.
</P>
<P>
   That's no excuse for Christians, Martin says, because of a
larger mandate that should put them on the front lines of racial
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can be a good Christian if you go to an all-white
or all-black church,'' she says. ``But I'm not sure if you can be
fully human unless you connect beyond those boundaries. We are the
people of God and we have to break down those barriers.''
</P>
<P>
   At poll respondent's Rose Washington's all-black United
Methodist church in Lexington, Miss., the congregation is trying to
do just that. They regularly visit churches in white communities,
and invite them to visit their church. It's busing in the name of
the Lord.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess because we're in a black neighborhood, white people
might not want to come here,'' said Washington, a 37-year-old
mental health consultant. ``I understand that because when we first
started visiting other churches, I felt uncomfortable. Now it
doesn't bother me at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Dating and marriage
</P>
<P>
   In some parts of the South, marrying someone of another race _
or miscegenation _ was once forbidden by culture and by law.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the Alabama state legislature repealed its
100-year-old ban on interracial marriage, becoming the last state
do so. The constitutional amendment must be approved by voters.
</P>
<P>
   Although the laws have all but vanished, the Southern Poll found
whites still six times more likely to say they would disapprove of
a relative dating or marrying someone of another race.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, Southerners were far more likely to disapprove of
interracial marriage: only 8 percent of newcomers said they would
disapprove of an interracial marriage in their family compared with
25 percent of respondents who lived their entire lives in the
South.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Roy Lancaster had felt the sting of disapproval before.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 25, I was engaged to a full-blooded Arapaho and my
family told me to go out and find a white woman, so I did,'' says
Lancaster, a 37-year-old pipe maker from Sands Springs, Okla. ``My
father is a preacher and he says you're supposed to stay with your
own race. I don't argue with him when it comes to the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   Unrepentant segregationist Fred Schofield of Alabama puts it
this way: ``A cow doesn't marry a hog, does it? Animals have sense
enough to stay with their own species.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schofield is in the minority of those polled. About 62
percent of whites and 92 percent of blacks in the South said they
would not disapprove of an interracial marriage in their own
families, or that it would make no difference.
</P>
<P>
   Although the practice remains fairly rare among whites, the same
is not true for blacks. In the South, 52 percent of blacks said a
family member married someone of another race, compared with 24
percent of whites in the South and North.
</P>
<P>
   Luke Szerbinsky, 22, knows how it feels to be a white minority.
Born in a racially mixed Chicago neighborhood, it was no big deal
dating his black or Latino classmates. But when he moved to DeKalb
County as a teenager, other whites and blacks branded him ``a
wigger'' _ a slang term for a white person who tries to ``act
black.''
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 71 percent of of newcomers to the South have had a
relative who dated someone of another race compared with 44 percent
of Southerners. Lifelong Southerners were also three times more
likely than newcomers to disapprove of someone in their family
dating interracially.
</P>
<P>
   ``People down here are not exposed to that kind of thing,'' said
Szerbinsky of Stone Mountain, whose black girlfriend is the mother
of his 22-month-old daughter. ``You can tell you're really not
accepted, and I still get the looks every now and then if we go to
a real nice restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   They met and got married in New York 13 years ago, Suruba
Ibumando and Howell Wechsler, a black writer from the Republic of
Congo and a Jewish research scientist. They didn't agonize over
about what others might think. But before moving to the Atlanta
area, they worried that their family would be confronted by blacks
who thought she had betrayed her race, and whites who still
considered blacks inferior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was apprehensive because of the history of slavery and I
heard stories about people harassing interracial couples,'' said
Suruba Wechsler, 43. ``I prepared myself, and said if anybody says
or does anything to us, that's their problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple says they haven't encountered any difficulties, but
they are concerned about their two children in elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if children born to interracial couples would have unique
problems, 81 percent of Southern whites and 56 percent of blacks
agreed. A similar percentage of Northern blacks and whites answered
the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes young kids will see me and my son Alex, who is
dark-skinned and they'll do a double take and say, ``That's your
dad?'' Wechsler said. ``I don't think they mean any harm. Of all
the things that could happen to them, a double take doesn't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids are just kids,'' says his wife. ``They know they are
African. They know they are American and they are Jews. They are
proud to be all three. When people ask us questions, I tell them
the truth: My kids are beautiful.''
</P>

Journal-Constitution. More results from this poll can be seen at

   &UR; HOW DOES THE CALIFORNIA GARDEN GROW? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If politics were a garden, posited state Attorney General
 &UR; Bill Lockyer &LR; , commencement speaker at McGeorge School of Law in
Sacramento (as reported by the Los Angeles Times):
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR; Jerry Brown &LR;  would be bamboo. The introduction seemed like a
good idea at the time, but you can't get rid of the stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR; Bob Dornan  &LR; would be an avocado, green on the outside,
essentially a nut within.''
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR; Willie Brown &LR;  would be sweet corn, (which) provides an earful
and carries a lot of greenery, sucks up all nutrients in the
vicinity.''

   `` &UR; Pete Wilson &LR;  would be iceberg lettuce; big head, difficult to

<P>
   &UR; WHITE HOUSE MAKES NEW YEARS PLANS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration was waiting until July 4 to announce
plans of a mega-centennial celebration in Washington, but the Wall
Street Journal jumped the gun last week, reporting that the
Clintons are planning a $10 million gala on the Washington Mall.
</P>
<P>
   This celebration, to be paid for by private donations, will
include live music produced by  &UR; Quincy Jones &LR;  and a 17-minute film
created by  &UR; Steven Spielberg &LR;  and narrated by big Bill himself.
Music for the film will be composed by  &UR; John Williams &LR; , who writes
music for most Spielberg movies.
</P>
<P>
   Fund-raiser  &UR; Terence McAuliffe &LR;  says that big corporations who
donate money will be recognized and identified. ``I don't see this
thing competing at all with other Democratic causes,'' he said.
``Clearly this is not about politics.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - A bogus eBay auction for 200 pounds of cocaine was pulled off
the site after being posted for 18 hours, reports MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Mark Hetts &LR; , author of a syndicated home repair column for
Universal Press Syndicate, is the sort of professional to have
noticed that the ``small rubber debris filter in the base of
urinals in men's rooms at Universal Studio's City Walk mall (in Los
Angeles) are imprinted with the words, `Just Say No to Drugs.'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Camryn Manheim &LR;  will be Lane Bryant's first celebrity
spokesperson this fall, reports Advertising Age.
</P>
<P>
   - The Milanese newspaper Corriere Della Sera has clarified its
report that  &UR; Daniel Day-Lewis  &LR; was apprenticed to a shoemaker,
saying that in fact, he was ordering several pairs of custom-made
shoes, had several fittings, and found the process so interesting
that he returned on his own several times to watch them being made.
</P>
<P>
   - This weekend's royal wedding reminded  &UR; Al Guthertz &LR;  of
standing in front of Buckingham Palace waving to royal newlyweds
 &UR; Andrew  &LR; and  &UR; Sarah &LR; , when he realized that kids next to him ``were
looking into my face instead of up at the balcony,'' and his pocket
was picked. In related travel news,  &UR; Agnes Chen Brown &LR;  writes from
St. Petersburg that she was standing in a crowd, worried about her
possessions, looking at a boy of 12 or so who said to her in
perfect English, ``I'm not going to steal your bag.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GUYS WITHOUT CLOTHES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - A new but instantly famous series of TV ads for Beyond.com
features an actor the ad calls  &UR; Reed Woodson &LR; , working at home
totally naked, thanks to his great software (and thanks to TV
digitalization in the crotch area). The ad was created by San
Francisco agency Leagas Delaney, and the name ``Reed Woodson'' is
that of a 26-year-old ad man.
</P>
<P>
   Woodson knew the theme of the spot, he told Personals, ``but
didn't know that my name was going to go in there until I saw it on
TV. It was a nice surprise, in a way. In this business, everyone
likes notoriety. This is one way to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodson's mother thinks ``It's one of my greatest business
accomplishments to date.''
</P>
<P>
   - Nude Recreation Week, July 5 through 11, will be celebrated
with Dress Poker games at the Olive Dell Ranch in Colton, Calif
CA &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Frank Moonan  &LR; is relieved at the Journal of Urology's report
that the old saw about men becoming temporary impotent as a result
of wearing briefs isn't true. Temperatures inside both styles of
underwear are barely different, and the sperm swims (breaststroke)
with the same fervor regardless.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``No! Not at all! Tommy has been neutered or spayed. What do you

 &HT;    MONASTERY A REFUGE FOR IN THE TROUBLED BALKANS
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   DECANI, Kosovo Offering a tranquil campus behind a massive stone
gatehouse, the Serbian Orthodox Visoki Decani monastery is a refuge
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But, the Monks here measure time in centuries, so as they
completed the first Sunday mass since NATO troops moved in to
Kosovo, they had little hope for a quick peace in the burned and
bloodied towns around them.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the monastery gate, monks brought tea to the Italian
NATO troops standing guard next to a tank. Inside, birds chirped
and a monk tended to his bee hives.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the town nearby of Decani is in almost complete ruin
and mass graves of Albanians foul the air in several spots along
this stretch of road.
</P>
<P>
   A couple weeks ago, the monastery was refuge to about 150 ethnic
Albanians fleeing the terror and murder of Serb troops. Most of
their fellow Albanians had fled to other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Serb troops completed their withdrawal from the
province, 15 Serb civilians were in the monastery for safety. They
fear a return to their homes could leave them vulnerable to
Albanian revenge. About 20 Gypsies also had taken shelter in the
Monastery; in the past Gypsies often have cooperated with the
ruling Serbs here.
</P>
<P>
   One of 20 monks in residence, Abbot Theodosie _ he would not
give family name _ commented to journalists on the many calamities
that have befallen the region since the monastery was built 665
years ago. They include the Turkish conquest and 500 year
occupation, the mass emigration of the Austro-Hungarian wars, the
Italian occupation of World War II and Communism.
</P>
<P>
   He gestured to the stately domed church, handsome in soft
horizontal stripes of cream and rose marble.
</P>
<P>
   ``This church remembers a lot of things,'' he said. ``Today we
have a similar situation as many times before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have been done without any reason. (There has been)
conflict that has not been good for anyone,'' he said. ``First we
were witness to the exodus of the Albanian people. Now we are
witness to the exodus of the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   A 64-year-old Serb man approached visitors with a letter signed
by three Albanians attesting that he was not a looter or murderer.
But, he is afraid to go home.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Patriarch Pavle, the head of the Serbian Orthodox
Church, took the unprecedented step of calling for the resignation
of Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic, who led the Serb
onslaught in Kosovo. He also urged Serbs to stay in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For inspiration, Pavle moved the seat of the church from
Belgrade to Pec, a city in Kosovo which has been the home of the
church several times since the 14th Century.
</P>
<P>
   The church complex in Pec is sheltering more than 100 Serbs.
But, Albanians do not see the church in Pec, at times the
instrument of Serb nationalism, as benevolent.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sunday, a nun who spotted two Albanians accompanying
foreign journalists was far from welcoming. ``Look at the Albanians
trying to come here, acting like foreigners,'' she hissed within
earshot.
</P>
<P>
   Ekram Ceku, Pec commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army, said
last week that church officials apologized to him for the Serbian
carnage. The apology rang hollow to him, coming now from the
vanquished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making a declaration and doing something is two different
things,'' Ceku said.
</P>
<P>
   But, the monastery at Decani has a reputation for kindness
worthy of its quiet splendor.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the church are brilliant, original frescos. The face of
Jesus looks down from the dome high above heavy marble pillars as
if it is afloat. One fresco shows a scale balance, with an angel on
the left, the devil on the right and a naked human in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, people have gone away from God and in this sense
they have gone away from each other,'' Abbot Theodosie said of the
recent carnage.
</P>
<P>
   He said he sees no end to the cycle of violence between Serbs
and Albanians. ``But, God can see it,'' he said, ``And we pray for
him to bring reason to peoples' minds.''

FATHER DIVES DEEP FOR ANSWERS IN SON'S DEATH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Va., Wash.) 
 
By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ At a U.S. Coast Guard station on Tuesday, Peter
Pilkington will begin to get the answers he has sought since his
son died more than three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to know why Brian Pilkington, a healthy, 23-year-old
commercial diver inspecting an offshore oil rig in 28 feet of
water, suddenly died in March 1996 off Sabine Pass.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to know why the Coast Guard, the federal agency in
charge of marine safety, conducted what he considers a shoddy
investigation into his son's death while working for a small
Houston dive contractor. It was an inquiry in which no witnesses
were interviewed or any piece of diving equipment examined or
retained by officials, Pilkington said.
</P>
<P>
   And he wants to know why two Coast Guard officers allowed the
dive to take place, even though they had cited the Cliff's Number
12 offshore rig, operated by a Houston-based drilling company, for
safety violations that day because a required predive safety
inspection had not been completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have fought to get this hearing for the last three years,''
said Pilkington, a 51 year-old architect and building contractor
from the Seattle suburb of Bellevue, Wash. ``It was unconscionable
to me that ... after this young man died ... there was no
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a single witness was ever interviewed by the U.S. Coast
Guard until three years and four days after the accident,'' said
Pilkington, referring to interviews taken in advance of Tuesday's
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony from 10 to 15 witnesses is expected to begin Tuesday
morning in Beaumont, Texas, where the U.S. Coast Guard is convening
a formal board of investigation, revisiting the initial inquiry
conducted after the young diver died March 4, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard officials say the decision to reopen the inquiry was
the result of information provided by Pilkington, who has conducted
a costly three-year campaign to find out what happened to his son.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard officers in Port Arthur, Texas, had determined, in a
report issued 13 months after the accident, that Brian Pilkington
had improperly attached an airhose, allowing water into his diving
helmet, and that he panicked after becoming entangled on the rig
causing him to drown.
</P>
<P>
   But Pilkington said a poorly maintained air compressor failed
near the end of his son's three-hour dive, cutting off his air
supply.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard officials did not examine the compressor, allowing
the dive contractor to remove it. Employees of a Houston equipment
dealer who examined the compressor told Pilkington it failed
because a shop rag being used as an air filter was sucked into the
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Pilkington has filed complaints with state bar officials against
the lawyers for the rig owner, Cliff Drilling Co. of Houston,
claiming they concealed evidence and made up the story about his
son disconnecting his air supply to limit their client's liability.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys did not return a call from the Houston Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, his son's widow accepted a multimillion-dollar
settlement in a civil lawsuit she brought against the company and
the contractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly will be looking into the Coast Guard's conduct as
well,'' said Lt. Commander Tom Beistle, the Coast Guard officer who
will conduct the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the hearing is to investigate the facts
underlying the casualty, to determine if any Coast Guard
regulations were violated,'' said Beistle, adding the inquiry will
also determine ``if Coast Guard (diving) regulations are
appropriate and need to be amended to better promote marine
safety.''
</P>
<P>
   During his private three-year inquiry, Pilkington said he not
only learned the tragic and preventable circumstances of his son's
death but the often hazardous working conditions facing commercial
divers across the country.
</P>
<P>
   He and others, including a nationwide commercial diver's trade
group, say the Coast Guard has done a poor job of protecting divers
although it has the legal tools _ in two sets of federal safety
regulations _ to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're (Coast Guard) not enforcing the regulations. All the
players in the industry agree on one thing _ the enforcement is not
being done,'' said Frances Stepp, president of the National
Association of Commercial Divers in Charlottesville, Va. ``The
Coast Guard is not going out and investigating these casualties and
accidents like they ought to.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics charge the Coast Guard rarely takes action against
commercial diving firms found to have violated federal safety
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``My point is not to put anyone in jail,'' explained Pilkington.
``But if the Coast Guard continues to let them violate the law
without punishing them, what's to keep them from continuing to
violate the law? Nothing! ... They (divers) refer to the Coast
Guard as the big dog with no teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regulations are there, we're only asking them to enforce
the existing regulations. We also think there ought to be a few
more for (requiring) back-up divers, back-up equipment and
certification'' of commercial divers.
</P>
<P>
   Back-up equipment is not required for commercial diving in less
than 130 feet of water, but maybe could have saved Brian
Pilkington's life.
</P>
<P>
   Since the dive team did not have a scuba tank or extra air hose
with them, those on board the rig spent 20 minutes trying to splice
together welding hoses to use in a rescue attempt.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, a fellow diver simply held his breath and dived down
and found Brian Pilkington's lifeless body. He was airlifted to a
Port Arthur hospital where he died.
</P>
<P>
   Pilkington contends the Coast Guard's investigating officers
never visited the accident scene, did not question any witnesses in
person or take any sworn statements and refused to examine or
secure any evidence. And when Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., inquired
about the investigation, the Coast Guard claimed the compressor had
been tested _ and later issued a letter of apology about the
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   And it was only June 14 that OSHA inspectors visited the offices
of G &AMP; G Marine _ the Houston dive company Brian Pilkington worked
for _ to examine the records on required maintenance and testing of
the company's three air compressors currently being used.
</P>
<P>
   In a sworn statement taken May 19, conducted in Houston by Lt.
Cdm. Beistle, company owner Danny Gilbert acknowledged he has never
sent his three diving compressors for air quality testing, as
required every six months by federal dive regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert said he couldn't remember if the air compressor Brian
Pilkington was using the day he died had been sent in for required
testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about the three (compressors) that you've got now? Do you
have air tests done on them routinely?'' Beistle asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No sir, we haven't had,'' Gilbert replied, explaining later
his practice is to test compressors by sniffing the air. ``... if
it smells foul, you don't use it ... if the air compressor is
putting out pressure and the air smells good, I'll dive it,''
Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
   Asking if that was a suitable substitute to the required
testing, Gilbert replied, ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert did not return a call from the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   The events of Brian Pilkington's case are all the more important
because diving deaths are not isolated events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the 116 occupational diving fatalities reported to OSHA for
1989-1997 (13 per year), 49 (five per year) occurred among an
estimated 3,000 full-time commercial divers,'' according to a June
1998 weekly mortality report from the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. ``The average of five deaths per year
corresponds to a rate of 180 deaths per 100,000 employed divers per
year, which is 40 times the national average death rate for all
workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard officials in New Orleans said Tuesday that 27 divers
had been killed and 28 had been injured from 1992 to December 1997
in the 8th Coast Guard District, which covers most of the Gulf of
Mexico from Texas to the Florida panhandle and extends north to the
Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   However, after first saying the casualties were the result of
commercial diving, Coast Guard officials Wednesday said they
include both recreational and commercial diving accidents. And,
Coast Guard officials in New Orleans said they could not readily
determine from their own records how many of the 55 incidents, if
any, resulted in sanctions against commercial diving contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coast Guard can't tell you about (commercial) diving
deaths, they keep no statistical information, they have no idea
about how many accidents have occurred. They have nothing, and OSHA
doesn't either,'' said Stepp, the head of the commercial divers
group.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Besides Brian Pilkington's death, there have been other young
commercial divers killed, according to accident records obtained by
Stepp.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, 31-year-old Troy Elwood died two minutes into
his first commercial dive 15 feet beneath a dive boat operated by
Cal Dive International Inc., a large Houston-based commercial
diving firm.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard officials later found a company employee had
fabricated records showing that maintenance had been performed on
faulty valves on the dive boat's air compressors that allowed
Elwood to breath a fatal amount of pure helium instead of
compressed air, according to Coast Guard documents.
</P>
<P>
   No action was taken against the company, Stepp said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was blatant neglect, somebody should be up on murder
charges for this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, Pattison resident Jerry McHazlett, a
35-year-old commercial diver who was married with one son and
expecting another, had a heart attack and died shortly after making
a 200-foot-plus dive below an oil rig in waters offshore of
Louisiana for Cal Dive.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Walker, a Houston attorney who filed suit against the diving
contractor, alleges that McHazlett was not medically fit to dive,
that an inoperative hatch on the diving bell prevented co-workers
from reaching him during the first crucial 20 minutes of the
emergency, and that Cal Dive had no procedures to deal with this
type of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if the divers down there had a procedure, a plan, this
guy's life could have been saved,'' Walker said. ``But they didn't
know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   McHazlett's sudden death occurred when his wife, Tami, was
expecting the couple's second child, John Jerry McHazlett III, born
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two sons who will not know their dad, and he was a
terrific person,'' Tami McHazlett said. ``He had a lot to
contribute, a lot more things to do in life, and I feel that he was
just ripped away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   The young widow is angry, and said Cal Dive officials were not
candid with her about the circumstances of her husband's death. She
had to hire a lawyer to collect the supplemental life insurance
purchased by her husband after Cal Dive refused to pay, claiming
her husband had not filled out an eligibility form.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling I got from the company was just basically `how is
this going to impact our bottom line,''' said McHazlett, referring
to a meeting with company executives a month after her husband's
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no remorse, there was no `This is not going to
happen again.' They didn't take responsibility for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans attorney Patrick Baynham, who is defending Cal Dive,
called the lawsuit frivolous and said McHazlett's autopsy indicated
``he had 100 percent blockage in one artery and 95 percent blockage
in the other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To say this is somehow related to Cal Dive procedures is
absolutely ridiculous,'' said Baynham. The attorney said CPR was
begun immediately on McHazlett by his co-diver, with only brief
interruptions as the co-diver cleaned debris from the hatch so it
would seal properly before the diving bell was brought to the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Baynham, who has handled the majority of Cal Dive's legal work
over the last five years, said the Houston diving firm is one of
the world's largest and safest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like all these diving companies, they have an extensive safety
program. (And) Cal Dive has extensive training, both prior to going
offshore and once someone is offshore,'' Baynham said.
</P>
<P>
   Another fatal diving accident occurred in May 1997 when Brent
Lewis, a 24-year-old diver, died after his air hose was severed as
he blew silt from beneath the Lady of the Isle casino boat near
Bossier City, La.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA investigators found the water intakes on the underwater
pump Lewis was operating were fitted with a makeshift rope guard,
allowing his air hose to be sucked in and cut. The diving company,
Cal Dive, contested OSHA's proposed $4,500 fine and paid a $2,250
penalty, according to Stepp's inquiry into the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you call the industry, the ADC, and ask them can they tell
how many deaths there have been in the last 10 years, they tell you
they have one death a year. But we have documents that stipulate
that is not so,'' said Stepp, who said she had obtained records
from the Coast Guard of five commercial diving deaths in 1997 and
two in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   She was referring to the Association of Diving Contractors
International, a Houston-based industry group formed in 1968 and
representing 360 dive companies, the majority headquartered in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a safe industry,'' insists Ross Saxon, the ADC's
executive director since 1992. ``We are going to have accidents and
fatalities, but all we can do is do our damnedest to continue to
reduce them. I think we have a hell of an excellent track record
and it will get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Saxon said that in the 1960s and 1970s, 10 commercial divers
were killed each year and others seriously injured, prompting the
Coast Guard and OSHA to draft safety regulations with help from the
ADC.
</P>
<P>
   Saxon said in the last decade an average of 1.5 diving deaths
occur per year of commercial divers working for ADC members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say in the last 14 months, as far as member companies of
our association subject to U.S. regulation are concerned, we've not
had a serious injury or a fatality that's been reported,'' Saxon
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Saxon said the Coast Guard's task of overseeing commercial
diving operations is huge, and estimated there are perhaps 50 or 60
taking place each day in U.S. waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could the Coast Guard enforce better? Yes. Are they properly
equipped to do so? Most probably not,'' Saxon said. ``They are an
agency of the government with a tremendously large area of
responsibility, with budget restrictions and they are not trained
in commercial diving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Coast Guard must look to the industry to be
self-regulating.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston attorney Joe Walker, a commercial diver for 10 years
before he went to law school, said the complexity of the commercial
diving industry exceeds the Coast Guard's expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very high burden to place on the Coast Guard, which
does not have a deep diving division; they really don't have the
facilities or the manpower,'' said Walker, who advocates the use of
independent diving experts to investigate diving accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said he is preparing for an August trial in a negligence
case where commercial diver Todd Baldridge, then 28, lost
consciousness and suffered disabilities in a May 1996 accident
during a 258-foot dive from an oil platform in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   An open bottom diving bell, required by federal regulations on
dives of this type, was not in place, said Walker, adding that
Coast Guard investigators did not cite the violation in their
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep seeing the same kind of accidents, over and over,''
Walker said. ``Maybe the only thing that will change that is making
the insurance premiums go up enough where the company will be
forced not to be dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilkington said he hopes the Coast Guard inquiry into his son's
death will result in changes that will prevent more tragic deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me three years and probably $300,000 to get where we
are right now,'' he said. ``Initially, it was to try and clear my
son's name _ now it's to try and make a difference.''

A COLOMBIAN REBEL GROUP STRIKES BOLDLY, BUT REAPS ONLY DISDAIN 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Italy, Germany)   By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Their military capability has been weakened
by a series of reverses on the battlefield, and the government is
ignoring their demands for peace talks. But the National Liberation
Army, Colombia's second largest guerrilla group, has managed to
thrust itself back into the center of national attention here
through a wave of bold and dramatic kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   The abductions have undermined support for the Colombian
government's effort to negotiate a solution to a decades-long
insurgency that has resulted in the deaths of 35,000 Colombians in
just the past ten years. But through its own miscalculations and
ineptness, the National Liberation Army, a Marxist rebel group,
thus far has little to show for its campaign but additional
opprobrium.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas' resurgence began in April, when a group of its
commandos hijacked an Avianca domestic flight with 41 people on
board. That was followed by the abduction of more than 140 people
from a Roman Catholic mass in Cali on May 30 and the kidnapping of
nine members of a sports club as they were fishing on a river near
Barranquilla a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have virtually monopolized Colombian news coverage in
recent weeks by periodically releasing small groups of their
hostages and delivering long harangues against President Andres
Pastrana and his government. On Friday, eight of Avianca captives
were released in just such a ceremony, leaving more than 50 airline
passengers, churchgoers and fishermen still in rebel hands,
including two Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Yet political and military analysts here regard the spate of
kidnappings not as a show of the group's strength but an indication
of its growing debility. Right-wing paramilitary forces are
reported to have made significant advances in recent months against
the rebel units in the north-central region that had been the
rebels' stronghold, nearly wiping them out in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   The peace process launched by Pastrana after he took office last
August, on the other hand, has been almost entirely focused on the
country's largest insurgent group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia, known as FARC. The government has granted the FARC
control over four counties as a good faith gesture, but has
rejected demands by the National Liberation Army that it be
apportioned a similar disarmament zone and largely ignored the
group since the collapse of a preliminary dialogue in Caracas early
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Given the disparity in the government's approach and the
resentment it has generated, many analysts see the recent
kidnappings by the National Liberation Army as little more than an
expression of petulance. ``They are desperately shouting to the
government and Colombian society, `We are here, we exist, don't
forget about us,''' said Armando Borrero, a former national
security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   But as Borrero also noted, the kidnappings have had ``a very
high political cost'' for the smaller rebel group that may
ultimately outweigh their usefulness as a propaganda tool. The Cali
church kidnapping in particular has alienated and outraged
important segments of the Roman Catholic Church that had in the
past shown some sympathy to the National Liberation Army and its
Cuban-inspired program.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Founded in the mid-1960s, the National Liberation Army has
traditionally drawn many of its estimated 5,000 fighters from
adherents of Liberation Theology, a socially conscious form of
Roman Catholicism that combines Christian and Marxist teachings.
Until his death last year, the group was led by Manuel Perez, a
Spanish-born former priest; analysts say Perez' death set off a
power struggle within the high command.
</P>
<P>
   In recent remarks apparently aimed at soothing the Colombian
public, the rebel commanders said that they sent out orders to
units for ``spectacular actions'' but did not specifically approve
the church kidnapping. Military analysts say that explanation is
probably true and view it as a sign of the inability of the rebel's
nominal leadership to enforce discipline within the National
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the army has been ``very fragmented, with acute
ideological disputes and a loose command structure that permits
each unit to obtain its own resources and carry out its own
actions,'' said Alfredo Rangel Suarez, author of the book
``Colombia: War at the end of the Century.'' One faction, he added,
``considers any dialogue with the state to be unrevolutionary,''
and may want to sabotage any prospect of renewing talks with the
government.
</P>
<P>
   In another effort to repair the damage to its image, the group's
senior commander, Nicolas Rodriguez traveled to the Vatican earlier
this month and, according to local press reports, met with a senior
aide to Pope John Paul II, Cardinal Dario Castrillon, a Colombian.
But little seems to have come of that contact: The Vatican
continues to call the kidnapping a ``sacrilege'' and to maintain
its excommunication of those who carried it out.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, rebel leaders have stepped up efforts to
obtain international mediation of their dispute with Pastrana. Key
to their campaign is Germany, and in particular a former minister
of security, Bernd Scmidbauer, and a shadowy former West German
intelligence operative, Werner Mauss, both of whom have been
involved in negotiations to free hostages held by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With its efforts to force the government back to the negotiating
table having apparently failed, the rebels have now taken a new
tack that promises to complicate the situation even further. At the
latest release of passengers from the Avianca flight on Friday, the
group's chief military strategist, Antonio Garcia, acknowledged
that many of the remaining hostages are no longer being held for
political purposes, but simply for ransom.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to financing a war declared by the government,
we think that is legitimate,'' he said. Pastrana responded hours
later with a televised speech condemning ``the extortionist and
delirious position assumed by this armed group'' and stripping the
National Liberation Army of its status as a legitimate ``political
force,'' awarded last year in hopes of encouraging peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel kidnapping campaign comes as Pastrana's government is
still reeling, and the peace process with the larger rebel group,
the FARC, stalled, due to the resignation late last month of
Defense Minister Rodrigo Lloreda. A former presidential candidate
much respected by the military, Lloreda stepped down to protest
government concessions in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   His replacement, Luis Fernando Ramirez Acuna, is close to
Pastrana but has little standing among or experience with the
military. An accountant who was Pastrana's running mate in his
unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 1994, Ramirez was formally
sworn in on Friday, promising to both restructure the Armed Forces
and step up efforts to halt mass kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pastrana is in a tight squeeze, or as they say here, between
the sword and the wall,'' a European diplomat said last week.
``When he doesn't act against the guerrillas, he is condemned, and
when he does, he is also criticized.''

<P>
   LOME, Togo _ A year after winning re-election in voting that was
widely considered tainted, President Gnassingbe Eyadema has
continued to tighten his three-decade hold on his nation's
politics, preserving his status as sub-Saharan Africa's
longest-ruling head of state.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has announced, by presidential decree, the formation of a
new government made up of his longtime loyalists. The announcement
came three months after his party swept parliamentary elections
boycotted by all opposition parties and a month after Amnesty
International released a report describing widespread human rights
abuses in Togo.
</P>
<P>
   Togo is a sliver of a country just east of Ghana with about 5
million people. But despite its size, Eyadema's career has been
watched closely in West Africa for its particular role in the
region's history.
</P>
<P>
   As a 26-year-old sergeant, Eyadema staged post-colonial Africa's
first military coup, in 1963, eventually seizing the presidency for
himself in 1967. When Mobutu Sese Seko was toppled from power two
years ago in the former Zaire, Eyadema became the continent's
longest-serving ruler.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, when West African nations began holding
multiparty elections and Eyadema's grip on power seemed shaky, Togo
experienced a political liberalization with a dilution of
presidential power. But Eyadema succeeded in clinging to power by
pitting opponents against one another and heading one of the
largest armies, per capita, in Africa, foreign officials here said.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, after presidential elections were held and returns
showed Eyadema trailing, one of his generals took over the ballot
counting. Since then, the West has withheld foreign aid that Togo
desperately needs, and relations between the government and
opposition parties have worsened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government line is brotherhood, reconciliation, peace,
love, make nice to everybody,'' said a foreign official here who
observed the March elections. ``But the March elections just
complicated matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the opposition declared that it would boycott the
elections, Eyadema's party, Assembly of the Togolese People, went
ahead with the voting. The party claimed a 66 percent turnout and
victory in 77 out of 79 seats, with the other two going to
independent allies of the president. Foreign observers described
the turnout as less than half that figure and the voting as
tainted.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that a new government has been formed even as
Eyadema is supposed to hold talks next month with opposition
parties. The opposition parties held seats in the former
parliament, though Eyadema's party held the majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can the government be considered legitimate when all the
members are from one party?'' said Emmanuel Akitani Bob, vice
president of the Union of the Forces for Change, the main
opposition party. Standing inside the party's headquarters, which
was ransacked and set on fire by soldiers last August, he added,
``We are pessimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob's organization is led by Gilchrist Olympio, considered by
most to have been the real winner of last June's presidential
elections and now living in exile in London. Olympio is the son of
Sylvanius Olympio, a wealthy businessman who was Togo's president
when he was assassinated in 1963 in the coup led by Eyadema.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Eyadema did not respond to requests for an interview.
In the past, however, the government has denied that the two
elections were rigged.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the government has also attacked Amnesty
International's charges of abuse and political repression. Late
last month, the government barred Amnesty International's secretary
general, Pierre Sane, from entering the country. After the group
accused the Togolese government of detaining and torturing one of
its Nigerian investigators for nine days, the government said the
Nigerian had been held as a suspected drug trafficker.
</P>
<P>
   Although events in the last year amounted to a setback for the
political liberalization in the early 1990s, even political
opponents acknowledge that the Togolese enjoy more freedom than in
the past. The government daily newspaper, Togo Presse, still
consists of photographs of the president and detailed descriptions
of his daily activities, but the cult of personality has died down
compared with the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, there was the naming of two of the capital's most
famous hotels. In January 1974, the president incurred minor
injuries as his plane landed in the northern town of Sarakawa; on
his triumphal drive back to the southern coast, he announced on
February 2 that Togo's main commodity, phosphate, would be
nationalized. The hotels were named Hotel Sarakawa and Hotel 2
Fevrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that a decade ago, I would have never talked openly
about politics with a journalist,'' said Artheme Ahoomey-Zunu, the
secretary of the Togolese Union for Democracy, an opposition party.
``But to have Africa's longest ruling head of state, it's
shameful.''

A TOURIST TOWN FEARS ATTEMPT TO RID ITS LAKE OF PIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTOLA, Calif. _ The latest bad news from Lake Davis has an all
too familiar ring to it.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997, the California Fish and Game Department,
fresh out of ideas for ridding Lake Davis of the northern pike that
for years threatened the state's crucial salmon and trout
populations miles downstream, dumped 76,000 pounds of toxins into
the lake.
</P>
<P>
   The lake treatment, called ``the poisoning'' by residents of
this Sierra Nevada town, was good for the state's fishing industry
but disastrous for Portola, killing the pike but also eliminating
one of Portola's sources of drinking water and jeopardizing its
tourism-dependent economy. Plumas County Supervisor Fran Roudebush
said the poisoning cost the city and county more than $15 million
in lost revenue from tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the toxins dissipated, the lake restocked with trout
and the region once more packed with anglers, pike have again been
spotted in Lake Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Frustration and dread are back, too, settling like a fog on
Portola. The fear is that the state will again shut down Lake Davis
and strangle the city's economy, just when Portola was showing
signs of renewal and people were starting to trust the lake as a
water supply.
</P>
<P>
   Although officials are not yet suggesting that the lake will
have to be treated again, residents are not waiting to see whether
that happens. Town meetings that include briefings on developments
at Lake Davis have been packed. And at the request of the Fish and
Game Department, residents are forming an advisory group that will
include department and city officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about a fish,'' Jim Murphy, Portola's city
administrator, said at a recent town meeting. ``This is about a
water supply. This is about the ability of a community to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone still remembers the rancor that marked the poisoning,
when protesters, including the man who would become mayor two years
later, were arrested after chaining themselves to a buoy in the
middle of the lake.
</P>
<P>
   With the railroad and logging industries that made Portola run
nearly dead now, the town now gains most of its revenue from
tourists who come for the prime fishing in Lake Davis. So while
many residents are exasperated by the recent pike discovery, the
town is officially accepting the Fish and Game Department's offer
to work together.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the city has no choice: The state has final
jurisdiction over its lakes and the tributaries and rivers that
flow out of them. These waterways are home to salmon and Steelhead
trout that Roudebush said bring California $1 billion in revenue
each year and could be decimated should pike _ razor-toothed
predators known to eat snakes, rats and ducklings _ begin to live
and breed in them.
</P>
<P>
   Fish and game biologists are using DNA tests to determine
whether the three fish caught at the end of May, one of which was
carrying eggs that would spawn next spring, survived the chemical
dump or were put in the lake by anglers who enjoy the difficult
catch and meaty taste. But they are sure that pike, which are
native to cold waters in the Midwest, were at one time illegally
introduced to Lake Davis.
</P>
<P>
   They are also determined to find out who did it and when. (Pike
were first found in Lake Davis in 1994). For the last month,
wardens have been conducting an extensive search for leads into
what Fish and Game officials call a crime of ecoterrorism. The
state and city have put up a $30,000 reward for information leading
to the arrest and conviction of people responsible for planting
pike in Lake Davis.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since the latest pike were caught, more than 30 game wardens
have been dispatched to knock on doors, search catches and survey
anglers.
</P>
<P>
   Others in Sacramento are contacting fisheries across the nation
that sell pike and combing Internet chat rooms that specialize in
fishing, looking for people bragging about catching pike in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people out there who want to see pike in Lake
Davis,'' said Steve Martarano, an information officer with the
Department of Fish and Game.
</P>
<P>
   Leads have turned up nothing; the closest officials came was
searching a man's house after he took responsibility on a Reno
radio station for planting the pike. Patrick Foy, a Fish and Game
spokesman, said the caller had lied on the air to get attention.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest concern to residents is whether there are more pike
in Lake Davis and, if so, whether the painful memories of the
poisoning will have to be relived.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials have gone on ``electrofishing'' tours of the
lake, in which Fish and Game officers temporarily stun fish in a
small area with electric shocks and then check the surface for
pike.
</P>
<P>
   Options short of poisoning the lake, should more pike be found,
including draining it, which would also affect tourism but would be
easier to recover from, or putting strong screens or sharp gates
over the lake's dam, which they hope would prevent any pike from
going downstream.
</P>
<P>
   Although the focus here is on the future of Lake Davis and
Portola, residents recognize the need to eliminate pike from the
state.
</P>
<P>
   People here also say they are dealing with an entirely new Fish
and Game Department this time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last time, Fish and Game stepped on our throats and told us
what to do,'' said Terri Nacar, an editor of The Portola Reporter,
who sharply criticized the department in print when pike were last
found in Lake Davis. ``This time they have a totally different
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, residents take heart in the fact that the lake is full
of fish and that even at midmorning on a weekday, a parking lot by
one of its ramps was packed with pickup trucks towing boat
trailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing excellent, excellent up here at Lake Davis,'' said
Lloyd Lambeth, who works at the Gold Rush Sporting Goods Store.

`THE METAPHYSICAL TOUCH': THE MIND-BODY PROBLEM IN VIRTUAL REALITY
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  (DW) 
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Metaphysical Touch'' is a brainy and ingenious story of a
virtual love affair conducted by e-mail. There is no sex of the
fantasy sort that e-mail is sometimes used for, part romance and
part pornography. Physical sex is restricted to what the two
virtual lovers have with others' bodies off-screen.
</P>
<P>
   In Sylvia Brownrigg's novel, on-screen and off-screen correspond
to the two sides of philosophy's mind-body problem. It is
appropriate, since Pi, the woman, is a budding philosopher and
J.D., the man, is knotty-headed enough to be one. Mind wins out in
this speculative fiction, which owes something to Milan Kundera's
novels of thought and eros, and something to Diderot's
philosophical romances.
</P>
<P>
   In a large sense _ recall the saying that the brain is the true
erogenous zone _ J.D.'s and Pi's long dialogue is sexier than
anything either has done in bed. It is love in Dante's ``Paradiso''
mode, disembodied and earth-displacing: Beatrice's ``Love moves me
and makes me speak.'' Except that in this case it is speaking (via
Internet) that makes Pi and J.D. love; more important, it makes
each of them move after each, separately, has bogged down.
</P>
<P>
   The bogging, set out in the first part of the book, begins with
two traumas. For Pi, it is the destruction of all she has in the
great Pasadena fire of 1992: a few possessions, her cat, a nearly
finished dissertation on Kant that was the sensation of the
Berkeley philosophy department, her lovingly collected books and
the notes tucked into or scrawled on each. These were her brain,
her life, her talent, her future.
</P>
<P>
   J.D.'s trauma has been oozing up all his life. He is achingly
perceptive and witty, but this is underwater lighting in a turbid
wash of depression and self-absorption. He inherited them from his
wandering father, along with a dilettantish notion of himself as a
writer.
</P>
<P>
   Undermined by his writing failures, J.D. crumbles when he is
downsized from a modestly satisfying job as a computer instructor.
Ms. Brownrigg, whose thought pings and ricochets off words as if
they were the electric posts on a pinball machine, has no need to
light up the resonance of ``fire'' and ``fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Pi went through the reverse of death. Instead of leaving her
things behind, they left her behind. She can't forgive her
absconding world. Suddenly she is unable to stand books,
philosophy, her old friends, Berkeley. She takes refuge in
Mendocino, an artists' community up the north coast. She stays with
Abbie, a woman going through a divorce, and her 7-year-old
daughter, Martha. There she finds warmth, a nurturing bond with a
bright and frail child, home cooking and a bit of lovemaking with
her hostess. The orgasms are rather like the home cooking, though:
they comfort but don't quite heal.
</P>
<P>
   J.D.'s retreat, like J.D. himself, lacks Pi's sprightly if
disconsolate energy. He resorts to a computer chat room that
discusses literary suicides.
</P>
<P>
   His entries, which he titles ``Diery,'' meticulously narrate his
lowering state of mind, hint at his impending suicide and with
witty condescension relate the efforts of friends and relatives to
pry him out of his funk. Not an especially attractive spirit, but
he acquires Internet chic with an audience made curious by his
literate style and their own sophisticated ghoulishness.
</P>
<P>
   At this point Pi stumbles upon the Internet and the airy
deliverance it can provide. With reality destroyed, virtual reality
beckons, its nowhere quality a balm for her incinerated somewhere.
Ms. Brownrigg is brilliant about the weightlessness of a
communication that resembles eavesdropping on yourself:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quiet; it didn't require immediate response, as a voice
on the telephone did; it was in her familiar medium, print, so it
emerged through the loved language of her fingertips. But it didn't
require a physical body of print on paper. Ontologically, e-mail
was not in any recognizable category: neither voice nor paper,
neither pure mind nor pure matter. Uncategorizable items often make
it past regulations that don't know how to understand them.''
</P>
<P>
   Having forbidden writing, Pi tries out a few tentative e-mails
to friends. Having banished reading, she surfs the Web and comes
upon J.D.'s Diery. She is touched by a kindred dead soul 3,000
miles away; it seems she can touch back in safety.
</P>
<P>
   In fact the e-mail exchanges at the core of ``The Metaphysical
Touch'' are safe up to a point. They are also stimulating; and
stimulation means change, and change, risk. What begins as an arch
play of wit develops into a rousing but still neutral exchange of
ideas, and advances gingerly to life stories and a tentative probe
of feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Pi probes harder; she asks for a meeting. J.D. is evasive; more
damaged than his buoyant if battered interlocutor, he can only hint
at a stir of feeling. The upshot is tentative and holds an element
of ironic surprise that should not be revealed. What can be said is
that their erotic metaphysical touching has brought both Pi and
J.D. at least partway back to life; their mind-body problem a
little less of a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brownrigg's novel is vital, provocative and written with a
wit and venturesomeness that go quite a way toward doing what
fiction should do: keep time for a ticking world. The e-mail
sections _ thought, and emotions disguised as thought _ are very
well done. So is the portrait of Pi's Job-like state and the
philosophical wrestling it engages her in.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, and it is a weakness, the characters are less
real when they are not thinking. To put it differently, their
thoughts about themselves are more vital than they are. An
exception is Martha, since a child's thinking and being are
inseparable. J.D., activated on e-mail, neither overcomes nor quite
inhabits his inertness.
</P>
<P>
   With him, with Abbie, Pi's hostess, and even with Pi (her
nonvirtual bisexuality barely gets beyond its description), we come
to the point of knowing we know people like them, yet we still fall
short of quite knowing them. It is appropriate and on the whole
captivating that ``The Metaphysical Touch'' has a mind-body problem
of its own.  &QL;

   KOSOVO-RDP (Podujevo) _ The last of some 40,000 Serb forces left
Kosovo on Sunday a few hours ahead of NATO's deadline for
withdrawal, leaving in their wake new scenes of jubilation among
the province's Albanians, as well as new acts of retribution. With
the withdrawal completed, NATO's secretary-general, Javier Solana,
announced that he had lifted the alliance's threat to resume
bombing, formally ending an air war that lasted 78 days and
culminated with the occupation of Kosovo by NATO-led peacekeepers
over the last eight days. By Steven Lee Myers.

   KOSOVO-SUMMIT (Cologne) _ Leaders of the G7 nations and Russia
outlined on Sunday a plan for ending eight years of war in the
Balkans through a massive program of aid and political support for
the region, but said Yugoslavia must undertake ``democratic and
economic reforms'' to be part of the process. At the end of a
three-day summit meeting, the leaders of Britain, France and
Germany said democratic reform in Yugoslavia involved the departure
of Milosevic; but in deference to Russia no explicit reference to
the Serbian leader was included in the final statement. By Roger

   MICROSOFT-GAME (New York) _ For most of New York it was a normal
weekend, but mingling among the natives was a group of very unusual
tourists, mostly current and former Microsoft employees, more than
a handful of them millionaires, who for 24 hours turned the city
into a game board. The scavenger hunt, which players call ``The
Game,'' is normally played in Seattle. But this year the game
organizers decided to ``raise the rims'' and bring it to New York
City to add a new level of complexity. At its root the game is a
frivolous adventure, but one fueled by the players' and designers'
creativity, not to mention their stock options and ego.

A NEW WAR DREW NEW METHODS FOR COVERING IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As 16,100 NATO troops rolled into Kosovo last week, 2,700
journalists signed up to follow them. Most of those journalists had
been forced to watch the 78 days of bombing through the lenses of
official video cameras and wanted to see things for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost anywhere you point the camera you find a story,'' said
Bill Wheatley, NBC's vice president for news.
</P>
<P>
   The wave of images of Serbian tanks departing and ethnic
Albanians returning is the latest to show the paroxysm of Kosovo.
From the terror of airborne high technology bombing to the terror
of the Serb military campaign, the conflict has produced war
coverage that has been in some basic ways different from any
battlefield coverage that has come before, according to editors,
correspondents and media critics.
</P>
<P>
   There was more censorship _ and more information. Military
censors ratcheted up controls during the bombing, but satellite
communications allowed reporters from Brussels, Belgium, to Kukes,
Albania, to triangulate information more easily than in earlier
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   There were more journalists covering all sides of the conflict.
Yugoslav authorities repeatedly expelled Western journalists, but
enough Western reporters returned and were tolerated to provide
on-the-scene coverage of the bomb damage and the ethnic strife _
though often these journalists were operating under tight Serb
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   With the rise of the Internet and cable television news, there
were more outlets for instantaneous reporting and analysis. Cable
news channels offered high-decibel debate, though some argue that
the formats permitted little nuance or textured argument.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, a profusion of Web sites provided perspectives
on the conflict from any angle one could want: Serb, Albanian,
Republican, Democratic, from the depth of the BBC to the passionate
nationalism of the Belgrade-based newspaper Politika.
</P>
<P>
   For David Halberstam, the author and former Vietnam
correspondent for The New York Times, the sum total of all these
trends amounted to sharper, speedier coverage. ``Despite all the
restrictions, and just god-awful limitations and dangers, there
were enough different people in enough different places to give you
the dimensions you needed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the spin doctors working in Washington were saying how well
it was going, there were enough people in the NATO command who
would talk quietly'' about the reasons for pessimism, Halberstam
added.
</P>
<P>
   The multinational cast of the war helped. Squabbles among the 19
member nations of NATO produced self-serving leaks, as did
differences in Washington about the need for ground troops or the
bombing's effect.
</P>
<P>
   Coverage strategies evolved in the early days after NATO began
bombing March 24, largely shaped by the Pentagon decisions to
stringently limit information.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said that ``because the Serbs
had a significant air defense, we were going to give as little
information as possible'' about what planes were flying, about the
frequency and location of bombings, even about what ordnance they
were using.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much has been public about this, there is so much on TV,
that it was like an extension of his own intelligence services,''
Bacon added, referring to the Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Even to disclose the number of bombing sorties or their targets
after the fact _ when the Serbs already knew what had been done _
would provide the enemy with too much information, he contended:
``You could extrapolate from what we were doing one night what we
would do the next.''
</P>
<P>
   Blinders were also imposed by the Serbs, who swept journalists
from their territory in the first days of the war _ but did not
throw out a German reporter and a Canadian-born correspondent for
The Los Angeles Times when they made their way back into Kosovo
shortly after their expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists coping with the restrictions imposed by the
combatants used other sources more fully, according to editors,
correspondents and media critics. As ethnic Albanian Kosovars
poured across the border into refugee camps, they were not only the
subjects of one story _ the mass exodus _ but also sources for what
was happening inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   And the new technologies kept the information moving at what
Wheatley of NBC called ``an unheard-of speed among the interested
parties, the groups, the combatants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean we were always able to authenticate something
that NATO was saying or Serbia was saying,'' he said, ``but it made
it somewhat easier.''
</P>
<P>
   The key catalyst for putting together information, according to
editors and media critics, was the satellite phone and, more
broadly, satellite communications.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast radio was the device that broke new communications
ground in World War II; the evening television news show was the
medium that most directly brought home the violence of the Vietnam
War; and CNN's 24-hour cable TV news coverage first caught hold
with the Gulf War. This time around, the satellite uplink was the
information medium of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instantaneous communication has changed things,'' said Andrew
Rosenthal, foreign editor of The New York Times. ``The ability of a
reporter on the Macedonian border to call a reporter on the
Albanian border or to call a reporter in Brussels or Washington
instantly made a huge difference. Newspapers were able to put
together groups of reporters to do joint efforts in a way that was
previously impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   The same satellite technology, said Ted Koppel, host of ABC's
``Nightline,'' can cut two ways when it comes to television. The
technology, he noted, allows a profusion of images to be
transmitted at great speed. When those images reflect something
like the fate of Kosovar refugees, or the Serb troop pullout from
Kosovo, the medium's emotional power is at its peak _ for better
and for worse, in Koppel's view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television in particular is a medium that allows people at
home to become violence voyeurs,'' he said, speaking from Pristina
by, yes, satellite telephone. ``The more they see, the more it
takes to gain their interest the next day. And it's all happening
so fast, and such an enormous volume is being churned out, that
people become very jaded by what they see very quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great danger is that there will be a reaction from
American television viewers that `we've seen it all, and last week
it looked better.' ''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Robert Lichter, president of the Center for Media and Public
Affairs in Washington, said that television coverage, by doing what
it does best, buttressed the humanitarian justification for the
hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on, the human suffering of the refugees provided a
natural story line that fit very well with NATO's rationale for the
war,'' Lichter said. ``To sell a war in a democracy when you're not
attacked, you have to demonize the leader or show that there are
humanitarian reasons for going in. George Bush demonized Saddam
Hussein. We did something of the same with Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   When the refugee crisis came, he said, ``the need of TV to have
human beings and an ongoing story and the need of the
administration to have a rationale for the bombing melded very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   His words have an echo in those of Bacon at the Pentagon, who
said that ``the refugee crisis, along with the atrocity stories,
was an indication of why we were fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Lichter said, he and his staff noticed in the conflict's
first few weeks that electronic news organizations and print
journalists weighted their coverage very differently, with the much
more critical coverage found in print. The initial television news
coverage ``was so highly positive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all television coverage was. Many cable and some broadcast
shows _ particularly the weekend wrap-up and analysis programs from
Washington _ are driven by debate, and amplified the criticisms of
President Clinton's decision to rule out ground troops. Then, when
Milosevic did not quickly accede to NATO demands, criticism also
grew that NATO had badly miscalculated.
</P>
<P>
   Night after night, strategy and tactics were debated by
journalists, congressmen and former generals in a forum whose
lifeblood is ``the journalism of assertion'' _ a term coined by the
media critics Bill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel in ``Warp Speed'' (The
Century Foundation, 1999), their book on the pitfalls of
instantaneous journalism and the argument culture of cable
television.
</P>
<P>
   Some media observers found this coverage tendentious _
journalists reflecting unrealistic expectations about an early end
to the war and reinforcing dubious assumptions about the
limitations of bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``One fundamental issue arose early in the coverage and was
never challenged to the end of the war,'' said Marvin Kalb, the
director of the Shorenstein Center at Harvard University's Kennedy
School of Government, ``and that was that this war could not end
through the application only of air power, that somehow or another
you're going to have to send troops in.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Kalb said, there was an early expectation that if
the bombing did not quickly sap Milosevic's resolve, then it had
failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a conviction perhaps sired by the quick end of the
Gulf War and perhaps by the American psyche that can't hold its
attention on anything for more than a week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rosenthal, the Times' foreign editor, said that ``the fact
remains that the analysis of the war's having gotten off to a slow
and clumsy start was accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The press reflects what is going on. If the
administration is sitting on its hands and not explaining itself,
we have to go to other analysts. And dissenters are always more
willing to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Some reporters, however, were able to see things firsthand. Some
did it with the Pentagon's sufferance, like Steve Komarow of USA
Today, who flew with a B-52 crew in the first days of the war, but
was not allowed to use the names and hometowns of the pilots in his
dispatches.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Steven Erlanger of The New York Times, worked from
Belgrade &UR;  &LR; reporting on bomb damage and Serbian morale while working
in and around a web of Serb censorship. Still others, like Paul
Watson of The Los Angeles Times, got inside Kosovo and covered
bombing damage and ethnic violence close up. And Jack Kelly of USA
Today reported from a dangerous vantage point alongside a Kosovo
Liberation Army unit.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics, however, see serious remaining flaws in war
coverage, even in the age of a thousand sources and a thousand news
outlets. ``All wars are imperfectly covered,'' said John MacArthur
Jr., the publisher of Harper's Magazine, who wrote ``Second Front:
Censorship and Propaganda in the Gulf War'' (Hill &AMP; Wang, 1992) &UR; . &LR; 
``All wars are a mess. You can only hope to get shards of
information.''
</P>
<P>
   And while he believes that the reporting of the Kosovo conflict
has been ``vastly better than the Gulf War,'' he said he believes
reporters still take too much official information and pass it on
as fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see the word `claim' or `claimed' used nearly
enough,'' he said. ``It's a useful discipline not to let the
Pentagon or NATO get away with loose talk.''

   KOSOVO-ALBANIAN (Pristina) _ Veton Surroi reckons he owes his
life to a bunch of looters in a utility truck. The prominent
publisher was one of the few leaders of the Albanian community to
remain in Pristina throughout the last three months of turmoil and
survive. On a rare occasion when he ventured outside to change safe
houses, Surroi saw three armed people climb out of a special police
car and come towards him. ``I was scared as hell,'' he recalled in
an interview today in the looted offices of his newspaper Koha
Ditore. ``I was saved by a utility car that came by,'' he said. The
men in the truck were looters and drew the interest of the police.
``I went quickly down a side street. It gave me time to get away,''
he said. By Carlotta Gall.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Mostly cloudy skies Monday will occur east of the Appalachians
from southern New England to the Carolinas as a wavering front
lingers off the Atlantic seaboard. Intermittent rain will fall near
the coast, but the heaviest and most persistent rain showers are
expected to remain offshore. Patchy drizzle will occur near the
slopes of the central Appalachians. Farther north, a weak
disturbance will produce a few afternoon showers from the Catskills
to the mountains of northern New England.
</P>
<P>
   Plentiful sunshine will be mixed with a few clouds from the
eastern Great Lakes to the interior Southeast. During the warmth of
the afternoon, isolated showers will form in the interior Southeast
while dry conditions prevail farther north. Meanwhile, there will
be frequent showers over central and southern Florida as a moist
air flow from the east continues.
</P>
<P>
   Heat will build over the northern Plains as winds from the west
are warmed as they descend from the Rockies. At the leading edge of
the hot air mass, clouds and some thundershowers will develop in
the northern Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and thundershowers will be common from central across
Oklahoma to the central Mississippi Valley. Weak high-level winds
will lead to slow-moving thunderstorms over parts of Texas and
Oklahoma raising the risk of local flash flooding.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, interior sections will be very warm with afternoon
thunderstorms developing over many of the peaks of the Rockies.
Onshore breezes will keep the Northwest coast mostly cloudy and
cool with a few sprinkles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: The Longest Season
</P>
<P>
   The official start of summer is at 3:49 p.m. EDT Monday, and
astronomy, not meteorology, is the deciding factor. It is then that
the northward trek of the sun's direct rays across the planet
cease. At that moment when the sun stands still, the summer
solstice arrives.
</P>
<P>
   For the next six months, the direct rays of the sun will move
inexorably south, culminating in the winter solstice. But alas, the
summer season is the slowest to fade. As a result of the elliptical
shape of the earth's orbit around the sun, the Northern Hemisphere
summer lasts 93 days while winter is 89 days long.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PLONSK, Poland _ Like Poland itself, Ludomir Turkowski embraced
capitalism and Western conveniences when communism collapsed here
10 years ago. His small pig farm now has a telephone, a fax
machine, a television and a video recorder. He can borrow money at
the local bank and he has invested in new farm equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, Turkowski is having new doubts about the West.
Subsidized pork and chicken from the European Union are flooding
into Central Europe. German apples are crowding out local produce.
Prices are slumping and costs are rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't sell my products,'' he complained. ``Just yesterday
the television news showed 150 big trucks from European Union
countries, full of chicken and pork, sitting on the Polish
border.''
</P>
<P>
   The post-communist world in Central Europe is entering a new
phase. After tireless and largely successful efforts to align their
economies with those of Western Europe, countries like Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic are pushing hard for the ultimate
badge of acceptance: membership in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   But at least here in Poland, Central Europe's biggest country
and thus its brightest economic star, leaders now find that a
substantial part of the population is balking.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers, angry about plunging prices and European competition,
have staged hundreds of protests in the last several months. Coal
miners, upset about plans to curtail subsidies, blockaded the
Ministry of Finance in early June until they received assurances of
new support.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those people blame the European Union for their woes.
According to recent surveys, only 55 percent of Poles favor
entering the European Union, down from 70 percent several years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   That is a troubling shift for Poland's political leaders, and
perhaps for other Central European nations that have pursued
membership in the European Union as if it were a holy grail.
</P>
<P>
   By becoming members, the Central European nations would
eventually gain full access to European markets. Their citizens
would be free to live and work throughout Western Europe. In time,
they could even be allowed to adopt Europe's new single currency,
the euro, which would reduce their vulnerability to wild swings in
global money markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important,'' said Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz,
president of the National Bank of Poland and an architect of the
country's economic policy. ``We are not a country that can profit
from being alone. Our situation is much more vulnerable to external
shocks than many people think.''
</P>
<P>
   But integration is also certain to bring change. ``There is a
feeling that the European Union will bring in more money and
investment, but also that it will bring in unfettered
competition,'' said Krzysztof Bledowski, chief strategist for
Central Europe at Wood &AMP; Co., a securities firm in Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
   To a great extent, the suspicion is mutual. Many European
countries are horrified by the prospect of extending the European
Union's substantial subsidies to Polish farmers. They also fret
about giving Polish workers carte blanche to work in their
countries, a standard right for anybody living within the union.
</P>
<P>
   As more detailed negotiations loom this summer between the
European Union and the Poles, Czechs and Hungarians, all these
issues are becoming increasingly tense, because both sides face the
need for painful change.
</P>
<P>
   While any government negotiating European Union entry finds
itself balancing national needs against the demands of the larger
bloc, and trying to win special deals, the Central Europeans have
the added burden of history. Many of them remain suspicious of
Germany, the European Union's largest power and Central Europe's
neighbor. And most adults, reared under communism, are still
adjusting to _ and therefore frequently fear _ the Western way of
doing things.
</P>
<P>
   As for the European Union, the prospect of a flood of labor from
the East raises irrational fears among Westerners already grumbling
about too many immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   And the entry particularly of Poland's small farmers confronts
the European Union with the necessity of long-postponed change in
its farm subsidy program. If the union's farm subsidies were
extended to all Central European farmers, their cost would
skyrocket. European leaders recently agreed on a plan to reduce
farm subsidies, but nowhere near enough to avoid a disruption.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Poland's 6 million farmers are too small to compete in
world markets. Meanwhile, the European Union is demanding
reductions in the subsidies for coal miners and shipbuilders. It is
also complaining about the generous tax breaks that Poland, like
other post-communist countries eager for foreign cash, offers
foreign companies that build factories in so-called enterprise
zones.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is putting new pressure on the country's governing
political coalition under Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek. With its
population of 42 million and its embrace of free markets, Poland
has become a magnet for foreign investment. Its trade is
overwhelmingly with Western Europe. And its economy has proved
remarkably resilient to the financial crises that racked Russia,
Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of Russia and slower economic growth in Western
Europe has reduced Poland's growth rate from more than 5 percent in
1998 to an estimated 3.5 percent this year. That is much faster
growth than in far more prosperous Germany and France, but it is a
significant reduction that has made it harder for the
right-of-center coalition led by Buzek to push through reforms that
would lower taxes and subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Pope John Paul II arrived for his marathon visit in
Poland in early June, miners blockaded the foreign ministry,
protesting government plans to slash coal subsidies and to reduce
production by about 20 percent by the year 2002, the year Poland
hopes to enter the European Union. The plan would reduce the number
of miners from 230,000 in 1998 to 138,000 in 2002. The government
responded to the protest with a promise to seek about $100 million
to compensate miners who lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Reducing industrial subsidies is crucial to Poland's attempts to
control spending. But it will also be a central issue in the
European Union negotiations. Yet it is in the rural areas that fear
of the European Union is most intense.
</P>
<P>
   Poland, alone among the former countries of the Soviet bloc,
never collectivized its agriculture. Most of the farms are smaller
than 50 acres and woefully inefficient. Thus, even though Polish
wages are a small fraction of those in Germany or France, farmers
have been besieged with competition from the West.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Plonsk, a small village about 40 miles northwest of
Warsaw, the transformation has been tangible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This used to be a flourishing countryside, where farmers could
sell everything they produce,'' said Kazimierz Dabkowski, a city
administrator who looks after farming issues, referring to the
conditions just about five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now, the situation has completely reversed. The first
problem is that production costs went sky high _ fuel, fertilizer,
pesticides,'' he said, contrasting this with subsidized supplies
under the Communists. And now, Dabkowski noted, farmers find they
must hold prices down to compete with Western imports. ``Suddenly,
there is a very bad situation where the farmers do not have enough
income.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkowski, a 57-year-old farmer who raises pigs and some cereal
grains, said he is struggling to hang on. Pork prices have fallen
by about 50 percent in the last year, partly because of the
economic collapse in Russia, which was the chief market for Polish
pork. When pork traders come into town to buy up pigs, he said,
farmers often wait for hours just to offer their animals and then
find themselves turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Josef Pietrzyck, who raises fruits and vegetables in the nearby
village of Zaborowo, said he can no longer earn a living on the
farm. He plans to sell his farm to his daughter, who has been
buying up land in the region to benefit from the economics of a
larger farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the small farmers are terrified, including myself,'' said
Pietrzyck. ``I think the large farms will simply absorb the smaller
ones. But many of the larger farms are in trouble, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Both farmers have decided they will vote for the radical
Peasants' Party in the next election, which has committed itself to
guaranteeing farmers the ability to sell their crops. Although the
Peasants' Party is unlikely to attain significant power any time
soon, pressure is already building for programs to buy up surplus
grain _ a move that would probably make local farmers even less
competitive in world markets because it would encourage
uneconomical production, rather than curbing it.
</P>
<P>
   Many farmers are particularly incensed about the European
Union's export subsidies. While Poland's pork producers have seen a
collapse in their exports to Russia, the European Union actually
subsidizes meat exports to Russia _ angering even the most
adamantly pro-European of Poland's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``When exports to Russia collapsed, what did the European Union
do? They increased their subsidies to aid exports,'' complained
Leszek Balcerowicz, Poland's finance minister, at a conference in
Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the only issue that worries local farmers. Another
big fear is that foreigners _ by which most people mean Germans _
will sweep in and buy up their land, which is another basic right
accorded to anybody living within the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Land purchase, particularly by prosperous Germans and Austrians
who have historically held sway over the neighboring Central
European candidates for the European Union, has also been an issue
in Hungary, Slovenia and the Czech Republic. Particularly to some
people in these smaller countries, land purchase by foreigners
equals the loss of their nations' new identities after decades in
the Soviet or Yugoslav grip.
</P>
<P>
   Polish leaders are expected to push for restrictions on land
purchases in the upcoming negotiations, but European countries have
made it clear they will fight them, since such special restrictions
ultimately would affect such long-established practices as British
citizens' buying property in Mediterranean countries in order to
vacation or retire in warmer climes.
</P>
<P>
   While balking at Polish demands on the purchase of property,
European leaders are expected to insist that the union's existing
scheme of farm subsidies, known as the Common Agricultural Program,
should not be extended to Polish farmers for at least several
years.
</P>
<P>
   To Pietrzyck, that sounds like insult added to injury.
</P>
<P>
   Krzysztof Paciorek, an apple farmer in the town of Grojec, is
more optimistic about competing with Europe. He owns a 104-acre
farm, which is still small by Western standards but big enough to
justify investment in at least some advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
   To improve productivity, he has switched to a new breed of
smaller trees that can be packed into small orchards at very high
density. He is also one of the very few farmers here who owns
low-oxygen coolers, standard equipment in the West that makes it
possible to keep fruit fresh for months.
</P>
<P>
   But even so, Paciorek is pessimistic about the Polish apple
industry. In fact, in early June, apples sold in Warsaw for
slightly more than they did on the streets of Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poland produces 2 million tons of apples, but only 1 percent
of all farms have low-oxygen coolers,'' he said as he relaxed in
his living room after a long day of work. ``I am afraid that most
of the small farmers will go bankrupt. They are just economically
behind, because they are so small.''
</P>
<P>
   Few experts, whether in business or in government, doubt that
Poland and the other big central European countries will be
admitted into the European Union. As a practical matter, investors
have already begun to treat Poland and Hungary more like any other
European country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to be in the European Union by the year 2002,''
asserted Ms. Gronkiewicz-Waltz at the central bank.
</P>
<P>
   But even the strongest supporters admit they still need to
persuade their own people.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are afraid, concerned that foreigners will come in and
buy up their land,'' Ms. Gronkiewicz-Waltz said. ``People are
afraid, because they don't know.''

REPUBLICANS SOFTEN STAND ON ABORTION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Ohio, Texas, Ind., Va.)   By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican Party has undergone a fundamental
repositioning, and softening, of its stand on abortion, recognizing
that a more tolerant position on probably the most divisive issue
in American politics is crucial to its hopes of reclaiming the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Several major presidential candidates are barely mentioning
abortion on the stump, if at all. Some members of Congress are
concentrating on other issues, like taxes and education. Even some
leaders of the anti-abortion movement have moderated their
positions, all in the name of political pragmatism.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Republicans competing for the presidential
nomination believed that the only way to draw support among those
who vote in caucuses and primaries was to aggressively trumpet
their anti-abortion bonafides. But it often came at a high cost:
alienating voters in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   The move to a more accommodating position on an issue that has
roiled the party for two decades has alarmed some conservatives and
split the Republican presidential field. Still, most party leaders
seem to view that as a more palatable alternative than giving a
Democrat the presidency _ and the opportunity to appoint Supreme
Court justices who are sympathetic to the abortion rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   When the abortion issue does arise on the campaign trail, many
Republican contenders frame the issue with a newly pragmatic,
incremental approach. While insisting that they oppose abortion,
several contenders have abandoned their push for a constitutional
amendment banning all abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in the most striking example, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, the early front-runner for the Republican nomination, said he
would not require a Supreme Court nominee to share his
anti-abortion position. The governor had already said the nation
was not ready to embrace a constitutional amendment that would
outlaw abortion. Elizabeth Dole, whom most polls place second to
Bush for the nomination, recently expressed similar positions.
</P>
<P>
   Even Pat Robertson, founder of the Christian Coalition, asserted
last month that pressing for a constitutional amendment was
unrealistic, saying, ``A strategic, incremental goal is much more
effective.'' He added, ``We must win an election.''
</P>
<P>
   David N. O'Steen, executive director of the National Right to
Life Committee, argued that there had been no major shift among
Republicans beyond ``slight changes in phraseology.'' But,
pronouncing himself satisfied that Bush was sufficiently ``a
pro-life governor,'' he said, ``Pro-lifers who truly want to save
unborn children should concentrate on exposing the extreme,
pro-abortion position of Al Gore rather than criticizing the
pro-life position of candidates like Gov. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   This new accommodation has spilled over to Capitol Hill as well.
In a notable triumph of practical politics over ideology, House
Republicans this year picked an advocate of abortion rights, Rep.
Thomas M. Davis of Virginia, to head the National Republican
Congressional Committee, which is responsible for the party's drive
to retain its House majority next year.
</P>
<P>
   The party has not retreated from its basic anti-abortion
philosophy. Few prominent Republicans predict that the party will
rewrite its platform calling for a constitutional amendment _ at
least not before the elections next year. Every Republican
candidate for president in 2000 describes himself or herself as
``pro-life.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there has been an unmistakable shift in tone and emphasis,
with some candidates sounding themes encouraging personal
responsibility, adoption and sexual abstinence and calling for
parental consent for minors seeking abortions. If they mention the
procedure at all, the focus is often more on opposing late-term
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Richard N. Bond, in his swan song as chairman of the Republican
National Committee in 1993, castigated the party for being
preoccupied with abortion and implored Republicans to ``not cling
to zealotry masquerading as principle.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Bond said: ``We've come a heck of a
long way. True believers such as Pat Robertson recognize how
divisive the issue is. They recognize that a more pragmatic
approach is called for. They recognize that candidates like Bush
need to be given the license to communicate a sincere concern for
abortion without it being a cue for intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond said it was time for the party to move beyond
abortion-rights opponents who argue that ``if you're not for our
point of view, you're a baby killer and you're a bad person _ and
you really can't be a member of the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Many leading Republicans said the repositioning has been borne
out of practical politics. There has been a recognition, they said,
that a constitutional amendment was not realistic. Another factor
is that Republicans are eager to win back the White House and have
concluded that a more inclusive, tolerant position is the only way
to win support.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that the public remains divided over abortion,
although more and more people seem to endorse what some call a
``permit but discourage'' approach toward abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Mrs. Dole are not alone among the Republican contenders
who are carefully calibrating their positions. Rep. John Kasich of
Ohio has said that anti-abortion Republicans should ``lower the
volume'' in the abortion debate. Sen. John McCain of Arizona has
called for a change in the party platform to reach out to people
who support abortion. Lamar Alexander, the former governor of
Tennessee, has said he will accept a running mate who backs
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Such positions have jolted some conservatives and sharply
divided the presidential field, with several of the more
ideological candidates, including Gary Bauer, Steve Forbes and Sen.
Bob Smith of New Hampshire, portraying their rivals as too squishy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be the virus of pragmatism that has entered the
bloodstream of the conservative movement in the Republican Party,''
said Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative columnist who is running
for president. ``I'm frankly astonished that George Bush has put
himself outside the mainstream of the party on the issue of life.
He's running a general election strategy before there's a general
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan added that when candidates cannot commit to court
appointees who are anti-abortion, their ``pro-life position is
utterly hollow.''
</P>
<P>
   Staking out his position on the issue earlier this year, former
Vice President Dan Quayle said, ``Because my commitment is rooted
in conscience rather than politics, those I select for the most
critical positions in government, including my running mate or
nominees to the Supreme Court, will share it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, most party leaders seem satisfied with a more
accommodating position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is a desire on the part of a growing number of
pro-life and pro-family leaders to insure that their own political
position is in accordance with the political reality,'' said Ralph
Reed, the former executive director of the Christian Coalition who
is now a Republican strategist. ``So part of this is a measure of
self-interest. The other thing is they're scared to death of Al
Gore being elected president and appointing three Supreme Court
justices. That would be a setback they wouldn't be able to recover
from.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a far cry from only four years ago, when conservatives
castigated former Sen. Bob Dole, the Republican presidential
nominee who had tried, unsuccessfully, to appeal to moderates by
proposing that the party's platform should note that Republicans
hold varied views on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``On abortion, I thought we had a deal worked out in San
Diego,'' Dole said in an interview. ``It fell apart. But I think
we've got to be an inclusive party.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives also lambasted Dole for saying he had not read the
platform and did not feel bound by it.
</P>
<P>
   The current shift toward moderation was also noted by Ann Stone,
national chairman of Republicans for Choice, an advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to have armed guards with me at the 1992 Republican
convention because we had death threats in 1992,'' she said. ``It
subsided in '96 _ they actually found us housing. But this time
there are tremendous open arms.''

THE SECRET SERVICE IS STUDYING SCHOOL SHOOTINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky., Colo., Mass., Ill., Calif., N.H.)  (lb) 
 By BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On a Monday afternoon in 1993, in a small town in
Kentucky, an honor student shot and killed his senior English
teacher in one of the nation's first school shootings. The student,
Scott Pennington, is serving a life sentence in a Kentucky prison,
where this month he had two unusual visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Pennington's guests were a forensic psychologist and an agent
from the U.S. Secret Service. They asked the somber young man the
same questions they had asked dozens of assassins: What was he
trying to achieve? How did he choose his targets? When did he get
the gun? Did he hope to be killed?
</P>
<P>
   The people who protect the president have turned their attention
to school violence. Prompted by the slaying of 12 students and a
teacher at Columbine High School near Littleton, Colo., in April, a
Secret Service team has begun a detailed review of the Columbine
shooting and those at more than a dozen other schools, interviewing
as many of the killers as it can.
</P>
<P>
   The team is looking for patterns of motive and behavior. The
goal is to help schools and the police recognize which students are
moving from interest in killing to weapons acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be so much easier if all the people who did this
dressed weirdly or were outcasts,'' said Robert Fein, the forensic
psychologist, who visited the prison along with the team leader,
Bryan Vossekuil.
</P>
<P>
   What the Secret Service has already learned from a detailed
study of American assassins poses several conundrums for school
principals, the police and public officials struggling to respond
to the school shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the most common responses to school violence: armed
guards, surveillance cameras, metal detectors, dress codes and
special telephone numbers for reporting threats.
</P>
<P>
   While more schools are hiring police officers to patrol the
hallways, the Secret Service warns that a motive of many killers is
to be killed. Heightened security may be a deterrent, and it may be
a magnet for suicide.
</P>
<P>
   While schools are installing video cameras, many killers said
their motive was to become famous. A camera may be a deterrent, and
it may offer a video yearbook of a killer.
</P>
<P>
   While schools are prohibiting trench coats, many killers told
the Secret Service that they tried to blend into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   While schools are encouraging the reporting of any threat, the
Secret Service takes all threats seriously, but it found that not
one assassin in the past 50 years had made a threat.
</P>
<P>
   And while Congress is financing a national phone number for
anonymous reporting of concerns about students, nearly all schools
and the police have been given no training in assessing which
people are planning an attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that some of the same ideas used to help protect the
president may also help keep our nation's schoolchildren safe,''
said Brian Stafford, the new director of the Secret Service. ``We
want to offer any assistance we can to prevent this from happening
again.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Secret Service has shed some of its secrecy, and begun
forming the National Threat Assessment Center, the formal name of
the team. Working from a warren of desks two blocks from the White
House, the group of fewer than a dozen members has widened its
research to celebrity stalking, then to workplace violence and now
to school slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly far removed from presidential assassination, these
rare events with powerful social consequences have several elements
in common. Killers study security. They acquire weapons. They often
study the history of assassination. They plan their escape or their
death.
</P>
<P>
   The national response to school killings has focused on root
causes: What makes children kill?
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service is encouraging public officials to pay more
attention to the investigator's challenge: How does a police
officer or principal respond to vague information that classmates
or teachers are concerned about a student?
</P>
<P>
   The goal, agency officials say, is to develop training materials
for police and school officials. Later this month the agency will
convene a group of principals, counselors and other school
officials in the Midwest to discuss its research.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service once watched for people who fit the popular
profile of dangerousness: the lunatic, the loner, the threatener,
the hater.
</P>
<P>
   That profile has been shattered by the assassins themselves.
Many agreed to be interviewed on videotape by the Secret Service,
which studied all 83 people who tried to kill a public official or
celebrity in the United States in the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The assassins were visited at home, in prisons and in hospitals
by Fein, a soft-spoken psychologist from New York, and Vossekuil, a
thoughtful agent who toured the world with Ronald Reagan. Their
work was supported by the National Institute of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   The first lesson taught by assassins is to discard stereotypes.
Killers are not necessarily mentally ill, or socially isolated, or
even male.
</P>
<P>
   Their second lesson is not to expect a threat. As assassins told
the Secret Service, why would they threaten? A threat would keep
them from succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   Few assassins express hatred for their victims, easily shifting
from one target to another. As a woman who approached President
George Bush with a gun explained: ``I liked the man. I would have
voted for him if I hadn't been locked up in county jail'' for
threatening to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   In the old view, a person is capable of violence or is not; a
person has to be crazy to commit mass murder; people just snap.
</P>
<P>
   In the new view, people are more or less violent depending on
the circumstances; people make a decision to kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they on a path toward attacking someone?'' said John
Berglund, a team member. ``If so, how fast are they moving? How
close are they to attacking someone? How might they be stopped?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Before committing the Colorado school massacre, the two
students, Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, copied school
keys, made bombs, acquired guns, kept a diary describing their
plans, and warned a student to leave the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some write about their ideas and activities, in a journal or
diary,'' Vossekuil said. ``Others tell friends, family or
colleagues _ but usually not the target _ about their thoughts and
intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   Killers often do not carry out a plan until a painful event _
job loss or the end of a relationship _ sends them into despair.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, the son of a career military man, kept a diary of his
plans for a year. The week before his suicidal attack, he was
rejected by the Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   Most assassins behave in ways that concern the people who know
them. As Robert John Bardo left for Los Angeles, where he would
kill the actress Rebecca Shaeffer in 1989, his father asked,
``You're not going to do a John Hinckley thing, are you?''
</P>
<P>
   The police in Colorado were criticized for not doing more to
prevent the attack at Columbine. Despite another student's
complaint that Harris was making threats on his Web site and
testing pipe bombs with Klebold, sheriff's deputies did not
interview either student, or talk with their parents, or examine
the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all learned a lesson on April 20th,'' said Lt. John
Kiekbusch of the Sheriff's Department of Jefferson County, which
includes Columbine. ``We need to take these in a more serious
fashion.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In assessing whether a person is dangerous, the Secret Service
recommends that schools and the police start with a detailed series
of questions about a person's behavior and motivation.
</P>
<P>
   What has the person said about his intentions? Has the person
shown an interest in assassins, weapons or militant groups? If
there is a history of mental illness, has the person acted on
hallucinations or delusions? Has the person been suicidal?
</P>
<P>
   On the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the
police have changed the way they react to vague reports of fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have cases where somebody is afraid of someone,'' said Anne
Glavin, chief of police at MIT for 18 years. ``It's not even real
tangible, but people have strong feelings about the situation, not
always in a way that they can articulate. Police have tended to be
dismissive of that sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with the Secret Service, MIT set up what it calls a
threat team to handle such cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone's scared, we spend a lot of time trying to find out
why they're scared,'' Glavin said. ``One can certainly rip a page
from the Secret Service's way of looking at violence.''
</P>
<P>
   This approach is being tested in stalking cases by prosecutors
in Chicago and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In Dover, N.H., the police and the Secret Service are
interviewing killers to learn more about the behavior of boyfriends
and husbands who kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to be cautious in drawing conclusions,'' said
Fein, the Secret Service psychologist. ``We have a set of ideas
that are a useful tool. But we would be skeptical of anybody who
claims certainty.''
</P>
<P>
   In Grayson, Ky., in 1993, English teacher Deanna McDavid was
certain that one of her students was dangerous. Thoughts of death
ran through Scott Pennington's journals.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, she had told a fellow teacher, that boy is going to
bring a gun to school and shoot himself _ or someone else.

   PODUJEVO, Yugoslavia _ The last of some 40,000 Yugoslav forces
left Kosovo Sunday a few hours ahead of NATO's deadline for
withdrawal, effectively ending Yugoslavia's control over a province
at the center of Serbia's cultural and historical lore.
</P>
<P>
   With the withdrawal completed, NATO's secretary-general, Javier
Solana, announced that he had lifted the alliance's threat to
resume bombing, formally ending a 78-day air war that culminated
with the occupation of Kosovo by NATO-led peacekeepers over the
last eight days.
</P>
<P>
   By early Sunday, the last Yugoslav troops had left the province
along the main route north of here. Only a small convoy of Yugoslav
army trucks remained at the border to Serbia proper, seeking
permission from NATO to be escorted back to retrieve broken-down
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   At the Serbian border town of Rudnica, Yugoslav soldiers manned
a checkpoint, but otherwise there was no sign of Yugoslav forces
along the winding road into Serbia from Mitrovica, except for a
lone carload of soldiers heading north.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's spokesman, Lt. Col. Robin Clifford, said the withdrawal
had been completed roughly 11 hours ahead of a midnight-Sunday
deadline that was set 11 days ago when Yugoslav generals accepted
NATO's terms for suspending its airstrikes. Clifford said some
stragglers might remain, but that any found after the deadline
would be detained.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav withdrawal left in its wake new scenes of
jubilation among Kosovo's Albanians, as well as fresh acts of
retribution even as the 18,000 NATO troops now in the battered
province moved, with mixed success, to exert a semblance of
control.
</P>
<P>
   While the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces has gone relatively
smoothly, NATO's troops continue to have difficulties keeping
fighters from the Kosovo Liberation Army in check.
</P>
<P>
   After talks with the rebels dragged on for another day,
complicated by rivalries within their opaque and fractious
leadership, a NATO official said Sunday night that the rebel
command had signed a draft agreement to disband and turn over their
weapons within 30 days. The accord still awaited approval by NATO
ambassadors in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, NATO troops had new confrontations with the
group, confiscating weapons and arresting several of its fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday night, Italian troops stopped a truck near Pec and
discovered an arsenal of weapons belonging to the rebels, including
more than 1,800 mortar rounds, 560 mines and 118 anti-tank rockets
and shoulder-fired missiles. British troops also intercepted and
disarmed two rebel patrols, while U.S. Marines arrested an Albanian
accused of killing three Serbs with a sniper rifle.
</P>
<P>
   With the final withdrawal of Yugoslav troops came vengeance
against Serb civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Albanians who only recently returned from hiding in the hills
looted and burned houses belonging to Serbs. In the lush valley
between Pristina and Mitrovica, smoke rose from dozens of homes,
leaving a thick pall in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Grace, north of Pristina, Albanians took
whatever they could from houses after driving out the Serbs who
lived there. ``Everything they did to us, we're getting back now,''
said Gazmehd Kosumi, 25, who returned with his family two days ago
to find their two homes nearby destroyed. ``They burned everything.
They took everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians filled their aging tractors with loot, even after
British and French troops arrived. A British soldier simply
shrugged when asked if there was not something NATO could do to
stop the destruction. Half a dozen homes crackled in flames.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford described the violence in Grace as ``an unfortunate
incident,'' saying the commander on the ground had decided that the
way ``to avoid any danger to life and limb was to accept some
damage to property.'' He said NATO troops had rescued a 19-year-old
man who had been attacked by the looters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we don't want to do is inflame any situation,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the violence prompted a new exodus of Serbs, more
than 50,000 of whom have already fled since NATO troops arrived
eight days ago. On the road to Serbia proper from Pristina to
Leposavic, dozens of Serb families headed north in bedraggled
convoys Sunday, their trucks and tractors crammed with whatever
they could carry.
</P>
<P>
   Just outside of Lesak, near the Serbian border, one man from
Grace erupted in anger when asked why he was leaving Kosovo. He
said the Kosovo Liberation Army had arrived on Saturday and began
shooting. French troops came, he said, but took their weapons, not
the rebels'. Another man gestured angrily at his clothes, saying it
was all he had left.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took everything,'' he shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Dragomir Ristic left his home in Stanovic grudgingly. He said
Serb leaders had encouraged them to stay. ``But the French came,
and the Albanians started to burn things,'' he said, sitting atop a
pile of suitcases and furniture in a wooden trailer being pulled by
a tractor. ``If I stayed, they would have killed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Serbs have said the presence of Russian peacekeepers would
give them a greater sense of security, but Ristic had no idea the
United States and Russia had reached an agreement to deploy 3,600
Russian soldiers to the province, beginning in a few days. It did
not matter now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't wait for the Russians to come,'' he said. ``I don't
have a house. I don't have anything.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Mitrovica, a group of several hundred Serb civilians on
Sunday tried in effect to partition the city, erecting a makeshift
barricade at one of end of a bridge and declaring the northern
third of Mitrovica a Serb-controlled zone.
</P>
<P>
   From there, they jeered and heckled Albanians, including an
elderly woman and a mother with a baby carriage, who tried to
cross. Citing fears that they were being infiltrated by Kosovo
Liberation Army, the Serbs said that only Albanians who could prove
they had previously lived in the neighborhood were welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a border,'' said one young Serb who would
not give his name. ``There are going to be two parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Serbs said that the predominantly Serb towns between
Mitrovica and the border with Serbia, including Zvecan and
Leposvic, would also be part of the self-declared Serb zone. NATO
officials said Sunday night that the stand off was continuing.
</P>
<P>
   For the Albanians, however, the withdrawal of the much-feared
soldiers and police officers brought a palpable sense of relief.
Things are nowhere close to normal in Kosovo, but in city after
city, village after village, there are renewed signs of life and
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Podujevo, one of the last cities vacated by the Serbs,
there has not been electricity for three days, and no water for 10.
But vendors have begun to sell fruit and vegetables on the
sidewalks, which were crowded with Albanians who had returned after
hiding in the hills for more than two months. It is also possible,
at last, to buy cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   At an old concrete hotel on the edge of town, which until
Saturday morning had been a headquarters for the Serb special
police, Kimete Avdiu and her sister, Feride, found two chickens
that had made a roost in a pile of trash beside the building.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Avdiu, 26, said the chickens were among nine they had left
behind when Serbs drove them from the home across the street on
March 29. In the roost, her sister found four eggs, a bonanza after
weeks with little food.
</P>
<P>
   British troops from the Kings Royal Hussars Battle Group, who
are turning the building into their headquarters, gave away
whatever they did not need, including mattresses, chairs, tables
and other furnishings. ``These people have nothing,'' the group's
commander, Capt. Chris McGregor, said.
</P>
<P>
   On Podujevo's main street, Bekim Kamerolli, a 22-year-old
waiter, used a razor to scrape away the Cyrillic symbol of Serb
unity, which Serbs painted on storefronts and homes across Kosovo
to distinguish their properties from those being ravaged. Until
Sunday, it would have been an unthinkable chore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to see it, because it is the Serbs' sign,''
Kamerolli said, standing on a milk crate as he worked the blade.
``It doesn't belong there anymore.''

MILOSEVIC URGES SERBS NOT TO LEAVE KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Hundreds of Serbs who had fled Kosovo,
fearing vengeance from the Kosovo Liberation Army rebels, responded
Sunday to appeals from the Yugoslav government to return to the
province and to trust the security provided by NATO-led forces.
</P>
<P>
   President Slobodan Milosevic, moving to shore up his position
after failing to keep NATO out of Kosovo, has urged the province's
Serbs to defend the right to their land by staying put, or
returning if they have already fled.
</P>
<P>
   By praising the very NATO forces _ now under a U.N. peacekeeping
mandate _ who were described during the war as criminal aggressors
and even worse, Milosevic is clearly putting the responsibility for
the Serbs' safety on NATO.
</P>
<P>
   He is also trying to rid himself of a potentially embarrassing
refugee crisis. After all, if Yugoslavia actually has won the war
and preserved its sovereignty over Kosovo, as his state news media
assert, why would Serbs leave Kosovo?
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has moved to protect his right wing, keeping the
Radical Party leader, Vojislav Seselj, from leaving the Serbian
government. The liberal politician Vuk Draskovic, leader of the
Serbian Renewal Movement, thus found his efforts to rejoin that
government spurned, and state television sharply attacked Draskovic
on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, Draskovic and his party called for ``interim
governments'' in Yugoslavia and its major republic, Serbia, that
could attract Western investment and support _ an indirect attack
on Milosevic, who has been indicted as a war criminal. Draskovic
also called for a return to peacetime laws, a resumption of
diplomatic relations with NATO countries and press freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we cannot make the regime see reason,'' Draskovic said in a
speech on Sunday to his party, ``I call on all members to be on
alert and ready for all of us to do whatever it is we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, whose party runs the capital, Belgrade, was
immediately attacked Sunday night on state television. Seselj's
party, in a statement read on television, derided ``criminalized
and arrogant city officials.''
</P>
<P>
   Then in its own commentary, the television mocked Draskovic,
saying that he was ``offering the West even more than they asked,''
and adding that he must be disappointed at being left out of a
meeting of opposition figures last weekend with Robert Gelbard, a
Clinton administration official. Serbian media have depicted the
meeting, held in Montenegro, as a conspiratorial gathering to plot
Milosevic's ouster.
</P>
<P>
   The editorial then accused Draskovic of using Belgrade's city
television, Studio B, as a personal advertising agency ``to promote
only himself and his party.'' So it was ludicrous for him to call
for changes in state television, which NATO had attacked with
missiles for its effort to serve the people, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
   While journalists witnessed the return of some Serbs to Kosovo
on Sunday, accompanied by Serbian Cabinet ministers and with food
and fuel provided by the government, state television asserted
Sunday night that ``large convoys'' were heading back to Kosovo
from the Serbian towns of Kraljevo, Kragujevac, Aleksinac, Jagodina
and Nis.
</P>
<P>
   The police had discouraged the bulk of the refugees _ numbering
up to 50,000, according to the Red Cross _ from coming to Belgrade,
where there was a small protest of 200 refugees Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Only on Saturday, when Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Milovan
Bojic called on Serbs to return to Kosovo within 48 hours, did
state television admit that many Serbs had left. And it used a
mocking term for them _ ``pobegulje,'' a feminine plural meaning
``those who have fled'' _ that seemed to accuse the refugees of
betraying their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   As one senior Serbian journalist said, asking anonymity, ``First
they call a defeat a victory, and then call the victims cowards.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bojic insisted, contrary to the facts: ``There's no shooting in
Kosovo and Metohija, nor are there murders there.'' He said that
the Kosovo Liberation Army had merely applied ``psychological
pressure'' to get Serbs to flee, and that the NATO-led peacekeeping
forces were now ``disarming'' the insurgent fighters.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and the Serbian Orthodox Church have also urged Serbs to
stay in Kosovo or to return there. After a slow move to establish
order, NATO now promises evenhanded justice, while Church leaders
like Patriarch Pavle, who has himself moved to the Kosovo town of
Pec, urge their flock to hold onto their right to holy Kosovo with
their physical presence.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian ``institutions are functioning in Kosovo and the
cooperation with KFOR,'' the NATO-led peacekeeping force, ``has
been established,'' Bojic said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going back because the U.N. forces have promised and
guaranteed security to us, not just a formal but a real one,'' he
said. ``Kosovo and Metohija is ours and will remain ours only if we
return there,'' he said. ``You should use this moment to return to
Kosovo in the next 48 hours. Otherwise the return will be more
difficult,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   And he promised: ``We will be with you now, possibly the hardest
hour, and in the future too, because we have succeeded, through a
great engagement of all of us, to secure conditions for your safe
return and a secure life in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The small opposition Christian Democrats lashed out at the
Serbian government for pushing the refugees to go back. ``The
officials whose disastrous policy has forced the Kosovo Serbs to
leave their homes are now persuading, blackmailing and even
threatening them to return,'' the party said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's political moves seemed to dampen the prospect for
the early elections advocated by opposition parties. Milosevic
could even benefit from elections this autumn, several analysts
say, although his party might not be able to count _ as it has in
past elections _ on artificially bolstering the number of votes it
got in Kosovo, whose majority Albanians boycotted Serbian polls.
</P>
<P>
   In the new circumstances, it is not clear whether Kosovo,
formally a part of Yugoslavia but actually under U.N.
administration, would be allowed to vote in any new elections.

 &HT;    Coke chairman gets briefing in Belgium
 &HT;    By Bert Roughton Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brussels _ Coca-Cola Chairman M. Douglas Ivester met privately
here with top company executives Saturday in what amounted to a
post-mortem of what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting inside Coca-Cola Belgium's midrise steel and concrete
complex in a suburban office park, Ivester spent hours listening to
explanations of how Coke products became tainted, leading to scores
of reports that people were falling ill after consuming them.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester has not made a public appearance here and the
Atlanta-based soft drink company isn't expected to make any
statements until Monday, said Paul Pendergrass, the director of
communications for Coca-Cola Greater Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgian government banned all Coke products a week ago today
after dozens of youngsters were hospitalized with complaints of
stomach pains and nausea after drinking the company's beverages.
The health scare rapidly spread to other nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgian government said Saturday its ban on canned Coke,
Coke Light (the European version of Diet Coke), Sprite and Fanta
will remain in effect until it is convinced of the company's
explanations about what happened, and until the problem is
corrected. Local TV news in Brussels showed tape of huge piles of
canned Cokes being disposed of in what appeared to be a dump.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Health Ministry officials said Friday they expected
to hear from Coca-Cola on Monday, Pendergrass said no meeting was
scheduled. He added, however, that such a meeting was entirely
possible.
</P>
<P>
   The government still expresses some impatience with Coca-Cola
executives. Mieke Van den Berghe, a government spokeswoman, said
the partial ban will continue until the company provides adequate
information about the cause of the illnesses and evidence that the
cause has been remedied. ``They still have not done this basic
thing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The government took the unusual step of banning all Coke
products in part because of its frustration at what it considered
the company's slow and insensitive response to the reports of
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Pendergrass said the company was in close contact with the
government and was trying to allay concerns by responding to
specific questions. ``Our communications have been very open and
direct with the government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coke was working over the weekend to develop more documentation
_ including gathering interviews from people who had fallen ill and
medical officials involved in their treatment, Pendergrass said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Coke products _ Nestea, Aquarius, Bonaqua, Kinley, Lift and
Minute Maid _ were reappearing in stores here Saturday after being
removed from shelves last week.
</P>
<P>
   While the furor over the Coke story seems to be subsiding,
Ivester's visit was reported in the major daily Le Soir under the
headline ``The boss of Coca-Cola has come to manage the crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivester, however, was identified as ``Jack'' instead of Douglas.

   SOUTH-INTEGRATION _ ATLANTA _ The change in attitudes toward
integration in the South in the 1990s has been marked. In a 1991
Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll, 47 percent of white Southerners
said they favored integration, compared with 56 percent of whites
now. (Harris, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH-POLL _ ATLANTA _ We believe in integration, but the
reality still eludes us. We claim to be comfortable with other
races, but for many that comfort is usually at arm's length. And
when it comes to interracial dating and marriage _ the most ancient
of America's racial taboos _ our aversions have diminished, not
disappeared. It's clear that we are still evolving, due in part to
an influx of transplanted Southerners who are slowly re-shaping the
region's distinctive racial topography. But how far has the South
really come? Focusing on four main areas of Southern life _
community, workplace, church and marriage _ the stories behind the
AJC poll statistics illustrate a tantalizing racial paradox where
racial attitudes and actions have come closer, but still only
rarely intersect. (Harris, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

specialists trek the nation, examining sickness and mortality

   ROCKMAN _ BALL GROUND, Ga. _ Drive through downtown Ball Ground
most any day and you'll probably see the old man in his parked red
pickup truck. He sits on the side of the road by one of the nine
buildings downtown that he has filled with a massive collection of
stones, rocks, gems and minerals. The man in the truck is Oscar
Robertson, a 75-year-old eccentric who watches people stroll past
the hardware store and post office before they try to open a locked
door to one of his shops. They often leave perplexed and
frustrated, however, because Robertson rarely unlocks his stores to
sell anything to anyone. City leaders cringe at the Rock Man's
reluctance to cater to the stream of tourists and rock collectors.
That stream, after all, could pump big bucks into the local
economy. Mayor Roberts and other civic leaders want Ball Ground to
get a piece of the action. They dream of a Ball Ground where people
from the big city and its suburbs visit antique stores, see the
rock shops and eat in sidewalk cafes. But the ``Rock Man'' just
wants to be left alone with his rocks. (Bixler, Atlanta

three-legged, is the inducement. So I was prone to drop the subject

 &HT;    Lifetime series shows real-life weddings

   TV PREVIEW
</P>
<P>
   ``Weddings of a Lifetime XV''
</P>
<P>
   8 tonight on Lifetime
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There were few dry eyes in the house when Daryl Tate
and Melissa Summers shared their first married kiss one Friday
night last month.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing embrace seemed to last several minutes. When the
happy couple finally began moving down the aisle of Atlanta's
Hillside Chapel and Truth Center, toward happily ever after, they
passed rows of beaming relatives and
</P>
<P>
   friends . . .
</P>
<P>
   . . . And a guy with a headset giving them directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to re-create the magic of the kissing of the bride,''
floor director Dale Stern apologetically told the crowd. ``Welcome
to Hollywood, ladies and gentlemen!''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome, in fact, to ``Weddings of a Lifetime,'' which four
times each year takes the largely romantic fantasy of getting
married and matches it with the cold, hard realities of television
production.
</P>
<P>
   It's essentially an arranged date where everybody wins: The
hourlong ``Weddings'' are Lifetime Television's highest-rated
nonmovie specials, with one recent installment being watched by
nearly 1.2 million homes. Couples get fantasies fulfilled (Grammy
winner BeBe Winans sang at Summers' nuptials) and most of the
expenses paid (Lifetime alone estimated it would spend as much as
$500,000 on this 15th ``Weddings'' installment, for everything from
crew costs to music rights) _ all in exchange for letting anyone
with basic cable watch them take the plunge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a spiritual thing,'' Summers, the megapopular KISS 104.7
DJ, explained hours before her wedding to Atlanta police officer
Tate, to be shown tonight on Lifetime. ``Not only can we touch
Atlanta this way, but also people nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   The urge to share one's nuptial bliss isn't uncommon, says one
expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people just feel they have such a great love story,
they want to broadcast it _ out of general good will,'' said Lois
Smith Brady, whose new book, ``Love Lessons: 12 Real-Life Love
Stories,'' includes couples who'd previously let her describe their
weddings for millions of Sunday New York Times readers. ``And then
there's just plain old ego. Brides and grooms have big egos!''
</P>
<P>
   But forget why anyone would want to televise their wedding. How
it happens is the really interesting part.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a double production,'' executive producer Lou Gorfain
explained outside the Grand Hyatt Buckhead, where Summers' fully
decked-out and made-up bridesmaids were filming a segment nine
hours before the ceremony. ``And the wedding is just as much of a
production as the TV show.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a man equipped with a detailed, 12-page production
schedule and enough experience to know that when something
inevitably goes awry _ in this case, Mayor Bill Campbell had to
miss rehearsing his entrance with Summers' mother and
great-grandmother _ they'll just work around it.
</P>
<P>
   Over Gorfain's shoulder, ``Weddings'' co-host Eva LaRue Callahan
mispronounced a designer's name on-camera. Gorfain threw a mock
look of despair at maid of honor Carolyn Anderson, who'd already
had to introduce herself on-air several times.
</P>
<P>
   ``See? And she's the talent!'' Gorfain pointed at Callahan, late
of the ABC soap ``All My Children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right, now I feel better,'' Anderson chuckled.
</P>
<P>
   With husband John Callahan (Edmund Grey on ``All My Children''),
LaRue Callahan has hosted seven ``Weddings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting thing I find every time is how shocked not
only the bride and groom, but also their family and friends, are by
the end,'' LaRue Callahan said during a shooting break in a 16-hour
day. ``Yes, it's their wedding. But they sometimes forget it's also
about getting a show on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting this show on the air meant solving some common wedding
problems. Summers changed her mind ``so many times'' about the
wedding's color scheme, joked her mother, Mary Brand of Red
Springs, N.C., ``I didn't know whether to cry, fly or sigh.'' But
it also meant dealing with the unusual, even for ``Weddings of a
Lifetime.'' For starters, this couple had a much higher public
profile than their predecessors; one Lifetime staffer says Summers,
nicknamed ``Atlanta's Girlfriend,'' was the first ``Weddings''
bride with her own PR people.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually everything about Summers' relationship with Tate was
well-known to listeners _ from how they met in his capacity as a
member of Mayor Campbell's executive protection team to how he and
Lifetime surprised her on-air with the news they'd been selected
for ``Weddings.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, the couple had invited the entire city to attend their
Saturday wedding on the steps of the State Capitol. When city
officials raised concerns about nearby Braves game traffic, Tate
and Summers moved the ceremony back a day, to Hillside, and limited
fan attendance through a hotline number _ all to Lifetime's quiet
relief. ``We'd had a lot of conversations about `Can we control
this situation with so many fans?''' confided Julie Falk, an
original programming director.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Lifetime had kind of asked for all this. Having
produced ``Weddings'' everywhere from a cruise ship to the U.S.
Naval Academy chapel in Annapolis, the network was itching to show
a real ``hometown'' wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both outstanding `hometown' people,'' said Falk, whose
network culls thousands of letters looking for captivating story
lines. ``What a couple has to have to be chosen is not only a very
interesting relationship, but they have to be interesting as
individuals as well.''
</P>
<P>
   From Tate's law enforcement work to Summer's rags-to-riches rise
from Army enlistee to nationally syndicated radio star _ ``She is
the Lifetime woman,'' Gorfain enthused _ it all was interesting to
the network. Some 17 days of filming everywhere from the
Lillington, N.C., home of Summers' great-grandmother, Ella
McLaughlin, to inside Campbell's car added up to 40 hours of film.
Falk said it was well worth the effort to get tonight's 40-plus
minutes. ``This couple just pops off the screen,'' she said
emphatically the morning of the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, ``this couple'' looked a tad weary rehearsing
at Hillside. While crews positioned cameras and checked sound
levels, a handful of formally dressed guests provided background
for an interview segment with Brand and McLaughlin. Lifetime
doesn't stop the actual ceremony once it begins, so almost nothing
was being left to chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us, there are certain moments we can't re-create or
reshoot,'' Falk had explained. ``We can reshoot the bridesmaids
here a bunch of times, but Daryl will only see her in her dress for
the first time once. There'll only be one first kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean there can't be a second first kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Hollywood, ladies and gentlemen.

WESTERN LEADERS DETAIL PLAN FOR AIDING BALKANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ Leaders of the seven wealthiest nations and
Russia outlined a plan Sunday for ending eight years of war in the
Balkans through a vast program of aid and political support, but
said Yugoslavia must undertake ``democratic and economic reforms''
to take part.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a three-day summit meeting, the leaders of
Britain, France and Germany said that in their view, democratic
reform in Yugoslavia would have to involve the departure of
President Slobodan Milosevic, but in deference to Russia no
explicit reference to him was included in the final statement.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton advocated a meeting of Western and regional
leaders in the Balkans in the next few months and said he would
attend. Such a meeting, unprecedented since Yugoslavia began to
unravel in violence in 1991, would symbolize a commitment to draw
the Balkans into the West and highlight Milosevic's isolation,
Western officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president got agreement from the leaders that there should
be a Balkan conference, in the Balkans, sometime in the
not-too-distant future,'' National Security Adviser Sandy Berger
said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin, looking puffy and uncertain on
his feet, joined the other leaders Sunday for the concluding hours
of the summit meeting and then talked for an hour with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In a determined effort to cast the encounter with Yeltsin in the
most positive terms Western leaders, including Clinton, avoided any
reference to contentious issues such as what sort of aid _ if any _
should be given to Serbia and what sort of orders should be sent to
the Russian troops who raced to the airport in Pristina, capital of
Kosovo, earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, there were no visible disagreements and the meeting
of the leaders of the United States, Britain, Germany, France,
Canada, Italy, Japan and Russia ended about an hour earlier than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   A final communique stated their support for a number of
important causes, including debt relief, lifelong education, more
employment, a balance between social security and greater personal
initiative, democracy in Nigeria and peace in the Middle East. But
the main thrust of the discussions was on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The positive, sometimes patently relieved tone of the meeting
seemed to reflect a growing conviction that the ethnic wars in the
region that have left more than 200,000 people dead and forced
millions of people from their homes may at last have exhausted
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The final statement called for ``the creation of a democratic,
multiethnic Kosovo.'' It added: ``The return of refugees and
displaced persons to their homes and the assurance of security for
all persons including Serb and all other minorities in Kosovo will
be high priorities of the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Serbs, afraid of reprisals from returning Kosovo Albanians,
have fled since the 11-week &UR;  &LR; war ended. The Serbian government is
now urging them to go back, and several hundred reportedly did so
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said the eight countries would ``fully cooperate
with the work of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia,'' which indicted Milosevic last month. But it made no
reference to the acts of Serbian forces in Kosovo during the war.
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said of Serbia that,
``Reconstruction aid, re-establishment of economic structures and
re-incorporation into Europe need democratization and that is not
possible with Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   But because of disagreements with Russia, which wants Serbia to
receive broad assistance, the leaders' statement contained no
details of how the billions of dollars of planned aid should be
distributed through the war-ravaged region.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the leaders of the richer nations, the Group of
Seven, but not Russia, agreed that only basic emergency assistance
_ food, shelter and medicine _ should be given to Serbia while
Milosevic remains in power. Britain expressed the view that even
this kind of aid was excessive and unjustifiable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe people would understand if we put money into
an undemocratic Serbia under Milosevic,'' British Prime Minister
Tony Blair said. ``Nobody can shut their eyes to the fact that
thousands were butchered with unforgivable barbarism in Kosovo, and
we cannot start giving money to those that perpetrated these
barbarities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plea to the people of Serbia is that you can be part of a
prosperous Balkan future, but first embrace values of democracy and
civilization that are incompatible with having an indicted war
criminal at the head of your country,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Germany, which earlier this month drew up a so-called
``Stability Pact'' involving the establishment of ``democratic
principles and values'' and ``vibrant market economies'' throughout
the region to aid the Balkans countries harmed by the war, said it
had agreed to Clinton's request that it organize the Balkan summit
conference.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that tens of billions of dollars will be needed
for the West's new plans for Balkan reconstruction and economic
reform, and the leaders said Sunday that the World Bank and the
European Commission would coordinate efforts to raise money. An
initial conference on emergency aid will be held in July.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Steiner, the chief diplomatic adviser to Schroeder, said
that money would be used as a political weapon to isolate
Milosevic. Aid would be pointedly channeled to Kosovo, Montenegro
and even perhaps areas of Serbia run or controlled by opposition
parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, there is a danger that some of this may seep to
Belgrade, but that should not stop us targeting the areas we want
to help, and so illustrating that democracy pays,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Kosovo and the republic of Montenegro are part of what is
left of Yugoslavia, but Western leaders are clearly determined to
draw a distinction between these parts of the federation and
Belgrade, however difficult this may be.

   French President Jacques Chirac said all the countries of the
Balkans could now aspire to membership in the European Union, but
added that the 15-nation bloc ``is not prepared to import conflict
into its midst.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The countries in the area should take an example from Romania,
which wants to join the European Union and has therefore resolved
its problems with its ethnic Hungarian minority,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Milosevic's future, Chirac added: ``Serb forces in
Kosovo probably obeyed orders and certainly responded to instincts
that were inadmissible and intolerable. The Serbian people should
now draw the appropriate political conclusions, and my own view is
the sooner they do this, the better for everyone.''

   KOSOVO-RDP (Podujevo) _ The last of some 40,000 Serb forces left
Kosovo on Sunday a few hours ahead of NATO's deadline for
withdrawal, leaving in their wake new scenes of jubilation among
the province's Albanians, as well as new acts of retribution. With
the withdrawal completed, NATO's secretary-general, Javier Solana,
announced that he had lifted the alliance's threat to resume
bombing, formally ending an air war that lasted 78 days and
culminated with the occupation of Kosovo by NATO-led peacekeepers
over the last eight days. By Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-SUMMIT (Cologne) _ Leaders of the G7 nations and Russia
outlined on Sunday a plan for ending eight years of war in the
Balkans through a massive program of aid and political support for
the region, but said Yugoslavia must undertake ``democratic and
economic reforms'' to be part of the process. At the end of a
three-day summit meeting, the leaders of Britain, France and
Germany said democratic reform in Yugoslavia involved the departure
of Milosevic; but in deference to Russia no explicit reference to
the Serbian leader was included in the final statement. By Roger
Cohen.

in Central Europe is entering a new phase. After tireless and
largely successful efforts to align their economies with those of
western Europe, countries like Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic are pushing hard for the ultimate badge of acceptance:
membership in the European Union. But at least here in Poland,
Central Europe's biggest country and thus its brightest economic
star, leaders now find that a sizable part of the population is
balking. By Edmund L. Andrews.

   OBIT-FADIMAN (Undated) _ Clifton Fadiman, the essayist, critic,
editor and indefatigable anthologist whose encyclopedic knowledge
made him a mainstay of ``Information Please'' and other popular

Sanibel Island, Fla. He was 95 and had lived on the nearby island
of Captiva. By Richard Severo.

   MICROSOFT-GAME (New York) _ For most of New York it was a normal
weekend, but mingling among the natives was a group of very unusual
tourists, mostly current and former Microsoft employees, more than
a handful of them millionaires, who for 24 hours turned the city
into a game board. The scavenger hunt, which players call ``The
Game,'' is normally played in Seattle. But this year the game
organizers decided to ``raise the rims'' and bring it to New York
City to add a new level of complexity. At its root the game is a
frivolous adventure, but one fueled by the players' and designers'
creativity, not to mention their stock options and ego.

changes, which have been creeping up for more than a decade, are

DEADLINE LOOMS AS BILL TO PROTECT PRIVACY OF MEDICAL RECORDS
LANGUISHES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Vt.)  (Exclusive) 
 (rk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Legislation to protect the privacy of medical
records is dying under pressure from insurance companies, health
care businesses, law-enforcement officials and others lobbying
Congress to preserve their access to sensitive information on
patients.
</P>
<P>
   As envisioned, the bill was supposed to establish comprehensive
federal standards for the confidentiality of medical records. The
goal of a uniform medical privacy standard was originally shared by
consumer advocates and the health care industry, which now operates
under rules that vary from state to state.
</P>
<P>
   But some consumer and privacy advocates now say the bill, which
has been changed amid a spirited lobbying blitz, permits health
insurers, health care businesses and law enforcement officials to
encroach on privacy rather than protect patients' confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   On four occasions in the last month, a Senate committee has
scheduled and then canceled meetings to amend and vote on the
legislation, which would affect virtually everyone who receives,
provides or pays for health care in the United States: doctors,
patients, hospitals, drugstores, employers, insurers, insurance
agents and researchers, among others.
</P>
<P>
   With so many competing interests swarming round the bill, it
appears to be doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Congress faces a deadline. If it does not act by August, Donna
Shalala, the secretary of Health and Human Services, is supposed to
issue privacy-protection rules. But Congress could stop her or
extend the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The stated purpose of the bill, drafted over the last three
years by Sen. James M. Jeffords, R-Vt., is to ``establish strong
and effective mechanisms to protect against the unauthorized and
inappropriate use of protected health information.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, the bill says, health care providers and insurance
companies may not disclose information from an individual's medical
records unless the person has authorized such disclosure. But then,
it says, anyone who wants health insurance must, ``as a condition
of enrollment in the health plan,'' authorize the use and
disclosure of personal health information, not only for medical
treatment and the payment of claims, but also for the vaguely
defined purpose of ``health care operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the bill would virtually force patients to give
consent, on penalty of losing their health insurance. A health plan
could deny coverage to people who refused to give consent.
</P>
<P>
   James C. Pyles, an expert on privacy rights who represents the
American Psychoanalytic Association and many home health agencies,
said: ``The bill recognizes a right to confidentiality, but
essentially eliminates it by compelling the consent as a condition
of obtaining insurance or even treatment in some cases. That's not
really consent; it's submission.''
</P>
<P>
   George J. Annas, chairman of the health law department at the
Boston University School of Public Health, said: ``The bill tends
to erode confidentiality more than it guarantees confidentiality.
More people would be authorized to have access to your medical
records than have access under current law. Health plans and
researchers would say that's a good thing because it'll make the
health care more efficient and speed up gene-based research to look
for new drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, law-enforcement officials could request and
obtain medical records in ``exigent circumstances'' if they were in
hot pursuit of a suspect or a fugitive, or if they were simply
trying to locate and identify a material witness. Some health care
professionals are particularly queasy about this aspect of the
bill, although the Justice Department has endorsed it.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. E. Ratcliffe Anderson Jr., executive vice president of the
American Medical Association, contends that the bill ``implicitly
deputizes physicians as law-enforcement officers,'' forcing doctors
to violate their ethical duty to patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are alarmed,'' Anderson said. ``The power that would be
vested with law enforcement is nothing short of breathtaking.''
</P>
<P>
   John T. Bentivoglio, chief privacy officer at the Justice
Department, said: ``Our intent is not to deputize medical
professionals as law-enforcement officers. But there are situations
where we need medical information to investigate crimes and protect
public safety. In those situations, we feel it's reasonable for
law-enforcement officers to have the information we need.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, health care is provided by large networks of
doctors, hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, pharmacies and
insurance companies that want to share certain types of information
on patients.
</P>
<P>
   Charles N. Kahn III, president of the Health Insurance
Association of America, said: ``We don't favor indiscriminate
access to medical information. We use it only to enhance the
quality of care and to prevent fraud and abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Health plans routinely use the information in their files to
contact women who need a mammogram or patients with a particular
disease who could benefit from a new drug.
</P>
<P>
   Health maintenance organizations have developed many techniques
to detect fraud, to learn which treatments are most effective, to
evaluate the work of individual doctors and to identify those who
order too many tests and procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers and HMOs say it is totally impractical for them to
request permission each time they want to use a patient's medical
records. Under Jeffords' bill and similar measures pending in the
House, a health insurance company could require a patient to sign
one form authorizing all future use of the person's medical records
for ``treatment, payment and health care operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of those terms is broadly defined in a way that seems to
codify current practices in the health care industry. ``Treatment''
includes risk assessment, disease management and the ``coordination
of health care or other services among health care providers and
third parties authorized by the health plan.'' Likewise,
``payment'' includes all sorts of activities to determine whether a
service is medically necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health care operations'' encompass almost everything for which
a health plan might want to use a patient's medical records:
``quality assessment and improvement activities,'' developing
clinical guidelines, reviewing the competence of doctors and
nurses, tracking variations in medical practice, auditing claims
and setting premiums and insurance rates based on the medical
history of an individual or a group.

 WASHINGTON: a group. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In trying to pass a bill, Congress has come to an impasse on
questions like these:
</P>
<P>
   _ If the federal government sets standards, should states be
allowed to go further and pass laws providing even more protection
for the privacy of medical records? Insurers say no; they want
uniform national standards because they continually send
information across state lines. But consumer advocates hope states
will pass stronger laws.
</P>
<P>
   _ Should the government provide extra protection for records on
particularly sensitive subjects like mental illness, HIV and AIDS
and genetic test results?
</P>
<P>
   _ Should parents be able to examine the medical records of their
children? Opponents of abortion say yes; advocates of abortion
rights say young women should not have to open such records to
their parents. The bill, as it stands, says that the rights of
minor children can be exercised by a parent or by the child, as
provided under state law.
</P>
<P>
   _ Should patients be able to sue anyone who improperly discloses
their medical records? Should there be a limit on damages?
</P>
<P>
   The bill would create a limited right to sue for certain
intentional violations of a patient's privacy rights, but neither
consumer advocates nor insurance companies like the proposed
compromise.

 &HT;    As Last Serbian Troops Withdraw Kosovo Town of Shame Appears
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAJKOVAC, Yugoslavia As the last Serbian Army troops pulled out
</P>
<P>
   of Kosovo on Sunday, they left behind a town of shame where more
than 8,254
</P>
<P>
   Kosovar Albanian refugees were herded at gunpoint and packed
into private
</P>
<P>
   houses with little more than bread and water for two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have enough to eat, but at least we survived,'' said
Fehmi
</P>
<P>
   Tahiri, 33, who leaving Sajkovac on Sunday, pushing all of his
possessions
</P>
<P>
   on a wheel barrow. The tall, gaunt farmer said he had dropped
from 165
</P>
<P>
   pounds to 143 pounds on a diet of bread and some occasional
soup. And he
</P>
<P>
   had his tractor stolen.
</P>
<P>
   On his way home, he passed the town's cemetery that bulged with
51
</P>
<P>
   freshly dug graves. Ten of the mounds were so stubby that they
appeared to
</P>
<P>
   be a burial ground for small children.
</P>
<P>
   Sobbing softly beside one three-day-old mound of earth was a
young mother.
</P>
<P>
   Abide Mulolli, 22, said her father was shot by Yugoslav soldiers
just
</P>
<P>
   hours before they abandoned the town and allowed the remaining
5,816
</P>
<P>
   refugees to go home. That was about three days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tried to sneak out to go and buy some food and medicine for
the
</P>
<P>
   children,'' she said. ``The British peacekeepers brought us his
body when
</P>
<P>
   they arrived on the same day the Yugoslavs left.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Serb campaign of ethnic cleansing struck northern
Kosovo in
</P>
<P>
   late April, dozens of members of the extended Mulolli clan were
driven from
</P>
<P>
   Sajkovac to join a refugee stream that spent two weeks being
herded from
</P>
<P>
   town to town, somehow never being allowed to flee into exile in
Albania or
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Then in early May, the Serbian police directed the Mulollis and
perhaps
</P>
<P>
   50,000 other refugees back north toward the Serbian border.
Abide Mulolli
</P>
<P>
   and her parents were allowed to return home -- so they could
turn their
</P>
<P>
   little courtyard into an involuntary refugee camp for 86 people.
</P>
<P>
   Every Sajkovac refugee even two-year-olds was assigned a number
and
</P>
<P>
   registration certificate that delineated how far each one could
travel. In
</P>
<P>
   many cases, refugees were only authorized to move around inside
their own
</P>
<P>
   house or walled compound. A few others were allowed to move
about the town.
</P>
<P>
   One refugee, a 38-year-old builder named Isup Kurtolli, took it
on
</P>
<P>
   himself to organize a house-to-house census of refugee families.
From the
</P>
<P>
   handwritten names in his green notebooks the size of the refugee
population
</P>
<P>
   in Sajkovac -- which is about 15 miles northest of Pristinea,
the Kosovo capital -- can be counted.
</P>
<P>
   On the scale of all the atrocities inflicted on the Kosovars
this year,
</P>
<P>
   the indignities suffered here are scarcely the worst. There was
no
</P>
<P>
   systematic torture in Sajkovac, no known gang rapes. Fifty-one
people died,
</P>
<P>
   some of hunger and others from scattered episodes of police or
Army
</P>
<P>
   shootings. But there were no known mass executions.
</P>
<P>
   All that happened to those concentrated by the Serbs in Sajkovac
is
</P>
<P>
   that they were forced to live 30 or 40 people to a room for two
months.
</P>
<P>
   And to be so short of nutrition that they lost 20 to 40 pounds
each. To
</P>
<P>
   stay alive, many were forced to buy bread flour from Serbian
troops at five
</P>
<P>
   times the standard price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 86 people in our home,'' said Abide Mulolli.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took in 163 people -- 11 in my family and 152 refugees we'd
never
</P>
<P>
   seen before,'' said her uncle Nazmi Mulolli, 60.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 79 people sleeping in two rooms,'' said another
relative,
</P>
<P>
   Ramadan Mulolli. ``We spent almost all the time indoors because
there was a
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav Army post on the hill that would shoot at us if we came
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   He said nobody in the village ever knew for sure why they were
being
</P>
<P>
   held. ``Maybe they wanted to use us as human shields,'' he
speculated.
</P>
<P>
   With new revelations of mass graves and atrocities coming almost
daily,
</P>
<P>
   and with people like the hostages of Sajkovac consumed with
efforts to
</P>
<P>
   reassemble their lives, there was little inclination to
celebrate the final
</P>
<P>
   departure Sunday of Serbian military and police forces.
</P>
<P>
   They left quietly, most of them well ahead of the Sunday night
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Near the Serbian border only two dusky green military trucks
filled
</P>
<P>
   with soldiers were seen zipping up the road in mid afternoon. A
lone jeep
</P>
<P>
   had been abandoned in the middle of main north-south road,
facing the wrong
</P>
<P>
   way to exit Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the withdrawal ended a decade of Belgrade's dominance and
</P>
<P>
   repression in Serbia's Connecticut-sized province, a decade that
</P>
<P>
   culminated in the horrors still being uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovar Albanians in the southern and middle sectors of the
province
</P>
<P>
   happily marked the withdrawal of troops from their areas earlier
in the
</P>
<P>
   week. The final withdrawal of Serb forces came from the north of
Kosovo,
</P>
<P>
   where most of the inhabitants are Serbian rather than ethnic
Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   The northern population, being predominantly Serbian and sitting
so
</P>
<P>
   close to safety at the border with Serbia, seemed to care little
about the

   troop withdrawal. Nor did they have disparaging remarks about
the

<P>
   international peacekeeping units spearheaded by NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   Most are farmers who spent this sunny, hot Sunday as other days,
in
</P>
<P>
   backbreaking field labor. Now is hay harvesting time, and
families were out
</P>
<P>
   in force swinging arced scythes and making haystacks.

   ``The troops left yesterday. For now there are no problems,''
said Srecko

   Radosavlevic, 26, who was standing by the side of the road
awaiting a ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do worry about the Kosovo Liberation Army.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he said he could not understand why so many Serbs living in
Kosovo
</P>
<P>
   gave in to ``momentary panic'' and fled. They were
</P>
<P>
   still leaving Sunday, not in a steady stream but in occasional
cars or
</P>
<P>
   horse-drawn carts piled high with family furniture and clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will be back,'' he said.

 &HT;    N.C. labs take the first step in pollution prevention _ research
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C. _ Inside an 8-by-4-foot chamber
with stainless steel walls and glass windows, volunteers work out
on an exercise bike while researchers carefully pipe ozone gas into
the room from air tanks outside.
</P>
<P>
   After the volunteers emerge from the chamber, researchers ask
them a battery of medical-related questions or conduct medical
exams, looking for signs or symptoms of health changes.
</P>
<P>
   To the casual observer, the experiments in this obscure lab near
Raleigh may seem little more than an academic pursuit. But, in
fact, this is ground zero in the nation's war on air pollution.
Here, researchers are working to find out how exposure to the
noxious gas _ at levels typically found in metro Atlanta and other
urban areas during the summer _ affects people in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   And what researchers learn here in the blips and bits of data
that emerge from the tests reaches far and wide, driving
environmental regulations in Atlanta and other major metropolitan
areas.
</P>
<P>
   The laboratory and several others like it are part of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency's Human Studies Facility on the
University of North Carolina campus in Chapel Hill. It is one of
several EPA laboratories and centers near Raleigh where scientists
conduct experiments and pore over scientific studies to determine
the standards to protect Americans against dangerous air
pollutants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working here to make people healthy and reduce their
risks of dying before their time,'' says Dr. John Vandenberg,
assistant director of the EPA's National Health and Environmental
Effects Research Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Under the mandates of the landmark 1970 Clean Air Act, the EPA
must establish maximum acceptable pollution levels for the nation
for six key pollutants _ ozone, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide,
particulate matter, lead and sulfur dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   The law also requires that new scientific research on each of
those pollutants be regularly reviewed and a scientific analysis
issued at least every five years. If the new analyses indicate that
an air pollution standard is not sufficiently protecting human
health, the EPA administrator may be advised to tighten up the
standard.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Center for Environmental Assessment in Research
Triangle Park, air quality experts continually examine new
scientific information from laboratories and institutions all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Many studies are conducted by the EPA itself at its Human
Studies Facility. The research includes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Animal studies, which most often involve rats and mice and
sometimes dogs that act as substitutes for humans. The animals can
be exposed to doses of air pollutants many times higher than the
ranges commonly found in American cities to determine adverse
health effects.
</P>
<P>
   _ In vitro studies, which involve cells or small samples of
tissue that have been removed from humans or animals and then
exposed to pollutants to determine what damage may occur.
</P>
<P>
   _ Epidemiological studies, in which groups of people or entire
communities may be followed over a period of time to determine if
there are higher-than-usual sickness and death rates and if there
is a common source of a problem. Air in the community may be
monitored to see if health problems emerge on days when pollutant
levels are high. Hospital admissions and emergency room visits also
may be tracked over time to see if patterns emerge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Controlled human studies, in which volunteers with a variety
of backgrounds and characteristics _ such as age, sex, height,
weight, physical condition, the presence of illnesses such as
asthma and emphysema _ are placed in the testing chambers or other
controlled environments and exposed to pollutants for precisely
timed periods.
</P>
<P>
   In the Human Testing Facility, volunteers exposed to ozone in
the testing chambers may be surveyed about symptoms _ shortness of
breath, coughing, tiredness. In some cases, researchers may insert
scopes equipped with tiny cameras into their bronchial tubes to see
possible effects from the ozone, such as inflammation. Sometimes
the scopes are used to scrape cells from the lining of the
bronchial tubes to examine under the microscope.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason EPA does its own research is because we can respond
more quickly to regulatory concerns'' than outside institutions
can, says Dr. Bill McDonnell, medical officer for the clinical
research branch of the Human Studies Division.
</P>
<P>
   Under the provisions of the Clean Air Act, EPA must analyze all
of the scientific information for a particular pollutant _ from
EPA's own laboratories and from institutions around the world _ and
summarize it in a ``criteria document,'' which is often thicker
than a phone book. The document is scrutinized by outside experts,
and from that information EPA develops a ``staff paper'' that
becomes the scientific foundation for air quality laws.
</P>
<P>
   In the staff paper, EPA indicates levels of a pollutant
acceptably safe for human health, taking into account especially
sensitive groups _ such as those with asthma _ and also
incorporating a margin of safety which considers the possible but
unproven effects of the pollutant. That paper also is reviewed by
outside experts. From there, the staff recommendations move to the
White House for review and finally to the EPA administrator, who
publishes it in the Federal Register. After that, the proposed new
standard undergoes public hearings and other scrutiny before
becoming law.
</P>
<P>
   State and local governments, in turn, are responsible for
devising so-called state implementation plans spelling out how they
plan to meet the new standards by certain dates that may vary
according to the extent and nature of the problem. Georgia's new
SIP unveiled this month, for instance, will require vehicle
inspections every year, instead of every other year, controls on
existing and proposed new industries, cleaner-burning gas in 69
North Georgia counties and much cleaner power plants.
</P>
<P>
   The process can take years. Last year, it culminated in a
tighter nationwide ozone standard _ a limit of 80 parts per billion
of ozone per cubic meter of air averaged over eight hours. EPA's
scientists had determined that the new standard, which improves on
the previous 120 ppb exposure limit averaged over a one-hour
period, is necessary to protect people _ especially children _ who
are exposed to ozone several hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Implementation of the new standard, however, was blocked last
month by three federal judges ruling in a lawsuit brought by
trucking organizations and other industry groups. The judges did
not question the science in developing the ozone standard, but
ruled that Congress did not have the authority to delegate the
rule-making to the EPA. The agency plans to appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, EPA is enforcing its old standard in effect since
1979. State environmental officials must submit its detailed plan
by October on how the region will meet the standard by 2003.

 &HT;    Rock man won't budge
 &HT;    (Photos available.)
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALL GROUND, Ga. _ Drive through this North Georgia town most
any day and you'll probably see him. A man sitting in a parked red
pickup truck outside one of the nine buildings that he has filled
with a massive collection of stones, rocks, gems and minerals.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Robertson, 75, watches people stroll past the hardware
store and post office before they try to open a locked door to one
of his shops. The visitors often squint and cup their hands to
their eyes, peering through big glass windows at jade necklaces,
bracelets and earrings, smooth green rocks shaped like eggs and
bookends of shiny gray stone.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson owns so many rocks that word of his collection
attracts tourists and collectors from all over Georgia, Alabama and
Tennessee. They come each weekend to downtown Ball Ground, about 50
miles north of Atlanta, to see the famous rock shops. They often
leave perplexed and frustrated, however, because Robertson rarely
unlocks his stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones I talk to are the ones who come in City Hall and say,
`How do we get in those rock shops?' '' said Mayor Rick Roberts.
``We have to tell them, `Look for the red pickup.' ''
</P>
<P>
   City leaders cringe at the Rock Man's reluctance to cater to the
stream of tourists and rock collectors. That stream, after all,
could pump big bucks into the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Roberts and other civic leaders have watched as growth has
enriched and revitalized many communities around metro Atlanta, and
they want Ball Ground to have a piece of the action. They dream of
a picturesque Ball Ground where people from the big city and its
suburbs visit antique stores, see the rock shops and eat in
sidewalk cafes.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rock Man stands between them and their vision.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Rock Man owns about half of the buildings
downtown. Roberts' dream of a downtown revival is being held up by
a man who says he just wants to be left alone with his rocks.
</P>
<P>
   People of the town like Nelle Hefner, a 70-year-old antiques
dealer, said the Rock Man has too much power.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has always been good to me. I have no personal bone to
pick,'' Hefner said. ``It's just that I'm sorry that any one person
can have so much control over a town.''
</P>
<P>
   Land, rocks his obsession
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't know it to look at him, but the Rock Man is very
rich.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't drive fancy cars or sail great big yachts, doesn't
jet off to the Caribbean or winter in the south of France. He lives
in a modest ranch-style house on a hill at the edge of downtown,
wears a baseball cap that says ``ROCKMAN'' and eats burgers from
the Checkers fast-food restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   He says he is worth $62 million, but he also says he was friends
with Presidents John F. Kennedy and Herbert Hoover. Over the years,
he has sold and repaired cars, cut hair and timber and driven taxis
and school buses.
</P>
<P>
   He made his fortune, though, buying and selling land.
</P>
<P>
   The Rock Man has bought and sold so much property in Cherokee
County that courthouse records of the transactions fill 367 pages
in 108 deed books. His real estate career began in 1948, when, at
age 24, he paid $800 for two tracts of land that didn't even total
an acre. He has gobbled up land, sold timber rights and unloaded
property at a healthy profit nearly every year since.
</P>
<P>
   Tax records in Cherokee, Gordon and Pickens counties show that
he now has 2,200 acres worth $5.9 million, although he has
transferred ownership of some of that land to his two grown
daughters. His holdings in Cherokee County, where he has lived
since he was a boy, include 990 acres worth $4 million. Dealing in
land has been an obsession, but it hardly compares to Robertson's
fixation with rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Step inside his shops and you see it at once.
</P>
<P>
   On a wall just inside the front door of one building, Robertson
has hung a framed box of arrowheads near strands of green beads
dangling from a wooden post. Slabs of pink and white marble lean
against a wall. Pale yellow rocks fill aluminum washtubs. In
another room, 98 boxes of fuel pumps for 1948 Plymouths and 1951
Studebakers gather dust. Baseball gloves, headlights and scissors
hang from hundreds of nails in the ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   But rocks are everywhere you turn.
</P>
<P>
   As Robertson walked through his stores he reeled off the names
of those rocks like a teacher recalling students who graduated
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Agate. Melilite. Staurolite crystals.
</P>
<P>
   The roll call ended when Robertson spied an egg-shaped rock on
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a break-in,'' he announced.
</P>
<P>
   Did someone climb in through the roof? Smash a window in the
side of the building?
</P>
<P>
   The Rock Man investigated for 15 minutes before concluding that
a squirrel had burrowed through the roof and mistaken the egg for a
nut. Then he paused to refine his deduction.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, he said, it was a wharf rat.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson knows people say he's strange, but he said that
doesn't bother him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're strange because you don't know the names of
gems and minerals,'' he said. ``That's strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Hefner, the antiques dealer, said Robertson's ability to amass
millions of dollars buying and selling land proves that he is more
than a one-dimensional and lonely man who whiles away his days in a
red pickup truck. Even so, Robertson struck her as odd when they
met decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was peculiar even then,'' she said as wind chimes tinkled
and a train whistled in the distance. ``He didn't have a great deal
to do with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Anger at city officials
</P>
<P>
   Robertson acknowledged that he has few friends but said he does
not get lonely. Much of his energy is focused on his anger at city
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The City Hall down there is really a bunch of Mafia,'' he
said. ``If they thought they could get away with it, they'd shoot
me dead in the street.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials characterize their relationship with Robertson in
less vitriolic terms. Roberts said he and members of the City
Council have tried to maintain friendly relations with the Rock
Man. Last year, they negotiated a deal to assemble a group of
investors who would buy Robertson's downtown properties for $2
million.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was for the city to keep ownership of one or two of the
buildings and run a small museum. Businessmen would decide what to
do with the others. Perhaps an entrepreneur would have maintained
the rock shops and marketed them to the legions of rock collectors
and tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those rock shops are drawing cards,'' the mayor said. ``They
could be such a plus for the city.''
</P>
<P>
   When Robertson backed out at the last minute, he dealt another
blow to their hopes for downtown Ball Ground.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, the population of Cherokee County has grown by 145
percent, from 52,000 to 127,000. Newcomers have flooded into
sprawling subdivisions with names like Towne Lake and BridgeMill.
Dry-cleaning businesses, convenience stores and bagel shops have
sprung up where once were miles of unbroken forest. The growth has
transformed the southern part of the county from sleepy countryside
to bustling suburb, but Ball Ground and other communities in north
Cherokee remain largely rural and undeveloped.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,300 people who live in Ball Ground still drive 25 minutes
to the nearest grocery store. Downtown consists of a post office,
pharmacy, hardware store and two restaurants on a strip that is
two-tenths of a mile long. In the last few years, a cafe, travel
agency and a doctor's office have opened, but a pizza restaurant
and a sandwich shop have folded.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said he expects a wave of construction to crash on Ball
Ground after 2001, when he expects the city to complete installing
a sewer system. Developers already have built a few subdivisions
near the city, and Roberts said he expects some commercial
development along an exit from nearby Interstate 575.
</P>
<P>
   `It don't need to grow'
</P>
<P>
   Roberts welcomes development but has a vision for the future
very much colored by Ball Ground's past. His great-grandfather,
Alfred Webb Roberts, opened a general store shortly after the city
incorporated in 1883. Alfred W. Roberts also founded a
marble-finishing company that made tombstones and dominated the
city's economy from 1898 to 1973.
</P>
<P>
   When Roberts was growing up, the city had five grocery stores, a
furniture store and a dress shop. There was even a Ford dealership
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a trading center for the surrounding area,'' he said.
``It was hustling and bustling.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's a small town even by small-town standards.
</P>
<P>
   A community bulletin board offers residents news of local
goings-on. Homemade signs advertise used campers, refrigerators and
motorcycles for sale. One leaflet promises ``Salvation Plain and
Simple.'' Another asks: ``Do You Need A Pet Sitter?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a place where locals joke that you can dial the wrong phone
number and still know the person who answers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rock Man wants it to stay that way. He challenges the
assumption that growth will benefit the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It don't need to grow. You can't get across the street here.
You can't get in here to park,'' he said. ``I'd rather have it the
way it used to be. It's going to look just like Fulton and Cobb
counties.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson fears that development will bring to Ball Ground a
crush of such things as pay-at-the-pump gasoline stations and
brightly lit discount stores selling everything from auto parts to
yogurt. He prefers the landscape of lush pastures where hawks soar
above grazing cows _ a landscape that survives in much of northern
Cherokee County.
</P>
<P>
   On a driving tour of land he owns west of Ball Ground, Robertson
pointed toward a row of red chicken houses and gentle green hills
undulating for half a mile to a line of trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to save what I like in life,'' he said. ``See, I get a
thrill looking at that. See across yonder.''
</P>
<P>
   Lots of older residents agree that Ball Ground does not need to
grow, but others whose livelihood is tied to the city's economy see
The Rock Man as an obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of businesspeople that would like to see him
do something with downtown,'' said Dale Coker, who opened the Ball
Ground Pharmacy on Main Street six years ago. ``They'd like him to
sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories about the Rock Man have made him a local legend.
</P>
<P>
   People still talk about the time in 1994 when Robertson paid
$2.9 million in unpaid income taxes from 1987-'91. Federal agents
with rifles and bulletproof vests came to his rock shops in an
armored car to collect the money.
</P>
<P>
   He paid most of his tab in hundred-dollar bills.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, whose wife worked at a bank then, said the Rock Man
gave the agents $80,000 in dimes and quarters and nickels and
pennies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stayed there until 8 o'clock rolling coins,'' the mayor
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other people remember the nights when he dressed in white to go
dancing at a country music nightclub in Cobb County.
</P>
<P>
   ``The announcer would get on the microphone and say `Ladies and
gentlemen, Oscar Robertson has arrived!' '' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson doesn't dwell on those days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't dance anymore. That was years ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   City Hall's landlord?
</P>
<P>
   Old-timers also whisper about the time in 1967 that
investigators charged Robertson with fondling a young girl. He
pleaded no contest and was ordered in May 1969 to spend seven years
on probation and receive medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Three doctors said then that he had a history of mental illness.
One found him to be ``suffering from insanity, which manifested
itself by strong emotional disturbances and peculiar behavior.''
Another doctor said Robertson had a ``definite tendency to project
and to blame others for his difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   In case anyone doubts the existence of such charges, the mayor
keeps folded in his wallet a piece of paper torn from a yellow
legal pad. On it is written the barest details of the criminal
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Case Number 1633,'' it says. ``Date of disposition '69.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson again generated lots of discussion in March, when he
filed a handwritten claim at the county courthouse contending that
he owns the land on which City Hall stands. He demanded $4 million
in ``back rent ... and damages'' and accused the mayor of setting
fire to one of his stores in 1988. Robertson taped photocopies of
the affidavit on the windows of his rock shops.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit has no legal value except as a record of
Robertson's version of the truth, and City Attorney Thomas A. Roach
Jr. said Robertson's claims are false. The city has owned City Hall
since 1903, he said, and the mayor is the one who dialed 911 when
he saw flames at the rear of one of Robertson's stores in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel sorry for him. He thinks these things are true,''
Roach said. ``Everyone appreciates the fact that he is one to be
dealt with carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Several shopkeepers in downtown Ball Ground declined to talk
about the Rock Man for fear of his reaction. They may know that
Robertson has tangled in lawsuits with the former mayor of Canton,
the former chairman of the Cherokee Board of Commissioners and the
mayor's father, Roy Roberts Sr., a prominent banker and real-estate
developer who died on June 7.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Rock Man, the mayor remains upbeat about the
possibilities for downtown Ball Ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is permanent,'' he said. ``Things will change over
time.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, Robertson controls the future of this tiny
downtown from the front seat of his red pickup truck. You can see
him most weekdays near one of the rock shops that dominate Main
Street. Just sitting there. In the driver's seat.

 &HT;    Video replay a nonfactor in Stars' win
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ There was no shortage of touchy-feely subplots,
the stuff of sports marketing nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Modano, the franchise fixture, who played with a crack in
his wrist, thanks to Novocaine, Vicodin and the determination some
doubted he had. Joe Nieuwendyk, who leaned on crutches with blown
out knees last year while his team fizzled in the playoffs, coming
back to tie an NHL record for game-winning goals. Ed Belfour, the
maligned goalie, who outplayed Dominik Hasek in a big game. Brett
Hull, the prima donna goal-scorer who changed teams, played through
the pain of tears in his knee and groin and scored the winning the
goals in two Stanley Cup games _ the title clincher in triple
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Dallas Stars embraced their first Stanley Cup at
1:31 a.m. Sunday after Hull's game-winner against Buffalo, the
NHL's potential golden moment mutated into commissioner Gary
Bettman's worst nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that we have been playing for two months (in the
playoffs) and somebody is sleeping,'' said Hasek, the Sabres'
goalie. ``When I saw the replay I was going to go back onto the
ice. But it was not going to do any good.''
</P>
<P>
   Video replay, which was expected to be voted out anyway for
goal-crease violations at today's Board of Governors meetings in
New York, surely received a death blow in Game 6 of the Stanley Cup
finals at Marine Midland Arena. Bettman's biggest concern about the
rule is that replay defuses spontaneous fan and player celebrations
after goals while the play is being reviewed in the press box.
There was no bigger goal or celebration than in the Stars' Cup
winner. When Hull converted a rebound past Hasek 14:51 into the
third overtime, ending the second-longest game in finals history,
his skate was clearly in the goal-crease, a violation of league
rules. But when Hull slid the puck past Hasek, the Stars poured
onto the ice in celebration, referees and linesmen hugged each
other in exhaustion . . . and NHL officials went into spin control.
</P>
<P>
   As Sabres coach Lindy Ruff fumed and yelled from the bench for a
video review, the oldest trophy in North America was brought onto
the ice and presented to the Stars by Bettman. Later, Bettman
declined to comment on the goal, sending director of officials
Bryan Lewis to speak, and even refused to speak to Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I wanted was a review, but once you've got 200 people on
the ice, they're not going to review it,'' Ruff said. ``I mean,
we've gone through this procedure all year and in the playoffs. I
wanted Bettman to answer the question: Why is that not reviewed?
And he just turned his back on me. He almost looked to me like he
knew this was a tainted goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The post-game scene was a circus. Instead of the focus being on
Hull and Belfour and the Stars' first Cup in 32 years, there was
Lewis, sweating out a media drilling. The official ruling, he said,
was that Hull had possession of the puck, took it into the crease
area (which is legal) and never fully lost possession before
shooting it past Hasek. Replays showed otherwise. The puck bounced
away from Hull and came outside the crease, at which point Hull
became required to do the same. But with a skate still in the
crease, he slapped the puck in.
</P>
<P>
   In the post-game, even Modano said, ``Yeah, Brett was in the
crease.'' Then he smiled and resumed talking about the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis maintained a review took place in the booth, even though
their seemed no indication of that on the ice. But when asked how
long the review took _ one minute? five minutes? _ he said, ``I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   He denied feeling pressure to allow the goal because of the
ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   Sabres center Michael Peca said, ``They didn't have the nerve to
call the goal back. What can you do? It's over. But it'll be a
story for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no guarantee the Sabres would have won and evened the
series if the goal was disallowed. Even then, they faced the task
of winning Game 7 back in Dallas. But the Stars' didn't care about
any of this. The Cup was theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to not having to practice for a while,''
said Hull, who disclosed his torn knee ligament after the game.
``It's been a long year. I realize now what the sacrifice is to win
a Stanley Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the warmer, fuzzier moments.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Dreams of a pool slowly take a dive
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ My 13-year-old granddaughter Betsy has a special knack
for winning new friends. ``I'm Betsy Vance,'' she says, ``I have a
three-legged dog.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That will get you friends!'' I gasped.
</P>
<P>
   She has many friends and she seemed to think Winnie, the big,
black three-legged, is the inducement.
</P>
<P>
   So I was prone to drop the subject until she added: ``I believe
it would be better if I could say, `I'm Betsy Vance. I have a
three-legged dog and a swimming pool.'''
</P>
<P>
   She can't say that she has a swimming pool, but none of us
doubts its efficacy as a friend-getter. There are days when we all
look out across the weedy overgrown yard and dream of a pure placid
sheet of water.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy has friends who have swimming pools. They seem to go with
expensive houses in the subdivisions.
</P>
<P>
   Before our nearest subdivision was completed, our dog Kazan
discovered the pool and used to take a morning dip there daily.
</P>
<P>
   He also brought home the neighbor's Wall Street Journal. My
husband, Jack, was glad to get it, but when Kazan started bringing
USA Today, he threatened to cancel his paper dog.
</P>
<P>
   But neighbors build fences around their pools and their
mailboxes are difficult to access for even a tall dog, so we no
longer freeload in their front yards. We simply dream.
</P>
<P>
   A swimming pool would be wonderful. Looking back, our family has
had the advantage of water to swim in for generations.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up with a wonderful big millpond where the water was
clear and cold, and I had a diving board and a little pirogue,
where I could float and drowse when I grew tired from swimming.
</P>
<P>
   When the children were babies, we lived near Pensacola Beach,
Fla., and a bridge pass was all it took to get us to the blue water
and white sand.
</P>
<P>
   When we moved to Atlanta, the Woman's Club pool was less than a
block away and Piedmont swimming pool was in easy walking distance.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I walked my brood up there daily for two weeks to take
the Red Cross swimming lessons. (I can smell the sweat and the
suntan oil even today.)
</P>
<P>
   When we moved to Sweet Apple, we had Jack's lake, a small but
perfect little body of water to which we raced at the end of every
summer day. We even hauled in white sand to make a smidgen beach
there.
</P>
<P>
   Now the road to the lake has been obliterated. I believe that is
also true of the lake. At least, the children and I couldn't find
it the last time we looked.
</P>
<P>
   Friends' pools are a saving grace. Our doctor, Bill Crowe, made
us welcome at his stylish pool on Randall Mill Road, until he asked
Jack's advice about getting rid of a mammoth hornet's nest in a
tree in his back yard.
</P>
<P>
   Jack had a new chain saw and was super-confident about his
ability to use it. He insisted on cutting down the hornet-riddled
tree, which unfortunately fell smack in the swimming pool,
demolishing it.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, I remember Jack tried to discourage my dreams of
owning a swimming pool. Such a body of water, he remarked mildly,
was a lot of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy and her friends are young to be learning that lesson.
Maybe they'll stick with three-legged dogs.

PUBLISHER SURVIVES SIEGE OF PRISTINA ON GRIT AND GOOD LUCK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Veton Surroi believes he owes his life to
looters in a utility truck. The prominent publisher, a member of
the Albanian delegation to the Kosovo peace talks in France last
spring, was one of the few leaders of the Albanian community to
remain in Pristina throughout the last three months of turmoil and
survive.
</P>
<P>
   Once, on one of his rare ventures outside to swap safe houses,
Surroi saw three armed men climb out of a special police car and
come toward him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared as hell,'' he recalled in an interview Sunday in
the looted offices of his newspaper, Koha Ditore, Kosovo's main
Albanian-language daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was saved by a utility truck that came by,'' he said. The
men in the truck were looters and drew the interest of the police.
``I went quickly down a side street. It gave me time to get away.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just one of several close shaves in the 11 weeks he lay
low in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, evading Serb police squads and
paramilitary groups who were herding Albanians out of the city and
hunting down eminent intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   Surroi was almost certainly a target. After the human rights
lawyer Bajram Kelmendi was killed on March 24 on the first night of
violence in Pristina, Surroi went underground.
</P>
<P>
   He has emerged as something of a hero to local Albanians, one of
the few who stuck it out throughout the NATO bombing and the Serb
rampage, refusing to flee to neighboring Macedonia or Albania. He
looks weary, a little thinner, with dark smudges under his eyes and
a closely trimmed beard.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting smoking his trademark pipe, he said the decision to stay
was a moral one. ``I thought that as somebody who signed the Paris
accords, I had taken some responsibility and could not go out. I
thought `I am going to suffer the consequences.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Also the people here in Koha Ditore, we are kind of a family.
I was absolutely not going to leave while others were here.''
</P>
<P>
   Surroi, son of a Yugoslav diplomat, who grew up largely abroad
and speaks fluent English and Spanish, also admitted that he had
misread both Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be shorter. I had miscalculated Milosevic
and overestimated NATO. I thought they would move much faster in
their targeting. The first week they looked like the sisters of
mercy. It drove me crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Surroi routinely denies any political ambitions, he is
often mentioned by diplomats and foreign observers as a potential
political leader of Kosovo. His stint underground in Pristina is
likely to enhance his image among local Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he intends to do now, he joked: ``First, I am
thinking how to get an espresso machine into the office.'' His
newspaper offices were looted of equipment and his printing presses
across town were destroyed. On top of that, Pristina still has no
water and there is not a single cafe in town serving coffee, the
favorite drink of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need strong democratic institutions. Koha Ditore is a
strong institution and has survived,'' Surroi said, drawing on his
pipe. ``It needs to be independent and a pillar of society through
which citizens can be informed.''
</P>
<P>
   Surroi clearly intends to rebuild his newspaper, which for the
past six weeks has been published in Macedonia by some editors who
did escape. He wants, he said, to help nurture new political
figures and parties.
</P>
<P>
   He is critical of the two men who are currently the main rivals
for the political loyalty of Kosovo Albanians _ Hashim Thachi, the
young commander from the Kosovo Liberation Army, and Ibrahim
Rugova, the writer long seen as the leader of Kosovo's Albanians,
who has lost ground over the past year to the KLA and whose image
suffered during the war because of his televised meetings with
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The two should help to form a consensus government that would
work closely with the U.N. mission that is to run Kosovo for the
foreseeable future, Surroi said. Elections should not be held
before next spring or summer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite strong urging from the international community, Thaci
and Rugova have not met since the Kosovo peace talks collapsed in
March after the Albanian delegation signed an accord but the
Yugoslavs refused, Surroi said.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova, who initially stayed in Pristina and went to Belgrade,
the Yugoslav capital, on at least two occasions to see Milosevic,
eventually left in May for Italy. Thaci's whereabouts are difficult
to determine _ he is often in Albania's capital, Tirana, but also
in Kosovo with his guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Surroi, by contrast, can say with truth that he has suffered
along with the people of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling his time in hiding, he said the low point was staying
with four families crammed into one house and realizing that his
presence was endangering them. ``I was thinking, `Why should they
pay the price, why is my life worth more than that of a 13-year-old
kid?''' Surroi said.
</P>
<P>
   That pushed him to move another time. His only moments outside
were the four times he changed his hiding place. He believes he was
not caught because he avoided the telephones, which he said police
were tapping, and which soon went down anyway. He was careful even
about garbage that might give away his presence, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He started out staying with relatives, and ended up in the homes
of vague acquaintances. His 64-year-old mother was with him all the
time. ``She is a strange kind of revolutionary,'' he said,
laughing.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Tom DeLay swears it's only the force of his
personality that has everyone in Washington persuaded _ mistakenly,
of course _ that he's the guy running the House of Representatives
while Speaker Dennis Hastert sends out for sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just _ I'm aggressive, and I've been aggressive all my
life,'' says DeLay, the majority whip, not unhappily. And the
speaker, he says, is just understated. Hastert doesn't think it's
his job to talk to the press, DeLay notes, and will never suit
those who were expecting Newt Gingrich, the Sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denny has a completely different style _ thank God,'' says
DeLay, laughing, maybe a little giddy that he can say these things
now. ``Newt had to drive everything and control everything and
didn't believe in the committee system at all; Denny's just the
opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Which sounds awfully close to the point made by those who see
DeLay as the real power.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's big, brawling, guns-and-culture fight over what
combination of violent entertainment and the availability of
firearms is causing children to shoot children, it was DeLay who
dramatically took to the House floor to deliver a series of
elemental attacks on modern culture, indicting birth control, the
theory of evolution and day care. (His 27-year-old daughter and
campaign manager, he says, still talks about how awful it was
spending a summer in day care at age 5.)
</P>
<P>
   It was DeLay who got conservatives to go along with a strategy
hatched by a Democrat, Rep. John Dingell, a longtime ally of the
National Rifle Association, to water down a Senate measure
requiring background checks on customers at gun shows. After the
modest gun-control legislation promised by Hastert _ if only to rob
Democrats of a campaign issue _ was defeated on Friday, it was
DeLay who left the Capitol smiling.
</P>
<P>
   At least some of his reputation as a master manipulator seems to
stem from the fact that even when he loses, he projects a
confidence that says he knew what he was doing all along. At a news
conference following the final vote, he called the result ``pretty
sad.'' But he also put in, ``I've had a great time this week.''
</P>
<P>
   As he left the room, a reporter asked if things hadn't in fact
turned out pretty well for him. He had won on some of the culture
votes, passing, for example, a bill that gives schools federal
permission to post the Ten Commandments. And the Democrats had
killed gun control, which he didn't really want anyway, right? He
smiled and threw up his hands.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview afterward, he said that it wasn't quite so
simple. ``The Democrats think this is a great issue for them, and
I'll be living with this all summer.'' Still, he spoke of the week
as a whole as a ``great personal victory.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was Hastert who had come up with the idea of dividing
the legislation in two, one part focusing on culture and the other
on guns. And Hastert who had convinced him to vote for the
gun-control measure, only a few hours before the final vote, as the
only way of advancing the culture package.
</P>
<P>
   His own role? ``I was more driving it from a policy point of
view in advising Denny I thought it was important to make sure it
wasn't only guns'' being discussed. ``This was a culture problem
and we had to make that clear.'' In other words, he was in charge
of the bills that passed. In case anyone missed this point, he
spelled it out: ``Culture won, guns lost. I spent most of my time
trying to kill gun control.''
</P>
<P>
   (When asked about the part a fellow Texan, Dick Armey, the
majority leader, had played in the week's events, he had to think a
minute. ``He was more the manager, and made the trains run,'' he
said finally.)
</P>
<P>
   DeLay is nothing if not sure of himself and of what he believes.
For example, that gun control is scarier than guns, because ``the
government hopefully would never turn on the people, but it's human
nature for it to do that if you don't have the deterrent of
citizens bearing arms.''
</P>
<P>
   And when asked about the power of that certainty, he said it was
surely his greatest strength. ``I always wondered why Ronald Reagan
did so well. They say he was a great communicator, but all he did
was read, really. He hardly ever spoke without reading. But he
projected this certainty, and that translates into security, and
people want that in their leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   A conservative's conservative, he claims ``some weird
friendships'' with a few Democrats, like Dingell, with whom he
works out in the House gym every morning.
</P>
<P>
   He also professes to admire committed liberals and sees Rep.
Barney Frank of Massachusetts as a kindred spirit in the sense that
he ``knows from where he comes and fights for it.'' Doesn't he
provide Frank with some of his best material? DeLay laughed. ``And
vice versa. He plays in Texas just like I do in Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   Moderates, on the other hand, he doesn't understand. ``They have
a hard time with certainty.'' And Bill Clinton? How much time have
you got?
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, he was watching the president play golf in Bob
Hope's celebrity tournament, and became convinced that Clinton was
cheating. ``I play a lot of golf and I'm telling you, with his
swing he cannot play an 81 without cheating. You can tell a lot
about a person's character by the way they play golf. If they cheat
at golf, they'll cheat at anything.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   DeLay draws a straight line between Clinton's impeachment, which
might not have happened without DeLay's determination, and last
week's votes. ``Without that debate last year, I don't think some
of these culture amendments would have passed.''
</P>
<P>
   In a view that is not widely shared, he sees a lot of good
coming out of the Lewinsky scandal. ``Ever since the Monica story
broke there's been a lot of husbands telling the truth to their
wives and a lot of introspection and people re-evaluating who they
were.''
</P>
<P>
   But not Tom DeLay. Born in Laredo, Texas, in 1947, the second of
four children, he grew up mostly in Venezuela, where his father
worked in the oil business until he made enough money to move the
family back to Texas. ``It was wonderful for a kid _ jungles and
monkeys and burros and golf courses,'' he says, and with no TV,
``the only entertainment was to be a family.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about a recent New Yorker profile which said he is
estranged from much of his family, including his widowed mother and
a brother who has done jail time, he said, ``I'd rather not talk
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he did. ``My father was a wildcatter typecast straight
out of the movie `Giant,''' he said. ``He was a boisterous,
domineering alcoholic. We were not exactly an ideal family.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay sought considerably more order in his own life. He married
his high school sweetheart with whom he is today raising two foster
children, teen-agers who had been abused in previous homes. After
receiving a degree in biology from the University of Houston, he
went into the pest-control business and became, in his words, the
``best weasel killer in Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling burdened by government bureaucracy, he ran for the state
Legislature, and served in Austin from 1978 until 1984. But it was
only after he arrived in Washington, in 1985, that he became the
man he is today, he says, motivated primarily by religious faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a real jerk when I got elected,'' he says. ``Me, me, me.
My job was my religion and I was mistreating my wife and
daughter.'' A video produced by James Dobson, called ``Where's
Daddy?'' he said, ``hit me like a 2-by-4'' and changed all that.
And it was then, he says, that he began ``the process that I now
see was preparing me for last year.''

DOES THE END OF `ANOTHER WORLD' SPELL DOOM FOR DAYTIME SOAPS? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They will gather Friday afternoon at Blondie's
Restaurant on Manhattan's West Side to reminisce about Cecile and
Peter's disastrous wedding, the time Lila gave birth in a stalled
elevator at the Lumina Ball, about Frankie's murder and when Vicky,
hovering between life and death, met Ryan in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Then at 2 p.m., they will tune to ``Another World'' for the last
time and say goodbye to Carl and Rachel, Joe and Paulina and Vicky
and Jake, and after 35 years and 8,891 episodes, one of
television's most venerable soap operas will be no more.
</P>
<P>
   If it seems like the end of an era for the fiercely loyal and
still-grieving fans of ``Another World,'' which will go out with a
final wedding and sundry surprises, it increasingly feels like
something close to that for America's soap operas.
</P>
<P>
   Buffeted by the entry of women into the workplace, the changing
routines for the ones at home and competition from real-life soap
operas ranging from Jerry Springer to l'Affaire Lewinsky, soap
opera audiences are plummeting. The changes, which have been
creeping up for more than a decade, are sending the industry into a
sense of gloom and providing an illustrative commentary on some of
the changes in American life and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The signs of distress are abundant. Estimates are that the shows
have lost a quarter of their audience over the last decade. Two of
the five weeklies that follow the soaps have closed down. No
successful new soap has been introduced over the last decade, and
shows increasingly are resorting to guest appearances by the likes
of Springer or increasingly outlandish gimmick plots to keep their
audiences. The so-called prime-time soaps that flourished in the
1980s are almost all gone, and rumors are rampant about which of
the remaining shows are most imperiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mood ranges from concern to panic, depending where they
stand in the ratings,'' said Lynn Leahey, editor in chief of Soap
Opera Digest. ``The top shows are aware of the pattern, but they're
not losing sleep over it. The others are worrying about their shows
getting canceled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Another World,'' which was first broadcast on May 4, 1964, was
the top-rated soap opera during its heyday in the 1970s. It ranks
as NBC's longest-running daytime drama. During its first year, the
show, set in the fictional town of Bay City, Ill., set new
standards for its time by taking on topics like abortion and
illegitimate pregnancy. Fans, some of whom have united in a
last-ditch effort to save the show, have viewed it as a show based
on solid acting and socially attuned plots rather than mere
romantic plot gimmicks.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first soap to introduce celebrity guest stars like
Liberace, the first to expand to a one-hour format, and it was an
early nesting place for actors and actresses who later hit it big
elsewhere like Anne Heche, Morgan Freeman, Ray Liotta, Brad Pitt,
Faith Ford and Kelsey Grammer.
</P>
<P>
   But after it peaked in the 1970s, it had trouble regaining
momentum. Producers tried gimmicks, like flying the cast off at
great expense, to film at exotic locations. Producers and writers
came and went. Though the cast was constantly renewed, ``Another
World'' was less lucky than some of the other older soaps in having
some important actors in the cast die off, most notably Douglas
Watson, who played Mac Cory, the beloved publishing magnate who was
one of the show's dominant figures.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Lee, senior vice president for daytime programming at NBC,
said that ending the show was a painful decision but something had
to go to make room for a new show, ``Passions.'' The choice came
down to ``Another World'' or an even lower-rated show, ``Sunset
Beach,'' which, like ``Passions,'' is hoping to attract a younger,
more demographically desirable audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an emotional decision for everyone,'' she said. ``but
the show had not performed for the affiliates for the last decade.
It was like something that hung around and it wasn't growing,
wasn't moving and the affiliates kept saying, `Why are we still
carrying this program?' ''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Leahey of Soap Opera Digest said the show had improved
enormously over the last year since a new executive producer had
come on board, and it is a sign of desperation in the industry when
a franchise like ``Another World'' is simply dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expectations have been lowered, and justifiably so,'' said
Mary Alice Dwyer-Dobbin, head of production for Procter &AMP; Gamble
Productions, which once produced 13 soap operas and after Friday
will be down to two, ``As the World Turns,'' which has been on for
43 years, and ``Guiding Light,'' the oldest of them all which has
been on television for 47 years and began on radio 62 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The glory days are gone, because of choices in terms of
lifestyle and television viewing. We like to think there is room to
grow from where we are, but more than anything I think we need to
concentrate on maintaining the level we're at now.''
</P>
<P>
   Even for women not in the workplace, an hour of soap-opera
viewing is often not an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a working mom, but of people I know in my neighborhood,
many of the moms at home are never home,'' said Ms. Leahey.
``They're driving the kids to music lessons or soccer games. It's
very different from when I was young.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Not only does that reduce the potential audiences, but it breaks
the inter-generational chain that has renewed the audiences for
many soaps. For example, Elizabeth Walker is one of the organizers
of the luncheon Friday that is expected to draw about 50 fans of
``Another World.'' She said she began watching the show in 1975
when she was 13 with her mother, who had been watching from the
very first show.
</P>
<P>
   There are fewer mothers around to pass the baton in the same
way, she said, and she said that networks are making a mistake if
they think they can invent new soaps willy-nilly and jettison old
ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have slapped all their long-time fans in the face,'' she
said. ``I know I'm not going to watch `Passions,' and I know a lot
of people feel the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even some actors on soaps say the overheated melodramas of the
soaps are having trouble competing with the overheated melodramas
of the news _ that the travails of Vicky and Jake and Luke and
Laura have a hard time being more dramatic than the travails of
Bill and Monica or O.J. and Nicole. The steepest ratings decline in
the soap world came when the country was fixated on live coverage
of the O.J. Simpson trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society's changed,'' said Tom Eplin, one of the stars of
``Another World,'' who is one of four characters who will go over
to ``As the World Turns.'' (His character, Jake, and Vicky will
help Tom Hughes as he tries to prove Emily Stewart innocent of
murder and Lila and Cass will stop in Oakdale on the way to Hawaii
for their honeymoon and be drawn into Eddie Silva's search for
information abut his natural father.)
</P>
<P>
   ``During JFK's term, we didn't know as much about him as we do
now, or about most politicians,'' Eplin continued. ``It dulls the
sword of drama a little bit. We see so much now, that the
relationship of two people on television seems a lot less
tantalizing. What we see in real life exceeds the drama of our
shows.''

NEW YORK: our shows.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Similarly, the ascendant daytime format is the blend of talk,
drama, confession and theater seen on shows like Springer and Rikki
Lake.
</P>
<P>
   There is competition from the Internet, so that teenagers who
might have become hooked on the soaps in the past, now come home
and log onto their favorite sites on the Web. Or teenagers looking
for episodic domestic drama may be more likely to plug into MTV's
``The Real World,'' which follows the domestic lives and romantic
entanglements of actual twentysomethings.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, soaps face the problems confronted by all network
shows, in a new cable universe full of hundreds of choices.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fundamental soap opera convention is that no reversal
_ apparent death, doomed love, seeming ruin _ need be permanent,
and the news for the soaps is not all bad.
</P>
<P>
   Two cable channels have announced all-soap formats to debut next
year in the hope of rebroadcasting shows so more people can see
them. USA Network is introducing a show, ``The Avenue,'' which is
designed to be less like a conventional soap and more like a
British serial _ with more realism and less melodrama _ with the
goal of hooking viewers looking for different serial fare.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lee of NBC said that while the soap audience is down from
its peak, it is not clear how far it is down. Unlike the 1970s, she
said, Nielson ratings are an inadequate gauge for who is watching
soaps. More people now tape them and watch at night or watch in
groups that cannot be registered, like the eight teachers and 80
students she cited who watch daily after school on a big-screen
television at North Hollywood High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our problems is that we have no idea how big this
audience is,'' she said. ``That's a big problem, because I have a
business based on Nielson numbers, even if I might fantasize I have
a business three times bigger than the numbers show.''
</P>
<P>
   So, she said, even if the soaps may be reeling, they need not be
reeling toward oblivion. In the hope of making new technology work
for the format, NBC has set up a Website and a town map on the
Internet to help young people get hooked on ``Passions,'' which
makes its debut next month.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the 50 or so women who will show up at Blondie's talk
about the end of ``Another World'' as something very close to a
death in the family, Ms. Lee said women still crave the sense of
intense, personal involvement that soaps provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``If soaps have a future, and I think they do, it is in the
intimacy of the genre and the way it affects women viewers more
than anything else on television, even the talk shows,'' she said.
``We do focus groups on talk shows and soaps, and people see Jerry
Springer as entertainment, a circus. There's fantasy in the soaps,
but there's a lot of reality, too. People see real people with real
problems they can't see anyplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans take ``Another World'' so seriously that some are citing
the show's history in a last-ditch effort to save it. The Committee
to Save Another World, saying it represents 3,000 viewers, says it
is preparing a 400-page document to send to NBC's corporate
ownership and seeking a meeting with Jack Welch, chief executive of
General Electric, which owns NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we have learned from this 35 year experience with
`Another World' is that if you honestly believe in something you
must fight for it,'' Charlotte Swank, chair of the group, said in a
statement released via E-mail. ``This show has been a leader in
empowering women and men in the social turmoil of the last 35
years.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, the group concedes it is highly unlikely NBC will
continue the show.
</P>
<P>
   If most nonviewers would find it hard to see the decline of the
soaps as a major cultural loss, Ms. Leahey said in its own way it
does reflect the passing of something valuable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are deciding they'd rather spend that time working
on homework with their kids, you'll get no argument from me,'' she
said. ``But soaps have filled a need in people's lives. It was a
nice place to go, a nice, warm, cozy hour that was a little treat,
like visiting an old friend. There are a lot worse habits you can
have.''

   ``Oooh-whoo.'' ``Wah-do-day.'' ``Diddit-dit-dum-de-doo-wah.''
``Bow-bow-bow-b-b-b-bow.'' Those syllables meant a lot to Brian
Wilson when he was composing songs for the Beach Boys. They were
the sound of vocal harmonies, companionship turned into discipline
and beauty. Wilson used them to make complex chords metamorphose
behind simple love songs or confessions of unbearable loneliness.
With lapidary, compulsive craftsmanship, Wilson packed ideas into
his three-minute songs: harmonies, orchestral arrangements, song
forms that concealed improbable fantasias behind their hooks. His
songs were revived in all their elaborate restlessness when Wilson
appeared at the Beacon Theater on Friday night as part of his first
tour without the Beach Boys.
</P>
<P>
   Audience and musicians alike knew what a rare event they were
witnessing. Wilson became one of rock's most famously troubled
recluses in the 1960s, with drug and psychological problems that
persisted for decades. He stopped performing with the Beach Boys in
1964 while continuing to write and produce their songs. Although he
briefly rejoined the group on tour in 1976, his rare public
appearances since then showed a man with debilitating stage fright.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1998 Wilson released an album, ``Imagination'' (Giant),
that regained some of his old melodic grace. And though he looked
uneasy, rarely smiled and had lyrics on a teleprompter, at the
Beacon he made it through two 40-minute sets without faltering.
After ``I Get Around,'' he blurted, ``Yay for the audience!''
</P>
<P>
   Concerts by the current Beach Boys, led by Mike Love, are oldies
shows that run through the hits as exercises in nostalgia. But even
as his backup singers were doing the Swim, Wilson's performance was
a composer's showcase, mixing hits and collectors'-item
obscurities. Before Wilson came onstage, a 20-minute film was shown
that extolled his musicianship and only glimpsed his troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Rehearsal chatter from the 1960s led to the first few notes of
``The Little Girl I Once Knew,'' a single from 1965. (It was not a
hit, but a harbinger of experiments to come: a harmonically
intricate, tempo-shifting song that also included a couple of
four-second silences.) Then the band started the song onstage, as
if transporting the audience to Wilson's true home, the studio.
</P>
<P>
   It was rock as repertory, setting out to recreate Wilson's
studio creations down to their exact drum licks; the band, led by
Joe Thomas on keyboards, took liberties only in finishing songs
that had ended as fade-outs. The song selection favored Wilson's
extraordinary late-1960s work; ``Pet Sounds,'' Wilson's 1967
masterpiece, was represented with four songs and two instrumentals.
The band delighted in the inner workings of Wilson's music: the
way, for instance, that ``Wouldn't It Be Nice'' changes key right
after its introduction. To illuminate the pristine close harmonies
and hermetic purity of ``In My Room,'' Wilson and the many singers
onstage performed it with a lone guitar as accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In My Room'' was one of the first Beach Boys songs to reveal
the isolation and uncertainty that run through Wilson's most
cherished ballads. For all the cockiness in ``I Get Around'' and
``California Girls'' or the sheer elation of ``Good Vibrations,''
Wilson's songs repeatedly told the world how desperately he needed
love and reassurance: ``God Only Knows,'' ``Don't Worry Baby,''
``Caroline, No'' and even a 1998 song, ``Your Imagination,'' in
which the only happy moments are daydreams of the past. But from
his solitude came gorgeous melodies, rising above his steady,
imperturbable keyboard chords with tranquil desolation. The music
solved its technical challenges brilliantly; the sadness remained.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's original productions were so diverse that his band
sometimes needed to fill in with synthesizers. But with four
members of the Wondermints, a group of Wilson devotees, at its
core, the band also deployed the instruments of Wilson's studio
orchestras: French horn, vibraphone, timbales. While the concert's
emcee, Steve Dahl, faked playing a theremin on ``Good Vibrations,''
Probyn Gregory was playing a reproduction of a tannerin, a version
of the theremin with more reliable pitch that was used in the
original recording.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who turned 57 Sunday, is no longer the singer he was in
the 1960s. His high notes are gone. At the Beacon, his lower ones
scratched and sometimes went flat. His uptempo exuberance and the
yearning in his ballads have shifted toward an inscrutable tenacity
that was still touching in songs like ``God Only Knows.'' Around
him, while voices and instruments rebuilt his grand, fanciful,
intricate songs, the music sustained him and transcended his
frailties, just as he had surmounted so many private tribulations
to create it.

 NANOTECHNOLOGY _ GROWING COMPUTERS AN ATOM AT A TIME  &HT;     By DAVID EINSTEIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Stan Williams knows good things come in small packages. In fact,
he's convinced that the future of the computer is just a few atoms
wide.
<P>
   Williams, a researcher at Hewlett-Packard, heads up a team that
is developing a new kind of computer memory using nanotechnology _
the art of manipulating material on a molecular scale.
</P>
<P>
   The memory, in the form of crisscrossing wires, will be just 100
nanometers across (a nanometer equals one-billionth of a meter, or
about the width of two atoms). It will hold 16 bits of data. That's
not much _ just enough to hold a couple of words. But if it works,
it could presage a quantum leap in the speed and power of all kinds
of computer chips, including microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nanotech should make it possible to build computers 1 billion
times as powerful as they are now,'' says Williams.
</P>
<P>
   That could translate into voice-activated supercomputers that
you wear on your wrist, unmanned space probes the size of a
grapefruit and home entertainment centers that make it hard to
distinguish reality from virtual reality.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' team _ as well as other research groups at places like
IBM, Cornell University and Rice University _ is probing the very
fabric of the universe. They're moving individual atoms around with
light beams called optical tweezers and laying the groundwork for a
new kind of computing based on molecular switches that take up much
less space than transistors and use far less power.
</P>
<P>
   Nanotech researchers are motivated to a large degree by the fact
that the technology used to make today's integrated circuits is
fated to hit a wall. If Moore's Law holds and chip companies
continue to double every 18 months the number of transistors they
can pack on a microchip, transistors will become so tiny in about
10 years that quantum forces _ which affect matter on the smallest
level _ will render them unstable.
</P>
<P>
   Also, manufacturing facilities will continue to become more
expensive, to the point that a full-on chip fabrication plant could
cost $50 billion by 2010. Not even Intel may have that kind of
money to spend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if engineering were available to go beyond 2010, there is
a real question of whether we could afford to build anything,''
says Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the beauty of nanotech is that instead of a fabrication
plant, chips could be made using chemicals as catalysts to coax
nanosize components to assemble themselves into circuits. In fact,
that technique, which sounds a lot like the way DNA works, is how
Williams' team intends to create its breakthrough memory component.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be real cheap,'' he says. ``It involves mixing up
chemicals in a beaker rather than building a huge fabrication
plant.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of defective parts that comes out of such a
manufacturing process is high, Williams admits. But so what?
They're so cheap to make that you can make more nanocircuits than
you need and simply route computing routines around the defective
ones.
</P>
<P>
   While people like Williams are working to create
nanoelectronics, a number of young companies have begun exploring
ways to use the technology in actual products, from personal
computers to ``smart'' fabrics that can replicate themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing nanoelectronics into computing is the whole reason
for our existence,'' said Robert Schmieder, founder and president
of NanoLogic, a small Walnut Creek company engaged in research into
mass production of devices such as molecular switches. ``We want to
bridge the gap between devices that are developed in laboratories
and the economics of producing them in the marketplace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of atomic-level computers isn't new. Nanotechnology
pioneer Richard Feynman, in a famous address 40 years ago at the
California Institute of Technology, laid out a theory for
manipulating atoms and suggested that the technology could be used
to build computers.
</P>
<P>
   Such computers _ far more powerful than conventional ones _
``could make judgments,'' said Feynman. ``They would have time to
calculate what is the best way to make the calculation they are
about to make. They could select the method of analysis which, from
their experience, is better than the one that we would give to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Feynman's vision, nanotech didn't really start to take
off until the late 1980s, when scientists at IBM invented the
Scanning Tunneling Microscope, which made it possible to capture
images of matter at the atomic level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that we'd taken a huge step forward in the ability to
control the structure of matter,'' said Donald Eigler, a physicist
at IBM's Almaden Research Laboratory in San Jose who helped perfect
the scanning microscope. ``And every time in history that we've
learned new ways to build things, something really unusual _ and
quite often something great _ has come out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Eigler doesn't share Williams' unbounded vision of nanotech's
possibilities. ``I'm the last person to discourage someone from
dreaming what could be,'' he said, ``but if somebody tells you
about nanotech and really small widgets being computers, that's
fantasyland.''
</P>
<P>
   Eigler is confident, however, that ``the research being done now
will create knowledge that can be used in the future of the
computer industry. It will allow us to extend today's technologies
and create new ones.''

 GIVING A BIG PUSH TO `PUSH' TECHNOLOGY  &HT;     By JON SWARTZ 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Short takes on an alien sighting (sort of) and Net natterings
during a lazy summer week:
<P>
   PLEASE POLESE ME: Internet diva Kim Polese stopped by with a
progress report on Marimba Inc., the software company she
co-founded which went public last month despite sniping from the
press (guilty as charged).
</P>
<P>
   Given up for dead as another purveyor of ``push'' technology,
the Mountain View company now is worth $901.3 million, based on its
stock price of $39.63 per share. Sales tripled to $17.1 million
last year, from $5.6 million in 1997. Its Internet-management
software is used by more than 200 corporate customers, such as
Chrysler and Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. And it boasts the considerable
financial backing and guidance of John Doerr, the influential
venture capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remained focused, never got complacent and stuck with our
management team,'' Polese said. ``Plus, we didn't let the push
stigma hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   Push technology automatically delivered customized news and
information to consumers' desktop computers. But it didn't deliver
on its promise _ to the chagrin of investors and several doomed
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of force-feeding news and content to subscribers, as
high-tech flop PointCast did, Marimba opted to create a program to
manage Net services and deliver software updates within
corporations. Schwab, for instance, used Marimba's product to
develop a premium portal for heavy traders to ease transactions.
Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co., meanwhile, uses Marimba software to keep its
Web-based customer service operations running.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Net should be as easy as using a utility,'' Polese said.
``It should be as simple as turning on a faucet or flipping a
switch.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a true CEO of a successful company.
</P>
<P>
   FIRMAGE SIGHTING: Joe Firmage's otherworldly views about
extraterrestrial intelligence earned him sensational headlines but
a pink slip from USWeb/CKS in January. Last week, he promoted a
more down-to-Earth venture _ with the financial backing of USWeb/
CKS.
</P>
<P>
   In a glitzy event at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art,
Firmage introduced Intend Change, a consulting company for Internet
startups in need of expert advice on writing business plans and
schmoozing with venture capitalists. USWeb/ CKS, which Firmage
co-founded, is a major investor. The company also is expected to
announce a partnership with an executive recruiter this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our challenge is: How do you take a great idea and turbocharge
it into a sector leader?'' said USWeb/ CKS co-founder Toby Corey.
``We've coined a new category called venture construction.''
</P>
<P>
   Firmage and Corey are co-founders of Intend Change. The Santa
Clara company will handpick and tutor select Net hopefuls in
exchange for 10 percent of each company's equity. It already has
chosen InveSmart, a retirement-planning Web site in Pittsburgh;
e-commerce firm Electron Economy in Cupertino; and Infrastructure
Defense, a Washington, D.C., security consultant for cyberattacks.
</P>
<P>
   Some 700 dot com startups are created every quarter among the
10,000 business plans that are sent to venture capitalists
annually, according to industry experts.
</P>
<P>
   The otherwise pedestrian news drew a throng of journalists _ no
doubt intrigued by Firmage. The last time he made news was for
promoting his 600-page online treatise, ``The Truth''
(www.thewordistruth. org), which linked many of history's major
religious and technological events to ``visits'' from
extraterrestrials. He even recounted a close encounter of the third
kind in his Los Gatos home in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The quixotic Firmage still stands by his beliefs but has
softened the more off-the-wall comments.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ``Dateline,'' A&AMP;E Television Networks and Fox Family
Channel all plan special reports on Firmage this year.
</P>
<P>
   WEBLESS CEOs: The Net may be indispensable to the lives of geeks
and blue-collar types everywhere, but it drew a collective yawn
from 656 CEOs worldwide surveyed by market researcher The
Conference Board and Heidrick &AMP; Struggles, an executive headhunting
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Only 6 percent of grand poobahs at industrial manufacturers
consider the Web critical to their business; a paltry 15 percent of
all chief executives polled placed a high emphasis on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Just more than half of the high-tech CEOs questioned ranked the
Internet as a primary concern, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most CEOs are preoccupied with industry consolidation,
cost-cutting and retaining customers,'' said Melissa Berman, senior
vice president of research at The Conference Board in New York.
``If and when they can see the Internet as a clear path to answer
those problems, the survey numbers will gradually increase.''
</P>
<P>
   The report quotes CEOs from The Mutual Group, Merck &AMP; Co. and
Tellabs Operations Inc.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sth  &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; SCAM ALERT: AT&AMP;T WorldNet customers received disturbing e-mail
this month: A billing snafu apparently required them to resubmit
credit-card information within 48 hours or they risked losing
Internet access. Those who responded promptly with e-mail were
promised a rebate.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out the message was a ruse designed to wangle financial
data out of AT&AMP;T WorldNet's 1.6 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I thought `Oh, no,' '' said Cassandra
Mettling-Davis, an AT&AMP;T customer in San Francisco. ``Then, I became
suspicious. I called AT&AMP;T and the credit-card company, and they
said there was no problem. You can never be too cautious on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The fake e-mail, titled ``Worldnet (sic) Billing Errors,'' is
the latest attempt by online hucksters to sucker personal
information out of cybersurfers. E-mail scams are among the most
common fraudulent acts online, according to the Federal Trade
Commission (www.ftc.gov).
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T WorldNet's fraud unit, which warned users of the faux
e-mail last week, is investigating the matter.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING RELIGION ONLINE: Take heart, exasperated eBay users.
Your prayers for reliable service may be answered.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican _ swear to God _ is considering the creation of a
patron saint of the Internet so that millions of cybersurfers can
pray for quicker service.
</P>
<P>
   St. Isidore, author of a 20-volume encyclopedia that is
considered the world's first database, is front-runner for the
mantle of digital divine intervention. Not bad for someone who died
1,400 years ago in Seville, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are patron saints of many things, so why not let the
Internet have one?'' Vatican spokesman Tom Hallwood said. ``It's a
good idea and might be able to help us all when we are about to
crash.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallwood, of course, is referring to the Catholic Church's
computer system _ not human foibles.
</P>
<P>
   The church's three computer servers _ which powered live
Webcasts of pope speeches and Vatican Radio _ are appropriately
named Raphael, Gabriel and Michael.
</P>
<P>
   SOMA DISPATCHES: A secretive Net startup nestled South of Market
is creating a buzz in high-tech circles.
</P>
<P>
   Desktop.com _ whose co-founder Larry Dreves started free e-mail

consumers create a personal computer-like desktop anywhere on the
Web. The mysterious project is scheduled to debut this summer.

 DRUG FIRMS TRYING TO MAKE MEDICINE GO DOWN EASIER  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Drugmakers know that most patients shrink at the sight of needles
and shirk responsibility for taking pills on time.
<P>
   These two foibles have helped spawn the alternate drug delivery
industry. Top scientists in this field gathered last week in
Berkeley to talk about using inhalers instead of injections to
deliver insulin, and creating coated pills or skin patches for
timed release of drugs _ so we don't have to remember when it's
time for our medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron scientist Bret Shirley gave me a quick tutorial on the
differences between traditional drugs and biotech remedies _ and
why biotech firms have taken the lead in inventing new delivery
mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional drugs work just fine as pills (so long as we
remember to take them). That's because the active ingredient in
most drugs is a chemical compound so small that when the pill
dissolves in the stomach, the active ingredient slips through the
digestive machinery and enters the bloodstream _ which delivers the
drug to the site of the ailment.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech remedies are protein molecules hundreds of times larger
than the active ingredients in traditional drugs. ``They're
proteins just like we'd eat in a steak,'' Shirley said. So if
manufacturers tried to shove biotech pills down our throat, our
bodies would digest the remedy before it could travel to wherever
it was needed.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the only way to get remedial proteins past the stomach
and into the blood has been to deliver them through injection,
Shirley said. Because no one likes to get shots, this has limited
the use of biotech potions.
</P>
<P>
   Several Bay Area firms are trying to break the needle barrier by
using inhalers to deliver protein remedies through the lungs. These
companies include Inhale Therapeutic Systems in San Carlos, Aradigm
Corp. in Hayward and AeroGen Inc. in Sunnyvale.
</P>
<P>
   Insulin is their first target. It is a protein, which means
people can't take it as pills. Moreover, many of the 8 million
Americans who suffer from diabetes need to take several insulin
shots daily _ creating a huge market for an easier alternative to
the needle.
</P>
<P>
   Aradigm founder Reid Rubsamen explained his company's early
stage trials of an inhaler that dispenses an insulin vapor. The
vapor contains insulin particles, far smaller than specks of dust,
bound with water molecules. If sprayed into the air, this vapor
would resemble fog, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to pump this insulin-rich vapor into the labyrinth
of tissues inside the lungs. So vast are our lung linings, he said,
that if we could remove their tissue from our bodies and flatten it
out, it would cover a tennis court.
</P>
<P>
   Having this huge target is essential because the success of
inhaled delivery rests on ensuring that microscopic droplets of
insulin land on the tissue and are absorbed by the blood vessels on
the other side. Aradigm and its competitors are testing their
systems in hopes of convincing the Food and Drug Administration
that the lungs deliver as much insulin to the bloodstream as the
tried-and-true shot.
</P>
<P>
   Vapor delivery is one way of getting protein remedies past the
digestive trap. Shirley, the Chiron scientist, said other firms are
experimenting with wrapping biotech proteins in what we might call
smart, armored pills.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to coat the protein, which we would otherwise
digest, inside a layer of fat that would protect it from stomach
enzymes _ at least long enough to allow the armored pill to make it
to the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   But why create protein pills when I started by saying people
often forget to take their medicines?
</P>
<P>
   That's where the smart part comes in, Shirley said. By varying
the thickness or chemical makeup of the wrapper, scientists hope to
fashion delivery systems that release remedies over time _ so we
can take a pill once a day instead of three times a day, or once a
week instead of daily.
</P>
<P>
   Time-release pills and capsules already are available for some
traditional drugs. The hope is to make the same one-a-day formulas
available for larger biotech proteins.
</P>
<P>
   Many people are familiar with other time-release technologies,
like the NicoDerm skin patch, which delivers tiny jolts of nicotine
to help people quit smoking. Many efforts are under way to expand
skin patches to deliver a wider range of remedies. But so far,
Shirley said, the patches are able to deliver only small chemical
packages, not big protein payloads.
</P>
<P>
   Patches aren't the only way companies are experimenting with
getting timed-release drugs under our skin. Lisa Nolan, with West
Pharmaceutical Services in Pennsylvania, said her firm is
developing a silicone sac that would be inserted under the eyelid.
</P>
<P>
   Sac sounds so ungainly for something an inch long and no wider
than a strand of angel hair pasta. Nolan said the sac is being
tested as a time-release alternative to the eye drops people must
take after getting cataract operations. Right now, people have to
cock their heads back and stare up into the eyedropper _ providing
they remember to take their medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech firms expect two benefits when, and if, some of these
alternative-delivery mechanisms win FDA approval.
</P>
<P>
   First, bypassing the needle would expand the realm of
biotech-treatable diseases. Today, we'll take a biotech shot only
for serious ailments. The companies would like to sell us remedies
for lesser ills.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if the various time-release strategies pan out, firms
expect to greatly increase the effectiveness of pharmaceutical
remedies, which many patients unwittingly sabotage by failing to
follow their drug regime.
</P>
<P>
   That should be good for patients, but it will be even better for
the profits of drugmakers. I could almost see the dollar signs
dance in Shirley's eyes when he explained, ``HMOs will pay more for
time-release (products) because it will insure compliance with the
treatment.''

Kosovo on Sunday a few hours ahead of NATO's deadline for
withdrawal, leaving in their wake new scenes of jubilation among

 TECH FIRMS GEAR UP FOR PC EXPO IN THE BIG APPLE  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
From wireless shopping to coin-size hard drives, the latest in
computing gear will be on display this week in the Big Apple, where
PC Expo, the East Coast's biggest computer trade show, opens its
annual run Tuesday.
<P>
   More than 100,000 showgoers _ mainly corporate computer users _
will get a chance to kick the tires on new products at some 500
vendor booths filling New York City's cavernous Javits Convention
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the exhibits are the usual computer-show fare, from the
fastest-ever Pentium chips to the latest in surge suppressors. But
the show also reflects trends that are reshaping the high-tech
world, including an increasing emphasis on mobility and wireless
communications and the growing importance of the consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   3Com will lead a parade of manufacturers touting new wireless
products. In addition to highlighting OpenSky, the on-the-go
Internet access service it announced last week, the Santa Clara
company will unveil AirConnect, a new product family that will let
businesses link their PCs into a local-area network without running
wires.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless LANs aren't new, and AirConnect won't ship until
September. But 3Com says its technology will deliver data much
faster than competing products and at little or no increase in
price. It can transfer 11 megabits per second, which makes it a
shade faster than the Ethernet wired networks currently installed
in most offices _ and more than five times faster than a new
wireless scheme Compaq Computer plans to demonstrate at this week's
show.
</P>
<P>
   3Com also will be giving heavy play to the Palm VII, its
electronic organizer and wireless Internet device, which currently
is sold only in the New York area. Meanwhile, smaller companies
will be pushing add-on products that bring similar communications
capabilities to other Palm models and competitors, in some case by
connecting to pagers. Motorola also will introduce an improved
version of the PageWriter, its two-way pager with a built-in
keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   GoAmerica Communications will show off a wireless
comparison-shopping service for handheld devices. Subscribers will
type in (or scan) the UPC bar code number of the product in which
they're interested, and the service will respond with details about
the item and prices from a variety of online outlets.
</P>
<P>
   If you find a deal you like, you'll be able to order it with a
few taps on the screen of your Palm or similar device. The service
is in beta testing, with final release set for late this year. By
then, GoAmerica said, it will have information on approximately 100
million products.
</P>
<P>
   With laptop computers accounting for a growing share of overall
PC sales and an even larger proportion of industry profits,
numerous vendors will highlight new notebook models, many of them
including the 400-MHz chips Intel announced just last week.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the new models are 7- or 8-pound behemoths, more
than ever will be aimed at travelers ready to sacrifice some
features to ease the burden on arms and shoulders. IBM, for
instance, will roll out a new ThinkPad model that weighs only 2.9
pounds, yet includes a keyboard only 5 percent smaller than
standard.
</P>
<P>
   In the desktop arena, one theme will be a new stress on styling,
as PC-makers seek to duplicate the success of Apple's curvaceous
iMac. Gateway will show off its new Profile line, in which the
computer components are built right into the back of a flat-panel
display that's only three inches thick.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft once again will demo a prerelease version of Windows
2000, the long-delayed successor to Windows NT, which now is slated
to ship late this year. The Redmond, Wash., giant also will be
touting the virtues of its recently released Office 2000 suite,
while Corel tries to get showgoers to check out its competing
suite, WordPerfect Office 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Adobe will overhaul its line of graphics
applications. Along with a new, Web-oriented update to Photoshop,
its $609 program for professional graphics, the San Jose company
will show off a stripped-down $99 version called Photoshop LE,
which it will begin selling retail for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   For the growing ranks of novice users of scanners and digital
cameras, Adobe will introduce a brand-new program called
ActiveShare and a companion Web site, ActiveShare.com, where users
will be able to create online albums and host chats for invited
guests.
</P>
<P>
   Intel and Kodak also will be touting Picture CD, a jointly
developed plan that lets users of film cameras get digital versions
of their snapshots, plus simple and fun software for editing and
distributing them, along with their prints.
</P>
<P>
   Set to ship August 1, ActiveShare will cost less than $20. Adobe
said the software will be distributed free through a variety of
promotional programs and bundling deals.
</P>
<P>
   Hardware vendors also are targeting consumers whose hard drives
are overflowing with images and music. IBM will show the
MicroDrive, a newly released hard drive for cameras and handheld
devices that's the size of a silver dollar but holds 340 megabytes
of data. And a slew of vendors will introduce improved rewritable
CD drives, which have gained popularity for backing up data and
recording digital video and audio.
</P>
<P>
   Iomega, maker of the popular Zip and Jaz drives, will jump into
the CD arena for the first time with Zip CD, a rewritable model
scheduled to ship in August with a street price of $299.95.

INVENTORS MAKE A MOVE IN BOARD GAMES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN:   Mass., Md., Utah, Colo.)   By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a world of cyber-this and video-that, can traditional board
games still gain attention?
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, dozens of patents have been issued to hopeful
inventors who dream that their new version of the old-fashioned
board game will one day become the next Monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   But in this age of Gameboy, is anyone still playing board games?
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has changed dramatically over the past 10 to 15
years,'' said Philip Orbanes, president of Winning Moves, a game
company based in Danvers, Mass. ``New games of that ilk have been
continual failures.''
</P>
<P>
   Orbanes ought to know. He left Hasbro Games Group several years
ago to form Winning Moves, a company that was supposed to
specialize in selling traditional board games.
</P>
<P>
   ``But consumers nowadays just don't have the patience,'' he
said. ``It was too formidable an environment.'' Orbanes' company is
branching out into other products.
</P>
<P>
   Milton Bradley and Parker Brothers, both divisions of Hasbro,
still produce best-selling board games, according to Orbanes, who
is the author of ``The Monopoly Companion'' (Adams Media). But they
stick to such classics as Monopoly or Pictionary _ games that
people already know how to play. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Orbanes offers a grim forecast for board game inventors. But the
example of Richard C. Levy, a successful toy and games inventor in
Bethesda, Md., suggests a silver lining.
</P>
<P>
   Levy recently received a patent, No. D406,614, to protect the
design of the board for his game based on the best-selling book
``Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus'' (HarperCollins). Levy
created the game for Cardinal Industries. It is based on the
best-selling book by John Gray, and the game _ which has the same
title as the book _ has begun to show up on toy store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Levy says, it's all about ``branding'' _ linking up
your game with a well-known book or product. He has created board
games based on ``Chicken Soup for the Soul'' (Health
Communications) as well as Uncle Milton's Ant Farm.
</P>
<P>
   Both games are now being introduced into stores.
</P>
<P>
   What other advice does Levy have? First, don't spend a lot of
money to patent something until you know you have a truly novel and
marketable product. Even then, unless the game has a singular
electronic or mechanical aspect, often trademark and copyright are
more important _ and cheaper to obtain.
</P>
<P>
   Second, try to license it. ``Self-publishing is absolute
suicide,'' Levy said. ``More than 99 percent of the people I know
who make the games themselves still have them in their basement.''
</P>
<P>
   Most big companies do not take submissions directly from
independent inventors. The Manhattan-based Toy Manufacturers of
America (www.toy-tma.org) has a list of toy and games agents who,
much like literary agents, take a cut of any future royalties as
their fee. (Toy agents are not to be confused with invention
submission companies, which are reviled by Levy as being ``carrion
birds circling the skies for unsuspecting inventors.'')
</P>
<P>
   Ronald O. Weingartner, a former executive at Hasbro Games Group
and the co-author with Levy of ``From Workshop to Toy Store''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster), adds that board games need to give children a
``wow'' experience. ``That usually means some kind of electronic
enhancement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even Levy's games, while successful, are unlikely to have an
enduring shelf life. According to Jonathan Becker, a toy agent in
New York, Hasbro introduced 24 games in 1996. Only two of those
were still around in 1997. None of them were on the market in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A WINNER IN SELF-PUBLISHING
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to Levy's advice, the self-publishing route has worked
for M. Ardell Olsen, an insurance salesman in Ogden, Utah, who
recently received patent No. 5,820,125 for a Bible game that he
originally assembled in his basement with the help of his wife and
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went into a store looking for something to help our family
remember and understand the teachings of the Bible and we couldn't
find anything,'' Dana M. Olsen, the inventor's wife, recalled.
</P>
<P>
   So Olsen decided to invent a game that has the object of
entering the Kingdom of Heaven by demonstrating biblical knowledge.
He and his family read scriptures together to come up with
questions. ``Then we maxed out a couple of credit cards until we
could get a bank loan,'' Mrs. Olsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Now more than 250,000 copies of Biblequest _ which comes in Old
Testament and New Testament editions _ have been sold through
religious stores and Wal-Mart Stores outlets nationwide. Olsen
recently licensed the games to Specialties, a publisher of
religious products that is also based in Ogden.
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE FICTION BOARD GAME
</P>
<P>
   Richard Recard, a retired management consultant in Louisville,
Colo., also plans to produce his recently patented science fiction
board game himself and begin selling it over the Internet this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Recard's game features hexagonal playing boards that represent
different solar systems and that can be tessellated, or attached,
together so that they represent a galaxy. Players, who draw
Catastrophe and Entropy cards, must navigate their spaceships
through hazardous conditions. They receive points both for
demonstrating their knowledge of astrophysics and for assisting
other spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Recard, who also plans to develop a digital version of his game,
received patent No. 5,906,372 last month.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231. &QL;

 EMI, LIQUID AUDIO PUTTING MUSICAL GIANTS ONLINE  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Garth Brooks, the Spice Girls and
hundreds of other major artists are joining the online music
revolution.
<P>
   Music giant EMI Recorded Music, which has a stable of about
1,500 artists on record labels like Capitol, Blue Note and Virgin,
is preparing to offer its vast catalog for direct download from the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Liquid Audio Inc. of Redwood City will convert EMI's music into
Liquid Audio's proprietary digital audio format, which allows songs
to be downloaded from the Internet and played on a computer while
preventing illegal copying.
</P>
<P>
   The next version of Liquid Audio's software, due out soon, also
will allow playback on handheld players made by electronics-makers
such as Diamond Multimedia's Rio, which now only plays songs
encoded in the popular MP3 format.
</P>
<P>
   The EMI deal, to be announced Monday, is a major coup for Liquid
Audio. EMI is the world's third-largest music company, after
Universal Music Group and Sony Music.
</P>
<P>
   EMI has not determined when or how the digitized music will be
sold, though EMI officials said it could be ready to go by the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Liquid Audio could thrust EMI ahead of its
competitors, which all are quickly lining up partners in the race
to bring Internet music into the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took the record industry some time to recognize the future
is here and the audience has spoken,'' said Jay Samit, EMI senior
vice president for new media.
</P>
<P>
   Liquid Audio officials declined to comment on the deal. The
company has registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission
to go public and is in the middle of a ``quiet period'' required by
the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   In SEC filings, Liquid Audio said it plans to offer 3.6 million
shares, representing 21 percent of the company, priced at $10 to
$12 per share. Web retailer Amazon.com has the option to take up to
a 10 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with EMI gives the music company a 1 percent stake in
Liquid Audio.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Mark Hardie of Forrester Research Inc. said the EMI deal
means Liquid Audio and CEO Gerry Kearby finally may have turned the
corner.
</P>
<P>
   For its first two years of existence, Liquid Audio tried
unsuccessfully to market its technology. It has signed about 1,300
musicians and 300 record labels, but they are mainly little-known
artists from independent labels.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past year, the grassroots popularity of the MP3 audio
compression format demonstrated the potential of Liquid Audio's
original premise that there is a market for selling music fans
digitized songs directly from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody was paying attention to him two years ago,'' Hardie
said of Kearby. Now after a string of minor hits, the EMI deal
gives Liquid ``a nice solid home run,'' Hardie said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the songs available in the MP3 format _ the second-most
sought-after topic on the Internet behind sex _ are legally
available songs from independent artists.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when MP3 first leaped into the mainstream, the
world's five biggest record companies, including EMI, complained of
lost revenues because their music was being pirated and distributed
in the MP3 format.
</P>
<P>
   But now all five have banded together with other music and
technology companies to develop piracy-proof standards for digital
music distribution and specifications for portable players such as
Diamond Multimedia's Rio.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the big five record companies have cut separate deals
with technology companies like Microsoft or IBM and have announced
plans to sell digital tracks within the year.
</P>
<P>
   The exception was EMI, which ``was pretty late,'' Hardie said.
</P>
<P>
   But EMI will be the first to start converting its library, which
includes artists like Janet Jackson and the Smashing Pumpkins, into
a existing digital download format. Liquid Audio also plans to
enable its software to play MP3-encoded songs in about one month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It positions Liquid now as, I would argue, the leader in
commercial delivery'' of digital music, Hardie said. ``MP3 is still
the de facto standard, but it's not commercial.''

 EXCITEATHOME TO OFFER FREE VOICE MAIL, FAX  &HT;     By JON SWARTZ 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
ExciteAtHome will lend a forceful voice to online communications
Monday, with a free voice mail and fax service on its Web site as
well as a new application that brings audio to chat rooms.
<P>
   The Redwood City Internet company is teaming up with General
Magic on Voicemail, which lets consumers receive voice-mail
messages and faxes from a special free phone number and e-mail
account. They then can listen to messages and view faxes from any
personal computer linked to the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``We not only view the Web as a forum for content, but for
people to communicate,'' said Craig Donato, senior vice president
of network programming at ExciteAtHome.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an aggressive effort for what we call the `access
anywhere' crowd _ especially traveling businesspeople who don't
want to constantly check their pager, fax machine and e-mail
account to stay in touch with the office,'' Donato said.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: Consumers register for an 800 phone number
with an extension listed on Excite's site. The number doesn't ring
at a real phone, but allows callers to leave a voice message or
fax.
</P>
<P>
   Those messages are then converted into computer files and
relayed to the e-mail accounts of Excite members, of which there
are at least 1 million. The members can either play audio files of
voice mail or view faxes.
</P>
<P>
   The service is based on General Magic's Portico technology, a
personal digital assistant that converts and delivers messages to
users via the Internet or phone. So-called unified messaging has
tantalized consumers but lagged in use because it can be slow and
clunky, industry observers said.
</P>
<P>
   ExciteAtHome isn't the first company to offer free voice mail
and faxes online, but it is the largest. A slew of startups _
TeleBot Corp. in San Francisco, onebox.com of San Mateo and
uReach.com Inc. in Holmdel, N.J., _ all offer similar services.
</P>
<P>
   None, however, has the reach of ExciteAtHome. The Web's
second-largest portal site reaches 20 million people per month.
</P>
<P>
   A second service on Excite's Web site, Voice Chat, provides
audio for chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Co-developed with Lipstream Networks Inc. of Cupertino, the free
service lets anyone with an Internet connection, speaker and
microphone talk in real time over the Net with other chat room
participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everyone is a great typist, which can be a barrier to
participating in a chat room,'' Lipstream Networks CEO Bret Savage
said. ``It is the next logical step for communications.''
</P>
<P>
   Savage said the technology will eventually be extended to
instant-messaging systems and online customer-support operations
for companies.

 PULSE ENTERTAINMENT HITS BIG WITH 3-D JAY LENO  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
J ay Leno pops a foil-wrapped burrito into a microwave and surfs
the Internet on his computer.
<P>
   Zap. The cosmic-electrical forces summoned by nuking aluminum
foil traps the square-jawed comedian in a Web world of man-eating
pizzas, shameless Intel promos, scantily clad Victoria's Secret
models and an endless supply of Bill Clinton jokes.
</P>
<P>
   And now, ladies and gentlemen ... Virtual Jaaaaaaaay Leno!
</P>
<P>
   That was how Virtual Jay, a 3-D computer-animated version of
Leno created by Pulse Entertainment of San Francisco, made his
debut last week on Leno's ``Tonight Show.''
</P>
<P>
   He also became a regular evolving character on the ``Tonight
Show's'' Web site at www.nbc.com.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual Jay is a major break for Pulse Entertainment, which is
trying to sell its 3-D animation technology to Web designers as a
way of juicing up Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great validation of what we do,'' said Pulse chief
executive Fred Angelopoulos.
</P>
<P>
   Pulse's proprietary software, called the Pulse Creator, can
create moving, talking 3-D interactive characters for Internet
sites. Computer users can move the animated characters on the
screen with a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Virtual Leno character demonstrated how a virtual sales
representative could lead a consumer around an electronic commerce
site.
</P>
<P>
   The company also envisions the technology being used to make
pictures of products on Web sites more realistic, so they can be
inspected by consumers just as if they were on display on a store
shelf. A portable stereo, for example, can be depicted as a 3-D
object that plays music.
</P>
<P>
   The Pulse Player software is a free plug-in for Web browsers.
Angelopoulos said the software works even on lower-speed 28.8 Kbps
modems, and the animations can be embedded in banner ads.
</P>
<P>
   Pulse was founded in 1994 by former Macromedia Chairman Bill
Woodward as a producer of CD-ROM games like Iron Helix and Bad
Mojo.
</P>
<P>
   But the closely held company located on Brannan Street shifted
its focus last year from games to ``bringing life to the
Internet,'' President Mark Yahiro said.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the 25-employee company drew up a Virtual Bill
Clinton _ complete with a salacious ``MonicaCam'' view _ for MTV's
Web site. And it created an interactive disc jockey called DJ Dev
for an Internet company called RadioV.
</P>
<P>
   Those demonstrations brought Pulse some notoriety, but Yahiro
said the company needed greater exposure. So Pulse hatched the idea
of creating an animated Jay Leno and pitched the concept to the
``Tonight Show's'' producers in April.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of PULSE21 (104332 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``The next thing you know, we're sitting in Jay's office pitching
ideas,'' Angelopoulos said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pitching Jay-jokes at the writers,'' Yahiro said.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, a little Hollywood-style karma also kicked in.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Crane, vice president and general manager of the network's
Internet arm, NBC.com, was at the same time looking for a 3-D
technology company to increase traffic on a Web site that promotes
another NBC show.
</P>
<P>
   Crane said she had a friend whose sister had just started doing
some consulting work for Pulse. The sister had a friend who worked
for the ``Tonight Show,'' and through that connection, Crane
learned that Angelopoulos and Yahiro were meeting with Leno's
producers.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, Crane met one of Pulse's investors at a cocktail
party and even heard more talk about Pulse while sitting in the
famous NBC commissary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things where I couldn't go anywhere without
hearing Pulse, Pulse,'' said Crane, who joined the meeting with
Pulse and ``Tonight Show'' execs.
</P>
<P>
   Angelopoulos and Yahiro had found their stage but still had to
convince the network that they could deliver. Crane said she had
not been impressed with other 3-D technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they first saw the technology, they didn't think it could
be done,'' Yahiro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jay was really interested, but he wanted to make sure it was
funny,'' Angelopoulos said. ``When the audience went nuts, he just
loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Using computer modeling, Pulse refined Virtual Jay in about six
weeks. ``Tonight Show'' writers came up with his lines, and Leno
himself supplied the voice.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual Jay debuted on Tuesday in a skit that had him trapped
inside his computer, bouncing to different Web sites, including one
for Intel, one of Pulse's major investors. The skit ended with the
real Leno being ``downloaded'' onto Bill Clinton's lap.
</P>
<P>
   The audience laughed and Leno directed them to the NBC Web site
for more Virtual Jay adventures, which will be created once a week.
The character will also appear from time to time on the show.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic on the ``Tonight Show'' site increased dramatically, but
Crane hedged on whether Virtual Jay will get his own virtual show.
She did say the network already plans to use a virtual character
for another show's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at a whole slate of cutting-edge programs,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Fenik, vice president of analysis for Zona Research Inc.
of Redwood City, said Pulse's technology has potential beyond
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   For example, aircraft mechanics learning how to service an
engine could first experiment with a graphic simulation in a
computer, Fenik said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has enormous potential in training and enormous potential
in documentation of physical things,'' Fenik said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Angelopoulos and Yahiro are concentrating on producing
new weekly installments of Virtual Jay. The company also has
developed a virtual trivia game show for NBC's ``Saturday Night
Live'' show and has another undisclosed project in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Pulse Entertainment is moving to new quarters on Mission Street
in San Francisco that Angelopoulos and Yahiro also hope will
provide more lucky karma: the building used to house an art gallery
for legendary cartoonist and Bugs Bunny animator Chuck Jones.

 LET THE NET HELP EVALUATE MUTUAL FUNDS  &HT;     By HARRY DOMASH 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
_ First of two parts on mutual fund investing online.
<P>
   For many investors, mutual funds offer advantages compared with
buying individual stocks.
</P>
<P>
   If you're busy, you don't have time to analyze and follow five
or 10 companies. When you own a mutual fund, you have a team of
professionals working for you.
</P>
<P>
   Diversification is an important element of investing. Mutual
funds give you automatic diversification because most funds own
dozens of different companies.
</P>
<P>
   But picking the right fund can be daunting. Look up fund
performance data and you'll find mountains of statistics: one-year
returns, five-year returns, beta, alpha, standard deviation,
turnover, Sharpe ratio, etc. How do you know what's important?
</P>
<P>
   I've come up with a few simple rules for evaluating funds, and
here's the good news: All the information you need is available on
the Internet, and it's free.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite source for mutual fund information is Morningstar, a
Chicago company that is well known and respected in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   If a mutual fund earns a high grade from Morningstar, the fund
company features the rating prominently in its advertising. Even
more important, Morningstar gives away all the information you need
to analyze a fund.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find some Morningstar data on other sites such as Quicken
(www.quicken.com) or America Online, but the Quicktake report on
the Morningstar site is more complete and updated faster.
</P>
<P>
   LET'S GET STARTED
</P>
<P>
   Pick out a mutual fund you own, or are considering buying, and
I'll show you how I would analyze it.
</P>
<P>
   Log on to Morningstar (www.morningstar.net).
</P>
<P>
   Look up the fund's ticker symbol:
</P>
<P>
   _ Click on the Ticker Lookup selector directly above the data
entry box.
</P>
<P>
   _ Type the first few letters of the fund's name into the box.
</P>
<P>
   _ Push the enter key on your keyboard. (There's no ``go'' button
to click.)
</P>
<P>
   Return to the main page, and type the ticker symbol into the
data entry box. That brings up the Snapshot page of the Quicktake
report.
</P>
<P>
   START WITH STARS
</P>
<P>
   Notice the stars (upper left). That's Morningstar's overall
rating of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   The range is one to five stars, with five being the best.
Morningstar does not give a star rating to funds younger than 3
years old.
</P>
<P>
   I look for funds with four or five stars. A high rating doesn't
guarantee that the fund will perform well in the future, but I've
found I always end up rejecting lower-rated funds when I examine
their performance in detail. I figure there's no point wasting time
analyzing funds I'm not going to buy, so I eliminate them right off
the bat.
</P>
<P>
   LOAD VS. NO-LOAD FUNDS
</P>
<P>
   Load is a sales charge usually paid to the stockbroker or
financial adviser who recommended the fund. If you invest $1,000 in
a fund with a 5 percent load, only $950 actually goes into the
fund. If you buy a no-load fund, the entire $1,000 amount goes to
work for you.
</P>
<P>
   Should you buy a load or no-load fund? It depends. If your
broker or adviser turned you on to a great fund, he or she deserves
to be paid. If you do all your own research, you may want to stick
with no-load funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Quicktake report consists of several sections listed near
the top of the page: Snapshot, Risk &AMP; Return, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Select Risk &AMP; Return, then click on Morningstar Rating from the
list on the left.
</P>
<P>
   You'll see the fund's Morningstar Return and Risk scores for
three-, five- and 10-year periods.
</P>
<P>
   RETURN RATING
</P>
<P>
   Return expresses the total appreciation of your investment
including dividends and distributions. Morningstar's return rating
compares a fund's return to all other funds in the same category.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if you're looking at a U.S. stock fund, the fund's
return would be compared to all domestic equity funds. A return
rating of 1.0 means the fund's return is equal to the average of
all funds in the category. A rating of 2.0 means the fund's return
was twice the return of the average fund.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar's return rating takes the fund's load (if any) into
account. I've found the rating for the five-year period to be the
most reliable for predicting future performance.
</P>
<P>
   RISK RATING
</P>
<P>
   Consider two funds, both with a total return of 25 percent last
year. Fund A's share price moved in a steady upward path during the
entire year. On the other hand, Fund B's price gyrated wildly.
There even were times during the year when Fund B was losing money.
</P>
<P>
   Fund A has low volatility. Fund B is highly volatile and might
have kept you awake nights.
</P>
<P>
   Fund-rating services typically base risk ratings on volatility.
Morningstar's does, too, but gives most weight to periods when
shareholders were losing money.
</P>
<P>
   As with return, a score of 1.0 means a fund's risk is average.
In this case, a lower rating is better. A risk rating of 0.5 means
a fund's risk is only half that of the average fund. I've found the
three-year risk rating to be the most significant.
</P>
<P>
   PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to select funds with high returns and low risks. I
look for funds with a minimum five-year return rating of 1.5, and a
maximum three-year risk rating of 0.9. You may prefer different
criteria. However you do it, make sure the return rating is much
higher than the risk rating. For me, the return must be at least
twice the risk. For instance, if a fund has a risk rating of 0.8, I
require a minimum return rating of 1.6.
</P>
<P>
   MORE WORK TO DO
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar's return and risk ratings are based on past
performance. All things being equal, funds that historically have
outperformed the market tend to continue their winning ways. But
there are many other factors to consider. For instance, changes in
management, the makeup of the portfolio and the portfolio's
price/earnings ratio, turnover, expense ratios and more. We'll
continue the discussion in my next column.
</P>
<P>

investing.

MARKET PLACE: THE BATTLE FOR U S WEST AND FRONTIER IS SYMBOLIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's an investor to do when swept up in the turmoil of today's
communications industries?
</P>
<P>
   It's a quandary apparent in the most current donnybrook
concerning U S West, the smallest of the regional Bells, and
Frontier Corp., one of the United States' largest long-distance
telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Communications companies are all too aware that if they do not
transform themselves _ placing one foot in the new digital universe
of the Internet and the other in the more traditional world of
cable or copper wires _ they risk certain death.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the telecommunications upstart Global Crossing, a
Bermuda-based owner of undersea cables, recently agreed to merge
with both U S West and Frontier. And then, in a bold move last
week, another upstart, Qwest Communications International, raised
the stakes with a bid of its own for U S West and Frontier.
</P>
<P>
   But the combinations deemed necessary to propel
telecommunications companies into the Internet age are wreaking
havoc on Wall Street. Investors are struggling with these new
hybrids, surprised by what these companies aspire to become and
questioning how those ambitions fit their investing strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Even executives with the best-laid plans to meld old and new
technologies are at odds with their shareholders these days.
``You've got different crosscurrents here,'' said William
Deatherage, an analyst at Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   And the steps that telecommunications, cable and networking
companies need to take now to prosper often do not mesh with the
short-term expectations of Wall Street. In May, when Global
Crossing first announced its intent to merge with U S West _ even
as Global had a pending deal to also acquire Frontier _ Wall Street
was not enthusiastic. Global Crossing's stock, which was trading at
more than $60 a share before that announcement, is now less than
$50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Investors swifter to punish Qwest. Its stock plummeted 24
percent last Monday, to $34.125 a share, although it began edging
back up, closing Friday at $37.9375.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen deals speak to this issue before,'' said
Deatherage. But the battle for U S West and Frontier ``is one of
the first times where the reaction from investors has been so
striking.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? For one thing, Wall Street loves pure plays. And these
proposed combinations are anything but. Qwest and Global Crossing
are high-growth companies staking their futures on the global
Internet boom. They trade like Internet stocks _ though that is not
what they are _ with billion-dollar market capitalizations based on
the promise of fast growth, despite no earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Frontier and U S West are slower-growth enterprises in mature
corners of the telecommunications industry. But they have what both
Global and Qwest need _ cash and customers.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, investors are well versed in the trauma of fusing
hares and tortoises. When Worldcom said it wanted to acquire MCI
Communications in 1997, investors trashed Worldcom's stock. Now
that move _ forming MCI Worldcom _ is hailed as brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when AT&AMP;T Corp. said it would buy the cable TV
operator Tele-Communications Inc., AT&AMP;T's stock, too, took a dive.
Those share have since recovered, though it is anyone's guess if
AT&AMP;T's bet will pay off.
</P>
<P>
   What is new is the breadth of companies suddenly thrown into the
crucible of old and new communications technologies. ``We're in an
industry reforming itself,'' Joseph Nacchio, Qwest's chief
executive, said in explaining his move last week. ``Those of us in
the midst of it have to reshape our companies.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A bet on once-staid AT&AMP;T has become a gamble on the cable
industry. Lucent Technologies, AT&AMP;T's spin-off of its switches and
hardware division, is buying Ascend Communications and reinventing
itself as a networking company.
</P>
<P>
   Even Alcatel SA, the Paris-based maker of mobile phones and
undersea fiber-optic cables, is touting itself in ads as ``the hot
new Internet company that's 100 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet what might make corporate sense does not always dovetail
with what investors expect. ``If an investor buys Global Crossing
or Qwest with the idea of adding a turbo-charged growth company to
their portfolio and is confronted with a merger that will lower
that growth rate,'' said Deatherage, ``even if the deal makes
industrial logic, that person will be a seller.''
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing may have come up with a structure that _ at
least in the short term _ could satisfy Wall Street. Tom Casey, a
Global vice chairman and former investment banker, said the company
specifically set up a dual share offering to address potential
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two distinct groups of shareholders,'' he said. In the
proposed merger of Global, U S West and Frontier, shareholders
would have the option of either of two stocks _ one for Internet
assets, the other a dividend-paying traditional telephone offering.
</P>
<P>
   But few investors are fans of so-called tracking stocks. Those
can be confusing, and many businesses that Global would spin off,
sell or otherwise divest now overlap.
</P>
<P>
   Deatherage calls it ``an attempt to artificially split'' the two
companies. But until investors sort through how to value hybrids,
``it could be a model,'' said Robert Gensler, an analyst at T. Rowe
Price, a Baltimore-based mutual-fund company. ``Companies now are
stuck in an earnings box.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, any of these combinations are best judged on
their strategic merits, and few people outside the companies
themselves are defending the strategies. So far, Nacchio is drawing
the most ire. He spent much of last week on the road soothing angry
investors, and on Thursday Frontier rejected Qwest's current offer.
U S West is still evaluating Qwest's offer.
</P>
<P>
   While Global Crossing may look as if it has won the first round,
the skirmish is not over. Investors have not overwhelmingly
embraced its merger agreement with the two companies, either.
</P>
<P>
   But Gensler may have the most novel thesis of why Global
Crossing and Qwest are at war: Both want to bolster their fledgling
businesses with real assets while they still have a relatively
overvalued currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``These deals don't feel strategic,'' he said. ``They feel like
they are just trying to lock in the value of their high-priced
stock by merging with another company.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, a new type of investor is likely to emerge
for these hybrids _ one not courageous enough for the
roller-coaster ride of a pure technology play but demanding
better-than-average gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still,'' Deatherage warned, ``in the short term, this will
lead to a fair amount of shareholder churn.''

REFUGEES FIND RUIN, LITTLE FOOD OR WATER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   POSLIC, Yugoslavia _ The villagers here began arriving back home
Saturday night, part of a flood of refugees racing back over the
border from nearly three months in camps and makeshift housing.
</P>
<P>
   They found their houses in ruins _ both from Serbian pillaging
and NATO bombing _ no electricity or drinking water and, worst of
all, hardly any food across a wide stretch of southern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to come back,'' said Nijazi Kryeziv, who made
the short journey from Kukes, Albania, where six of the nine
refugees camps have already been closed and the refugees are
streaming out at the rate of about 15,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``On television, we have seen the pictures of people arriving
back home,'' he went on. ``We didn't have money to pay for
apartments in Albania. And our tractors were stolen there.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to even things out, a neighbor, Sherif Berisha, put in,
``My tractor was stolen by the Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Inviting a group of strangers for the traditional hospitality of
coffee, dusting off plastic garden chairs and putting cushions on a
ledge, the villagers were suddenly embarrassed to realize they did
not have any.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have electricity, we don't have water _ only for
washing not for drinking, &UR; '' &LR;  Kryeziv said. ``We are going to a
spring up on the hill.''
</P>
<P>
   They are afraid to use their well because in many villages the
departing Serbs have poisoned the wells _ sometimes by killing
people and throwing in their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any food, we didn't bring anything with us,''
said Kryeziv, and Fidajie Berisha, an old woman with a scarf over
her head and a baby on her knee, broke in to add, ``We don't even
have a stove to make bread.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherif Berisha summed it up, sadly, ``Everything is broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 125,000 refugees have crossed back into Kosovo from
Albania and Macedonia in the past six days, Rupert Colville, a
spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, said Sunday
night _ and many are coming back to bleak situations similar to
this.
</P>
<P>
   The refugee agency and other relief agencies had hoped that the
refugees would stay put for at least three weeks, so that
preparations could be made for their arrival. Despite their
urgings, the refugees are packing up and coming here, catching the
relief agencies once again unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   This village and others have been appealing to the refugee
agency for food and other aid. Colville said he and other aid
workers feared the swift return of the refugees would overwhelm
their resources, diverting aid from the homeless refugees who have
been living inside Kosovo in the forests and mountains with little
food or shelter and are in much more desperate straits.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Poslic, a few miles south of the city of Prizren,
is typical of the early days of the Serbian campaign to drive out
the Kosovo Albanians. The army appeared in the village on March 27,
three days after the beginning of the NATO bombing, villagers said,
rolling six tanks into the surrounding fields. The people were
given half an hour to gather a few belongings and forced down the
main highway to the border.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs turned the houses into military barracks, apparently
part of their effort to disguise their troop deployments from the
NATO bombers. When the villagers returned they found their houses
wrecked and their televisions, VCRs and satellite dishes stolen.
</P>
<P>
   In one house, the Serbs chopped holes in doors and walls with a
big, rusty, primitive-looking axe. In another, they left the
Serbian sign of a cross and some Cyrillic letters, along with their
names: Ivica, Dudek and Franjo.
</P>
<P>
   In one part of the village four very large new houses had been
destroyed by NATO bombing, which blanketed the area late in the air
war. There were huge craters, the roofs were shattered and the tops
of a half dozen of the tall trees that lined the road leading into
the village were splintered, with dead branches lying all about.
The electricity lines dangled from poles and lay in tangles on the
ground. Dead cows lay in the fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter,'' Kryeziv said. ``They can blow up all my
house. I just wished when I returned not to find a single Serb
here.''

TOBACCO'S IMPRIMATUR REMAINS ON CULTURAL EVENTS, BUT NOT SO BOLD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill.)   By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As part of the $206 billion agreement reached last year between
tobacco producers and 46 states, cigarette companies agreed to
sharply curtail the sponsorships of entertainment and sports events
that they have traditionally used to spread the names and cachet of
their brands.
</P>
<P>
   But while most of the sports alliances will be phased out, other
well-known sponsorships will continue, and tobacco companies seem
to be having no trouble putting their names on entertainment events
like swing dances and blues and jazz festivals by staging them in
clubs and bars limited to adults. Because of the restriction to
adults, the events are not barred by the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   A recent issue of The Village Voice, for instance, included a
full-page advertisement for the Merit Swing Shift dance event at
the China Club (``Learn to swing and dance the night away!''), a
full-page ad for Marlboro cigarettes with listings for 26 clubs and
bars, and a two-page ad with the familiar Camel silhouette and
listings for 34 clubs, musical events and bars on what is billed as
the ``Camel Page _ Your Guide to Urban Night Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the ban on large billboards that went into effect in
April, the sponsorship provisions are a compromise that falls well
short of the goal of antitobacco groups and the attorneys general
who negotiated the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's in the agreement was very hard fought, and it's not the
ban on sponsorships we had hoped to achieve,'' said Christine
Gregoire, the Washington state attorney general and one of the
chief negotiators. ``It was one of the first issues on the table
and one of the last items left on the table. For the industry, this
was a break-the-deal issue, so what we got was not what we
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Some officials are already wondering if the agreement's intent
is being circumvented.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spirit of the agreement was that a lot of these activities
would not continue,'' said Joseph Belluck, special litigation
counsel with the New York State attorney general's office. ``Some
of these activities are clearly on the line, and what side of the
line they fall on will probably have to be determined by
enforcement agencies in every state.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies say the agreement was meant to prevent
marketing to minors, not intended to ban tobacco advertising and
promotion altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philip Morris is committed to the letter and spirit of the
agreement,'' said Brendan McCormick, a spokesman for the company.
``And the agreement recognized that tobacco companies could
continue to market their products responsibly and effectively to
adults who choose to smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement's biggest effect on sponsorships may be to halt
the growth of tobacco sponsorships of smaller arts-related events.
Mark Smith, a spokesman for Brown &AMP; Williamson, said Kool
cigarettes, for example, has sponsored smaller events, like
concerts by emerging bands, and the company had considered several
other events.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had quite a few in the planning stages,'' he said. ``They
ranged from art contests to some music-oriented events. Those will
not go forward.'' He declined to give more information on specific
events.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, tobacco companies are barred from
sponsoring all concerts, events in which the intended audience is
composed of a significant percentage of youths under 18, events in
which any paid participants or contestants are youths, and
football, basketball, baseball, soccer or hockey games or leagues.
</P>
<P>
   But tobacco companies may retain one sponsorship not barred by
the agreement, which can be a series of events rather than a single
one. They may continue any existing sponsorships throughout current
contractual relationships of up to three years.
</P>
<P>
   The exceptions will allow RJR Nabisco Holdings, for instance, to
continue sponsoring the popular Winston Cup auto races for as much
as three years, depending on the stipulations in its contract, and
beyond that if it decides to do so. The company also sponsors the
National Hot Rod Association Winston Drag Race series and the
Vantage Championship Golf Tournament. It may continue only one of
the three after its contracts expire, and officials declined to say
when that would be.
</P>
<P>
   The company has said it has not decided which sponsorships it
would continue.
</P>
<P>
   Its blues performance sponsorship under the title of the Winston
Blues Revival will continue in all-adult environments like clubs
and bars.
</P>
<P>
   The Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. sponsors a Team Kool Green
auto racing team, and its GPC brand is a sponsor of the George
Strait Music festival. Both contracts last two more years, and one
will be eliminated after that.
</P>
<P>
   The company said one of its best-known sponsorships, the Kool
Jazz Festival, had ended several years ago, but the agreement with
the states specifically allows the company the option of using that
festival as its annual brand-name event.
</P>
<P>
   The Philip Morris Co.s plan to continue auto racing
sponsorships, which include the Marlboro Grand Prix, the Marlboro
500 and the Marlboro Team Penske racing team. The company will
discontinue Virginia Slims tennis, Merit bowling and a series of
concerts on military bases.
</P>
<P>
   While those sponsorships will end, the company is heavily
advertising its Marlboro Ranch Party, a promotion in its second
year, which sends winners to a five-day ranch vacation in what is
called Marlboro Country.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gregoire said states are carefully monitoring compliance
with the agreement, and some issues have already arisen.
</P>
<P>
   But while a relatively small number of large-scale sponsorships
will be affected, tobacco sponsorship of music and other events at
bars in major cities has become an increasingly entrenched feature
of American night life since such sponsorship began on a small
basis about a decade ago. Tobacco brands like Marlboro, Camel and
Kool are aggressively competing to sign up clubs or bars, where
they sponsor concerts or parties, sell cigarettes and put their
names and logos on napkins, ashtrays and other items.
</P>
<P>
   Bar owners say it helps them put on events they might not
otherwise be able to afford and helps the companies market to hip
young city dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Camel's market is a bit more hip and edgier; it's not the
Marlboro man,'' said Sammy Jo, manager of Mother, a club in
Manhattan. ``Their image tends to be more cutting edge, so it makes
sense for them to be in these clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Camel Page in The Village Voice is designed as a with-it
night life and entertainment guide for young urbanites. Offerings
include tapas bars, Cajun food and what is billed as ``the best VIP
room in NYC, if not the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Listed are rock, jazz, hip-hop and country music, billed with
come-ons like ``DJ Philter spins jungle, (sl)ambient and minimal
intelligent eclectica'' or ``Roy Ayers is revered as the icon of
the acid jazz movement, combining rhythms of funk, salsa, jazz,
rock, soul and rap.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ads in free weeklies also tout Kool Nites and Marlboro
sponsorship of performances by musicians like Willy DeVille and
Clarence (Gatemouth) Brown, with artwork featuring the Marlboro
name and colors and a stylized guitar. Cigarette companies sponsor
similar events in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and other
major cities.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that even if the ads are supposed to be aimed at
adults, they appear in publications that attract teen-agers, who
are certain to see as many ads for cigarette brand-name events now
as in the past. They say that allowing sponsorships in adult-only
venues can give tobacco the hidden-fruit allure of something
attractive but unattainable.
</P>
<P>
   But even Ms. Gregoire said the events in adults-only settings
are consistent with the agreement's intention of banning tobacco
marketing to those under 18. Tobacco officials say that children
cannot be shielded from all cigarette references any more than to
all references to lotteries or guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face reality,'' said Smith, of Brown &AMP; Williamson.
``There are people who will have a problem for political reasons
with this industry no matter what we do. This is an adult
environment with no children involved whatsoever. It's a very
efficient environment for reaching people who are already smokers
to get them to try our brand.''
</P>
<P>
   But some tobacco critics fear that tobacco companies have won
logistical and public relations battles in the wake of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We forget that the tobacco lawsuits were not only about the
tobacco industry misleading youths, but adults as well,'' said Eric
Lindblom, manager for policy research at the Coalition of
Tobacco-Free Kids. ``The industry has been successful in focusing
just on the youth issue, and saying anything we do with adults
should be off the table.''

WHITE HOUSE BUOYED BY CLINTON-YELTSIN MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ The reasonable face of Russia, President
Boris Yeltsin, walked stiffly, but his presence here Sunday was
enough to reassure President Clinton and other leaders that
dialogue with Moscow was possible in the aftermath of the Kosovo
war.
</P>
<P>
   After months of tensions since the start of the war, culminating
in an unnerving standoff between Russian and NATO troops at the
main airport in Kosovo, the Russian and American leaders met Sunday
and decided to let bygones be bygones, according to Clinton's
aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're actually in a position to have a stronger
relationship with Russia in the future than before the conflict
started,'' Clinton said after their hourlong session.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to give a fresh start to the frayed relationship, the
aides said, the two leaders instead focused in their meeting on the
Russian economy, Moscow's sharing of nuclear technology with Iran,
and arms control.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, in a joint statement, agreed for the first time to begin
discussions on changes to the linchpin accord on nuclear weapons
between the two countries, something desired by successive American
presidents, including Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The encounter between Clinton and Yeltsin, their first since the
president was in Moscow last September, was set in the context of
the summit meeting of the Group of Eight _ the world's seven
leading industrial nations and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was included in the prestigious club several years ago as
a way of showing that Moscow counted as a major power, and
Yeltsin's appearance, truncated to about seven hours and uncertain
until the last moment because of the precariousness of his health
and tensions over Kosovo, was as important for him as it was for
the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make up after our fight,'' Yeltsin said of the
heated differences over Kosovo between the NATO allies and Russia.
As a traditional ally of Yugoslavia, Russia vehemently opposed
NATO's bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The other leaders, who had watched the roller-coaster behavior
of Russia over Kosovo _ helpful, then obstinate over the role of
its troops, then helpful again in arriving at a solution two days
ago _ were relieved and grateful.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing buoyed by Sunday's encounter with the Russian
president, Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said
the meeting was ``one of the best'' the two leaders had held.
Despite the concerns about the health of Yeltsin, who appeared
uncertain on his feet at times, Berger described the Russian leader
as ``pounding the table'' and being very ``forceful'' in overruling
his aides arrayed on either side of him.
</P>
<P>
   The French president, Jacques Chirac, spoke warmly of
``reconciliation'' between Russia and the West.
</P>
<P>
   But the summit leaders, in a reflection of their underlying
uncertainty about Russia's political and economic future, offered
only modest economic assistance.
</P>
<P>
   In the summit's final communique Sunday, Russia was urged to
step up its economic reforms so it could meet requirements set by
the International Monetary Fund for an agreement on a $4.5 billion
loan.
</P>
<P>
   Only after the agreement with the fund was in place should the
Paris Club of sovereign creditors ``act expeditiously'' to
negotiate a debt rescheduling agreement, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for the Paris Club debt relief was a ``little thank you
by the West'' for Russia's final role in resolving the Kosovo
crisis, Karl Kaiser, a German foreign ministry official, said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half of Russia's total debt of about $150 billion is owed
to Germany, and further debt relief would require a ``green light''
from the German government, Kaiser said. So far, such a go-ahead
was not in sight, he added.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several weeks, as the negotiations over Kosovo went
up and down, the White House had prepared several scenarios for the
meeting between Clinton and Yeltsin. In a worst-case scenario, some
officials were ready for a total blowup.
</P>
<P>
   Until almost the last moment, it looked as though the two men
would talk almost exclusively about Kosovo and finalize an
agreement on how Russian soldiers would operate with NATO in the
province.
</P>
<P>
   But with Yeltsin apparently giving the order to settle the talks
in Helsinki, Finland, before the summit meeting, the way was
cleared, according to Berger, for the two countries to be ``back in
business.''
</P>
<P>
   In their face-to-face meeting, held in an bland conference room
in a local hotel where the Russian delegation was staying _ a
locale chosen so Yeltsin would not have to move around too much _
Clinton reiterated the position of the other summit leaders on
economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Russia must meet the revenue-raising requirements set by the IMF
in order to start the disbursement of the $4.5 billion loan, the
president said. Berger quoted Yeltsin as saying: ``I am personally
committed'' to finalizing the IMF agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In agreeing in the joint Russian-American statement to discuss
the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty between the the two countries,
Yeltsin acceded to a process the Russians had previously refused to
consider, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration wants to start these discussions because
modifications to the treaty are needed if a decision is made to
deploy the national missile defense system proposed by Clinton in
his State of the Union address in January.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, the statement also said, pledged to work toward the
ratification of the START II treaty _ stalled by Russia's
Communist-dominated Parliament _ but that is a pledge the Yeltsin
government has made many times before. The two sides also agreed to
continue discussions on the START III treaty, which aims to reduce
both sides' nuclear arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   According to Berger's account, the Russian foreign minister,
Igor Ivanov, said that it was unlikely that the Russian Parliament
would deal with the START II ratification before its summer recess.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Yeltsin raised the issue of
Congress' lifting the Jackson-Vanik Act, a 1974 law that forbids
Russia to be automatically granted normal trading relations with
the United States because of Moscow's Soviet-era refusal to permit
freedom of emigration.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been declared eligible for normal trading relations
status, even though the law remains on the books, so the law has
little practical effect. Recent expressions of anti-Semitism by
Communist Party politicians in Russia have made Congress reluctant
to repeal the law, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   When told that those Russian politicians were blocking
congressional action, Yeltsin, according to a White House official,
replied: ``Give me the names. I will grind them down and come at
them like a ton of bricks.''
</P>
<P>
   On the question of Russia's helping Iran with nuclear
technology, Yeltsin said he wanted to be co-operative in working
out disagreements, administration officials said. He said he wanted
to revive what had been the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission _ named
after Vice President Al Gore and the former Russian prime minister,
Victor Chernomyrdin _ by including the new prime minister, Sergei
Stepashin. The proliferation issues could be dealt with under the
aegis of the new commission, Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
   As a special gesture to Clinton, Yeltsin presented the president
with documents on President Kennedy and his assassination which had
been declassified by Russian military and civilian archives at
Yeltsin's request, Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   After Yeltsin flew back to Moscow, Clinton spoke Sunday night at
a short ceremony marking the move of the American Embassy in
Germany from Bonn to Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the summit meeting, Clinton said, coincided with a
potential turning point in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find ourselves at that pivotal moment between winning a
conflict and winning the peace,'' he said. ``Today the last Serb
forces are leaving Kosovo, in accordance with the deadline that has
been set.'' What happened now, the president said, ``will determine
the character of this Continent, the shape of our alliance and the
nature of our partnership with Russia for years and years to
come.''

   HOLLYWOOD _ Several months ago Tom Hanks received a video
documentary called ``Return With Honor'' from Richard Chew, a top
film editor. ``He sent me a note saying that he thought I might be
interested,'' Hanks recalled, ``but I just let it sit on my desk
for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally Hanks opened the package and began watching the video.
``I sat there amazed,'' he said. ``It didn't take much to be swept
away. It was one of the greatest stories I have ever heard.''
</P>
<P>
   The film depicts the heroism and endurance of American prisoners
of war in Vietnam, and Hanks has taken the unusual step of lending
his name as its ``presenter'' (``Tom Hanks Presents'') and is
actively promoting it.
</P>
<P>
   The 102-minute film opened in New York and Los Angeles to strong
reviews and is to be released in other large cities in the next few
weeks. An official opening is scheduled for Tuesday in Washington
at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, to be attended
by most of the former prisoners and their families as well as by
Hanks and government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The film was made by Freida Lee Mock and Terry Sanders,
documentary makers from Los Angeles who had won an Academy Award
for ``Maya Lin: A Strong, Clear Vision,'' about the architect who
designed the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mock said she received a call in 1997 from three Air Force
Academy graduates, class of 1965, who had served in Vietnam and
were now successful entrepreneurs. They wondered if Ms. Mock and
Sanders had considered making a documentary about American pilots
shot down over North Vietnam who had survived as long as nine years
under harrowing and brutal conditions. The call came after the men
had seen the Maya Lin documentary.
</P>
<P>
   The three were Mark Johnson, a former commercial pilot; Bart
Holaday, a former Rhodes scholar and portfolio manager, and Warren
Langley, a former president of the Pacific Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, `Wow, what a great idea,' '' Ms. Mock recalled. ``We
began talking to the former POW's and what surprised us was how
open and candid and intimate these men were about their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``They were so forthcoming; they were not at all
stereotypical military men. Their experiences in prison camp
totally affected what they are today and, as they told us, as
difficult as that experience was, they were strengthened by it and
that's why they were so direct and open.''
</P>
<P>
   The film includes interviews and archival newsreels from Vietnam
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In his review of the film in The New York Times, Stephen Holden
said that the documentary signified a major shift in the screen
image of the Vietnam veteran from that of an alienated and damaged
person to a hero. ``The stories they tell are inspiring, sometimes
astounding, and most important, true,'' Holden wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The film cost about $1.3 million. Ms. Mock said the money came
from the Boeing-McDonnell Foundation and the MBNA Corp., a credit
card company.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks said he became involved in selling the documentary because
films like this one usually have trouble at the box office. He said
he had been unaware of the heroism of so many American prisoners,
as well as the brutalities they endured, and he assumed that that
was true of most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of their imprisonment has never been illuminated
like this,'' he said.

THIS TEN-DOLLAR TONGUE KNOWS A HIGH-DOLLAR RECIPE

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yr. Obdt. Correspondent is cursed, or blessed, with a $10
tongue. It was once valued at only $6, but everything has gone up
since then.
</P>
<P>
   I can enjoy and appreciate a $10 bottle of wine. I can't
truthfully say that my enjoyment is doubled or tripled when I am
served a $20 or $30 vintage.
</P>
<P>
   After a recent visit to chalk-lined cellars of the Marne River
winery that produces both Dom Perignon and Moet et Chandon
champagnes, we were served tulip glasses filled with the
world-famous brut.
</P>
<P>
   It tasted like champagne. I knew it wasn't Cook's. But it might
have been Korbel. You could have fooled me. See, I've got a $10
tongue.
</P>
<P>
   On that same trip to France, I had to confront yet another
truth. How much is my split nose worth?
</P>
<P>
   ``I divide the `nose' into two parts,'' explained Serge Dubs
during a two-hour wine tasting in the Alsace. What Dubs meant was
that he sniffs the wine just after it has been poured. Then he
sniffs it a second time, after revolving the glass in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, a group of judges from around the world
named Dubs ``Sommelier of the Year.'' This man is blessed with a
$300 tongue. Lord knows what his matched pair of noses are worth.
</P>
<P>
   Between sips of various French wines, we learned to look for
``tears'' on the sides of the glass. ``Is this wine limpid?'' he
asked. ``Look for the nuances of color from white or green to
red-orange. Is the aftertaste long or short. What dominates,
bitterness or sweetness? If the two are equal, you have a
remarkable wine.''
</P>
<P>
   I'll take his word for it. I might pop for a bottle of the
muscat or the pinot gris we sampled. If it didn't cost any more
than $10.
</P>
<P>
   I asked the former sommelier of the year whether he had any
Pacific Northwest wines in his personal cellar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some pinot noirs from Oregon,'' he admitted. ``And I
have some Washington wines from, what is the name? Ah yes, Ste.
Michelle.'' Dubs said he is impressed with some of the wines being
produced in Australia. But you will never get the French to rate
any wine above the local product, for sipping, slurping or cooking
in a dish like this:
</P>
<P>
   Cod Beaujolais
</P>
<P>
   6 6-ounce portions of true cod
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 cup light red wine, like Beaujolais
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons tomato sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons fresh minced parsley
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon oregano
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon thyme
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon rosemary
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   18 black olives
</P>
<P>
   Parsley for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Wash fillets and pat dry with paper towels. Lay out in one layer
in a large oven platter or two small ones. Sprinkle with salt and
pepper and cover with wine. Cover the platter with aluminum foil
and bake in a 400-degree oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the
fish is just beginning to firm up.
</P>
<P>
   Remove fish to a platter. Pour the wine liquid into a small
saucepan and boil for 2 or 3 minutes. You need 1 cup of reduced
liquid, so add or pour off wine accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Melt butter in a skillet. Over medium heat saute the onions for
about 2 minutes. Add garlic, reduced wine liquid, tomato sauce, 2
tablespoons parsley, the oregano, thyme and rosemary. Bring sauce
to a boil, stirring. Reduce heat to a simmer. Mix the cornstarch
with 1 tablespoon of cold water and stir this mess into the pan.
</P>
<P>
   When the sauce is thick, return fish fillets to oven dish and
cover with sauce. At this point you can refrigerate the fish,
covered, for a couple of hours if you wish.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before you want to serve, shove platter into a
350-degree oven and cook the fish, covered, until done to your
liking, maybe 15 or 18 minutes. Garnish with olives and more
parsley and this will serve six.
</P>
<P>
   Nah, you don't have to use French Beaujolais in this dish. You
can probably find a light red from Washington or Oregon. You might
even get one on sale for under $10.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure many French sommeliers would mix white wine with
red chili peppers, but it works in a dish like this.
</P>
<P>
   Garlic Steamed Mussels
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   2 large garlic cloves, peeled and minced
</P>
<P>
   4 dried chili peppers
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   2 and a half pounds mussels
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in your seafood pot and saute the onion, garlic and
chili peppers for about three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Dump in the mussels and wine, cover the pot and steam until all
the visible shells have opened. Remove pot from heat and let sit
covered for a minute. Dish the mussels up into two large bowls and
pour the contents of the pot _ through a strainer _ over the
mussels until the broth is evenly divided.

   LOS ANGELES _ An on-line sports betting site called
Intertops.com (www.intertops.com), a fully licensed company in St.
John's, Antigua, has laid claim to establishing the first odds _
5-to-6 _ on Michael Jordan's return to the NBA to play now that
Phil Jackson has taken over the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Internet gamblers can also bet against the likelihood that
Jordan will come out of retirement _ currently posted at even
money.
</P>
<P>
   Phil's other cause: Democratic presidential candidate Bill
Bradley has a campaign website (billbradley.com) that will send
e-mails about his appearances, such as the one he had this past
week in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Not even game-used: It was item number 115415780 on the ebay.com
online auction site _ a USC football helmet that used to belong to
quarterback Jason Thomas, who has since transferred. First bid was
$100.00. The high bid was $162.50.
</P>
<P>
   NBA playground: Among the toys to play with during the NBA
Finals on the league's official Website (http://nba.com) is a
section on the odd records that have been set during the NBA
Finals. Did you know that on the day Magic Johnson set the rookie
record for points (42) to lead the Lakers to the title in Game 6
against Philadelphia in 1980, he also set an NBA Finals record with
10 turnovers? Those are just two of Johnson's 19 NBA Finals
records, more than anyone in history.
</P>
<P>
   The site also has a Quicktime video clip of Jerry West making
his 60-footer during the 1970 NBA Finals
(nba.com/theater/video/1970ot.avi).

<P>
   Net volleys: For the fifth straight year, Wimbledon's official
site (www.wimbledon.org) should be the best place to go for updated

CLIFTON FADIMAN, A BOOKWORM'S BOOKWORM, DEAD AT 95 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.) (rk) 
 By RICHARD SEVERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clifton Fadiman, the essayist, critic, editor and indefatigable
anthologist whose encyclopedic knowledge made him a mainstay of
``Information Please'' and other popular radio programs in the late
1930s, '40s and '50s, died Sunday on Sanibel Island, Fla. He was 95
and lived on the nearby island of Captiva.
</P>
<P>
   Fadiman, who also helped establish the Book of the Month Club
and served on its editorial board for more than 50 years, was a
bookworm's bookworm. He learned to read when he was 4 and he never
got over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I opened and read the first page of a book for the first
time, I felt this was remarkable: that I could learn something very
quickly that I could not have learned any other way,'' he said.
Fadiman added that he ``grew bug-eyed over the miracle of
language'' and that his enthusiasm for ``decoding the black
squiggles on white paper'' never ceased. ``One's first book, kiss
or home run is always the best,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His interest in literature was accompanied by a formidable
memory. And so it seemed he was literally born to be an
anthologist; over six decades, he assembled more than two dozen
anthologies dealing with everything from the beliefs of leading
intellectuals to poetry to mathematics to prose to limericks and
the atrocious pun. If his knowledge seemed encyclopedic, it was
understandable; he served on the Encyclopedia Britannica's
editorial board for many years.
</P>
<P>
   He also created Treasury of the Encyclopedia Britannica, for
which he read or skimmed approximately 200 years of the
encyclopedia's editions and then condensed this into a 700-page
volume. He admitted he had not read every word the Britannica had
ever printed, but with his knowledge of history and literature and
his ability to read 80 pages an hour, he got through more of the
encyclopedia than most people would.
</P>
<P>
   Of primary importance to Fadiman was ``The World Treasury of
Children's Literature,'' which he assembled in the mid-1980s. There
were volumes for children ages 4 to 8 and 9 to 14. He created these
anthologies not only because he was interested in children's
literature but also because he felt that it was necessary to
involve children early in reading if literacy was to survive
television.
</P>
<P>
   Fadiman said he feared that society was passing ``into an
entirely new techno-culture in which reading will be a very
secondary or tertiary occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kip Fadiman (friends called him by his childhood nickname) was
especially proud of his Encyclopedia Britannica entry on the
history of children's literature; to study the subject he learned
to read child-level Italian, Spanish, Swedish and Dutch when he was
in his 70s.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s and '50's, Fadiman's presence in and influence on
American intellectual life were ubiquitous. He prided himself on
his skill as a popularizer and on his ability to make lofty
subjects accessible to people who lacked his education and acuity.
</P>
<P>
   This made him the target of such critics as Dwight MacDonald,
who in the 1950s accused him of being a high priest of ``Midcult,''
contaminating American culture with what MacDonald saw as the
``tepid ooze'' of phony intellect. Other critics said that
Fadiman's creativity was not the equal of his memory. But Fadiman
was never defensive about what he was or what he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a profound thinker,'' he once said. He said he saw
himself rather as a guide, someone who could help other readers
pick the titles that suited them. During the middle part of the
century he had a good sense of what Americans wanted to read and
was an important national taste maker.
</P>
<P>
   But as the years passed, his influence waned; Americans seemed
less interested in the great works of classical literature that he
loved and more attracted to certain of the newer novels in which,
he said, ``the sex scene is mandatory about every 40 pages.'' He
thought such writers went too far, thereby leaving ``nothing for
the poor guy or woman to work on actively in their bedroom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to discover things for yourself, I've found out,''
he added.
</P>

<P>
   Clifton Paul Fadiman was born on May 15, 1904, in Brooklyn, the
son of Isidore Michael and Grace Elizabeth Fadiman, Russian-Jewish
immigrants. His father was a pharmacist, his mother a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   His elder brother, Edwin, encouraged him to read, and by the
time he was 10, Clifton was reading Homer, Sophocles, Dante and
Milton. He quickly showed a great interest in the intellectual
history of Western civilization and would walk to and from the
library, two miles round trip, with his eyes fixed on the printed
page. He took pride in being able to sense curbs with his
peripheral vision so that he did not have to stop reading just to
cross the street.
</P>
<P>
   Fadiman graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Columbia University in
1925. While at Columbia, he urged his classmate Whittaker Chambers
to read ``The Communist Manifesto.'' His first job out of college
was as a teacher at the Ethical Culture High School (now
Fieldston), where he remained until 1927. He also lectured, from
1923 to 1933, at the People's Institute of New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1920s he was a top editor at Simon &AMP; Schuster,
remaining there until 1933, when he left to become book editor of
The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   In his 10 years at The New Yorker he favored ``clarity above all
in what I read.'' Thus he gave high praise in his reviews to
writers like Sinclair Lewis and was not an admirer of writers like
Gertrude Stein and William Faulkner. Earlier, he had been a book
reviewer for The Nation.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1938, Dan Golenpaul started a radio program
called ``Information Please'' and asked Fadiman to be its
moderator. Regular panelists included John Kieran, Franklin Adams
and Oscar Levant. Their lively discussions gained a reputation for
wit and erudition and soon won an audience of nine million.
</P>
<P>
   These listeners submitted questions and if any of them were able
``to stump the experts,'' Fadiman rewarded them with sets of the
Encyclopedia Britannica.
</P>
<P>
   When the program was taken off the air in 1948, Fadiman was
sought after as a lecturer. During this same period, he also
appeared on other radio shows, most notably ``Quiz Kids,'' which
put questions to bright young people. Other programs in which he
participated included ``Mathematics,'' ``Alumni Fun''and
``Conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1952 he was the host of a popular television show called
``This Is Show Business,'' which featured a panel that included
George S. Kaufman and Abe Burrows.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his life, he urged young people to be serious and to
read classic literature. ``Books,'' he said, ``are not rolls, to be
devoured only when they are fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades readers encountered Fadiman in his introductory
essays in the Modern Library to such classics as ``War and Peace''
and ``The Short Stories of Henry James,'' in his contributions to
special editions of such books as ``Moby-Dick'' and ``The Pickwick
Papers,'' in anthologies like ``Reading I've Liked'' and ``I
Believe,'' in newspaper and magazine articles and in a monthly
column in Holiday magazine called ``Party of One.''
</P>
<P>
   And for years thousands of readers were guided by his literary
suggestions, especially through the Book of the Month Club and
ventures like The Reader's Club, an organization that distributed
books reprinted on the advice of Fadiman, Carl Van Doren, Sinclair
Lewis and Alexander Woollcott.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the author, with renowned wine merchant Sam Aaron,
of ``The Joys of Wine,'' an exhaustive book on a subject that, like
cheese and cigars, was a favorite indulgence. In his essay ``Brief
History of a Love Affair,'' he told of his lifelong passion for
wine. ``I think of ourselves as a model couple,'' he wrote,
``faithful, mutually solicitous, still ardent, and in the case of
the lady, well preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   He lost most of his sight as a result of acute retinal necrosis
in his late '80s. But according to his daughter, Anne, also a
writer, he continued to vet manuscripts for the Book of the Month
Club, as he had since 1944, by listening to unabridged tapes of the
volumes specially recorded for him by his son Kim. He dictated his
assessments to a secretary. He continued to participate, by way of
conference calls, in the club's editorial board meetings until
March.
</P>
<P>
   While blind he brought out a new edition of ``The Lifetime
Reading Plan,'' a guide done with John S. Major that was intended
to introduce Americans to the classics of civilization, and he was
the general editor of ``World Poetry: An Anthology of Verse From
Antiquity to Our Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in his life the book world honored him for his love of the
printed word by awarding him the 1993 National Book Foundation
Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Fadiman's marriage to Pauline Elizabeth Rush, an editor, ended
in divorce. In 1950 he married Annalee Whitmore Jacoby, a
screenwriter and the co-author with Theodore H. White of ``Thunder
Out of China.'' In addition to his wife, his daughter, Anne, of New
York, and his son Kim, of Sanibel, Fla., he is survived by another
son, Jonathan of Concord, Mass., a brother, William Fadiman of Los
Angeles, six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Clifton Fadiman had a fondness for people's last words and wrote
an essay about them called ``Some Passing Remarks on Some Passing
Remarks.'' He once told his daughter that his favorite parting line
was that of the 18th-century English writer Mary Wortley Montagu:
``It has all been very interesting.''

EDITORIAL: THE HORRORS OF KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, June 21:
</P>
<P>
   During the NATO bombing of Kosovo, when Serbia controlled
reporters' access to the region, journalists could document
atrocities only by interviewing the ethnic Albanians who had fled
to refugee camps. News reports of their accounts usually carried
the words ``could not be independently confirmed.'' They can be
now. Journalists have fanned out through Kosovo, and the
confirmation is horrifying. Ethnic Albanians offer reporters
crumpled lists of the dead and lead them to burned mosques, the
remains of bodies and fresh graves dug by friends and family to
bury the victims.
</P>
<P>
   There were no battles on these killing fields. The victims were
civilians _largely men of fighting age, but also young children,
women, old people and especially those who ran out of Deutsche
marks for the marauding Serbian paramilitaries or special police.
The British government now says that at least 10,000 ethnic
Albanian civilians were killed in hundreds of massacres. An
American official called this number ``conservative in the
extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   The most urgent task for NATO is to prevent further killings. A
significant number of ethnic Albanians who were arrested for
political activity in Kosovo before the war have been transferred
to prisons in Serbia, where they are in peril. Their safe return
should be a high priority. The dimension of the horrors should
strengthen the West's resolve to allow only a token scattering of
Serbian security forces into Kosovo, and to keep Russian
peacekeepers from acting as Serb surrogates. It is now impossible
to contemplate softening the extended self-rule that the peace deal
promises Kosovo, even after NATO leaves.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of brutality will complicate reconstruction. Thousands
of families have lost not only all their possessions, but also
their breadwinners. Survivors, especially children, will need
psychological help. NATO forces will also have to pay special
attention to demilitarizing the Albanian guerrillas quickly and
protecting the Serbian civilians who remain, as revenge will
continue to be a strong temptation.
</P>
<P>
   Trials of Serbian officials, paramilitary and police commanders,
and particularly brutal troops are crucial _ for the sake of
justice and historical accuracy, and also to head off revenge
killings. Preparations for such trials went badly in Bosnia. NATO
forces there did not make helping investigators a priority. Many of
the crimes were old. Investigators were stymied by Serbian and
Bosnian Serb authorities, who controlled the important sites.
</P>
<P>
   The war-crimes tribunal should have an easier time in Kosovo.
NATO has moved quickly to secure crime sites. Providing logistical
help for investigators and land-mine clearance is also high on the
peacekeepers' list. The atrocities are fresh and the Serbian forces
will not be around to get in the way, although they were able to
dig up some graves and destroy some evidence. Still, the
investigation needs to move as fast as possible, and NATO should be
ready to arrest people when there is convincing evidence that they
committed serious atrocities _ rather than let them escape from
Kosovo _ even before they are formally indicted. Governments should
be generous in lending staff to the tribunal and giving money.
Washington has pledged $9 million, an important start.

   It would be useful for the tribunal to encourage independent
journalists from Serbia and Russia to report on the new and
powerful evidence of atrocities. Virtually all Russia's coverage of
crimes against Albanian Kosovars came on its independent NTV, and
that was very limited. Serbia's tiny independent media were shut
down and persecuted during the war, and their harassment has only
continued. The West should help these groups resume broadcasting
out of neighboring Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Even these brave journalists, however, have shown little
interest in what their fellow Serbs were doing to Albanian Kosovars
during the war. What is perhaps most sobering about the scale of
the atrocities is that even as their countrymen were killing many
thousands of innocents, the vast majority of Serbs chose not to
notice, or not to care.  &QL;

   SAN FRANCISCO _ On the World Wide Web, the rich are getting
richer.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing new statistical support to an increasingly common
Internet wisdom, two Xerox Corp. researchers have found that the
most popular Web sites command by far the biggest share of Internet
traffic _ a signature of what economists refer to as ``winner take
all'' markets.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which is based on statistical measurements of
visitors to sites on the Internet's World Wide Web, looks at a
large data sample of Internet traffic to two types of sites:
universities and so-called adult entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, which are laid out in a report that is to be
presented at a technical conference this month by Lada Adamic and
Bernardo Huberman, would seem to undermine arguments by some
entrepreneurs and technologists that the World Wide Web would be a
democratizing force, allowing a large number of relatively equal
market contestants to compete on a level playing field. Instead,
the study finds, the most popular sites tend to gain an
accelerating advantage over their competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we found that you are rewarded not so much for
absolute performance as much as for relative performance,'' said
Huberman, a physicist who studies the ecology of computer networks
at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Xerox study is based on a sample of America Online users in
December 1997. The data look at 60,000 users and 120,000 Web sites.
Whether analyzing traffic to university sites or to the
sex-oriented adult entertainment sites, the research indicates that
the traffic distribution follows what is known as a universal power
law. This means that a small number of sites command the traffic of
a large portion of the entire Web population.
</P>
<P>
   Huberman said the pattern found in the America Online data was
reflected in the researchers' subsequent analysis of data from the
Web ``portal'' Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   The America Online user data indicated that among all sites
visited _ excluding America Online as a site itself _ 119 sites
received 32.36 percent of all visits, with Yahoo receiving the
most.
</P>
<P>
   The top 5 percent of all sites in the sample _ approximately
6,000 sites _ received 74.81 percent of all Web traffic. The top 5
percent of adult sites received 41.75 percent of total visitors to
such sites. And the top 5 percent of educational sites received
59.5 percent of all visitors to that category of sites.
</P>
<P>
   The finding that Web visitors are distributed among sites
according to the universal power law mirrors what social scientists
refer to as Pareto's Law _ named for a late 19th-century Italian
economist, Vilfredo Pareto, who studied different countries and
found the statistics of inequality in the distribution of wealth
showed a remarkable similarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most popular sites are generally not the ones that were
created first,'' Huberman said. Popularity instead tended to be
determined by a collective process he referred to as social search,
in which referrals from friends and acquaintances drove growth.
</P>
<P>
   The Xerox findings are closely correlated with the
yet-to-be-released results of similar research conducted by a group
of IBM researchers at the company's Almaden Research Center in San
Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a broader study undertaken in an effort to improve
the quality of a Web searching tool, a group of five scientists
graphed the hyperlinks, or pointers, between different Web sites.
Pointers that refer to other Web sites are another measure of
popularity on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their research is very similar to our research,'' said Sridhar
Rajagopalan, a member of the IBM research staff at the Almaden
center, referring to the Xerox team's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams of researchers said their findings could not be used
to predict winners and losers on the Web _ but did show that once a
Web site catches on, its popularity tends to increase rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't say it will be hopeless for a small mom-and-pop
Web site,'' Rajagopalan said. ``It's more like a lottery.''

<P>
   If the executives at Hearst Magazines wanted to place an ad in
the newspaper for the position of editor in chief of Harper's
Bazaar, it might read something like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Wanted: an editor with enough attitude to revitalize a
magazine that was once a solid No. 2 in the field and is now
wavering between Nos. 3 and 4; a woman (probably) who is willing to
make close to $1 million a year and has the ability to answer the
following question: Do American women _ and the advertisers that
cater to them _ care about fashion anymore?''
</P>
<P>
   This week, Cathleen Black, the president of Hearst Magazines, is
expected to announce which lucky contestant will win the coveted
opportunity to replace the late Elizabeth Tilberis as top editor of
Harper's Bazaar. While a half-dozen names are being mentioned,
executives of Hearst are mostly staying silent. (One who ventured
to speak off the record would do so only after asking if a reporter
was sure her phone lines were not bugged.)
</P>
<P>
   But whoever takes the helm will have to contend not only with
the problems at Harper's Bazaar _ dwindling advertising pages,
snazzy competition and sluggish growth in fashion advertising _ but
with the potential end of an era for the high-fashion glossy, as
magazines that combine style and lifestyle _ like In Style,
published by Time Inc. _ come to dominate the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   After a recession in Asian markets late last year, manufacturers
of high-end apparel and makers of luxury goods, like Gucci,
suffered some losses, and that translated into lower budgets for
fashion-magazine advertising. (These losses came on the heels of a
decline the previous year; in the category of ready-to-wear
clothing, manufacturers spent $539 million in magazine advertising
in 1997 but only $510 million in 1998, the first dip after a
precipitous rise during the previous five years.)
</P>
<P>
   Other categories remained strong. The four magazines in the
United States that focus on women's fashion _ Vogue, Elle, W and
Harper's Bazaar _ show relatively healthy advertising figures,
encompassing all categories, for this year.
</P>
<P>
   Harper's Bazaar was the least sprightly of the four, with just a
2 percent increase in overall advertising revenue for January
through May, compared with the period a year earlier. Vogue and W
are both up 13 percent, and Elle is up 3 percent, according to the
Publishers Information Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, In Style is up 60 percent. But much of this year's
rise can be credited to the fact that the fashion titles have
followed the lead of magazines like In Style and brought in new
categories of advertising, said Roberta Garfinkle, the director of
print media at McCann-Erickson, a unit of Interpublic Group of Cos.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to build your business, you're going to have
go beyond the traditional advertisers in fashion and bring in new
ones,'' Ms. Garfinkle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is fashion the staple it used to be? I don't know. They're
looking at automotive, at consumer electronics. If Harper's Bazaar
becomes more mainstream, does it make them a better candidate for
different kinds of advertising, more mass-market kinds of
advertising? Or does it stay where it is, stay focused on the creme
de la creme, the high-end couture, and limit themselves? That's a
business decision that Cathie Black has to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Elle, which is published by Hachette-Filipacchi Magazines, is
taking a particularly aggressive _ and increasingly common _
approach: It is starting a magazine to bring new and less frequent
advertisers into the fold.
</P>
<P>
   This November, Elle will arrive in subscribers' mailboxes
bundled with a new publication, Elle's Ultimate Road Trip, a
luxury-travel magazine that is being planned as a quarterly.
Intended to attract advertisers in categories like luxury goods,
culinary, hotels, automotive and high technology, Elle's Ultimate
Road Trip has already signed up Gucci, Cartier and Chopard, the
watch manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's mission, said Elaina Richardson, the editor in
chief of Elle, is to present women with what she called ``a
lifestyle approach'' to fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about lifestyle, and a sense of the good life, and this
is what fashion is about now,'' she said. ``I think we spend as
much time now thinking about the thread count of our sheets as the
ply of our cashmere. Fashion to women now is what's going on in
clothes, but also what company or designer is making furniture,
what designer is involved in a hotel. The world of fashion is
connected to travel and resorts and furnishings, and it's a much
bigger universe than it once was.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the categories that have grown most energetically in the
pages of magazines this year, according to figures released this
month by the Publishers Information Bureau, are technology, up 15
percent in advertising pages, home furnishings and supplies, up 14
percent, and travel, up 13 percent. Apparel has remained flat at
1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers, in the meantime, wait to see who will take the helm
at Harper's Bazaar and how that person will shape the magazine. For
much of its 132-year history, Harper's Bazaar has been strictly
devoted to fashion, but in the last two years it has had more
articles on other topics.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Vogue tends to be more celebrity-oriented: While Harper's Bazaar
recently featured an article about houses designed by the architect
Richard Neutra in Los Angeles, Vogue ran a spread on Oscar de la
Renta's vacation hacienda.
</P>
<P>
   W, too, covers the high-living celebrity life, as well as
highlighting its avant-garde photography (a recent spread showed a
macho-looking Brad Pitt holding a furry rabbit) and dozens of pages
of society news at the front of the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Elle maintains the most middlebrow approach, featuring
color-splashed fashion spreads and a particularly bawdy advice
columnist.
</P>
<P>
   But the success of lifestyle magazines points to a serious
issue: Do American women want to read fashion magazines? Nancy
Etcoff, a psychologist at the Harvard Medical School and the author
of ``Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty''
(Doubleday), said that American women may have grown
fashion-fatigued.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fashion magazines are about fulfilling fantasy, and they
are an art form _ they are theatrical,'' she said. ``We will always
have a longing for that kind of beauty and theatricality, but I
think right now, fashion magazines no longer present the most
popular images, and part of the problem was that there was such a
focus on the supermodel as an object and less a focus on
personality. Perhaps they need to rethink their approach to women
as more rounded personalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Richardson of Elle said: ``A friend of mine used to tell me
that 10, 15 years ago, she used to sit at the beach at the end of
the summer and she and her friends would flip through the September
magazines and do their fall clothes shopping. Now what woman has
time to do that? She's faxing her office, or taking care of the
kids. I don't know if she has that time or inclination anymore. I
don't know if women even have time to sit on the beach.''

THIS WEEK'S TV HIGHLIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
TODAY: If they put their minds to it, maybe the Spurs and Knicks
can break the record this time for lowest-scoring NBA Finals game.
It'd be a perfect footnote for the worst season in league history.
NBA Finals Game 3: San Antonio at New York, Channel 4, 6 p.m. (NBC
also has Game 4 Wednesday at 6 p.m. and, if absolutely necessary,
Game 5 Friday at 6 p.m. with Game 6 Sunday in San Antonio at 4:30
p.m.) 
TUESDAY: The WNBA-champion Houston Comets (4-0) are the last
unbeaten team in the league and should stay that way after a visit
by the road-weary Sparks. Just in case you were curious about that
sort of thing. WNBA: Sparks at Houston, ESPN, 5 p.m. 
WEDNESDAY: Don't worry, we haven't overlooked Wimbledon. It's Day
3, and by this time Andre Agassi's opening-round match against
Andrei Pavel should already have been put to bed. So now that
Agassi is the fourth seed and coming off the French Open stunner,
there'll be no surprise if the '92 Wimbledon champ charges through
this one. Except he's not 100 percent healthy and isn't the kind of
guy you can rely on, is he? ``Andre is the reverse Houdini _ he
appears when you don't expect it,'' said Martina Navratilova,
who'll be doing commentary for HBO. And what'll it be like this
time without Brooke getting overly emotional in the stands?
Martina's pick for the men's title is Patrick Rafter, who ``has the
perfect game for grass.'' On the women's side, HBO commentator Mary
Carillo says ``It's Steffi Graf's Wimbledon to win this year.''
Just as long as we don't have to see Martina Hingis in the crying
game again. Wimbledon, HBO, 6 a.m. to noon, live each weekday;
NBC's coverage Saturday (10 a.m. to 1 p.m.) and Sunday (11 a.m. to
3 p.m.) is tape delayed. 
THURSDAY: So on what channel do we get the female equivalent of
Andres Cantor? FIFA Women's World Cup: U.S. vs. Nigeria in Chicago,
ESPN, 5:30 p.m. (ESPN also has Sunday's U.S. game against Korea
from Foxboro, Mass., at 4 p.m.) 
FRIDAY: The Dodgers need to win this one to establish they're still
in the NL West race. Dodgers at San Francisco, Channel 5, 7:35
p.m. 
SATURDAY: The Dodgers need to win this one to strengthen their
national image. Dodgers at San Francisco, Channel 11, 1:05 p.m. 
SUNDAY: The Dodgers need to win this one 'cause it's against the
freakin' Giants, for cryin' out loud. Who needs another reason?
Dodgers at San Francisco, ESPN, 5:05 p.m.

COMMENTARY: LOTTERIES ARE LOSERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Somebody's going to win the lottery,'' reads an
ad from a public-spirited corporation, ``Just not you.''
</P>
<P>
   That's right. If any class of gamblers qualifies as
super-suckers, it's the pack of dreamers who believe what their
state governments tell them about a pot of gold at the end of the
numbers rainbow.
</P>
<P>
   Media that benefit from state lottery advertising hype the one
winner (not you) in a million. They ignore the bad news of all the
others who blow the bread money, or feed their compulsive-gambling
habit, on the worst odds of any betting in America.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the immoralists of New Hampshire introduced a state
lottery in 1964, followed quickly by New York in 1966,
pusillanimous politicians have been ripping off their constituents
with this ``painless taxation.'' Now 37 states are imitating the
banana republics.
</P>
<P>
   The profits go to education, the gambling governors claim, as
they substitute lottery money for other state education aid in a
classic bait-and-switch. It's the only tax increase that
conservatives support _ from zero to $43 billion in one generation
_ and is the only regressive tax embraced by liberals.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan National Gambling Impact Study Commission has
issued its report. At the start, members fought over whether to
call gambling ``gaming,'' but in the end, agreement on more
important matters was found: 15 million Americans are ``problem
gamblers.'' The Internet is hooking teen-agers on games of chance.
``Convenience gambling'' with video poker terminals everywhere is a
training ground for lifelong gambling. (Even the kid in the new
``Star Wars'' is taught to gamble.)
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of feckless harangues in this column, I have
accepted reality: At least half the population enjoys betting. So
if you want to feed quarters for hours on end to one-armed bandits
in Las Vegas, or go broke on jackpot.com, that's your business.
</P>
<P>
   But when the state becomes croupier, that's everybody's
business.
</P>
<P>
   The most telling part of the wake-up call is the criticism of
lotteries. They are ``the most widespread form of gambling in the
United States.'' State governments have ``irresponsibly intruded
gambling into society on a massive scale,'' says the commission
report, ``through such measures as incessant advertising and the
ubiquitous placement of lottery machines in neighborhood stores.''
</P>
<P>
   And they're a lousy bet. ``Lotteries bring out the worst in
politicians,'' noted Richard Leone, commissioner from New Jersey.
``They are heavily and misleadingly advertised; they pay back to
bettors the smallest share of the take of any legal game ... yet
lotteries have proven to be catnip for elected officials who fear
taxation.''
</P>
<P>
   Where does any state come off urging its citizens to spend their
hard-earned income or welfare checks unwisely? Who is your governor
to tell you to ignore your economic self-interest and take a little
flyer with him or her? Government is not a game, nor should it be a
casino empowered to declare itself a monopoly so it can make a
profit by stimulating public avarice.
</P>
<P>
   State lotteries should reduce their sales dependence on
low-income, less educated gamblers, the commission recommends, and
limit advertising and sales outlets in poor neighborhoods. But
that's precisely where the most business is. And because states
advertise their lotteries, the Supreme Court strikes down state
restrictions on advertising any gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Thus does the lottery tail now wag the public-policy dog. To
make a bigger profit, state-sponsored gambling must sell harder to
the poor and the addicted. Your state legislator is facing the same
moral conflict as the seller of tobacco and hard liquor and violent
movies: trying to make what's bad for you look good to you. The
difference is that the state does not permit competition in its own
numbers racket.
</P>
<P>
   The state belongs in the business of protecting and educating
the public, not in the profitable dodge of bilking the public.
Residents of Nevada have their law legalizing prostitution, but do
not expect their state to run monopoly brothels advertised on local
television with a small portion of the profit supposedly going to
sex education.
</P>
<P>
   OK, all you family-values, faith-based types running for
president and governor and whatnot. Where do you stand on
state-sponsored gambling? How about a national lottery guessing the
number of eligible voters not casting their ballots because they're
turned off by political hypocrisy?

EXCLUSIVE: INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE REPORT WON'T LINK BREAST IMPLANTS
TO DISEASES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   An independent panel of 13 scientists convened by the Institute
of Medicine at the request of Congress has concluded that silicone
breast implants do not cause any major diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some women with breast implants are indeed very ill and the
IOM committee is very sympathetic to their distress,'' the group
wrote in a report to be made public on Tuesday. ``However, it can
find no evidence that these women are ill because of their
implants.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, more than 400 pages long, says that the ``primary
safety issue'' with implants is their tendency to rupture or
deflate and to lead to infections or hardening or scarring of the
breast tissue. There is little argument about these localized
problems, which can be painful and disfiguring and which often lead
women to have additional surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But the report asserts in forceful terms that there is no reason
to believe that the implants cause rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or
any other systemic disease. Women who say their implants have
caused them to suffer these or related problems have turned breast
implants into a leading source of liability litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The report was provided to The New York Times by an organization
that consults in the breast implant matter and, a spokesman said,
that ``is pleased with the report's conclusions.'' The report is
the latest in a series of evaluations that have concluded there is
no scientific evidence to support the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Because it comes from the Institute of Medicine, the medical arm
of the National Academy of Sciences, the nation's most prestigious
scientific organization, it is expected to be influential in
setting scientific agendas and encouraging women to accept
settlements from implant makers rather than take their cases to
court.
</P>
<P>
   In preparing the report, panel members held public hearings, met
in private and evaluated more than a thousand research reports. The
Institute panel did not conduct any original research. Rather, the
panel relied primarily on research reported by other scientists.
But the report said that since lawsuits were first filed in the
late 1980s and early 1990s, there have been many scientific studies
upon which to make an evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, scientists appointed by the judge overseeing
implant liability litigation, Sam C. Pointer Jr., of U.S. District
Court in Alabama, came to a similar conclusion as the Institute
panel and a report issued last July by scientists in Britain who
had been charged by the British minister of health to review
implant safety.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists appointed by Judge Robert E. Jones of U.S. District
Court in Oregon, reached a comparable conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Dow Corning Corp., which filed for bankruptcy
citing the burden of its breast implant litigation, has agreed to
pay women $3.2 billion to settle their claims. Other implant
manufacturers, Baxter International, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and
Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, have agreed to a settlement
estimated at $3 billion combined.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, thousands of women have settled their cases in
private agreements with implant makers or gone to trial and won
awards that reached millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Medicine committee estimated that about 1.5
million to 1.8 million American women have had silicone breast
implants, about 70 percent for breast enlargement, the rest as
reconstruction after mastectomy.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the committee, headed by Dr. Stuart Bondurant, a
professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill, and Dr. Virginia Ernster, a professor of epidemiology at the
University of California in San Francisco, were prohibited from
discussing the report until it is officially made public.
</P>
<P>
   Sybil Goldrich, founder of Command Trust Network, an information
clearing house for women with silicone problems, said, ``I find it
extremely difficult to accept what the Institute of Medicine says
because those studies are paid for by the manufacturers. They have
not convinced me that their review is correct. It is as simple as
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Jacks, a lawyer in Austin, Tex., whose firm has
represented 425 women with implants, said he doubts that the report
will be the last word on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report is simply a review of the literature by a
committee that's reached some conclusion,'' Jacks said. ``It is
premature to conclude that reports like this are the last word that
scientists and physicians will have about the safety of breast
implants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But medical experts informed of the committee's conclusions,
applauded them.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Shaun Ruddy, the chairman of the rheumatology, allergy, and
immunology division at the School of Medicine at Virginia
Commonwealth University in Richmond, said that the conclusions were
``very forthright and outspoken'' and that he was glad the group
was attempting to put the disease hypotheses to rest. Ruddy, a past
president of the American College of Rheumatology, said he has had
no part in any of the litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Medicine committee was set up at the behest of
Congress. It's work began with a public hearing on July 24, 1997,
when almost 700 people filled an auditorium at the National Academy
of Sciences in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of medical professional associations made
statements, scientists spoke about their research, and women with
implants spoke of how their lives had been ruined by them. Some
said that they were so ill that they needed canes or wheelchairs to
get around, conditions they blamed on the implants. Others
testified that after they breast fed their babies, their children
developed the same debilitating symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Examining more than 1,200 references, the group addressed the
major questions about implants: Do they cause established
connective tissue diseases, like arthritis or lupus? Do they cause
breast cancer, nerve diseases, like multiple sclerosis, or new
diseases with symptoms like aches and pains and overwhelming
fatigue? Are children of women with breast implants at risk for
disease because of silicone transmitted across the placenta or in
breast milk? Do breast implants produce immunological reactions
that could cause disease?
</P>
<P>
   In every case, the committee concluded, there was no convincing
evidence that implants were at fault. When lawsuits were filed in
the late 1980s and early 1990s there was a lack of research on the
topic. Since then, according to the report, ``a number of strong,
well-designed epidemiological studies involving large numbers of
women and clear results have been published.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For example, the group wrote, the evidence is ``insufficient or
flawed.'' that implants cause ``atypical disease,'' a term covering
signs and symptoms like weakness, fatigue, and diffuse muscle pain.
But the group said that evidence on the other side is strong.
``Controlled epidemiologic studies cited'' led the committee to
conclude that ``there is no novel syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   On the question of established connective tissue diseases, like
lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, the group reviewed 17
epidemiological studies and concluded that they were ``remarkable
for the consistency of finding no elevated risk or odds for an
association of implants with disease.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing a description of the report, David Bernstein, a
law professor and adviser for the American Tort Reform Foundation,
a business-sponsored group, said that, coming as it does in the
wake of similar reports, the report ``might have a dramatic effect
in hastening the end of the litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very strong statement,'' Bernstein said. But he added
that it was a shame that the legal system went ahead on the
litigation in the absence of science, with companies paying
billions to compensate women with implants. ``It would have been
nice to have had this $6 billion ago,'' Bernstein said.

EDITORIAL: GET THE LEAD DUST OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, June 21:
</P>
<P>
   Millions of gallons of lead paint brightened the nation's walls
before lead was banned from paint almost 20 years ago nationally
and almost 40 years ago in New York City. The bans were part of a
national effort to end lead poisoning in children who ingest the
dust when the old paint crumbles and a sticky leaden residue
settles onto whatever is underneath. Even in small amounts, lead
can cause permanent brain damage in younger children. Under a court
order to enforce or revise the city's lead abatement law by June
30, the New York City Council needs to address the issue of lead
dust in housing as a continuing health hazard for young children.
</P>
<P>
   As the council moves into this contentious territory with its
first hearing scheduled today, the prime concern must be to protect
children under age 6, who can be damaged for life by high lead
levels in their blood. That does not mean that all lead paint must
be removed from apartments housing young children. Experts have
come to agree that it is often safer to inspect, repair and clean
the area rather than scrape and sand it all away, creating even
more dust. But the decision on what action to take must be made on
health grounds, with cost an important, but secondary,
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   City Council Speaker Peter Vallone is sponsoring a revised bill
that bends too far toward freeing landlords of any real liability
for lead hazards. The bill puts the burden on the tenant to make
certain the landlord is aware of young children and any lead
hazards in buildings constructed before 1960. In such a critical
health matter, the burden should be on the landlords to demonstrate
the safety of their premises.
</P>
<P>
   The council should be sure to investigate less expensive ways to
keep apartments lead-safe, so as to keep housing affordable to the
poor, and it should explore how to test apartment surfaces for lead
dust after work is done. The council also ought to hear from
experts about newer methods for getting rid of lead hazards. With
so much to digest, it may make sense to ask the courts to give the
city until October to argue through these complicated issues.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to keep lead from children in this country has been
one of the great success stories in public health. Even so, every
year more than 1,000 additional children are documented with lead
poisoning in some of the poorest areas of New York City. They all
deserve a home safe from lead dust.  &QL;

Wenatchee children the state insists were sexually abused in the
mid-1990s, has won the right to sue authorities for allegedly

AFTER ESCAPING FROM RODEO, BULL IS SHOT DEAD IN QUEENS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A raging bull escaped from an illegal rodeo being
held in a Queens parking lot Sunday morning and charged through the
streets before four police officers shot it dead in the parking lot
of a housing project.
</P>
<P>
   Frightened tenants at the project, the Ravenswood Houses, awoke
to screams and looked out their windows as a scene right out of
Pamplona unfolded on the streets below.
</P>
<P>
   One tenant, Cassandra Daniel, 30, was walking her three children
to church. ``All of a sudden, I hear gunshots and I see a bull
running down 36th Avenue,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   After shepherding her children into the building for safety, she
said, she watched as the pursuing police officers surrounded the
bull and opened fire. ``They kept shooting at the bull and it
wouldn't die,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the bull fell next to a gray sedan in a pool of
blood.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said that the 1,700-pound bull had escaped from
a traveling Mexican rodeo that was to have been held in the parking
lot of a club in the Long Island City section of Queens, near the
entrance to the Queensboro Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Its organizers _ who advertised in bodegas to attract Mexican
immigrants and others _ were given three summonses for having wild
animals without the proper permits, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand people gathered in the club's parking lot last
month for a similar rodeo that featured bull riding, music and
food. But Police Capt. William D'Amora said that the club's
landlord, whom he did not name, grew upset when he learned that he
had rented his space to a traveling rodeo without the proper
permits.
</P>
<P>
   The landlord called the police Sunday and asked them to shut the
rodeo down, he said. As officers looked on and rodeo hands pulled
up stakes and loaded the bulls onto a trailer, he said, one
escaped.
</P>
<P>
   The bull, named Roughrider, bounded through the streets with
police cars in pursuit. Along the way he charged at several people,
but no one was hurt, said Officer Valerie St. Rose, a department
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   When the bull reached the parking lot at the Ravenswood Houses _
roughly three quarters of a mile from its starting point _ the
officers tried to corral it.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing pandemonium severely disrupted the Sunday morning
routine.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Davis, 50, heard the gunshots shortly after 10 a.m. ``I
went to the window and I thought I saw a horse running down the
street,'' she said. ``Then all of a sudden I noticed it had horns.
I said to my family, `Honey, that's a bull.' I told my son to run
out with his video camera.''
</P>
<P>
   He sold his tape to the local television news, she said proudly.

DEPARDIEU REVELS IN REVENGE AND DERRING-DO AS THE COUNT OF MONTE
CRISTO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first of the many disguises adopted by the hero of ``The
Count of Monte Cristo,'' Edmond Dantes pretends to be a corpse.
Unjustly imprisoned for 20 years, Dantes sees a chance to escape by
changing places with a kindly old priest who has died. When one of
the guards hauling the body in a sack says, ``He's very heavy for
an old man who was just skin and bones,'' we know why. Dantes is
played by Gerard Depardieu, whose larger-than-life presence is just
right for this enjoyably fluffy extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the 1844 novel by Alexandre Dumas pere, this
French-Italian-American costume drama never takes itself too
seriously as it tells the story of the wronged Dantes who, after
his escape, discovers a fortune in a treasure chest and uses it to
get revenge on his betrayers. But the mini-series never winks at
the audience either.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Count of Monte Cristo'' indulges its straightforward,
old-fashioned spirit. Loaded with action and as many coincidences
as can be crammed into its eight hours (including commercials),
this is the kind of film in which capes are always flying as men
dash off on horseback. There are poison potions and nick-of-time
antidotes, thwarted romances and duels, murders, a guillotining and
even a sultan's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Playing over four nights on Bravo, in French with English with
subtitles, ``The Count'' is a major investment of time, not to
mention eyesight. But it is a treat for anyone inclined to sink
into a world of sumptuous settings and tangled, overwrought plots
(though it may not be energetic enough to grab anyone who is not
predisposed to such over-the-top entertainments).
</P>
<P>
   Dantes devises ingenious strategies to destroy his enemies, but
he was not always so clever. While still in prison, at the start of
Episode I, he recalls in flashback how he came to be there. As a
young sailor he naively carried a letter from Elba that plotted
Napoleon's escape from the island.
</P>
<P>
   In prison he picks up valuable knowledge. Abbe Faria, the priest
whose death helps him escape, has directed Dantes to the island of
Monte Cristo and the treasure chest brimming with jewels. When
Dantes lets huge emeralds and diamonds flow through his hands like
sand, it is a stereotypical but satisfying image.
</P>
<P>
   Soon he is in Marseilles and Paris, and the series becomes more
than a costume drama; it is now a costume-upon-costume drama.
Adopting a fictional identity to suit his immense fortune, Dantes
calls himself the count of Monte Cristo and begins seeking his
revenge. This allows Depardieu to appear in a series of conspicuous
wigs and alarming noses, with the count masquerading as a priest,
Abbe Busconi and an English banker, Lord Wilmore.
</P>
<P>
   In all his escapades he is aided by his Italian servant and
right-hand man, Bertuccio, an indispensable Sancho Panza figure
played with flair by Sergio Rubini. (Look closely and you'll see
that the Italian actors' mouths do not always match the French they
are speaking.) The count is especially intent on destroying
Villefort, the judge who sent him to prison, and the Count de
Morcerf, a onetime friend who sent an anonymous letter betraying
him. Morcerf is now married to Dantes' former fiancee, the
beautiful Mercedes (Ornella Muti). When she meets the count,
Mercedes looks into his eyes and drops her tea cup on her valuable
carpet, without letting on whether she has actually recognized her
one true love or not.
</P>
<P>
   In a bit of stunt casting in Episode I, the younger versions of
these characters are played by Depardieu's son, Guillaume
Depardieu, and Ms. Muti's daughter, Naike Rivelli. In a more
substantial role, Depardieu's daughter, Julie Depardieu, gracefully
plays Villefort's sweet-natured daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Depardieu has played many costumed heros in his career,
sometimes overdoing the swagger. Here he is at his restrained best.
The count glowers at his enemies and looks believably confused and
touched in his scenes with Mercedes and her grown son. But most of
the time he is simply racing around 19th-century France, followed
by Bertuccio and some turbaned servants he has picked up on a trip
to the Far East.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Count of Monte Cristo'' is not rich in psychological
insight, but it does suggest that bribery and deviousness will get
you everywhere. Though the count learns to forgive at the end, that
tacked-on lesson is less convincing than his gleefully vengeful
escapades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think I like being the Count of Monte Cristo?'' he asks
Bertuccio. ``He is terrifying, ruthless and cold. I didn't want to
become that man.''
</P>
<P>
   But a more truthful statement has come from Bertuccio after one
of their early adventures: ``You had fun, didn't you?''

SAMPRAS AND GRAF SEEK GRANDEUR AT WIMBLEDON 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ The wrought-iron gates are polished, the
bloom is on the roses twining through the courtside trellises and
the grass will never be greener. The last Wimbledon of the 20th
century is open for business, and the mood is a combination of
elegiac and electric.
</P>
<P>
   Some players are making an imprint here for the first time, and
some, like Boris Becker, for the last, but they are united in their
prayers for sustained sunshine and in their awe of the event that
treats them all like royalty and offers the best of them the chance
to rule their sport's most cherished castle, Center Court, in two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you took a census of all the players, I think Wimbledon is
the greatest tournament to win,'' said Andre Agassi, the
fourth-seeded player, whose recent French Open championship put his
name again in the history books, this time as the first man since
Rod Laver to win all four Grand Slam tournaments and the only man
to win his Grand Slams on three different surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   While grass is a surface that used to bemuse Agassi, the Las
Vegan became enamored of Wimbledon in 1992 when he won his first
major here. Since then, he has been a convert, and this year he is
eager to improve on recent poor play here: a first-round loss in
1996, an injury no-show in 1997 and a second-round exit last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes Wimbledon so enjoyable is not necessarily the
quality of the play,'' said the 29-year-old Agassi, who contends
that grass offers all the reliability of a banana peel underfoot,
``but what you're witnessing. You're part of a sporting event. It's
quite awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, there is history to be made here, and as usual, Pete
Sampras, Wimbledon's defending champion and its titleholder for
five of the past six years, is the man poised to make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My form is there, my rhythm is there and my confidence is
back,'' said Sampras, whose game and attitude seem to respond to
Wimbledon the way a patch of parched turf responds to a dose of
fertilizer and water.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras expressed little apprehension about Scott Draper, his
opponent when he inaugurates Center Court on Monday. ``I raise the
bar whenever I come here. Knowing you've won before _ done it five
times _ gives you a good feeling about being able to go out and do
it again. For me at Wimbledon, it's all about expectation, not
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   The top-ranked Sampras, who won the Queen's grass title nine
days ago in London, is seeking his third consecutive Wimbledon
victory and sixth overall, a coup that would make him the first man
in 110 years to rule these lawns with such prolonged authority.
Should he succeed, Sampras, who is 39-1 over the last six seasons
here, will break his second-place tie with Bjorn Borg and Laver and
share Roy Emerson's record of 12 Grand Slam championships.
</P>
<P>
   Just as fond of this place, and as decorated by it, is Steffi
Graf. She tiptoes across the grounds of the All England Club like a
prima ballerina and is one of the few women players refusing to
berate this Grand Slam for paying the women $1.2 million less in
prize money than the men. Now she will try to insure that her
campaign for an eighth Wimbledon title is not anticlimactic to her
sixth French Open title, which she won two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still ``drunk with success'' after capturing her 22rd Grand Slam
championship at Roland Garros, a milestone she gilded by announcing
her retirement from that Grand Slam, the second-seeded Graf said
she isn't sure whether a title here would inspire a similar
declaration.

<P>
   At 30, Graf's body continues to be as fine-tuned as a Ferrari,
but beneath the sleek facade there is a chronically sore spine that
continues to test her pain threshold. Since Graf does not emulate
Sampras' reverence for records, the fact that she is just two Grand
Slam victories short of tying Margaret Court's record is not a
motivating force for continuing _ or quitting _ tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I win, I'm not ruling out anything,'' Graf said on Saturday
as she roamed the hallways beneath Center Court after her final
full-scale practice session for Monday's opener against Slovakia's
Ludmilla Cervanova, the 99th-ranked player. Graf used the French
Open as her practice session for Wimbledon and came away with a
title she thought she was far too tired to win. Here her
expectations, and her energy level, are higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because I won in Paris doesn't mean I'll win here, too,
but I feel more confident without a doubt,'' said Graf, who, just
in case this is her last Wimbledon, has coaxed John McEnroe back
onto a mixed doubles court for the first time in 20 years. ``I'm in
it now for the special moments, not planning that this or that may
be my last match, but just letting things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   One player with big plans for Wimbledon is top-ranked Martina
Hingis, who disgraced herself with her teen-age temper tantrum
during the French Open final against Graf.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly penitent, but aware that her behavior _ which Graf
characterized as unconscionable for any player, champion or not _
has burned some bridges between her and her public, Hingis
predicted a more businesslike approach to Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you will see a different Martina at Wimbledon, a
happier Martina,'' said Hingis, who won here in 1997. Hingis opens
against 16-year-old Elena Dokic, the Australian qualifier whose
father, Damir, was ejected nearly two weeks ago from an event at
Birmingham, England, for drunken and disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   In other notable opening-day encounters, sixth-seeded Venus
Williams, whose 10th-seeded sister, Serena, withdrew because of the
flu, takes on fifth-ranked Miriam Oremans, and 17th-ranked Anna
Kournikova tackles Barbara Schwartz, the Austrian qualifier who
upset Venus Williams at Roland Garros.

NEW YORK CITY BALLET THERAPIST MAKES MO BETTER
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mo Vaughn in a tutu?
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. But the Anaheim Angels' burly designated hitter
could be back at first base Friday when the Angels open a six-game
homestand, thanks to the New York City Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, hobbled by a badly sprained left ankle since the first
game of the season, visited the ballet's physical therapist Friday
for a rigorous session that broke down scar tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been doing it three times a day since we've been here
and it has made all the difference,'' Vaughn said after Sunday's
4-2 victory over the Yankees. ``I mean it was serious. I was in
there sweating. Rotating the foot, really stretching it out. And it
worked. It feels great. I'm getting back as soon as I can. I've had
enough of this DH stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn played first base for three games in Dodger Stadium,
where there was no DH, and will work out in the field today before
the Angels' exhibition game against the club's Double-A team in
Erie, Penn. But he will remain the DH during the upcoming
three-game series in Seattle, which will be played on artificial
turf.
</P>
<P>
   Goin' deep: Matt Luke, the former Dodger called up six days ago,
hit a two-run homer in his first start (LF) with the Angels. It was
an added bonus that it came against the Yankees, the team that
drafted him in 1992. ``I feel great to have made a contribution in
a big win, but it feels especially good to happen here,'' he said.
``You see guys you played with and it is good to get their respect.
I plan on sticking around here and having a long career.''
</P>
<P>
   Luke spent five days with the Yankees in 1996, scoring as a
pinch runner but never batting in the big leagues until he joined
the Dodgers last year. He hit 12 home runs but was not re-signed,
joining the Angels as a non-roster invitee to spring training. Luke
started the season on the disabled list with an inflamed left rib
cage before hitting .421 (9 for 21) in six games with Triple-A
Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Goin' deeper: Third baseman Troy Glaus seemed to have put an
awful May behind him when he was named American League Player of
the Week on June 6 after batting .550 (11 for 20) with three homers
and six RBI.
</P>
<P>
   But since then Glaus has stumbled badly; no game has been worse
than Sunday's, when he struck out twice and hit into two double
plays. Since his streak ended, Glaus is 7 for 32 and 4 for 22 on
the trip. He went 1 for 12 against the Yankees and was hitless in
his last nine at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today all he was taking was home run swings,'' hitting
instructor Rod Carew said. ``There was no discipline. He has to get
back to just wanting to make contact on a consistent basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: When Tino Martinez shattered his bat popping out to
open the seventh, it struck on-deck hitter Paul O'Neill in the left
leg. O'Neill was on the ground for several minutes before coming to
the plate and singling to right. The next batter, Chili Davis, also
broke his bat and the barrel nearly struck O'Neill as he ran to
second.... To start the ninth inning the Angels went with Troy
Percival, who hadn't pitched in a week, and catcher Steve Decker,
who was making just his second start behind the plate.

<P>
   VELIKA KRUSA, Yugoslavia _ Dressed in masks and white coveralls,
forensics experts with the international war-crimes tribunal are
collecting evidence in a house here where the bodies of perhaps
three dozen Kosovo Albanians lay in charred heaps.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first site to be investigated among the seven
believed to be sites of massacres cited in the war-crimes
indictment against President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia and
other top Yugoslav leaders. John Bunn, head of the British forensic
team here from Scotland Yard, called the site ``a high priority.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people there who died pretty horrible deaths,'' he
said, standing down the road from the site, a one-floor farmhouse
blocked off from view by plastic crime-scene tape, tanks and German
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   There are perhaps hundreds of places across Kosovo where
Albanians were apparently massacred by Serbs over the last two
months, and new mass grave sites and bodies are being discovered
virtually every day.
</P>
<P>
   War-crimes investigators have frankly conceded that they cannot
look into all of them and will concentrate on the sites with the
greatest number of dead and those listed in the indictment. ``If we
went to every site we wouldn't have enough soldiers'' to guard
them, said Bunn, a detective chief superintendent at Scotland Yard.
</P>
<P>
   That presents the risk that there will be enough interference
with some sites that they will be useless for evidence for any
war-crimes trial. At the village of Meja, north of here, where
witnesses have said 100 or more people were killed, six bodies
lying in the open have been moved around since last week, probably
by people looking for some sign of identification.
</P>
<P>
   Some Kosovo villagers are returning to their battered homes,
some littered with bodies, with a clear eye toward providing
evidence to the tribunal. On Sunday, villagers from Senovce
disinterred three bodies that they said had been buried in a
neighboring town by Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   They said that one of the victims, identified as Shaban
Krasniqi, a 54-year-old farmer, was tortured _ his ears cut off,
his right eye gouged out, teeth knocked from his lower jaw.
</P>
<P>
   Before they reburied him, along with one of the others, on a
slope with a broad view, his fellow villagers videotaped the
bodies. ``It will make it much easier for people, the tribunal, to
investigate,'' said Isuf Krasniqi, 45, the victim's cousin. ``That
is why we videotaped them.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the killings here in Velika Krusa _ Krush-e-Madhe to
the Albanians _ which took place on March 25, the day after NATO
began bombing Yugoslav targets, was also captured on videotape,
which is perhaps another reason why the killings are being
investigated early on. The tape, shot by a villager, shows the
bodies of at least 17 men.
</P>
<P>
   Audi Duraku, 41, a villager who said he was hiding down a gravel
road when the killings took place, said that Serb policemen brought
many people _ he did not know how many _ in a truck to the house
here on the afternoon of March 25. About 3:30 p.m., he said, nine
Serb paramilitary group members in uniforms went into the house. He
heard shooting outside in the back, then the house went up in
flames.
</P>
<P>
   After hiding for two hours, he said, he went to the house and
found two bodies beneath his tractor, which was parked near the
house. But he said he did not find blood outside where he heard the
shooting, leading him to believe that the Serbs fired into the air
and then burned the victims alive.
</P>
<P>
   His family fled to Albania, and he said he will probably not
live here anymore. ``There is no life here,'' he said. ``You can't
live in this village.''
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that the Serbs made several attempts to cover up
evidence of the killings.
</P>
<P>
   In Postoselo, the village next to Sanovce, Krasniqi said, Serbs
dug up 104 bodies, most of them old men who he said were killed on
March 31. On Sunday, Krasniqi, who said he helped bury the bodies
several days after the killings, stood on one of the empty graves,
which lay in two long rows now clumped with dug-up dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took these bodies away to wipe out any trace,'' he said.

POTENTIAL RIVAL REMAINS WARY OF MICROSOFT'S POWER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Stephen M. Case, chief executive of America
Online, contemplated making the biggest deal of his career _ the
purchase of Netscape Communications _ he stopped for a moment last
fall to ponder whether his company could finally afford to dump
Microsoft. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two years earlier, America Online executives were thinking they
had no choice but to use the Microsoft Corp.'s browser instead of
Netscape's as the default for their millions of customers.
Microsoft had made an offer they could not refuse _ a high-profile
spot on the Windows desktop.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But by last fall, America Online, the world's largest Internet
service provider, was a powerful force with 16 million members.
Soon it would actually own Netscape. So Case, in an e-mail to other
executives at his company, suggested, ``Maybe we can get
comfortable with putting our support behind Netscape so they really
have browser share momentum.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Specifically,'' he added, ``if we push share to Netscape, can
Microsoft really pull us out of Windows 98 (legally, as well as
would it be palatable given current antitrust attention).'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The response was swift. Less than 20 minutes later, Robert W.
Pittman, the company's president, replied: ``I do think Microsoft
is too strong to throw them out of the tent. They can hurt us if
they think they have no other option.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unquestionably, America Online is now an industry powerhouse.
But documents and testimony offered last week at Microsoft's
antitrust trial during an appearance of David M. Colburn, an
America Online senior vice president, disclosed that the company's
leaders still feel constrained, even threatened, by Microsoft _
chastened, perhaps, by Netscape's experience. When Microsoft made
Netscape an enemy, it used every resource to turn the rest of the
industry against the company. The campaign was remarkably
successful. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, as America Online prepares to branch out in new directions
under a campaign with the slogan ``AOL Anywhere,'' the documents
show that the company is still looking over its shoulder, wary of
stirring Microsoft's wrath. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of the documents were brought to the trial by Microsoft.
The company was trying to show that America Online had the
resources to become a serious challenger, undercutting the
government's contention that Microsoft holds an unstoppable
monopoly.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But many of the documents cut both ways, for they also showed
that with all its hard-won power, America Online repeatedly pulled
back from any new business venture that would upset Microsoft. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``To manage reality, we need to continue working with Microsoft
wherever we can,'' Kathy Bushkin, an America Online corporate
communications executive, wrote last November in an internal
document titled ``Microsoft Relationship.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The documents describe a plan to work with Sun to build a
personal computer that used no Microsoft software, thus ``breaking
the deadly embrace with Microsoft'' in the words of a Sun
executive. (On the stand, Colburn pointedly disavowed the ``deadly
embrace'' language, noting that Sun holds a special animosity
toward Microsoft.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But America Online's intention was different. While the company
was working with Sun on that project, ``we are also developing
Apollo for the desktop version NT,'' Ms. Bushkin wrote, using the
company's code name for itself. This, she explained, ``shows our
agnostic approach to operating systems.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, her memo, like others, noted that as America Online
ventured into other new businesses with Sun _ designing telephones
and television set-top boxes to run the online service _ the
company was also working on other versions ``for Windows CE, to
insure that Apollo TV and Apollo phone work on that platform as
well.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a note to Ms. Bushkin about a news release last November
announcing the Netscape deal, Case summarized America Online's
strategy this way: ``The logical way to go is to assure Microsoft
and investors that we will continue to be bundled with Windows and
continue to attempt detente.'' While making the Netscape deal, Case
said, America Online ought to give Microsoft ``a bearhug.''
</P>
<P>
   The investment bankers whom America Online hired to analyze the
acquisition and suggest future directions repeatedly urged moving
aggressively against Microsoft by using the Netscape browser.
``Extend the browser to be a more comprehensive desktop
application, bundling communications and productivity applications
to absorb more share of computing time, with the goal of becoming
the users' de facto environment,'' one analysis advised. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives predict that sooner or later, America
Online really will take them on. The online service is laying low
now, the company says, so as not to give Microsoft ammunition to
use in the antitrust trial. But in another memo, an America Online
executive noted that no one ever comes out ahead in a war with
Microsoft. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, as Pittman put it in his note to Case: ``I think we need to
stay in business with them, create a need for them to need us. And
then leave ourselves the flexibility to always accommodate them to
a certain extent.'' &QL;

FEW MANAGERS EXPECTING YEAR 2000 GLITCHES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the latest sign of growing confidence about the millennium
computer challenge, a poll last week of American corporate managers
involved in year 2000 projects found that 83 percent expect
calendar-related glitches to have little or no impact on their
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 42 percent of the nearly 900 managers polled said they
had become more confident in the past three months. That figure
compared with only 4.2 percent who said they had become more
pessimistic about the rollover to Jan. 1, 2000, when many computers
could have problems because they might not recognize that the
two-digit figure ``00'' represents the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted by CIO Magazine, a publication for chief
information officers, the Information Systems Audit and Control
Association and a year 2000 clearinghouse run by Edward Yardeni,
the chief economist of Deutsche Bank Securities. Yardeni and CIO's
editor, Gary Beach, are known in year 2000 circles for arguing that
risks are being underestimated and that too many people are not
prepared for disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   But the vast majority of those polled disagreed with Yardeni's
oft-cited warning that year 2000 disruptions are likely to lead to
a worldwide recession. Only 7.3 percent expect a recession, and
less than 1 percent expect a major depression. In fact, 9 percent
say the economic impact could end up being positive.
</P>
<P>
   The poll seemed to confirm that fear of lawsuits is preventing
some companies from being honest about their year 2000 readiness,
but the impact is not as worrisome as many year 2000 alarmists
imagine. Just 1.5 percent said they were in much worse shape than
their companies had disclosed publicly. By contrast, 26.4 percent
said they were better off than they were admitting.
</P>
<P>
   Yardeni warned that the poll results might have been skewed
toward a rosy outlook because companies with more than 1,000
employees accounted for 61 percent of the responses, and 26 percent
were from the financial sector. Large companies in general and
financial-sector businesses in particular have shown up repeatedly
in research to be further along in dealing with year 2000 problems
than business as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more cautionary findings: Only 8.4 percent of the
companies surveyed have actually completed their year 2000 work;
one in three is running behind schedule; about half expect at least
one ``mission critical'' failure, and more than one out of every
three projects are currently waiting for software vendors to
deliver critical programs.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also asked about personal plans. Almost 12 percent of
the managers see year 2000 as a ``nonevent'' and nearly 60 percent
are following government recommendations to prepare for short-term
disruptions of less than a week. Others expect anything from
problems lasting for weeks to a ``catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   Most said they would be working or on call on Jan. 1, although
25 percent said they would be free to stay home. But 1 percent told
the surveyors that they planned to stay home even though they had
been told they would be required to work.

<P>
   ALON SHVUT, West Bank _ Yuli Edelstein is probably the only
member of the Israeli Cabinet _ much less the only one in a
yarmulke _ whose father is a Russian Orthodox priest.
</P>
<P>
   He is probably the only Beatlemaniac in that august group, and
probably the only one who ever made a living as a nude model at an
art institute in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Few others would gleefully offer a biographical anecdote that
culminated with a crotchety old Russian sculptor barking: ``Get up
on that pedestal, young man! Now, this, class, is a god!''
</P>
<P>
   But Edelstein, 40, the immigration minister, is among a new
breed of politicians who represent a new generation of Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Younger and from a greater diversity of ethnic backgrounds, they
are less likely to be veterans of the great Israeli wars, lifelong
Zionists or even Jewish. Instead, their stories form the new
narrative strands of a country that is redefining itself.
</P>
<P>
   A former Soviet refusenik, Edelstein is No. 2 to Natan Sharansky
at the helm of Yisrael B'Aliya, the small but powerful Russian
immigrant party. Because Sharansky is an international figure and a
large personality on the Israeli political stage, Edelstein sits
somewhat in his shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cannot be No. 1,'' said Sharansky, the former Soviet
dissident, ``because he spent in prison only three years and I
spent nine.''
</P>
<P>
   But Edelstein's story is drama-filled, too, his ideology equally
complex and his trajectory here replete with promise. And
Edelstein, not Sharansky, has been the front-line representative
for the 1 million Russian immigrants, since his department provides
them with services.
</P>
<P>
   Like Sharansky, Edelstein is worldly and sophisticated and tilts
to the right on issues of peace with Israel's neighbors. Living
behind barbed wire in Alon Shvut, a Jewish settlement south of
Bethlehem, he is an unlikely settler, with a Volvo and a driver _ a
Cabinet minister's perquisite _ city-style black clothing and a
yearly subscription to the opera.
</P>
<P>
   Also like Sharansky, he is something of a disappointment to his
liberal supporters in Israel and among Jews in the Diaspora, who
expected such prize fighters for human rights to empathize more
profoundly with the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
   But Edelstein is loyal. First he is loyal to Alon Shvut, which
adopted him, running an international campaign to free him from an
eastern Siberian prison camp. And then he is bound to the notion of
the ``greater land of Israel'' _ that Jews have an unqualified
right to all of the land of their forefathers _ which inspired him
before he emigrated here.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987 in Moscow, shortly after his release from prison,
Edelstein, pale and gaunt, received a visit from two leftist
members of the Israeli Parliament eager to escort him to Israel.
Told that he intended to move to this settlement, one gasped and
one spat on the ground, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Edelstein _ with his wife, Tanya, an engineer, and son,
Elyasaf, 8 _ still lives in the modest building that he first
occupied here. His apartment has been renovated and expanded; the
marble counter tops, party bumper stickers and table-tennis
trophies (his) are new. But the cramped, scruffy low-rise is, if
anything, the worse for wear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't spend one single minute here if I didn't believe
Jews had a right to live here,'' Edelstein said. ``The problem is,
where do you draw the lines? I'm not of the school that says don't
give an inch. Because there is also a Palestinian population here
that is not exactly contented to be ruled.''
</P>
<P>
   Edelstein, who was sworn in three years ago as immigration
minister, is almost certain to stay in his post under Prime
Minister-elect Ehud Barak. He is roundly applauded for making the
ministry more immigrant-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He changed the mind-set from paternalistic and removed the
stigma from being a new immigrant,'' said Gideon Dubinsky, 44, a
Russian-language television producer.
</P>
<P>
   But whether he remains a Cabinet member _ giving his six-member
party two seats in the Cabinet _ has been a subject of fierce
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   During the negotiations, Edelstein, representing the party,
briefly walked away from the table because he felt that the
coalition platform was too negative toward settlers. That revived
questions in his party about whether he and Sharansky, close
friends, really represent Russian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Settlements are his political and life choice,'' Roman
Bronfman, a more liberal party member, said of Edelstein. ``But the
newcomers from the Soviet Union are so far from this issue. Most of
them are moderate and secular, and few live in the West Bank.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Edelstein grew up in Chernovtsy, a western Ukrainian city that
was called Czernowitz in an earlier era. His mother was Jewish, as
was his father's father. But his parents, who were both linguists,
considered themselves intellectuals first.
</P>
<P>
   His parents were sent to universities in the countryside to
teach, and Edelstein was raised by his maternal grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   His grandfather had taught himself Hebrew, at age 70, from a
tattered self-instruction manual, enough to listen to the Voice of
Israel on a short-wave radio. Edelstein was 17 when his grandfather
died and, feeling sad, he turned to the weathered Hebrew text. He
also started reading popular books like ``Exodus'' by Leon Uris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really felt suddenly that, yes, there is something to live
for and to die for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977 he asked for an exit visa from the Soviet Union. He was
refused, and his life as a Jewish dissident began. He joined a
small circle of Hebrew teachers who held class in their apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Religion came slowly. Edelstein says it was a journey similar to
that of his father, who looked to religion during the same period,
albeit a different religion. ``They used to tell my father, `You
failed because your son became a Jew,''' Edelstein said. ``He would
say, `I would be more afraid if my son was a big atheist.'''
</P>
<P>
   Expelled from college for political reasons, he and his friends
held odd jobs as street cleaners and security guards, each one
lasting only a few months before they were found out.
</P>
<P>
   The nude modeling was a godsend _ steady, well-paid work in a
clean, warm place. Because a famous sculptor had declared him ``a
god,'' Edelstein held on to that job even after the KGB ordered the
refuseniks dismissed. But before long, he said, he was set up on
drug charges and arrested.
</P>
<P>
   His prison years were rough. He saw fellow inmates die of
starvation. He traveled to the Mongolian border in a train
compartment meant to hold four but packed with 24. In a labor camp
in Siberia, he fell from a construction tower, crushing many of his
bones.
</P>
<P>
   He was the next to last of all the refuseniks to go free, but he
did so on the eve of Israeli Independence Day in 1987. Recounting
this, he ran into a back room of his apartment to fetch a shiny
blue uniform, the prison suit in which he had been set free.
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky, who had been freed first, led a welcoming party of
hundreds at the airport in Tel Aviv. Their partnership began;
Sharansky, 11 years older, would be the ideologue, and Edelstein
the practitioner, according to Sharansky.
</P>
<P>
   On the latest anniversary of his arrival, Edelstein's friends
gave him a big handmade card. ``He was a prisoner in Russia,'' it
said, ``and he became a capo in Israel.''

MYSTERY SHOPPERS - SLEUTHS FOR HIRE CHECK SERVICE OF RETAILERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN PHINNEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Heather Larson doesn't look like a mysterious woman
with a double life.
</P>
<P>
   At first encounter, she's middle-aged, soft-spoken, with minimal
makeup _ unobtrusive, unlikely to stand out in a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in sensible shoes, flowered dress and a cardigan
sweater, Larson is an accounts payable specialist with a suburban
school district in the Seattle area.
</P>
<P>
   But in her other life _ wearing a baseball cap, jeans and
sneakers _ she's a mystery shopper for hire.
</P>
<P>
   She'll spend her off-hours hanging around movie theaters or
hardware stores. Or she might take her car in for an oil change, or
put on a special dress to visit a top-rated restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Larson is a sleuth who shops retail stores, apartment houses,
banks and other providers of goods and services. Her undercover
work helps retailers determine how they rank in service, quality,
cleanliness and other key issues with customers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a job she's been doing since the '70s, when she was home
with two preschoolers and looking for part-time work. She answered
an ad and was hired as a mystery shopper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to eat in seven Jack in the Box restaurants every two
weeks. Sometimes we went to three in one night,'' Larson says.
After each meal she'd file a report. She did this for three years,
leaving her daughter with an addiction to Breakfast Jacks.
</P>
<P>
   When her children entered school, Larson branched out to car
washes, apartment rentals and banks. Now she works for about 20
different companies and checks Internet listings for other
interesting shopping jobs in this area.
</P>
<P>
   Larson says there's a great demand for mystery shoppers because
retail competition is fierce. With so many stores selling the same
merchandise at similar prices, only service and other side issues
differentiate them.
</P>
<P>
   Retail operators want to know how their customers are being
treated, and how their stores rate with consumers. Owners often
want to know what goes on when they're away. They rely on mystery
shoppers to tell them.
</P>
<P>
   It may sound interesting, even glamorous, but the life of a
mystery shopper can be boring and routine. ``It's good for extra
money, but I don't recommend it as a career change,'' Larson says.
</P>
<P>
   She describes an assignment in a megastore where she had to
interact with personnel in 17 different departments. She couldn't
find a salesperson in some of them, so she had to keep checking
back until she did.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the details that have to be remembered:
Background music, employee hygiene and appearance, number of loose
carts in a grocery store lot, etc. Each assignment and report has
different demands.
</P>
<P>
   Take a movie theater, for example, one of Larson's favorite
assignments.
</P>
<P>
   She has to arrive early and check the cleanliness of the parking
lot and the theater. She notes the ticket vendor's attitude and
makes certain she gets correct change when she buys her ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop is the concession stand to buy a snack and see if the
attendant is tending to business. Lobby and restroom are evaluated
for cleanliness. Larson then sits in the back of the theater so she
can count the house _ not always easy with patrons coming and
going. Finally, she evaluates quality of sound and picture.
</P>
<P>
   All this information has to be remembered for the written
report.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Larson decided mystery shoppers could use a
training class, because manuals and forms provided by employers
didn't prepare shoppers for the reality of the job.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote a proposal and sent it to community colleges in the
area. Renton Technical College and Highline Community College, both
south of Seattle, accepted. Now she teaches about 20 classes per
year.
</P>
<P>
   Students learn how to make detailed, factual reports and how to
interact with salespeople. ``I tell my classes to dress beige. They
don't want to be noticed,'' she says. That means no logos or
artwork on clothing that might make a mystery shopper memorable.
</P>
<P>
   Her classes are popular with retired people, business owners or
managers who want to know how mystery shopping works, and young
women in their 20s looking for part-time employment.
</P>
<P>
   She tells them how to avoid scams _ never pay to get a shopping
job _ and how to work the Internet to find them. Larson even gives
tips on keeping track of expenses for tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who calls herself Ann Rogers _ not her real name, she
wants to stay anonymous _ took Larson's class last September. She
got her first assignment in October and ``I've just bloomed from
there,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She likes mystery shopping so much that she's now spending 30 to
40 hours a week at the job. Rogers has checked out fast-food
franchises and spent hours dining in a top Seattle restaurant.
She's also spent 40 minutes in a small store waiting for a
salesperson to approach her _ something specified in her
assignment. The three women on duty ignored her.
</P>
<P>
   She makes $10 to $30 per assignment. When visiting a restaurant,
mystery shoppers are usually given a set amount to spend on dinner
for two, and sometimes told what to order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking the course is a great way to find out what's expected
of you and how to go about it,'' Rogers says. ``You always have a
choice of assignments, and you're never forced to take a shop you
don't want. But it is work.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Worthley owns The Genesis Group, a Bellevue-based firm
specializing in customer service surveys. ``I hate the term
`mystery shopping.' It denotes spying on people,'' Worthley says.
</P>
<P>
   Worthley was managing a retail clothing store in the 1970s when
corporate headquarters told him his store would be checked out
anonymously sometime during a two-week period.
</P>
<P>
   Worthley and his staff were at their best during that time,
greeting customers and providing top-quality service. Sales went up
and Worthley took note.
</P>
<P>
   He began learning more about mystery shoppers and what they
could do for companies. Today he has clients in 42 states and a
database of 9,000 shoppers he can deploy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every store you go into hires shoppers _ wineries, hospitals,
clinics, restaurants,'' Worthley says. ``Companies who hire us
really want to change the culture of their organization.''
</P>
<P>
   He says there are just three issues in business: The product or
service, the price and the level of service. ``That's why service
today is so much more serious,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   When Worthley founded Genesis in 1991, there were only about 150
other customer survey companies in the country. Today there are
about 700, complete with a professional association (Mystery
Shoppers Providers Association) to set standards.
</P>
<P>
   Worthley likes to hire people with some retail exposure, people
who have seen the best and worst of service, actors, people with
flexible schedules.
</P>
<P>
   He likes to introduce his program to company employees and
explain to them how mystery shoppers work so they will feel
involved, not threatened by them. He also encourages companies to
reward good service.
</P>
<P>
   Worthley sees surveys as a coaching tool to help companies
refocus their energies and teach sales skills and hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to catch people doing something right,'' he says.

NEW MOSCOW DRIVE-IN OFFERS CABBAGE AND PROMISES OF POPCORN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ It is true that the men behind the first and only
drive-in movie in Russia overlooked a few things, such as telling
the audience that films are best viewed with headlights off. Also,
popcorn. Somehow, a drive-in isn't quite the same munching on
cabbage pie.
</P>
<P>
   But those are nits. With a hastily built 56-by-30-foot screen
and a projection booth mounted on stilts, three Moscow
entrepreneurs staged a two-night dry run over the weekend of the
quintessentially American motion picture experience, and appeared
to have a hit on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, once the sun set _ that is, in this northern season of
bright summer solstice nights, at about 11:20 p.m. _ the Moscow
Kinodrome could well have been the Kenwood in Louisville or the
Moonlight in Pittsburgh instead of what it was: a deserted parking
lot, hard by an equally deserted velodrome built for the 1980
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing to have, just to relax,'' said 30-year-old
Igor Martinov as he stood by his red Nissan, downing beers and
smoking L&AMP;Ms. ``And if you have a good car with shaded windows,''
he grinned, ``it's a very good thing for young kids to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Drive-ins may be a dying breed in the United States, where their
number has shrunk to about 500 from 10 times that at the peak of
their popularity. But the story may well be different in Moscow, a
place desperately short of theaters and where the economics of
moviegoing is completely different.
</P>
<P>
   While most American drive-ins aim for the teen-age crowd or the
family seeking a cheap night out, the backers of the Kinodrome have
their sights on a slightly older, more upscale crowd. When it
reopens _ the theater is in hiatus after its two-night premiere _
it will cost 195 rubles per person, or $8, for a movie and a light
meal.
</P>
<P>
   While the Olympic complex has seen better days, the drive-in is
in one of the city's finer neighborhoods, a mile from President
Boris Yeltsin's city apartment and not far from clusters of luxury
high-rise apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Volkov, who came up with the idea after seeing
drive-ins in Hungary and Germany, said in an interview that the
backers decided to expand on one partner's successful experience
running 16 nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's based on the idea that in Moscow in the summertime, a
great number of people are living the night life,'' he said, ``and
secondly, that Moscovites love to watch films. We found that there
are a great number of people who haunt these clubs during the night
and prefer to sit not inside, but outside. They ask to move their
tables to the open.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the Kinodrome sports an outdoor cafe at the rear of the
parking lot, where filmgoers can buy apple, mushroom and cabbage
pies, fruit-stuffed pirozhki, or pastries, American soft drinks,
beer and _ soon _ vodka.
</P>
<P>
   The drive-in itself is a decidedly makeshift affair. The parking
lot, equipped with green gates to keep freeloaders out, holds only
150 cars and lacks a ticket booth. The screen is anything but
oversized, and the cramped projection room inexplicably flies a
skull-and-crossbones and is draped in camouflage netting.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the two water-cooled projectors were salvaged from the
defunct October Theater on Moscow's Novy Arbat, which is being
gutted and turned into a multiscreen cineplex. As there are no
water lines running to the lot, the projectionists' great fear _
unrealized, fortunately _ was that the evenings' feature films
would catch fire.
</P>
<P>
   Critics might have called that no great loss. Although the
Kinodrome promises the best in Russian and foreign film, the main
events Thursday and Friday were an American sci-fi potboiler,
``Virus,'' and one of the Mel Gibson vehicles, ``Lethal Weapon 4.''
</P>
<P>
   But the premiere audiences, lured by free tickets and the
novelty of it all, didn't seem to care. College girls and boys
strolled up and down the rows of obediently lined-up Audis,
Mustangs and other imported cars, looking for each other. In one
expensive-looking sport utility vehicle, Andrei Bezlepkin, his wife
and their two children said they were there strictly on a lark.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter Julia, 15, had seen three of the Lethal Weapon
films, but her dad was clueless. ``I think it's something like
Weapons Number Four,'' he said when asked about the night's
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   On the road by the theater, dozens more cars _ including one
police cruiser _ squeezed onto the gravel shoulder on Friday night
seeking their own free view. Still more people simply walked in and
squatted on the pavement, straining to catch the soundtrack
broadcast from the projection booth to car radios.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some glitches. At Thursday's first showing,
drivers in the front row had to be told to switch off their
headlights. Some who came on motorcycles or in cars without radios
were disappointed to find that they were watching a silent movie.
One walk-in, clearly there more for the beer than the movie, rose
in the middle of one presentation to demand that the sound be
turned up.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it a seamlessly American experience. For one thing, the
brief Russian summer nights mean that the first showing doesn't end
until close to 1 a.m., and the second finishes around first light.
The viewing season is also brief: the Kinodrome will close for the
winter in October, a projectionist said, because the oil in the
projectors freezes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at least one oversight is about to be remedied. When the
Kinodrome reopens later this month, Volkov said, it will serve
popcorn.

WHERE COUNTRY STARS GO TO PRESS THE FLESH
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ In rap music, it's called keeping it real. In the
pop world, it's known as keeping your feet on the ground. In soul,
it's payback. And in rock-and-roll, it's remembering your roots.
</P>
<P>
   But nowhere is the practice of celebrity humility _ of stars
showing fans that they're simultaneously one of them but also
worthy of their veneration _ more widespread and wholeheartedly
embraced than in country music at the annual Fan Fair, which took
place at the Tennessee State Fairgrounds over the last week. Every
year since 1972, the biggest stars in country music have rented
booths at Fan Fair and sat there patiently, giving autographs,
posing for photos, chatting with fans and in some cases giving away
(or auctioning) their clothes and belongings. It's like a giant
swap meet with a star at the helm of almost every booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that you could do this in any other genre of
music,'' said the singer-songwriter Steve Wariner, pausing from a
special hourlong autograph session for his handicapped fans to
imagine the pandemonium that would ensue if Bruce Springsteen, John
Mellencamp, Pearl Jam and half a dozen other rockers gathered under
one roof for an open house.
</P>
<P>
   Wariner, one of Nashville's most enduring stars who began
signing autographs here in 1978, then recalled a legendary incident
from Fan Fair three years ago. Garth Brooks met with his admirers
for 24 hours straight, by Wariner's account, without a bathroom
break.
</P>
<P>
   But something was different at Fan Fair this year. There was no
Garth _ and no Shania Twain or Dixie Chicks or Reba McIntyre. Some
country stars, fans grumbled, are getting too swell-headed for
their cowboy hats.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year Shania Twain couldn't get anybody to get in her line
for an autograph,'' recalled Vince Smith, a 39-year-old restaurant
employee who drove in from Toronto and pitched his tent outside the
fair at 10 p.m. Wednesday to be among the first in line when the
gates opened at 9:30 on Thursday morning. ``The next year it was so
crowded you couldn't get into Shania's line. And now she doesn't
even bother.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoebe Cowart, an office manager from Indiana, said: ``We're
here for them. They should be here for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives for the missing musicians said Brooks was
completing a rock concept album in Los Angeles, the Dixie Chicks
were touring Europe, Ms. McIntyre was making a movie in Canada and
Ms. Twain was completing a Northeast tour with a Madison Square
Garden performance.
</P>
<P>
   Other hot stars who performed in town the week of Fan Fair
either did not set up booths for autograph sessions or canceled
autograph appearances. The most in demand of them were Trisha
Yearwood and the country power couple of Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Partly as a result, attendance at Fan Fair dropped. Though in
past years the event has sold out a month ahead of time, this year
2,000 of its 24,000 tickets (priced at $90 for the last three
years) went unsold despite the participation of nearly 200 country
singers, including LeAnn Rimes, Alan Jackson, Clint Black, Wynonna,
Neil McCoy, Vince Gill and Brooks and Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `Is this the death of Fan Fair?''' said Ed Benson,
the executive director of the Country Music Association, the music
support group that runs Fan Fair. ``I tell them it's the exhaustion
of the artists. We need to figure out how to manage the
expectations of fans against the reality of the artists.''
</P>
<P>
   In the world of country music, stars are not supposed to be
larger than life. They are supposed to be the embodiment of real
life, the perfect ideal of the everyday person. Explaining why they
liked performers like the new and improved David Ball and the
fantastic-voiced Sara Evans at Fan Fair, audience members made
comments like ``he looks like a guy you could sit down with and
tell your problems to'' and ``her mother was the kind of woman you
might see at Wal-Mart.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, musicians _ cognizant of the Dale Carnegie
dictum that the sweetest sound to people is the sound of their own
name _ make it a point to remember the names of admirers who show
up at Fan Fair year after year for autographs.
</P>
<P>
   Where rock stars often try to protect their family from prying
fans, country musicians make it a point to show off their spouses
and children. At a private show for fan club members last week,
Alan Jackson _ after introducing his wife, his children and his
housekeeper _ reinvented housecleaning when he and his wife invited
two fans to their house to cart off their clutter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how I could have sold a hundred million records?''
Garth Brooks once asked rhetorically. ``Sign every autograph I
could have.''
</P>
<P>
   But over the last few years the stakes in country music have
gotten much larger. Just as in the larger world of pop, the
superstars keep getting bigger. Brooks has become the best-selling
male solo artist in the history of popular music and Ms. Twain is
among the top-selling female singers. And country, according to the
Recording Industry Association of America, is the best-selling
music genre next to rock, despite a slight dip since a huge country
boom in the mid-'90s.
</P>
<P>
   This makes the goal of Fan Fair, to have every fan feel like he
or she is the star's friend, impossible. After all, artists at Fan
Fair are not expected just to sign autographs and remember names;
they are also supposed to engage their fans in conversation as if
they were making small talk at a bar.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps some artists have stopped making appearances at Fan Fair
because the normally polite and orderly audience is beginning to
get too large and rambunctious to please. When there was confusion
in a line to meet Gill this year and it seemed as if some people
weren't going to get his autograph, one fan made a display of
ripping up Gill's photograph in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made this town is going to break this town,'' said John
Gilman as he stood in a stall for the Great Escape, a local record
store. ``Country music is growing too much. People can go anywhere
now to see it. They don't have to come to Nashville.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of a changing world of country was also provided in the
demographic shifts at Fan Fair. There was an increase in the number
of families (from young children to great-grandmothers) and more
tellingly, a large rise in teen-agers and preteens, Benson said.
Girls squealed as cute, boyish singers like Bryan White and South
Sixty-Five (country's inevitable answer to the Backstreet Boys)
walked into the building, evidence of the transformation of country
cowboys from the man next door to the boy on the pedestal.
</P>
<P>
   A new singer, Brad Hawkins, had no fans lined up at his booth
when he arrived at Fan Fair the first day. But word soon spread
among female fans that he was a hunk. And on day two Hawkins
arrived at his booth surprised to find that a line had formed for
him. It was rare evidence of a pop phenomena being created
literally overnight.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Country Music Association, women now account
for 65 percent of the audience in this genre, which was once
dominated by male fans. And in response the marketing of country
artists has begun to change. ``Look,'' hissed one manager as he
tried to explain the popularity of a booth featuring a young singer
without a recording contract, Greg Rowles. ``He kisses on the
lips.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowles was indeed giving very long, smoldering hugs to the women
who visited his small booth, some of whom dreamily compared his
looks to Ricky Martin. ``He's going to make it,'' said Sandra
Whitton, a 41-year-old nurse from Indiana, ``because of how he's
treating people.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his enthusiastic displays of affection for
strangers, Rowles, a former ``Star Search'' winner, explained:
``It's no technique. I do this with my family.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Around the corner from Rowles and directly across the aisle from
the young, hard-working Ms. Rimes sat a table full of old-time
musicians known as the Reunionairs. They weren't has-beens, they
were never-wases, and they sat there for the week virtually ignored
in the stampede of fans for Ms. Rimes and even for Rowles. It
wasn't a crime that they were being overlooked; it was evidence of
a pop music more interested in youth than tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't tell one artist from another,'' grumbled Raymond
(Cousin Ray) Woolsend, an 83-year-old disk jockey and the
Reunionairs' president, who sat proudly in his wheelchair. ``Now
they have no change in voices, no real songs and too much drums in
the leads. Musicians of yesteryear were just like uncles and
cousins, like family. They're not that way today.''
</P>
<P>
   The simple, thematically decorated booths at the fair were
packed side by side in several cavernous, brightly lighted and
distinctly unglamorous exhibition halls patrolled by a kindly
security staff that consisted mostly of local schoolteachers on
summer break. Lines of fans, many of them families on their annual
vacation and nourished by free meals ladled out of giant vats by
the Odessa Chuck Wagon Gang, were tightly coiled around each
building, lined up for hours to meet their heroes, who were either
dressed like Wariner in jeans and a T-shirt or like the faux
bad-boys Montgomery Gentry in exaggerated cowboy garb.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the booths, the event also offered fan-friendly
concerts by most of the popular acts. Instead of barricading the
area in front of the stage, a path was created so that fans could
walk by and take photographs, offer presents to and sometimes shake
hands with the artists as they performed.

   ``People outside of country music look at us and tell us we're
nuts,'' Clint Black told a cheering Fan Fair audience on Wednesday
night. ``They don't see this in other areas of entertainment, and
they're kind of surprised by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many participants and ticket-buyers wondered whether, with talk
of the convention moving downtown to the Nashville Arena next year,
the friendly, familial community of Fan Fair would give way to an
event that was simply a big, impersonal concert. It is a fear
reflected in one of the biggest and best recent country hits, Alan
Jackson's barrel-voiced eulogy for ``the little man that built this
town before the big money shut him down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless the little man,'' Jackson concludes the song,
offering a celebration of and lament for not just the independent
shopkeeper but also the denizens of the Fair, fan and artist alike.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ It is true that the men behind the first and only
drive-in movie in Russia overlooked a few things, such as telling
the audience that films are best viewed with headlights off. Also,
popcorn. Somehow, a drive-in isn't quite the same munching on
cabbage pie.
</P>
<P>
   But those are nits. With a hastily built 56-by-30-foot screen
and a projection booth mounted on stilts, three Moscow
entrepreneurs staged a two-night dry run over the weekend of the
quintessentially American motion picture experience, and appeared
to have a hit on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, once the sun set _ that is, in this northern season of
bright summer solstice nights, at about 11:20 p.m. _ the Moscow
Kinodrome could well have been the Kenwood in Louisville or the
Moonlight in Pittsburgh instead of what it was: a deserted parking
lot, hard by an equally deserted velodrome built for the 1980
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing to have, just to relax,'' said 30-year-old
Igor Martinov as he stood by his red Nissan, downing beers and
smoking L&AMP;Ms. ``And if you have a good car with shaded windows,''
he grinned, ``it's a very good thing for young kids to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Drive-ins may be a dying breed in the United States, where their
number has shrunk to about 500 from 10 times that at the peak of
their popularity. But the story may well be different in Moscow, a
place desperately short of theaters and where the economics of
moviegoing is completely different.
</P>
<P>
   While most American drive-ins aim for the teen-age crowd or the
family seeking a cheap night out, the backers of the Kinodrome have
their sights on a slightly older, more upscale crowd. When it
reopens _ the theater is in hiatus after its two-night premiere _
it will cost 195 rubles per person, or $8, for a movie and a light
meal.
</P>
<P>
   While the Olympic complex has seen better days, the drive-in is
in one of the city's finer neighborhoods, a mile from President
Boris Yeltsin's city apartment and not far from clusters of luxury
high-rise apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Volkov, who came up with the idea after seeing
drive-ins in Hungary and Germany, said in an interview that the
backers decided to expand on one partner's successful experience
running 16 nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's based on the idea that in Moscow in the summertime, a
great number of people are living the night life,'' he said, ``and
secondly, that Moscovites love to watch films. We found that there
are a great number of people who haunt these clubs during the night
and prefer to sit not inside, but outside. They ask to move their
tables to the open.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the Kinodrome sports an outdoor cafe at the rear of the
parking lot, where filmgoers can buy apple, mushroom and cabbage
pies, fruit-stuffed pirozhki, or pastries, American soft drinks,
beer and _ soon _ vodka.
</P>
<P>
   The drive-in itself is a decidedly makeshift affair. The parking
lot, equipped with green gates to keep freeloaders out, holds only
150 cars and lacks a ticket booth. The screen is anything but
oversized, and the cramped projection room inexplicably flies a
skull-and-crossbones and is draped in camouflage netting.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the two water-cooled projectors were salvaged from the
defunct October Theater on Moscow's Novy Arbat, which is being
gutted and turned into a multiscreen cineplex. As there are no
water lines running to the lot, the projectionists' great fear _
unrealized, fortunately _ was that the evenings' feature films
would catch fire.
</P>
<P>
   Critics might have called that no great loss. Although the
Kinodrome promises the best in Russian and foreign film, the main
events Thursday and Friday were an American sci-fi potboiler,
``Virus,'' and one of the Mel Gibson vehicles, ``Lethal Weapon 4.''
</P>
<P>
   But the premiere audiences, lured by free tickets and the
novelty of it all, didn't seem to care. College girls and boys
strolled up and down the rows of obediently lined-up Audis,
Mustangs and other imported cars, looking for each other. In one
expensive-looking sport utility vehicle, Andrei Bezlepkin, his wife
and their two children said they were there strictly on a lark.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter Julia, 15, had seen three of the Lethal Weapon
films, but her dad was clueless. ``I think it's something like
Weapons Number Four,'' he said when asked about the night's
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   On the road by the theater, dozens more cars _ including one
police cruiser _ squeezed onto the gravel shoulder on Friday night
seeking their own free view. Still more people simply walked in and
squatted on the pavement, straining to catch the soundtrack
broadcast from the projection booth to car radios.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some glitches. At Thursday's first showing,
drivers in the front row had to be told to switch off their
headlights. Some who came on motorcycles or in cars without radios
were disappointed to find that they were watching a silent movie.
One walk-in, clearly there more for the beer than the movie, rose
in the middle of one presentation to demand that the sound be
turned up.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it a seamlessly American experience. For one thing, the
brief Russian summer nights mean that the first showing doesn't end
until close to 1 a.m., and the second finishes around first light.
The viewing season is also brief: the Kinodrome will close for the
winter in October, a projectionist said, because the oil in the
projectors freezes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at least one oversight is about to be remedied. When the
Kinodrome reopens later this month, Volkov said, it will serve
popcorn.

INDUSTRY VIEW: THE RACE FOR TOP BRIDAL WEB SITE HEATS UP
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Evan I. Schwartz is the author of the newly released book
``Digital Darwinism'' (Broadway Books;
www.digitaldarwinism.com).)  
(nk) 
 By EVAN I. SCHWARTZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beware the bridal-industrial complex.
</P>
<P>
   Embarking on what is probably the most acquisitive year of their
lives, the newly engaged often find their hearts, minds and
checkbooks being tugged in many different directions at once. The
2.5 million couples who get married every year in the United States
generate wedding-related spending of about $50 billion, according
to research by Modern Bride magazine, which works out to an average
of $20,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no wonder that the cyberspace race to create the
ultimate wedding site is now heating up in this, the height of
marriage season.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with launching a national bridal commerce site,
however, is that much of the business _ the caterers, the florists,
the photographers and the like _ is intensely local. It's
difficult, for instance, for one all-purpose nuptials site to
recommend the best wedding singers for both Valley Stream, N.Y.,
and Simi Valley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, one of the biggest chunks of the wedding business _ the
buying of the gifts _ is the picture perfect Web commerce
application. Friends, family and other guests spend about $17
billion annually on ceramic napkin holders, silver candlesticks,
pasta-making machines and the various other treasures that couples
will stash away for many years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The task of buying these items is poised to go digital because
the guests have no need to physically see or touch the merchandise.
They already know that whatever they pick from an online gift
registry has already been deemed wedding worthy by the recipients.
And by putting their gift registries on the Web, the engaged couple
solves the problem of being limited to registering only at stores
that have locations near all their far-flung relatives and college
buddies.
</P>
<P>
   As is typical with fast-evolving electronic opportunities, the
early contenders to dominate this market don't come from the ranks
of the industry's traditional players _ in this case, the bridal
magazines and large department store chains. Rather, they come from
the world of well-funded Internet start-ups founded by people in
their 20s with personal experience in the ways of modern wedding
planning. What's surprising, though, is how widely divergent these
new-wave business models are.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most popular wedding site, the Knot,
(www.theknot.com) takes an approach similar to Amazon.com,
bypassing brick-and-mortar stores altogether. Stocked with 4,000
different gift items, theknot.com allows the bride and groom to
browse the online catalog, add their choices to their personal
registry page, and tactfully alert their guests. Founded by David
Liu and Carly Roney, a young New York couple, the service is based
on the premise that today's busy young couples do not enjoy the
experience of registering for gifts in large department stores.
``The off-line world is somewhat broken,'' Liu said. ``We think the
Web has changed people's consumer patterns.''
</P>
<P>
   To help with the logistics and fulfillment, the Knot recently
took a $15 million strategic investment from the television
shopping giant QVC Inc., which is owned by Comcast and is now
procuring, warehousing, and distributing all of the Knot's gift
merchandise from one location in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Vehemently disagreeing with that anti-store approach is Tim
Grey, co-founder and chief executive of WeddingChannel.com,
(www.weddingchannel.com)  &UR;  &LR; a three-year-old Los Angeles start-up
backed by more than $19 million in venture capital, including
financing from the personal computer magnate Michael Dell. Newly
engaged couples like going to the store to select their china,
flatware, linens and other accouterments of married life, Grey
contends. ``They want the face-to-face contact with store employees
and a place to return merchandise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's why WeddingChannel has teamed up Federated Department
Stores. The operator of Macy's, Bloomingdales and five other chains
has taken a 20 percent equity stake in the company, and will be
automatically adding the in-store registries of the 300,000 brides
it signs up each year to the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Stephen Cunningham, founder and chief executive of
WeddingNetwork.com. Instead of just one giant retail partner, like
Federated, his company has signed pacts with dozens of smaller
ones, including the bridal specialist Ross-Simons and the linen
giant Bed, Bath &AMP; Beyond. With more than 60,000 products to choose
from, $16 million in venture financing and equity backing from
Primedia, the parent of Modern Bride, Cunningham claims that his
company is the one to beat.
</P>
<P>
   And now comes a Silicon Valley start-up called Della &AMP; James,
which has combined elements of many of these other business models
_ while also tackling the daunting job of integrating online bridal
registries with the back-office data bases and order-fulfillment
operations of major retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Named after the young newlyweds in the O. Henry short story
``The Gift of the Magi,'' and backed by the venture capital firm
Kleiner-Perkins, Della &AMP; James says it is the first wedding Web
site to offer real-time updating between Web gift registries and
store-based ones. So when Cousin Buffy shops online and selects a
crystal vase from Harcourt General's Neiman Marcus on a Wednesday
morning, Uncle Bertrand knows upon arriving at a physical store
later that day that he must choose something else.
</P>
<P>
   Besides working with Neiman Marcus, the company has integrated
the registries of Crate and Barrel, Dillard's, Williams-Sonoma and
the outdoors specialist REI into its service.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica DiLullo, the 26-year-old cofounder and vice-president of
Della &AMP; James, is getting married in September to her Stanford
University sweetheart at a ceremony in California's wine country.
The couple have a personal home page on the site
(www.dellajames.com), complete with a fetching photo, details about
the event, and of course a growing list of what they want,
including a gift certificate for ballroom dancing lessons ($50),
walkie-talkies ($109.95 each), a backpack ($80), and
sterling-silver salt and pepper shakers ($90). Ms. DiLullo is
thrilled that the service is ready for a trial run in time for her
big day. ``I wanted to be a beta bride,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, these sites are supposed to simplify the hectic
lives of the newly engaged _ a group that can use all the help it
can get in that regard. An interactive poll being taken by
WeddingBells.com, yet another site that plans to start a bridal
registry, asks this question: Are the two of you having sex before
getting married? Out of 1,264 votes received, 9 percent selected
the response ``No, it's more special this way,'' and 13 percent
chose ``No, it's against our beliefs.'' A whopping 77 percent
selected ``Yes! Why shouldn't we?'' But maybe there should have
been a fourth choice: ``Too stressed. We're planning a wedding, you
know.''

   TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEALS CONFUSING MANY INVESTORS
</P>
<P>
   Communications companies are all too aware that if they do not
transform themselves _ with one foot in the Internet and the other
in the more traditional world of copper wires _ they face certain
death. But the combinations deemed necessary to do that are
wreaking havoc on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent example is the takeover battle between Global
Crossing and Qwest Communications for Frontier and U S West.
Investors are surprised by what these and other companies aspire to
become and question how those ambitions fit their investing
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T PLEDGES CABLE FRATERNITY
</P>
<P>
   In his keynote address at the annual convention of the National
Cable Television Association, Michael Armstrong, the chairman of
AT&AMP;T, made his shrewd social debut as he tries to build AT&AMP;T into
the United States' biggest cable operator. At its highest levels,
cable is a fraternity, and AT&AMP;T is seen as a rich but untested
prodigy.
</P>
<P>
   `LIVE' PAY-PER-VIEW WEB BROADCAST
</P>
<P>
   Woodstock.com, an Internet music start-up, has announced what it
bills as the first pay-per-view Webcast of a live event _ even if
the concert in question did take place last year. On Friday, the
company will offer a Webcast of a Sarah McLachlan concert, to be
seen simultaneously on pay-per-view cable television in many
cities. The nearly two-hour performance was recorded in April 1998
in Portland, Ore.

   AMERICA ONLINE WARY OF MICROSOFT
</P>
<P>
   Documents and testimony offered at Microsoft's antitrust trial,
during the appearance of an America Online senior vice president,
disclosed that the online service's leaders still feel seriously
constrained, even threatened, by Microsoft's power.
</P>
<P>
   AS PC PRICES FALL, SO DO PROFITS
</P>
<P>
   As PC Expo gets under way this week at the Javits Convention
Center in New York, the show's organizers are sounding a theme of
``smarter, faster, cheaper'' and highlighting the trend toward
powerful, portable devices. But among personal-computer makers, the
theme might as well be ``where have all the profits gone,'' as
cutthroat competition continues to erode earnings.
</P>
<P>
   NEWS MAGAZINES DOMINATE SUMMER
</P>
<P>
   Television programmers have bloated summer evenings with reruns
and news magazines, which always earn good ratings and advertising
revenue during the summer. But even the news magazine may be in
danger of being overdone. For the first time, the three major news
divisions have all scheduled hourlong news magazines five nights a
week.
</P>
<P>
   WEB POPULARITY PERPETUATES ITSELF
</P>
<P>
   Bringing statistical support to an increasingly common Internet
wisdom, two researchers have found that the most popular Web sites
command the biggest share of Internet traffic and tend to gain an
accelerating advantage over their competitors.

   Roger Black, the designer who has applied his rigorous aesthetic
eye to the pages of The New Republic and Reader's Digest, is about

publishes The National Enquirer and Star, has hired Black and two
ad agencies to reposition the tabloids.

MYSTERY SHOPPERS - SLEUTHS FOR HIRE CHECK SERVICE OF RETAILERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN PHINNEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Heather Larson doesn't look like a mysterious woman
with a double life.
</P>
<P>
   At first encounter, she's middle-aged, soft-spoken, with minimal
makeup _ unobtrusive, unlikely to stand out in a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in sensible shoes, flowered dress and a cardigan
sweater, Larson is an accounts payable specialist with a suburban
school district in the Seattle area.
</P>
<P>
   But in her other life _ wearing a baseball cap, jeans and
sneakers _ she's a mystery shopper for hire.
</P>
<P>
   She'll spend her off-hours hanging around movie theaters or
hardware stores. Or she might take her car in for an oil change, or
put on a special dress to visit a top-rated restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Larson is a sleuth who shops retail stores, apartment houses,
banks and other providers of goods and services. Her undercover
work helps retailers determine how they rank in service, quality,
cleanliness and other key issues with customers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a job she's been doing since the '70s, when she was home
with two preschoolers and looking for part-time work. She answered
an ad and was hired as a mystery shopper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to eat in seven Jack in the Box restaurants every two
weeks. Sometimes we went to three in one night,'' Larson says.
After each meal she'd file a report. She did this for three years,
leaving her daughter with an addiction to Breakfast Jacks.
</P>
<P>
   When her children entered school, Larson branched out to car
washes, apartment rentals and banks. Now she works for about 20
different companies and checks Internet listings for other
interesting shopping jobs in this area.
</P>
<P>
   Larson says there's a great demand for mystery shoppers because
retail competition is fierce. With so many stores selling the same
merchandise at similar prices, only service and other side issues
differentiate them.
</P>
<P>
   Retail operators want to know how their customers are being
treated, and how their stores rate with consumers. Owners often
want to know what goes on when they're away. They rely on mystery
shoppers to tell them.
</P>
<P>
   It may sound interesting, even glamorous, but the life of a
mystery shopper can be boring and routine. ``It's good for extra
money, but I don't recommend it as a career change,'' Larson says.
</P>
<P>
   She describes an assignment in a megastore where she had to
interact with personnel in 17 different departments. She couldn't
find a salesperson in some of them, so she had to keep checking
back until she did.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the details that have to be remembered:
Background music, employee hygiene and appearance, number of loose
carts in a grocery store lot, etc. Each assignment and report has
different demands.
</P>
<P>
   Take a movie theater, for example, one of Larson's favorite
assignments.
</P>
<P>
   She has to arrive early and check the cleanliness of the parking
lot and the theater. She notes the ticket vendor's attitude and
makes certain she gets correct change when she buys her ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop is the concession stand to buy a snack and see if the
attendant is tending to business. Lobby and restroom are evaluated
for cleanliness. Larson then sits in the back of the theater so she
can count the house _ not always easy with patrons coming and
going. Finally, she evaluates quality of sound and picture.
</P>
<P>
   All this information has to be remembered for the written
report.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Larson decided mystery shoppers could use a
training class, because manuals and forms provided by employers
didn't prepare shoppers for the reality of the job.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote a proposal and sent it to community colleges in the
area. Renton Technical College and Highline Community College, both
south of Seattle, accepted. Now she teaches about 20 classes per
year.
</P>
<P>
   Students learn how to make detailed, factual reports and how to
interact with salespeople. ``I tell my classes to dress beige. They
don't want to be noticed,'' she says. That means no logos or
artwork on clothing that might make a mystery shopper memorable.
</P>
<P>
   Her classes are popular with retired people, business owners or
managers who want to know how mystery shopping works, and young
women in their 20s looking for part-time employment.
</P>
<P>
   She tells them how to avoid scams _ never pay to get a shopping
job _ and how to work the Internet to find them. Larson even gives
tips on keeping track of expenses for tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who calls herself Ann Rogers _ not her real name, she
wants to stay anonymous _ took Larson's class last September. She
got her first assignment in October and ``I've just bloomed from
there,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She likes mystery shopping so much that she's now spending 30 to
40 hours a week at the job. Rogers has checked out fast-food
franchises and spent hours dining in a top Seattle restaurant.
She's also spent 40 minutes in a small store waiting for a
salesperson to approach her _ something specified in her
assignment. The three women on duty ignored her.
</P>
<P>
   She makes $10 to $30 per assignment. When visiting a restaurant,
mystery shoppers are usually given a set amount to spend on dinner
for two, and sometimes told what to order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking the course is a great way to find out what's expected
of you and how to go about it,'' Rogers says. ``You always have a
choice of assignments, and you're never forced to take a shop you
don't want. But it is work.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Worthley owns The Genesis Group, a Bellevue-based firm
specializing in customer service surveys. ``I hate the term
`mystery shopping.' It denotes spying on people,'' Worthley says.
</P>
<P>
   Worthley was managing a retail clothing store in the 1970s when
corporate headquarters told him his store would be checked out
anonymously sometime during a two-week period.
</P>
<P>
   Worthley and his staff were at their best during that time,
greeting customers and providing top-quality service. Sales went up
and Worthley took note.
</P>
<P>
   He began learning more about mystery shoppers and what they
could do for companies. Today he has clients in 42 states and a
database of 9,000 shoppers he can deploy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every store you go into hires shoppers _ wineries, hospitals,
clinics, restaurants,'' Worthley says. ``Companies who hire us
really want to change the culture of their organization.''
</P>
<P>
   He says there are just three issues in business: The product or
service, the price and the level of service. ``That's why service
today is so much more serious,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   When Worthley founded Genesis in 1991, there were only about 150
other customer survey companies in the country. Today there are
about 700, complete with a professional association (Mystery
Shoppers Providers Association) to set standards.
</P>
<P>
   Worthley likes to hire people with some retail exposure, people
who have seen the best and worst of service, actors, people with
flexible schedules.
</P>
<P>
   He likes to introduce his program to company employees and
explain to them how mystery shoppers work so they will feel
involved, not threatened by them. He also encourages companies to
reward good service.
</P>
<P>
   Worthley sees surveys as a coaching tool to help companies
refocus their energies and teach sales skills and hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to catch people doing something right,'' he says.

NETWORKS DELIVER SMORGASBORD TO FILL ORDER FOR YOUNG VIEWERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Remember the episode of ``The Twilight Zone'' when a
horrified woman discovered that a book written by space visitors
called ``To Serve Man'' was actually a cookbook? Well, a book about
the 1999-2000 season for the broadcast television networks could be
titled ``To Serve Youth.''
</P>
<P>
   But now Madison Avenue is wondering whether that book will be a
best seller or a recipe for failure.
</P>
<P>
   For years, agencies and advertisers have exhorted broadcast TV
to appeal to younger viewers _ 12 to 24, 18 to 34, 18 to 49 _
because they are deemed more desirable consumers than their older
counterparts: more willing to spend, to try new products, to switch
brands. Besides, younger consumers, particularly teen-age and
20-something males, watch less television, making those who do
watch much more valuable to marketers.
</P>
<P>
   The ``dot com'' advertisers pitching computers, Web sites and
other high-technology products and services, whose dollars are
beginning to flood into TV, are licking their chops over the
millions of wired consumers in Generations X and Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's looking for young eyeballs,'' said Jamie Kellner,
president of the WB network in Burbank, Calif., which is owned by
Time Warner and the Tribune Co. and is enjoying strong gains in ad
revenue by delivering marketers audiences aged 12 to 24.
</P>
<P>
   So broadcasters are racing to add programs aimed at younger
viewers to their prime-time schedules for the coming season. By one
count, 18 of 37 new series on the six broadcast networks will look
at the world through youth-colored glasses, joining more than a
dozen returning series with similar skews.
</P>
<P>
   Among the newcomers: ``Freaks and Geeks'' on NBC, ``Manchester
Prep'' and ``Ryan Caulfield'' on the Fox Broadcasting Co. and
``Snoops'' and ``Then Came You'' on Walt Disney's ABC, as well as
more youthful fare for WB like ``Angel,'' ``Roswell'' and
``Popular.'' UPN, owned by Viacom, will appeal to young males with
a wrestling show called ``WWF Smackdown!'' and a Friday movie
called ``Blockbuster Video's Shockwave Cinema.''
</P>
<P>
   Even CBS, the network first in older viewers, is seeking to
climb down the demographic ladder a couple of rungs, pairing
younger and older cast members in new series like ``Judging Amy.''
</P>
<P>
   But after all those entreaties to broadcasters to think young,
some agency executives worry that the pendulum may be swinging too
far too fast in one direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too much of the same thing,'' said Paul Schulman,
president of Schulman/Advanswers NY, a media services agency in New
York owned by the Omnicom Group. ``People are copying the WB.''
</P>
<P>
   A primary concern is that the broadcast networks will be
diverted from an audience they ought to be pursuing: the aging baby
boomers, the 76 million consumers born from 1946 to 1964 whose
incomes for the most part dwarf those of younger viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being associated with youth is a positive because people like
to envision themselves as young, virile, active,'' said Stacey Lynn
Koerner, vice president for broadcast television research at TN
Media in New York, the media services arm of True North
Communications. ``That's our American culture. Advertisers like to
be in environments where there's a perception that positive things
are going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is no reason to believe older people are less
willing to try new things,'' she added. ``And there are different
levels to it. I might be 15 and want to do what my friends do. I
might be 45 and want the new Mercedes my neighbor has.''
</P>
<P>
   The executives also warn that the youth movement may conflict
with the traditional mission of broadcast TV: to reach the widest
audiences possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``A broadcaster is exactly that, a `broad-caster,''' Ms. Koerner
said, adding: ``Broadcasters can't narrow themselves to one
audience and remain viable. They have to in some sense be all
things to all people.''
</P>
<P>
   If broadcasters narrow their focus to fixate on youth, according
to this school of thought, they run the risk of becoming clones of
cable networks, which most commonly aim their programming at
smaller, specific targets. That would then weaken the strongest
argument for advertising on broadcast TV.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasting ``doesn't exclude,'' said Bob Igiel, president for
the broadcast division of the Media Edge in New York, the media
services arm of Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc. ``When you turn on the TV, a
sign doesn't come on saying `You're 50 and you can't watch this.'''
</P>
<P>
   The rush to satisfy young viewers, the critics fret, may also
exacerbate the longstanding problem the broadcast networks
confront: declining ratings. Shows that seemingly exclude older
viewers may send them away to alternative fare, thereby further
eroding audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``If two networks of six focus on youth, that's fine,'' said
Peter Chrisanthopoulos, president for broadcast and programming in
the United States at the Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide agency in New
York, a unit of WPP Group PLC, ``because if viewers have enough
choices, they don't always have to go to cable. ``If more than two
do it,'' he added, ``they start to cannibalize one another and lose
more viewers to cable.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the network that most ardently believes in the
puissance of older consumers is CBS, which has the most older
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no strong economic reason for Madison Avenue's
fascination with the young audience,'' said David F. Poltrack,
executive vice president for research and planning at CBS
Television in New York. ``I've always called this the programmer's
dilemma, pursuing the segment of the audience for which there is
greatest competition, which watches less TV over all, because of
Madison Avenue's obsession. ``As the baby boomers move into an
older age group,'' he added, ``Madison Avenue will become
increasingly aware that's where the money is.''
</P>
<P>
   The other networks say they are becoming more youth-centric
simply to deliver what advertisers and agencies request.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not different from any other business with a
market-share war going on,'' said Randy Falco, president of the
NBC-TV Network unit of NBC in New York, part of the General
Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   So while broadcast TV is ``still the only place you can reach
the mass audience,'' he added, if ``the advertising community cares
about 18 to 49,'' those are the viewers who will receive special
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good television is about taking chances, trying to capture
lightning in a bottle,'' Falco said. ``With `Freaks and Geeks,' we
will take a chance, do something different. Every once in a while,
you hit on something.'' That new series is about high school life
in the 1980's
</P>
<P>
   At Fox, a unit of the News Corp., the focus has been on viewers
18 to 34; the network finished first in that age group for the
1998-99 season and second behind NBC in viewers 18 to 49.
</P>
<P>
   ``We attract a higher percentage of light television viewers,
which makes our audience more valuable because it's more difficult
to reach,'' said Jon Nesvig, president for sales at Fox in New
York. ``And that correlates with youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, ``reaching the largest possible audience is still
important,'' he added, and Fox is looking to viewers 12 to 34 as
well as 25 to 54 for potential audience gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ratings erosion is a major concern,'' Nesvig said, ``but in
general the biggest issue is better programs. You still see the
audiences respond on a given night if there are good programs and
we get them to the set. It's still, `The play's the thing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Come fall, Madison Avenue will be watching the broadcast ratings
as closely as teen-agers watch ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' or
``Dawson's Creek'' on WB.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those of us representing advertisers,'' said
Chrisanthopoulos at Ogilvy &AMP; Mather, ``it's good if a network has a
focus, a mission, and tries to fulfill its goals by focusing on the
audiences it desires.
</P>
<P>
   ``The youth focus is good as long as they all don't do it.'' &QL;

INSTEAD OF SUMMER RERUNS, NETWORKS REPACKAGE PRIME-TIME NEWS
SERIES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As surely as summer brings visions of beaches and barbecue
grills, it brings reruns to broadcast television. And by making a
big promotional fuss about their shows' season finales in May, the
networks basically close up shop and tell viewers, ``See you in
September.''
</P>
<P>
   When they wave goodbye, they often send those viewers to cable
television camp. But since prime-time sitcoms and dramas are so
expensive to produce, programmers have bloated summer evenings with
reruns _ and with news magazines, which always earn good Nielsen
ratings (and advertising revenue) in summer.
</P>
<P>
   But even the news magazine may be in danger of being overdone
this summer. For the first time, the three major news divisions
have all scheduled hourlong news magazines five nights a week. And
several of these ``new'' hours are actually repackagings, with past
news stories updated to tell viewers what has happened since the
original story.
</P>
<P>
   The new summer-only series are six weeks of a program called
``Vanished'' on ABC (Thursdays at 10 p.m.), followed by four
Thursdays of ``Nightline in Prime Time: Brave New World'' (also 10
p.m.), and, on CBS, two new nights of ``48 Hours,'' each with a
special theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``48 Hours: Monday Mysteries'' earned such solid Nielsen ratings
last summer, its debut ``season,'' that CBS executives asked CBS
News if there was anything else that could be done with the genre.
The result is ``48 Hours: Tuesday Adventures,'' which will revisit
adventure stories from various past CBS News programs, not just
from ``48 Hours'' itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity to reintroduce your audience to a show,''
said Leslie Moonves, president of CBS Television. ``If you told
people, `We're doing another ``48 Hours,'' ' there's no sizzle to
it _ it's not saying anything new. But this way we're adding new
material, and we'll be able promote it in a whole new way.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, ``48 Hours: Tuesday Adventures,'' by its
title, ``will attract men, and there's a real void for men on
Tuesday at 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Having a promotable theme, Moonves said, is important in the
summer, because viewers tend to assume most nights are filled with
repeats, and that puts them off.
</P>
<P>
   ABC News addressed the problem with ``Vanished,'' a series of
hourlong stories about people who have disappeared, either
voluntarily or involuntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves praised the theme of ``Vanished,''saying ``It's a smart
move by ABC _ it can be promoted almost like a movie of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   But does this trend mean journalists are being asked to skirt
the line between news and entertainment?
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider these shows to be entertaining, but I don't
consider them to be entertainment,'' said Phyllis McGrady, vice
president and executive producer of special projects for ABC News
and the executive in charge of the ``Vanished'' series, which
includes a new look at the Lindbergh baby's kidnapping in 1932 and
a potentially news-breaking report on Madalyn Murray O'Hair, the
renowned atheist who led the 1960s movement to ban prayer in public
schools and disappeared in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   For Susan Zirinsky, executive producer of ``48 Hours'' and its
summer offspring, there is nothing wrong with making news
entertaining as long as it is valid. And, she said, with new
information, updated segments are fresh to viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not just putting on another show _ I'm evolving the
story,'' said Ms. Zirinsky, whose original ``48 Hours'' will
continue to appear Thursdays at 10 p.m. all summer. ``It's a
satisfying thing, as a journalist, to be able to put an additional
chapter on a story, perhaps even the closing chapter.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC will continue five nights of ``Dateline,'' a scheduling
concept successful during the regular season, and ABC will continue
its four nights a week of ``20/20.'' Both will mix some repeat
episodes with original stories, as will ``60 Minutes II,'' on
Tuesdays at 9.
</P>
<P>
   The venerable ``60 Minutes,'' on Sunday nights at 7, always
reverts to reruns in summer, selecting a ``best of'' collection of
episodes in the hope that viewers will want to see them again.
Judging by its high summer ratings, viewers do.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Zirinsky sees a bonus in the new nights. ``We now have
three nights when, if news breaks, I can dump the show and do an
hour on the news,'' she said.

CROWD, ON AND OFF THE FIELD, FORCED SCURRY TO SCRAMBLE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the largest crowd to ever see a women's sporting event in
the United States, larger than any crowd for a Giants game or a
Jets game, larger than any audience ever at Giants Stadium except
for the pope. That would be Pope John Paul II of the Vatican, not
Eddie Pope of D.C. United.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the American players got goose bumps in front of 78,972
fans on Saturday, some got tears. They all got nervous, which left
goalkeeper Briana Scurry to hold down the fort until Mia Hamm
gathered a rescuing cavalry charge for a 3-0 victory in the opening
match of the Women's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes into the match, Denmark's Gitte Krogh blasted a shot
across an empty goal mouth. Then, in the 15th minute, Scurry came
off her line and collided heavily with Danish forward Lene Jensen.
The shot to her ribs knocked the wind out of Scurry, who crumpled
to the ground. Wobbling, she climbed on all fours, then went down
again. Any harder, and the collision would have required an
insurance adjuster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stunned; I saw the ball but I didn't see her,'' Scurry
said. ``I didn't want to get up, but I knew I had to.''
</P>
<P>
   Still woozy in the 17th minute, she somehow nicked a corner
kick, then smothered a header that was played into dangerous
territory. ``I'm just glad the ball landed near me,'' Scurry said.
``I was out of it for about five minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   She fell on the ball like Lawrence Taylor pouncing on a fumble,
and Denmark seemed to deflate immediately. Its plan seemed to be to
get an early goal then to retreat into a bunker defense. To duck
and cover while the Americans blasted away.
</P>
<P>
   But Scurry fended off that first wave and, seconds later, Hamm
put the Americans up by 1-0 with a wonderfully balletic move,
trapping a long pass with her right foot and drilling it into the
net with her left. As Denmark wilted, Scurry pitched her 50th
shutout in 91 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really painful, but it was no time to be a baby,''
Scurry said of her collision. ``We were nervous. We knew their plan
was to throw the kitchen sink at us, and our job was to hold them
off for the first 20 minutes. We worked it out, and they ran out of
gas in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Scurry expects more of the same throughout the World Cup, teams
opening with a flurry of counterpunches, trying to back the
Americans up early. Next is a match against Nigeria Thursday night
at Soldier Field in Chicago, where more than 60,000 of the 65,000
available seats have been sold.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria is a fast, combative team, given to fierce tackling.
Forward Patience Avre scored three goals in a recent 4-3 victory
over China in a scrimmage. The Americans will get knocked down. The
question is how quickly they get back on their feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``My team is going to need me,'' Scurry said. ``We're on a grand
stage now. Teams don't want to have a bad showing. I realize they
are going to get through, and I am going to have to hold them off.
It's something I've become accustomed to. Sometimes we come out
nervous and the other team's excited and things happen here and
there.''
</P>
<P>
   A victory over Nigeria would almost certainly put the Americans
into the quarterfinals on July 1, thus letting the United States
qualify for a chance to defend its Olympic title at the 2000 Summer
Games in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The team was not in top form against Denmark, but it could take
encouragement on two fronts: Hamm appears ready to shoulder the
responsibility that comes with being considered the best female
player in the world. And the Americans are very fit, allowing them
to overcome early jitters with a relentlessness that eventually
wears down other teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``For two months, we seem to be turning it on in the second
half,'' Scurry said. ``That's one thing that carries us through.''
</P>
<P>
   There were, however, a few vulnerable moments Saturday. The
defensive wall is not the fastest, and the Americans needed
desperate closing maneuvers by Carla Overbeck, Kate Sobrero and
Brandi Chastain to quiet several scares. Forward Tiffeny Milbrett,
the team's most reliable scorer this year, was knocked down twice
with pummeling hits and taken off her game. And forward Cindy
Parlow lacks a finishing gear that could have put her onto more
passes from Hamm.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tony DiCicco has not been hesitant to bring Kristine Lilly
from midfield to forward in the second half for increased mobility.
Lilly nailed a shot from 18 yards in the 89th minute Saturday, then
taunted a Danish defender who had fouled her moments earlier,
saying, ``That one was for you!''
</P>
<P>
   Scurry sees a need for minor adjustments, no major overhauls.
After Saturday's victory, she exhorted the record crowd to its feet
and clapped in appreciation for its support, leading the Americans
on a victory lap around Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was something we had been hoping for; it was unbelievable
seeing it,'' Scurry said. ``It shows that our team is out there in
the mainstream. We read that the only person to beat us was the
pope. We'll take a back seat to the pope any time.''

EXCLUSIVE: INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE REPORT WON'T LINK BREAST IMPLANTS
TO DISEASES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: CORRECTS name of medical school in 18th graf: Dr. Shaun
Ruddy...) (rk) 
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   An independent panel of 13 scientists convened by the Institute
of Medicine at the request of Congress has concluded that silicone
breast implants do not cause any major diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some women with breast implants are indeed very ill and the
IOM committee is very sympathetic to their distress,'' the group
wrote in a report to be made public on Tuesday. ``However, it can
find no evidence that these women are ill because of their
implants.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, more than 400 pages long, says that the ``primary
safety issue'' with implants is their tendency to rupture or
deflate and to lead to infections or hardening or scarring of the
breast tissue. There is little argument about these localized
problems, which can be painful and disfiguring and which often lead
women to have additional surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But the report asserts in forceful terms that there is no reason
to believe that the implants cause rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or
any other systemic disease. Women who say their implants have
caused them to suffer these or related problems have turned breast
implants into a leading source of liability litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The report was provided to The New York Times by an organization
that consults in the breast implant matter and, a spokesman said,
that ``is pleased with the report's conclusions.'' The report is
the latest in a series of evaluations that have concluded there is
no scientific evidence to support the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Because it comes from the Institute of Medicine, the medical arm
of the National Academy of Sciences, the nation's most prestigious
scientific organization, it is expected to be influential in
setting scientific agendas and encouraging women to accept
settlements from implant makers rather than take their cases to
court.
</P>
<P>
   In preparing the report, panel members held public hearings, met
in private and evaluated more than a thousand research reports. The
Institute panel did not conduct any original research. Rather, the
panel relied primarily on research reported by other scientists.
But the report said that since lawsuits were first filed in the
late 1980s and early 1990s, there have been many scientific studies
upon which to make an evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, scientists appointed by the judge overseeing
implant liability litigation, Sam C. Pointer Jr., of U.S. District
Court in Alabama, came to a similar conclusion as the Institute
panel and a report issued last July by scientists in Britain who
had been charged by the British minister of health to review
implant safety.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists appointed by Judge Robert E. Jones of U.S. District
Court in Oregon, reached a comparable conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Dow Corning Corp., which filed for bankruptcy
citing the burden of its breast implant litigation, has agreed to
pay women $3.2 billion to settle their claims. Other implant
manufacturers, Baxter International, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and
Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, have agreed to a settlement
estimated at $3 billion combined.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, thousands of women have settled their cases in
private agreements with implant makers or gone to trial and won
awards that reached millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Medicine committee estimated that about 1.5
million to 1.8 million American women have had silicone breast
implants, about 70 percent for breast enlargement, the rest as
reconstruction after mastectomy.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the committee, headed by Dr. Stuart Bondurant, a
professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill, and Dr. Virginia Ernster, a professor of epidemiology at the
University of California in San Francisco, were prohibited from
discussing the report until it is officially made public.
</P>
<P>
   Sybil Goldrich, founder of Command Trust Network, an information
clearing house for women with silicone problems, said, ``I find it
extremely difficult to accept what the Institute of Medicine says
because those studies are paid for by the manufacturers. They have
not convinced me that their review is correct. It is as simple as
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Jacks, a lawyer in Austin, Tex., whose firm has
represented 425 women with implants, said he doubts that the report
will be the last word on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report is simply a review of the literature by a
committee that's reached some conclusion,'' Jacks said. ``It is
premature to conclude that reports like this are the last word that
scientists and physicians will have about the safety of breast
implants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But medical experts informed of the committee's conclusions,
applauded them.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Shaun Ruddy, the chairman of the rheumatology, allergy, and
immunology division at Virginia Commonwealth University's Medical
College of Virginia in Richmond, said that the conclusions were
``very forthright and outspoken'' and that he was glad the group
was attempting to put the disease hypotheses to rest. Ruddy, a past
president of the American College of Rheumatology, said he has had
no part in any of the litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Medicine committee was set up at the behest of
Congress. It's work began with a public hearing on July 24, 1997,
when almost 700 people filled an auditorium at the National Academy
of Sciences in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of medical professional associations made
statements, scientists spoke about their research, and women with
implants spoke of how their lives had been ruined by them. Some
said that they were so ill that they needed canes or wheelchairs to
get around, conditions they blamed on the implants. Others
testified that after they breast fed their babies, their children
developed the same debilitating symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Examining more than 1,200 references, the group addressed the
major questions about implants: Do they cause established
connective tissue diseases, like arthritis or lupus? Do they cause
breast cancer, nerve diseases, like multiple sclerosis, or new
diseases with symptoms like aches and pains and overwhelming
fatigue? Are children of women with breast implants at risk for
disease because of silicone transmitted across the placenta or in
breast milk? Do breast implants produce immunological reactions
that could cause disease?
</P>
<P>
   In every case, the committee concluded, there was no convincing
evidence that implants were at fault. When lawsuits were filed in
the late 1980s and early 1990s there was a lack of research on the
topic. Since then, according to the report, ``a number of strong,
well-designed epidemiological studies involving large numbers of
women and clear results have been published.''

   For example, the group wrote, the evidence is ``insufficient or
flawed.'' that implants cause ``atypical disease,'' a term covering
signs and symptoms like weakness, fatigue, and diffuse muscle pain.
But the group said that evidence on the other side is strong.
``Controlled epidemiologic studies cited'' led the committee to
conclude that ``there is no novel syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   On the question of established connective tissue diseases, like
lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, the group reviewed 17
epidemiological studies and concluded that they were ``remarkable
for the consistency of finding no elevated risk or odds for an
association of implants with disease.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing a description of the report, David Bernstein, a
law professor and adviser for the American Tort Reform Foundation,
a business-sponsored group, said that, coming as it does in the
wake of similar reports, the report ``might have a dramatic effect
in hastening the end of the litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very strong statement,'' Bernstein said. But he added
that it was a shame that the legal system went ahead on the
litigation in the absence of science, with companies paying
billions to compensate women with implants. ``It would have been
nice to have had this $6 billion ago,'' Bernstein said.

THE AGONY OF A DISAPPOINTING BOOK DEAL 
NEW DESIGNS AND NEW ADS FOR OLD TABLOIDS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the summer of 1996, Joe McGinniss turned his back on a $1
million advance for a book on O.J. Simpson, parted with his
longtime literary agent and headed for a remote Italian village,
Castel di Sangro, to pursue his passion for soccer and an
eight-page proposal for a quirky book about a quixotic local team.
</P>
<P>
   The official dust jacket version of what ensued is that
McGinniss almost immediately ``was embroiled in a small-town drama
that had less to do with a game played by men kicking a ball than
with universal emotions like hope, fear, love, loss and almost
unbearable suspense.''
</P>
<P>
   Then McGinniss returned to the United States, where, with the
May publication of the resulting book _ ``The Miracle of Castel di
Sangro'' _ he was almost immediately embroiled in a small New York
drama with his publisher that had less to do with writing a book
than with universal emotions like hope, fear, loss, loathing and
almost unbearable tension.
</P>
<P>
   Since his book was published, McGinniss has rather publicly
suggested that he will never write a book again because of his
distress about how his publisher, Little, Brown &AMP; Co., handled
almost every element of the publication of the book.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail to Little, Brown's publisher, Sarah Crichton,
titled ``Arrivederci, Sarah,'' McGinness listed of what in his view
were missteps: a mediocre book cover, a canceled tour, legal
wrangling over a final chapter that chronicles how the team
purposely threw a game. The letter rapidly circulated among
literary agents, editors and publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Some who received the letter viewed McGinniss' situation as
unique because of his own outsized personality. Others were
sympathetic, saying his experiences echoed wider trends in
publishing. ``I think that the kind of problems Joe McGinniss had
are fairly widespread in the business in terms of how publishers
are pulling back very quickly,'' said Robert Gottlieb, a literary
agent and executive vice president of the William Morris Agency.
``These large publishing houses have different demands than they
had before. There's no real staying power. When expectations don't
get met, they pull back and cut expenses very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinniss said he considered his latest book his best ever. He
was so convinced that the subject would make a good book, he said,
that he split with his literary agent of 15 years, Mort Janklow,
because Janklow had doubts about its potential. And he said he
repaid his $1 million advance to his former publisher, Crown,
because he did not have the same interest in the Simpson murder
trial, which sometimes so bored him that he would divert himself by
doodling with crayons from a pack of 128 Crayolas.
</P>
<P>
   But thus far, McGinniss said, his publishers have been unable to
ignite enough interest in ``The Miracle of Castel di Sangro'' to
attract any national media attention. McGinniss never faced his
publishers directly to raise these complaints because he said he
had never met any of them in person. ``There's too much loneliness
and anxiety and fear and stress in the process of being out there
for three years,'' he said. ``And then, when you finally come in
from the cold, you're still in the cold.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Ms. Crichton who acquired ``The Miracle of Castel di
Sangro,'' for an advance of about $300,000, and she has remained
diplomatic so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, we're extremely proud of the job that we've been
doing, and we think it's a terrific book,'' she said, noting that
Little, Brown, part of Time Warner Inc., had paid for full-page
advertisements in The New York Times. ``The truth is that thus far
there hasn't been a tremendous amount of interest from national
shows for Joe McGinniss, but we can hope that there will be.''
</P>
<P>
   After the e-mail crossfire, McGinniss is now considering hiring
his own publicist to arrange a tour. But even this solution may be
raising tensions. McGinniss says he believes that Little, Brown may
be finished with his expenses, which means no money for air fare,
hotels or food _ or miracles.

   New Designs and New Ads for Old Tabloids
</P>
<P>
   Roger Black, the designer who has applied his rigorous aesthetic
eye to the pages of The New Republic, Foreign Affairs and Reader's
Digest, is about to embark on an entirely different design
adventure. Next week, Black will head to Lantana, Fla., to remake
The National Enquirer.
</P>
<P>
   David J. Pecker, the chairman of American Media Inc., the
company that publishes The National Enquirer and Star newspapers,
has hired Black and two advertising agencies _ each to spend $25
million annually on campaigns _ to reposition his two tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   To organize The Enquirer's advertising campaign, Pecker has
hired Della Femina/Jeary &AMP; Partners, an agency headed by Della
Femina and Michael Jeary. Pecker has hired Peter Arnell of Arnell
Group Brand Consulting to direct both advertising and redesign
efforts for Star, the Enquirer's sister publication.
</P>
<P>
   Pecker's mission? ``We are going to create history by turning
around these two properties,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The redesigned newspapers will be introduced in September, he
said. Arnell, who has worked on brand campaigns for Vanity Fair and
Elle magazines, among others, said that he would try to make Star
``a hip, relevant and cool media vehicle.'' (He would not say
whether that meant no more articles with titles like ``Chocolate
Diet to Lose 15 Pounds Fast!'')
</P>
<P>
   Jeary said that the Enquirer advertising campaign, a series of
print and television commercials, would focus on reclaiming
Enquirer readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the tabloidization of the news media, with `Dateline'
and `20/20' and Connie Chung and `Inside Edition,' '' he said.
``These shows have taken over the character of the tabloid
newspaper. We want people to get back into the habit of considering
The National Enquirer as the king of the tabloids, not the
television shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Della Femina, the man who brought Joe Isuzu to life, added that
he was excited by the proposition of remaking The Enquirer because
of its part-owners, the investment group Evercore Capital Partners
LLC, which is headed by former Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger
Altman. (Pecker also owns a stake in the company.)
</P>
<P>
   Della Femina said: ``The quality of the advertising has to be
such that people will feel comfortable buying the paper. It can't
be cheap or leering.''
</P>
<P>
   Della Femina said that remaking the National Enquirer into
something that consumers are not embarrassed to pick up will be far
from impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are basically doing what the networks do during sweeps,''
Della Femina said. ``They run out and try to get sensational
stories and news stories. I hate to say this, but this is going to
be relatively easy, because we all recognize the trend toward
gossip. People love gossip. Everyone loves gossip. My wife and
daughter and I fight over Page Six every morning,'' he said,
referring to the gossip column of The New York Post.

AS INTERNET TRAFFIC SURGES, SO DO TECHNICAL PROBLEMS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the sun rose on her corner-office window one recent dawn in
San Francisco's financial district, Jan Hier-King punched the start
button on the stopwatch she was clutching and leaned forward in her
chair. Like a track coach training sprinters, she scrutinized the
speed and recovery time of her subject: the Charles Schwab Web site
(www.schwab.com).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hier-King, senior vice president of electronic trading
technology for Schwab, was nose-to-glass with her computer monitor,
putting the company's site through its early morning paces.
``Everything looks good,'' she said, leaning back with relief after
the Web pages loaded in less than eight seconds. ``Hopefully, today
will be uneventful.''
</P>
<P>
   She would have a much better idea in three minutes, when the
stock market opened and 30,000 visitors poured onto the Web site.
This would be rush hour, information superhighway style, the kind
of onslaught that makes every day an adventure for Ms. Hier-King,
her colleagues _ and the entire electronic commerce industry.
</P>
<P>
   The day before the site had gone down for 47 minutes during
trading hours after a data-storage device on one of the mainframe
computers locked up. But on this day, when trading opened back East
on the New York Stock Exchange, Schwab's system roared to life
without a sputter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like leaving a car out in the cold all night, then
climbing into it and revving it up to 100 miles per hour without
warming it up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Hier-King knows full well, hardly a week goes by without
an outage at a major E-commerce site, whether online brokerage
services s like Schwab, Etrade (www.etrade.com) and Ameritrade
(www.ameritrade.com) or merchants like the bookseller Amazon.com
(www.amazon.com) or the auctioneer Ebay (www.ebay.com). The week
before last, for example, trading on Ebay was shut down for nearly
22 hours, because of a software glitch.
</P>
<P>
   Colossal as such failures may seem, though, if you pull back the
curtains on so-called mission-critical Web operations, it is a
wonder that they do not crash all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting each Web site and every transaction is a huge
technological undertaking that can involve hundreds of computers,
thousands of miles of network cable, hundreds of software programs
and dozens of engineering employees, some of whom are upgrading
systems on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   There are numerous points of vulnerability, ranging from the
failure of multimillion-dollar mainframes, to programming errors,
seemingly innocuous software glitches or human stumbles. The site
of SecureTax.com, (www.securetax.com) for instance, a Web site used
by hundreds of thousands of customers to prepare and file taxes,
crashed on April 11 when a $200 network circuit card failed and in
another instance in March because an employee tripped on a power
cord.
</P>
<P>
   More often, though, the challenge lies in building (some would
say cobbling together) a collection of cutting-edge technology that
was not necessarily designed with E-commerce traffic in mind _ or
at least not traffic that grows so quickly. The Schwab site, for
example, had 75 million page hits one day in mid-April, more than
double the peak one-day traffic as recently as December.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like preparing an aircraft carrier to go to war,'' a
Schwab spokeswoman, Tracey Gordon, said of the daily efforts to
keep afloat a site that has already capsized eight times this year.
</P>
<P>
   Keynote Systems Inc., a company in San Mateo, Calif., that
tracks the reliability of E-commerce sites, has concluded that the
major online brokerage firms, probably the most technologically
demanding sites on today's Web, are accessible much more than 90
percent of the time. Schwab says that its own site is operable 99
percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Given all the variables, achieving such reliability figures is a
``mind boggling'' technological feat, in the view of Gene Shklar,
Keynote's vice president for marketing. But he notes that when
customers have their own trading dollars on the line, they expect
perfection.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the more daunting problem for many E-commerce
sites is not so much the threat of angering or losing customers,
but the prospect of attracting new ones in droves.
</P>
<P>
   James M. Marks, E-commerce specialist and managing director at
Deutsche Bank Securities in New York, said that Web site outages
were largely a result of surges in traffic that seemed
inconceivable a year ago. ``They just blew out the trend line,''
Marks said of brokerage sites in particular. ``They are in a
desperate race to stay ahead of the capacity issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, before the Web site has a chance to fail, a company
will close it down intentionally. At the personal-finance software
publisher Intuit Inc., for example, the company took down the
online tax preparation and filing portion of its Web Turbo Tax site
for 14 hours on April 12 _ three days before the tax filing
deadline _ for a scheduled maintenance and back-up of the filing
data.
</P>
<P>
   The timing was far less than ideal, but Intuit had designed the
network to make weekly maintenance necessary, said Elizabeth
Dougherty, product manager for Web Turbo Tax, an online tax
preparation and filing service. Such precautions might be
understandable: for the 1998 tax year, some 388,000 tax returns
were filed via the Web site _ a tenfold increase over the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
   Because Intuit's main business is selling packaged software, not
offering online services, a three-day sabbatical may be survivable,
if not ideal, from a customer relations standpoint. In the case of
Web companies whose entire business depends on a continuous
bitstream, like the online auction provider Ebay, even a day's down
time can be disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, June 10, Ebay's site crashed at 7:50 p.m.
California time and did not return to service until 5:30 p.m. the
next day. Officials of the Santa Clara, Calif., company estimate
their lost transaction revenues at $3 million to $5 million during
the blackout.
</P>
<P>
   The problem _ a corruption of the files used for listing auction
items and submitting bids _ involved software from Sun
Microsystems. But Ebay executives are not ready to assess blame,
since they still do not know the precise cause, even though
technicians from Ebay, Sun and other outside vendors spent the
subsequent weekend trying to inoculate the system against a
relapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been any number of things,'' said an Ebay
spokesman, Kevin Pursglove. ``They're still working on root-cause
analysis.''

Undated: root-cause analysis.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In essence, E-commerce is a field so new, that the standard
operating manual has yet to be written. That is one reason Ms.
Hier-King of Schwab is on the scene every trading day at 6 a.m.,
not simply to head off trouble, but hoping to learn whether there
are any patterns to be gleaned from the seeming chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Although she claims to be continually on edge, Ms. Hier-King
presents a picture of calmness. Her office is immaculate, a single
piece of paper on the desk in front of her reminding her in her
tiny, meticulous handwriting of the events of the day before and
the tasks of the day to come. Only the ball of Play-Doh she keeps
next to her keyboard betrays Ms. Hier-King's inner turmoil.
Throughout the day, she will squeeze, twist and pull the putty _
the intensity varying with the Web activity playing out on the
screen of her Pentium II Compaq Deskpro and the trading activity as
reported by MSNBC or CNNfn on the screen of the television that
hangs from her office ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, Schwab's site is currently designed to
accommodate 264,000 simultaneous users. The peak so far was 60,000
simultaneous users one day in April.
</P>
<P>
   But for each individual customer interaction, there are
opportunities for a crash-causing error to occur at numerous points
along the transaction route, which begins when a customer logs on.
</P>
<P>
   When customers first arrive at the Schwab site, they are
actually linking up with Schwab's data center in Phoenix, some 500
miles away from Ms. Hier-King's San Francisco monitoring station.
It is the data center's 152 Web server computers that essentially
store and dish up the main Schwab Web pages. These so-called
gateway servers, which can cost $60,000 each and are made by IBM,
are typically not the cause of an outage, because of load-balancing
software that evenly distributes the incoming customer traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Customers who choose to trade stocks are sent from these 152
gateway servers to one of 84 IBM ``middleware'' computers. The
middleware machines, which can also run $60,000 apiece, act as
translators, conveying the incoming trading data over
ultra-high-speed internal lines to one of seven multimillion-dollar
IBM or Hitachi mainframe computers.
</P>
<P>
   The mainframes store and process most of the crucial data in the
transaction, like customer balances, and they include dozens of
programs that can cause a system crash _ whether the programs that
control customer data or account balances, or those that govern
links to the stock exchanges or those that support communication
with Schwab's internal telephone customer service and sales agents.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the data center running _ or scrambling to the rescue
when it falters _ are more than 250 engineers and technicians,
whose managers are in frequent contact by telephone, pager and
e-mail with Ms. Hier-King back in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   On the wall of the data center, a half-dozen color flat-panel
monitors, each six feet tall and five feet wide, display graphical
charts reporting the status of various network elements. The key
indicators are sets of bar graphs representing the level of
mainframe activity for such vital functions as updating customer
portfolios and updating trades. A green graph means the mainframe
is nimbly handling its load. But when a graph turns red, that means
the mainframe is laboring or has even seized up _ and that the Web
site may be in danger of crashing.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, a problem is beyond Schwab's control. The
initial step of a customer transaction, for example, involves
logging into the Schwab sites from the customer's own Internet
service provider. Delays can occur on the service provider's
computers or along the way on the network backbone that carries the
service provider's consolidated traffic.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, a problem with the Schwab data center might the
responsibility of an outside provider of hardware or software. On
April 26, for instance, a program on one of Schwab's mainframe
computers hit a snag. The software then did what it was supposed to
do under such conditions _ phone home.
</P>
<P>
   But when the automatic dial-up call reached the East Coast
office of the software's maker _ which Schwab declined to identify
_ a technician there entered a command that was supposed to
remotely fix the software error, but instead caused the program to
freeze altogether. That, in turn, froze the entire Web site for
more than 45 minutes during trading hours.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Schwab must shoulder its share of blame. Back on Jan.
8, when the site crashed, the fault lay in the failure of the data
center's own technicians to configure software correctly when
trying to shift part of the workload from one mainframe to another.
Drawing perhaps from such experiences, Schwab announced with IBM
last week that the companies planned jointly to develop
load-shifting technology for the online brokerage industry.
</P>
<P>
   On the recent day that began at dawn with a stopwatch, Ms.
Hier-King was able to put her Play-Doh aside as the trading session
rang to a close on Wall Street some six and a half hours later. She
took a moment to remark upon the remarkable: that against
considerable odds, the Charles Schwab online trading system had
once again withstood the onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arthur Clarke said that any significant technological
achievement is magic,'' she said, referring to the science fiction
writer. By such measure, ``the Web is magic,'' she said. ``The fact
that a single trade can travel the Net and take place in under 20
seconds is magic.'' &QL;

 &HT;    New 'Twin Towers' gives Nicks fits
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After the NBA's first duo with the designation ``Twin
Towers'' failed to win a championship, the game eventually went
away from the concept of employing two 7-footers in tandem.
</P>
<P>
   But 13 years after Ralph Sampson and Hakeem Olajuwon missed
against the Celtics in 1986, their one chance together with
Houston, the latest set of ``Twin Towers'' is proving dominant.
</P>
<P>
   Two games into the Finals, Tim Duncan and David Robinson have
combined for 14 blocked shots and have so intimidated the Knicks
they have been unable to get things done in the paint.
</P>
<P>
   While Jeff Van Gundy insists his players must get to the line
more often, the fact remains they have been out-shot 66-31 from the
line and no one is seriously complaining about the officiating.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson says he and his partner have made life miserable for
the Knicks, who he says are trying to attack the basket. ``I think
it's pretty frustrating for them because they're doing a lot of
pump faking with their 6-6, 6-7 guys inside. It's going to be
tough. I mean they have to foul us really. And there's going to be
that disparity. They get a lot of their bucks in transition, off of
jump shots and you don't get a lot of fouls that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Knicks guard Chris Childs explains, ``You have to adjust your
shots because of their length. You still have to take the ball to
the basket. We have to make better decisions once we get in there
and that's not what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   They may be involved in a national championship, but on Father's
Day, but basketball players make time for their children.
</P>
<P>
   David Robinson's flew here Sunday to celebrate the day with
their dad. Avery Johnson's children already were here and he said
he was going to mark the day by taking them to the famous toy store
FAO Schwartz and then to a museum or a movie and then to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also may spend some time on my new personal computer they
got me for Father's Day,'' Johnson said. ``I'm the ninth guy on our
team to get a computer, so I'm way behind and I want to start
catching up.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Duncan, eligible to sign a long-term contract for as much as
$85 million, has not committed to the Spurs beyond next season
because he wants to see if the city of San Antonio will insure the
team's future in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, does not mean Duncan has eyes for a city like New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a big city guy,'' he said Sunday. ``I come from a
small island (St. Croix). I went to Winston Salem for college (Wake
Forest), started in San Antonio for my professional career. I'm not
a big city guy. It's a great city, a lot of fun. I don't know if I
could live here for any extended period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is the math that works against the Knicks with an 0-2
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Only two teams have come back from 0-2, the 1969 Celtics against
the Los Angeles Lakers and the 1977 Portland Trail Blazers against
Philadelphia. Both lost their first two games on he road and got
back on track at home.
</P>
<P>
   No team has ever come back from 3-0 or 3-1 to win the Finals.
Six teams have come back from 3-2, most recently Houston in 1994.

 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ So, here are the San Antonio Spurs, two victories shy
of winning their NBA championship, two quick road victories away
from going 15-1 in the playoffs. Not even the Michael Jordan
Chicago Bulls ever did that.
</P>
<P>
   So, here is Jeff Van Gundy, who always appears frazzled, but
outwardly remained calm at an off-day practice in his home arena
Sunday, charged with finding a way to derail this San Antonio team
that is bigger, deeper, healthier and, not coincidentally more
talented, than his own depleted Knickerbockers.
</P>
<P>
   There are 18 million people, 13 newspapers, 11 radio outlets,
maybe 16 TV and cable outfits who insist that Van Gundy ought to be
able to do something to alter the outcome of this series _ not to
mention Dave Checketts, the guy who runs Madison Square Garden and
refuses to endorse his frumpy coach.
</P>
<P>
   So faced with the task of turning water into wine, gristle into
fillet mignon, Van Gundy is trying to balance fantasy and reality
as the NBA Finals advances into game 3 at 9 p.m. tonight in Madison
Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   What New York wants is for Charlie Ward, the former football
quarterback, to literally get lost. Ward and, to a lesser extent,
his alternate Chris Childs who is shooting 3-for-16, have become
the poster boys for everything that has happened to the Knicks in
this series.
</P>
<P>
   Ward, the starter, has not been able to run the offense _ the
Knicks are shooting .356, averaging 72 points. He has become the
target of extreme invective, particularly from NBC's Bill Walton.
In what may have been an unprecedented attack on a player by a
network analyst, Walton after game 2 Friday night called Ward's
play ``disgraceful'' He further called the player ``a disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday Ward was also reminded of harsh criticism levied
against him by the Nets' Stephon Marbury, who said the Knicks could
never win a title with him at the throttle. That led Ward to say in
his soft voice that he cares not what any man says about him, so
long as he is right with God.
</P>
<P>
   The critics in this city have little interest in Ward's peace of
mind. They simply don't want him on the floor. Van Gundy is being
urged to go with a backcourt of Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston,
a front line of Marcus Camby, Larry Johnson and Kurt Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of perspective, remember that Van Gundy took his
team from 21-21 with eight games left in the season to the
championship and he no longer has starting center Patrick Ewing,
who was lost in the Eastern finals with a torn Achilles. Van Gundy
sees opportunities, but he also sees problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't go with less than eight players,'' Van Gundy
explains with some patience. ``Three healthy 'bigs' (Camby, Johnson
and Thomas) , one guy who is a little hobbled (Chris Dudley). So
you're gonna start three of the four and they're all getting in
foul trouble simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secondly, make all the changes everybody wants _ Marcus, Kurt,
Larry, Allan and Latrell _ then you're bench consists of two points
guards (Ward and Childs) and an unhealthy Chris Dudley. It's a
viable option that you can use in short spurts but I don't think
there's some panacea out there that says if we start a certain unit
that we're guaranteed of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   In its ardor to help the Knicks, the New York Times suggested
Sunday that deposed general manager Ernie Grunfeld should have
picked up another big man somewhere along the way, but the paper
did not have a player in mind. But that's one more knock to put on
the man who changed the Knicks by dealing Charles Oakley for Marcus
Camby and by pushing for the Sprewell deal that sent John Starks,
Terry Cummings and Chris Mills to Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it has become crystal clear to most that the Spurs
are much of what's wrong with the Knicks and Van Gundy's main
concern is that his team not suffer the same fate that befell the
Minnesota Timberwolves, Los Angeles Lakers and Portland Trail
Blazers in games 3 of their playoffs series with the Spurs. ``Teams
fell apart against them,'' Van Gundy said (average margin of loss,
12). We want to hang tough against them.''
</P>
<P>
   With so few players available _ Herb Williams and Rick Brunson
are out of the question _ the Knicks are much like the Atlanta
Hawks, whom they vanquished in the second round of the playoffs.
The question is whether they show a great capacity to fight back.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As PC Expo gets under way this week at the Javits
Convention Center in Manhattan, the show's organizers are sounding
a theme of ``smarter, faster, cheaper'' and highlighting the trend
toward powerful, portable devices that combine computing and
telephony.
</P>
<P>
   But among personal-computer manufacturers, the theme might as
well be ``where have all the profits gone,'' as cutthroat
competition continues to erode the industry's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Compaq Computer Corp., the world's largest PC
manufacturer, announced that it would lose 15 cents a share in the
current quarter, compared with analysts' estimates of earnings of
20 cents, even as it aims to reduce operating costs by $2 billion.
Compaq's difficulties led to a first-quarter shortfall in earnings
and the ouster of Eckhard Pfeiffer as president and chief executive
in April.
</P>
<P>
   IBM Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. have both found profitability
elusive in their PC divisions in recent quarters. And even Dell
Computer Corp., with the most efficient business model in the
industry, traded market-share gains for a small drop in profit
margins last quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Among major players, the resurgent Apple Computer Inc. has
bucked the trend with growing sales, earnings and profit margins.
But Apple will not be at PC Expo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The present industry trend is going to make Expo-like shows
totally unfeasible, because nobody is going to have enough gross
profit to invest in them,'' said Seymour Merrin, a PC industry
consultant with Merrin Information Services.
</P>
<P>
   The industry ``has taken profitability and thrown it out the
window,'' he said. ``They think they've bought market share, but it
only lasts until someone else has a lower price. We have trained
the customer to expect the world for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   And prices continue to fall. Last week, Compaq announced the
5300 series, which will be available in retail stores starting at
$599 without a monitor. Gateway Inc., the second-largest direct
seller of personal computers, said it planned to introduce a PC for
less than $800 in an effort to increase unit shipments, and Dell,
which had long avoided low-end machines and first-time buyers,
introduced its first PC for less than $1,000, the $899 Dimension L.
</P>
<P>
   With the conventional desktop PC increasingly a commodity that
sells almost purely on the basis of lowest price, manufacturers
have to look to other parts of the product line for profits. Small
portable devices are one area of increased emphasis, as are
ever-slimmer, more powerful laptop computers, like Psion Enterprise
Computing Ltd.'s Netbook, a 2.5-pound, Java-based portable, and
IBM's Windows 98-based Thinkpad 240.
</P>
<P>
   ``One theme you're seeing is products that are wireless, rugged,
connected and powerful,'' Randy Zane, a spokesman for PC Expo,
said. ``We're seeing an explosive growth in remote access. We're an
information technology event for business, and all these products
are used by business professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   Another area of differentiation consists of large PC servers,
microprocessor-based machines that are used by numerous people
across an internal network or, increasingly, to support electronic
commerce over the Internet. These machines are called on to perform
tasks once relegated to minicomputers or mainframes and there is a
seemingly endless appetite for more power.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   IBM will be showing a new version of its Netfinity Server, with
eight Intel Pentium Xeon 550-megahertz processors _ the first of
its kind _ as well as a piece of software that allows eight of
these machines to be clustered to act as one powerful computer.
</P>
<P>
   IBM is also showing the Netfinity Switch, a dedicated piece of
hardware that allows customers to tie together from 12 to 1,000
servers, should anyone need to do that. ``Margins on the high-end
Netfinity products are well above 20 percent,'' Michael Corrado, an
IBM spokesman, said. ``What we're talking about is beyond the
commodity level.''
</P>
<P>
   Software is another way PC vendors hope to differentiate their
products. For example, Hewlett-Packard is showing a new version of
its software for server management, Web QoS, for the Windows NT and
Linux operating systems. Previously implemented on HP-UX,
Hewlett-Packard's own version of the Unix operating system, to
manage Web-site traffic, Web QoS will now be available on PC-based
servers for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
   And some vendors say that margins appear to be stabilizing.
``Demand is healthy,'' Joe Marengi, Dell's senior vice president
and group general manager, said. ``The component costs have taken
on a more normal decline, compared to last year, and pricing is
stable. As long as you can keep operating expense growing at a
slower pace than your revenues, then you will be fine in a
profit-and-loss sense. Some of our competitors have forgotten
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Dell long eschewed the sub-$1,000 space and the
first-time buyers that come with it, Marengi said declining
component costs have made such machines viable, and the Internet
has made the cost of servicing those customers less onerous. ``We
think this will be incremental business for us,'' he said. ``At the
end of the day, we wouldn't go into this market if we couldn't make
money at it.''

&HT;    WESTERN LEADERS DETAIL PLAN FOR AIDING BALKANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: ADDS 5th graf with possible cost.) (rk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ Leaders of the seven wealthiest nations and
Russia outlined a plan Sunday for ending eight years of war in the
Balkans through a vast program of aid and political support, but
said Yugoslavia must undertake ``democratic and economic reforms''
to take part.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a three-day summit meeting, the leaders of
Britain, France and Germany said that in their view, democratic
reform in Yugoslavia would have to involve the departure of
President Slobodan Milosevic, but in deference to Russia no
explicit reference to him was included in the final statement.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton advocated a meeting of Western and regional
leaders in the Balkans in the next few months and said he would
attend. Such a meeting, unprecedented since Yugoslavia began to
unravel in violence in 1991, would symbolize a commitment to draw
the Balkans into the West and highlight Milosevic's isolation,
Western officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president got agreement from the leaders that there should
be a Balkan conference, in the Balkans, sometime in the
not-too-distant future,'' National Security Adviser Sandy Berger
said.
</P>
<P>
   The exact amounts involved in Balkan reconstruction are still
vague. The European Union has pledged $500 million a year for the
next three years for Kosovo alone; Western officials say as much as
$30 billion over the next five years may be needed for the region
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin, looking puffy and uncertain on
his feet, joined the other leaders Sunday for the concluding hours
of the summit meeting and then talked for an hour with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In a determined effort to cast the encounter with Yeltsin in the
most positive terms Western leaders, including Clinton, avoided any
reference to contentious issues such as what sort of aid _ if any _
should be given to Serbia and what sort of orders should be sent to
the Russian troops who raced to the airport in Pristina, capital of
Kosovo, earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, there were no visible disagreements and the meeting
of the leaders of the United States, Britain, Germany, France,
Canada, Italy, Japan and Russia ended about an hour earlier than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   A final communique stated their support for a number of
important causes, including debt relief, lifelong education, more
employment, a balance between social security and greater personal
initiative, democracy in Nigeria and peace in the Middle East. But
the main thrust of the discussions was on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The positive, sometimes patently relieved tone of the meeting
seemed to reflect a growing conviction that the ethnic wars in the
region that have left more than 200,000 people dead and forced
millions of people from their homes may at last have exhausted
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The final statement called for ``the creation of a democratic,
multiethnic Kosovo.'' It added: ``The return of refugees and
displaced persons to their homes and the assurance of security for
all persons including Serb and all other minorities in Kosovo will
be high priorities of the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Serbs, afraid of reprisals from returning Kosovo Albanians,
have fled since the 11-week war ended. The Serbian government is
now urging them to go back, and several hundred reportedly did so
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said the eight countries would ``fully cooperate
with the work of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia,'' which indicted Milosevic last month. But it made no
reference to the acts of Serbian forces in Kosovo during the war.

CLIFTON FADIMAN, A BOOKWORM'S BOOKWORM, DEAD AT 95 
</HEADLINE>
  
 Repeating for all needing. 
(ATTN: Fla.) (rk) 
 By RICHARD SEVERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clifton Fadiman, the essayist, critic, editor and indefatigable
anthologist whose encyclopedic knowledge made him a mainstay of
``Information Please'' and other popular radio programs in the late
1930s, '40s and '50s, died Sunday on Sanibel Island, Fla. He was 95
and lived on the nearby island of Captiva.
</P>
<P>
   Fadiman, who also helped establish the Book of the Month Club
and served on its editorial board for more than 50 years, was a
bookworm's bookworm. He learned to read when he was 4 and he never
got over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I opened and read the first page of a book for the first
time, I felt this was remarkable: that I could learn something very
quickly that I could not have learned any other way,'' he said.
Fadiman added that he ``grew bug-eyed over the miracle of
language'' and that his enthusiasm for ``decoding the black
squiggles on white paper'' never ceased. ``One's first book, kiss
or home run is always the best,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His interest in literature was accompanied by a formidable
memory. And so it seemed he was literally born to be an
anthologist; over six decades, he assembled more than two dozen
anthologies dealing with everything from the beliefs of leading
intellectuals to poetry to mathematics to prose to limericks and
the atrocious pun. If his knowledge seemed encyclopedic, it was
understandable; he served on the Encyclopedia Britannica's
editorial board for many years.
</P>
<P>
   He also created Treasury of the Encyclopedia Britannica, for
which he read or skimmed approximately 200 years of the
encyclopedia's editions and then condensed this into a 700-page
volume. He admitted he had not read every word the Britannica had
ever printed, but with his knowledge of history and literature and
his ability to read 80 pages an hour, he got through more of the
encyclopedia than most people would.
</P>
<P>
   Of primary importance to Fadiman was ``The World Treasury of
Children's Literature,'' which he assembled in the mid-1980s. There
were volumes for children ages 4 to 8 and 9 to 14. He created these
anthologies not only because he was interested in children's
literature but also because he felt that it was necessary to
involve children early in reading if literacy was to survive
television.
</P>
<P>
   Fadiman said he feared that society was passing ``into an
entirely new techno-culture in which reading will be a very
secondary or tertiary occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kip Fadiman (friends called him by his childhood nickname) was
especially proud of his Encyclopedia Britannica entry on the
history of children's literature; to study the subject he learned
to read child-level Italian, Spanish, Swedish and Dutch when he was
in his 70s.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s and '50's, Fadiman's presence in and influence on
American intellectual life were ubiquitous. He prided himself on
his skill as a popularizer and on his ability to make lofty
subjects accessible to people who lacked his education and acuity.
</P>
<P>
   This made him the target of such critics as Dwight MacDonald,
who in the 1950s accused him of being a high priest of ``Midcult,''
contaminating American culture with what MacDonald saw as the
``tepid ooze'' of phony intellect. Other critics said that
Fadiman's creativity was not the equal of his memory. But Fadiman
was never defensive about what he was or what he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a profound thinker,'' he once said. He said he saw
himself rather as a guide, someone who could help other readers
pick the titles that suited them. During the middle part of the
century he had a good sense of what Americans wanted to read and
was an important national taste maker.
</P>
<P>
   But as the years passed, his influence waned; Americans seemed
less interested in the great works of classical literature that he
loved and more attracted to certain of the newer novels in which,
he said, ``the sex scene is mandatory about every 40 pages.'' He
thought such writers went too far, thereby leaving ``nothing for
the poor guy or woman to work on actively in their bedroom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to discover things for yourself, I've found out,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-FADIMAN-OBIT-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Clifton Paul Fadiman was born on May 15, 1904, in Brooklyn, the
son of Isidore Michael and Grace Elizabeth Fadiman, Russian-Jewish
immigrants. His father was a pharmacist, his mother a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   His elder brother, Edwin, encouraged him to read, and by the
time he was 10, Clifton was reading Homer, Sophocles, Dante and
Milton. He quickly showed a great interest in the intellectual
history of Western civilization and would walk to and from the
library, two miles round trip, with his eyes fixed on the printed
page. He took pride in being able to sense curbs with his
peripheral vision so that he did not have to stop reading just to
cross the street.
</P>
<P>
   Fadiman graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Columbia University in
1925. While at Columbia, he urged his classmate Whittaker Chambers
to read ``The Communist Manifesto.'' His first job out of college
was as a teacher at the Ethical Culture High School (now
Fieldston), where he remained until 1927. He also lectured, from
1923 to 1933, at the People's Institute of New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1920s he was a top editor at Simon &AMP; Schuster,
remaining there until 1933, when he left to become book editor of
The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   In his 10 years at The New Yorker he favored ``clarity above all
in what I read.'' Thus he gave high praise in his reviews to
writers like Sinclair Lewis and was not an admirer of writers like
Gertrude Stein and William Faulkner. Earlier, he had been a book
reviewer for The Nation.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1938, Dan Golenpaul started a radio program
called ``Information Please'' and asked Fadiman to be its
moderator. Regular panelists included John Kieran, Franklin Adams
and Oscar Levant. Their lively discussions gained a reputation for
wit and erudition and soon won an audience of nine million.
</P>
<P>
   These listeners submitted questions and if any of them were able
``to stump the experts,'' Fadiman rewarded them with sets of the
Encyclopedia Britannica.
</P>
<P>
   When the program was taken off the air in 1948, Fadiman was
sought after as a lecturer. During this same period, he also
appeared on other radio shows, most notably ``Quiz Kids,'' which
put questions to bright young people. Other programs in which he
participated included ``Mathematics,'' ``Alumni Fun''and
``Conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1952 he was the host of a popular television show called
``This Is Show Business,'' which featured a panel that included
George S. Kaufman and Abe Burrows.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his life, he urged young people to be serious and to
read classic literature. ``Books,'' he said, ``are not rolls, to be
devoured only when they are fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades readers encountered Fadiman in his introductory
essays in the Modern Library to such classics as ``War and Peace''
and ``The Short Stories of Henry James,'' in his contributions to
special editions of such books as ``Moby-Dick'' and ``The Pickwick
Papers,'' in anthologies like ``Reading I've Liked'' and ``I
Believe,'' in newspaper and magazine articles and in a monthly
column in Holiday magazine called ``Party of One.''
</P>
<P>
   And for years thousands of readers were guided by his literary
suggestions, especially through the Book of the Month Club and
ventures like The Reader's Club, an organization that distributed
books reprinted on the advice of Fadiman, Carl Van Doren, Sinclair
Lewis and Alexander Woollcott.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the author, with renowned wine merchant Sam Aaron,
of ``The Joys of Wine,'' an exhaustive book on a subject that, like
cheese and cigars, was a favorite indulgence. In his essay ``Brief
History of a Love Affair,'' he told of his lifelong passion for
wine. ``I think of ourselves as a model couple,'' he wrote,
``faithful, mutually solicitous, still ardent, and in the case of
the lady, well preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   He lost most of his sight as a result of acute retinal necrosis
in his late '80s. But according to his daughter, Anne, also a
writer, he continued to vet manuscripts for the Book of the Month
Club, as he had since 1944, by listening to unabridged tapes of the
volumes specially recorded for him by his son Kim. He dictated his
assessments to a secretary. He continued to participate, by way of
conference calls, in the club's editorial board meetings until
March.
</P>
<P>
   While blind he brought out a new edition of ``The Lifetime
Reading Plan,'' a guide done with John S. Major that was intended
to introduce Americans to the classics of civilization, and he was
the general editor of ``World Poetry: An Anthology of Verse From
Antiquity to Our Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in his life the book world honored him for his love of the
printed word by awarding him the 1993 National Book Foundation
Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Fadiman's marriage to Pauline Elizabeth Rush, an editor, ended
in divorce. In 1950 he married Annalee Whitmore Jacoby, a
screenwriter and the co-author with Theodore H. White of ``Thunder
Out of China.'' In addition to his wife, his daughter, Anne, of New
York, and his son Kim, of Sanibel, Fla., he is survived by another
son, Jonathan of Concord, Mass., a brother, William Fadiman of Los
Angeles, six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Clifton Fadiman had a fondness for people's last words and wrote
an essay about them called ``Some Passing Remarks on Some Passing
Remarks.'' He once told his daughter that his favorite parting line
was that of the 18th-century English writer Mary Wortley Montagu:
``It has all been very interesting.''

URGENCY TO STREAMLINE GRIPS AIRBUS WITH BOEING'S REBOUND 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PARIS _ The Boeing Co., on the ropes the past two years as it
reeled from a series of production and financial difficulties, is
coming back as a leaner and a more formidable competitor than
before.
</P>
<P>
   And if rival Airbus Industrie hopes to be Boeing's competitive
equal in the new millennium, it must get its act together and
transform itself from a loose consortium of sometimes bickering
in-laws into a more streamlined and efficient centralized company.
</P>
<P>
   That was the warning sounded again and again last week by
European leaders as the world's aerospace industry came together
for the last time this century at the biennial Paris Air Show.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest and oldest air show on the planet ended Sunday, with
Airbus facing the most sweeping changes, and challenges, since it
was founded 30 years ago out of fear that European aerospace
technology could be snuffed out by the dominance of Boeing and
McDonnell Douglas Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Though much has been written of the progress Airbus has made _
at Boeing's expense _ in capturing nearly 50 percent of airplane
orders, the Airbus partners are at an historic crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   Noel Forgeard, the likable Frenchman who is Airbus managing
director, told the Financial Times of London on the eve of the air
show, ``One nice morning we will wake up and discover that Boeing
has recovered, that they've solved their production problems and
that they're better than we are.''
</P>
<P>
   He echoed that view a few days later at an air show news
conference when he told reporters that competition with Boeing ``is
going to be even fiercer'' in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our competition is the Boeing that will be in three years,''
he said in making the case that Airbus must, as soon as possible,
become a single corporate entity, or SCE as it is called in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   That transformation to a single corporate entity was supposed to
have taken place earlier this year. Instead, it has been delayed
until at least next year. The sticking point has been trying to
determine the valuation of each partner's assets.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Boeing's apparent rebound, a new sense of urgency has
taken hold inside and out of Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   One day after Forgeard's news conference, aviation ministers
from Germany, France and the Britain met at the Paris show and gave
the four private companies now controlling Airbus _ DaimlerChrysler
Aerospace (Dasa), British Aerospace, Aerospatiale Matra and Spain's
Construcciones Aeronautics (Casa) _ until the end of summer to come
up with a concrete plan for turning Airbus into a single corporate
entity.
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize the point, Siegmar Mosdorf, Germany's industry
minister, said Dasa will provide no money for the planned Airbus
A3XX super jumbo until ``we have a complete integration plan
leading to a single corporate entity.''
</P>
<P>
   The A3XX is supposed to be launched next year, assuming Airbus
can line up enough customers to justify the $11 billion or more in
development costs. Airbus believes the A3XX, which will be able to
seat upwards of 500 passengers, is the final piece needed in its
plan to sustain a 50 percent share of the commercial market with
Boeing. The Seattle-based aerospace giant now enjoys a monopoly
with the 400-seat 747.
</P>
<P>
   Forgeard said Airbus can build the A3XX under its present
corporate structure, but most industry analysts don't agree.
</P>
<P>
   The problems and limitations of the archaic Airbus structure
have been more obvious than ever in recent weeks, and they all but
overshadowed the achievements made by the airplane maker as it
celebrated at the Paris Air Show the 30th anniversary of the launch
of its first airplane, the A300.
</P>
<P>
   Leading up to the air show, which is an important world stage
for Boeing and Airbus to showcase their products and achievements,
civil war had broken out between Aerospatiale Matra, the French
Airbus partner, and DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, the German partner,
over where to build the new A318. The A318 is a 100-seater that
Airbus is offering to airlines as an alternative to Boeing's new
717.
</P>
<P>
   Aerospatiale Matra wanted the A318 to be assembled in Toulouse,
where it builds the A320 and the widebody Airbus planes.
DaimlerChrysler Aerospace wanted the new plane assembled in
Hamburg. The A318 is a shortened version of the A319, which is
built there.
</P>
<P>
   As part of an agreement announced by Forgeard at the air show,
Hamburg will get to assemble the A318, but some A319 assembly work
will be shifted to Toulouse.
</P>
<P>
   But the dispute served to underscore that Airbus is a
politically conceived company with an encumbering bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airbus is crippled by politics and Boeing has been crippled by
money _ they lost investor confidence,'' said Richard Aboulafia,
chief aviation analyst with the Teal Group, a market research firm
in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus was formally created on Dec. 18, 1970, under French law
as a Groupment d'Interet Economique, the French term for a grouping
of economic interests.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, the Airbus partners are each
guaranteed a piece of the work. The planes are assembled in Hamburg
and Toulouse, but the British make the wings, the Germans and
French make parts of the fuselage and the Spanish make the
elevators and horizontal stabilizers.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus, at its headquarters in Toulouse, markets and sells the
airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   If Airbus makes a profit, it splits the net among its
shareholders, with Aerospatiale Matra and Dasa each holding 37.9
percent, British Aerospace holding 20 percent and Casa holding 4.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the Paris Air Show, The German partner, Dasa,
announced that it had reached agreement to acquire Casa, the
smallest of the Airbus partners. The combined company will be the
largest shareholder in the consortium.
</P>
<P>
   The current organization of Airbus is hardly a model of
efficiency. All that Forgeard and his management team control are
sales, marketing and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the Airbus structure into a single corporate entity
would, the argument goes, force Airbus to reduce costs and improve
efficiencies by possibly closing factories and combining
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Airbus has been able to make dramatic market share
gains against Boeing in part by undercutting the airplane prices of
its U.S. competitor. As a single corporate entity, however, Airbus
would be more responsible to shareholders and would have to compete
by building cheaper airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Boeing executives welcome the coming
transformation.
</P>
<P>
   But not all of the Airbus gains against Boeing have come because
of this discount war. Airbus has simply done the better job on
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   This is what British Midland Airways Chairman Sir Michael Bishop
had to say at an April press conference when he announced the
carrier had broken with tradition and decided to buy 20 Airbus
A321s rather than Boeing's 757.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been a Boeing customer for a long, long time, since
1970, over 25 years. ... Boeing is a great, great company, but all
great companies have their peaks and troughs. This has been a
trough for Boeing ... I'm sure Boeing is going to be a supplier to
British Midland in the future, but I do think they felt they were
more invincible than they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airbus made a fantastic sales pitch to us in 1997. We had the
same salesman from Airbus for three years knocking, knocking,
knocking at our door. We must have seen six different sales teams
at Boeing, different people switching in and out. Airbus made a
consistent approach to us. They've actually backed that up with the
quality of the product.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Airbus last year had almost as many orders as Boeing, and
is even or slightly ahead this year, it is far behind in production
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Boeing delivered a record 560 planes and expects to
deliver 620 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus delivered 229 planes in 1998 and will deliver fewer than
300 this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of being able to deliver airplanes, Airbus is still
only half the equal of Boeing,'' said aerospace analyst Peter
Jacobs of Seattle's Ragan MacKenzie firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing still remains the dominate player. If the trend
continues over the next five years or so, then Airbus may grow to
the size of Boeing. But the jury is still out. They must become a
single corporate entity and expand production.''
</P>
<P>
   Aboulafia, the Teal Group analyst, said Airbus may well be able
to build as many airplanes as Boeing, but the question is whether
they can produce the higher value widebody planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airbus needs to generate capital to sell new airplanes,'' he
said. ``Given the current structure, that's problematic. Unless
they do something about that, they are going to have a very hard
time attracting capital. They are stuck in the old way, of going to
the government with cap in hand, versus the new way of going out
and saying, `We are a good company, invest in us.' They are stuck
between these two worlds.''

STARS' WINNING GOAL LIKELY TO BE DEBATED FOR YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By delicious coincidence, the National Hockey
League's board of governors will meet Monday in New York to
discuss, among other things, the use of videotape replays to
determine if goals should be nullified when an attacking player
precedes the puck into the crease. The board could revoke a
three-year-old procedure that has provoked a discordant debate, one
that reached a boil over the weekend with a controversial
conclusion to the Stanley Cup playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   A disputed goal by Brett Hull that was allowed to stand won the
championship for the Dallas Stars early Sunday morning, a 2-1
victory over the Buffalo Sabres in the third overtime at Buffalo's
Marine Midland Arena. The Sabres, who lost the game and the debate,
said a replay proved that Hull's goal was technically illegal and
should have been voided because his skate preceded the puck into
Dominik Hasek's crease. League officials ruled otherwise. Hull
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was I interfering with Hasek?'' Hull said. ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull's goal, at 14 minutes 51 seconds of the third overtime,
gave the Stars their fourth victory in six games in the
championship round and their first cup since the franchise was
formed in Minnesota as the North Stars in 1967. In the six
close-checking and often passionate games, the Stars scored 13
goals and the Sabres nine. The last tense test of will and
endurance ended at 1:30 a.m. By then, the ice was worn out and so
were the players and spectators. Joe Nieuwendyk of the Stars, who
won the Conn Smythe trophy as the most valuable player in the
tournament, said: ``We had nothing left. They had nothing left.
Thank God it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing left except the arguments, and they could rage for
years. Lindy Ruff, the Sabres' coach, stood on the sidewalk outside
the arena at 3:30 Sunday morning, accepting thanks from passing
fans (``Great season, Lindy!'') while pleading his case again to
reporters. Inside, a half-dressed Hull sat atop a locker, high
above the loud music and the splashing champagne, stretching his
battered limbs and hooting that he did not care what anyone thought
_ after 14 seasons, he could no longer be labeled an underachiever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the world has left me, it's off my back, it's done,
we did it, and I don't have to answer to anybody,'' said the
34-year-old son of Bobby Hull, who put his name on the cup in 1961
with Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff contended that Hull, after capturing a loose puck, put his
left skate in the crease before he shot the puck. Apparent goals of
this nature are often waved off after video review. Ruff charged
that league officials were reluctant to review the goal because the
Stars' celebration was already in progress and to call it off and
resume the game would be ``the worst nightmare'' for the league.
Ruff said commissioner Gary Bettman turned his back on him when he
appealed for justice.
</P>
<P>
   But Bryan Lewis, the league's director of officiating, insisted
that he and other video judges reviewed the tapes at least half a
dozen times, even while the Stars celebrated. They ruled the goal
legal, Lewis said, because an attacking player is allowed to enter
the crease ahead of the puck as long as he is in control of the
puck. A memo dated March 25, sent by the league's senior vice
president, Colin Campbell, to general managers and other officials,
anticipated this and other situations and addressed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``An attacking player maintains control of the puck but skates
into the crease before the puck enters the crease and shoots the
puck into the net,'' the memo said, in Section 9. ``Result: Goal is
allowed.'' The rationale, according to the memo, is the same as
that governing offsides at the blue line, where part of a player's
body may precede the puck into the attack zone as long as he is in
control of the puck with other parts of his body. A close
slow-motion viewing of the Hull tape seems to show that the puck
and all parts of Hull's body were out of the crease at the instant
he began to take control of the loose puck by kicking it with his
skate to the blade of his stick, before his left foot entered the
painted area of the crease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a stupid rule,'' Hull said of video review for crease
violations. ``It's the No. 1 rule they have to address.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff scoffed at the league's justification of continuous puck
possession and predicted the governors would amend the rule. ``It
will be changed, obviously,'' Ruff said. ``They'll call it the
`Sabres rule.''' Ruff said the league was ``reaching for an
explanation'' by saying Hull was in control of the puck before
entering the crease. Joe Juneau of the Sabres said: ``Everybody
jumped on the ice and they were afraid to make the call. Everybody
will remember this as the Stanley Cup that was never won in '99. It
was not a legal goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the final round, Bettman discussed the rule's other
consequence: the disallowing of goals. ``The rule itself, as we now
apply it, works,'' Bettman said. ``The problem is whether or not it
is a good rule. I have a real question about relying on the replay
too much and taking some of the energy and excitement out of the
building when a goal is scored and people are worried about whether
or not they can cheer.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time the cup has been won on a disputed
goal by a road team in a Game 6 overtime. In 1966, the Montreal
Canadiens beat the Detroit Red Wings at Olympia Stadium on a goal
by Henri Richard, who, the Wings charged, swept the puck into the
net with his arm as he slid along the ice. Had this happened in
1999, the goal would have been reviewed on videotape and possibly
negated. Back then, there was no video review. The goal stood and
the Canadiens won.
</P>
<P>
   That game, theoretically, could still be in progress. Among
Detroiters of a certain age, this issue lives. And so it will be
with Buffalo fans. Such are the causes of hockey.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once again, the Knicks find themselves behind the eight ball. A
pair of double-digit losses to San Antonio in the championship
series has put the Knicks down by two games to none.
</P>
<P>
   The last time his team was in this position, Jeff Van Gundy,
faced with the loss of Patrick Ewing and the surging Indiana
Pacers, relented and put Latrell Sprewell in the starting lineup.
Sprewell had been a spark off the bench, but Van Gundy conceded
that he needed a spark at the beginning of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Now against the taller, stronger Spurs, Van Gundy's Knicks need
all the sparks they can muster. The answer is clear: Van Gundy has
to start Marcus Camby. This is the final piece of the puzzle, the
final evolution to the new, flexible Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm overestimating Camby; maybe all he can do is fly
around the basket and tip in missed shots, or maybe we have seen
just a hint of what he can do. He is talented enough and versatile
enough to keep the Spurs' post players occupied for an evening or
two _ or three. At this juncture, down by 2-0, playing Camby off
the bench is like having Secretariat pull a milk wagon.
</P>
<P>
   But the coach seems caught once again in the throes of loyalty;
he can't let go.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, someone asked Van Gundy whether he planned to remove
Larry Johnson from the starting lineup. The source of the Knicks'
woes has been the matchup between Tim Duncan and Johnson, the
smallish small forward who has been roasted by Duncan in both
games. Duncan has enjoyed two games of uncontested target practice
on offense, and on defense, he smothers Johnson, who has never been
a threat around defenders to explode to the basket for thundering
dunks. This is a series in which anything less than thundering
playground-like dunks, or attempted dunks, gets rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-foot Duncan, towering over the 6-foot-5-inch Johnson, has
scored 58 points in two games, making 22 of 38 shots. When he has
missed, it has not been because of L.J. You have an excellent big
man, with youth, health and soaring confidence against a smaller,
injured veteran whose confidence has been punctured.
</P>
<P>
   But Van Gundy, perhaps trying to hide a secret strategy, said
absolutely not _ there would be no switch. ``As far as Larry not
starting, I don't think that's in our best interest,'' he said. ``I
think we need his. . . .'' Van Gundy paused and thought better of
using the word offense. ``He hasn't shot the ball well, but if
we're to win this series, he has to be efficient to help us do
that; that's why I'm keeping him in the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny how two participants have opposite views of the same
event. When Mario Elie, San Antonio's rough and ready guard, was
asked about Johnson, he said: ``The man's not 100 percent. But he's
a warrior. He wants to help his team win. But I feel like now it's
hurting them. With him having to guard Tim and David, he's
6-foot-5, and they're 7-foot and they're a handful.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Van Gundy reminded us that it's not the start but the
finish that matters. That may be true in life, but in these rituals
of sport, where life is framed by quarters and innings, fast starts
are crucial. From the outset in each of the first two games, Duncan
has flown out of the block and built so much momentum that by the
time Camby comes in, there's simply too much inertia to contend
with. This was the same conundrum that forced Van Gundy to start
Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   Camby has been the Knicks' good corporate soldier, through a
morass of double talk. Sunday he parroted Van Gundy. ``The lineup
that we have right now has been effective, has been working,'' he
said. ``We've started games real well, we just haven't finished
that in-between part.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby hinted that there might be a line change aimed at
attacking Avery Johnson, the Spurs' point guard. ``Maybe we can go
to a bigger lineup to go at Avery a little bit more, to post him
up,'' he said. ``We have options. When the time is right, Jeff is
going to use them.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Knicks' two-game deficit and San Antonio's confidence
surging, the time is now. And Avery Johnson is not the Knicks'
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Seems odd. Here we are on June 21, Game 3 of the National
Basketball Association finals, and we're still lobbying for one
final lineup change. But that's the unexpected beauty of this
Knicks team: flexibility, fluidity. Players go down, and the lineup
is rearranged and suddenly corresponds to the opponent's weakness.
Now the Knicks, with a desperate need to attack, can insert Camby
in a starting lineup to join Sprewell and Houston and have them
joined intermittently off the bench by Johnson, Childs and Kurt
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   But Van Gundy says no, and you have to assume he knows best. He
gets paid millions _ now several millions _ to work these things
out. What he sees up close is what we see at a distance. Except
that in this odd Knicks season, in which allegiances and alliances
have clouded judgment and tempted rational people to abandon
objectivity and clarity, closer has not necessarily meant better.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that is the lesson of this season, this series, Monday
night's game and even this slogan _ Free Marcus: Save the Knicks. &QL;

CONCERT BROADCAST IS A FIRST FOR WEB  
 THE COST OF INTELLIGENCE  
 A DAY FOR TECHIES

<P>
   The music industry notion of a ``live album'' has always been
something of an oxymoron, considering that albums are, by
definition, recordings. Now Woodstock.com, an Internet music
start-up, is about to raise the semantic stakes. The company has
announced what it bills as the first pay-per-view Webcast of a live
event _ even if the concert in question did take place last year.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, at 9 p.m. ET, the company will offer a pay-per-view
Webcast of a Sarah McLachlan concert, offered simultaneously via
pay-per-view cable television in many cities through Spring
Communications. The performance was recorded in April 1998 in
Portland, Ore., at the end of Ms. McLachlan's ``Surfacing'' tour.
</P>
<P>
   The Webcast is apparently aimed at people who are such zealous
McLachlan fans that they would be willing to watch her performance
in a small portion of a PC screen in the choppy video still
characteristic of Webcasts. Or maybe it will attract viewers who do
not subscribe to cable or do not live in the right cable markets.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the Web viewers will be drawn by the discount: $7.95
for the nearly two-hour concert, compared with $14.95 for the
television version.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans are not going to be having a broadcast-quality
experience, so we didn't want to charge them for one,'' Rand
Bleimeister, chief executive of Woodstock.com, said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the show does not draw a large Web turnout, Bleimeister
predicts that pay-per-view Web concerts will eventually be a big
business, as the technology improves.
</P>
<P>
   Woodstock.com says that the Webcast will be the first to use new
video-streaming technology from Microsoft that allows a user's
password to work only at a single location. This feature is a
breakthrough for Internet vendors because it prevents multiple
users from dodging the pay-per-view fee by sharing the same stream.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodstock.com name comes from Woodstock 99, the rock
festival to be held in Rome, N.Y., July 23 through 25;
Woodstock.com is the official site of that show, which will mark
the 30th anniversary of the original concert. The company plans to
Webcast the festival live _ in this case, as it is actually taking
place.

   For a Price, Intelligence on Viruses and Worms
</P>
<P>
   As the malicious computer worm known as Explore.exe ripped
through computer networks across the globe over the last two weeks,
it took a heavy toll on corporate systems. But could the attacks
have been predicted?
</P>
<P>
   That is a question prompted by a new information service begun
this month by Infrastructure Defense Inc., a year-old company based
in Alexandria, Va., that conducts research into what its founder,
James Adams, author of a dozen books on covert warfare and
intelligence, terms information warfare. On Monday, June 7, the
company began sending daily news briefings to corporate clients,
intended to serve as advance warnings on the latest computer
viruses, worms and hacker plots.
</P>
<P>
   The service's first big test came the next day _ Tuesday, June 8
_ when the company learned of the worm and began warning its
charter clients, which include Microsoft and Citigroup. That was
two days before widespread invasions of Explore.exe began to be
reported. On the other hand, it was two days after the first signs
of the worm were noted on Sunday, June 6, by some people involved
in computer security.
</P>
<P>
   As Jerry Irvine, a company spokesman, said, ``It's very
difficult to give a heads up to something that's happening in real
time.''
</P>
<P>
   To gather its information, the 35-person company devotes as many
as 20 staff members to eavesdropping on Internet chat groups and
monitoring Web sites where hackers and computer virus writers are
known to congregate. It also employs automated searching tools,
called spiders, to search the Internet for key words that might
lead to new sources of vulnerabilities.
</P>
<P>
   It is still not known who created the Explore.exe worm and
turned it loose, though it is believed to have originated in
Israel. Generally, though, the company, also known as Idefense,
says its form of intelligence gathering should help companies stay
apprised of the more organized efforts within the underground of
computer hackers.
</P>
<P>
   Such intelligence does not come cheap. For $20,000 a year, an
Idefense customer will receive general daily reports. For $100,000,
a client company gets a more specialized report devoted to that
company's particular network needs and vulnerabilities.

   `Techies Day' Is Aiming to Clear Up a Misconception
</P>
<P>
   With the demand for technology workers expected to double in the
next four years, and with the supply of such workers chronically
low, the Education Department and several commercial partners are
planning this week to declare Oct. 5 as National Techies Day. A Web
site is already in place (www.techiesday.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a perception problem around this area,'' said Doug
Berg, chief executive of Techies.com, a job recruitment site that
is supporting the observance. ``People think everyone in it is all
geeks and nerds, and kids don't think it's a fun career. But it's
the funnest, most riveting career out there.''
</P>
<P>
   And all this time people had thought stock options were the big
draw.

ORDONEZ AND HIS OFFENSE DESERVE CREDIT FOR VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ If ever a position player deserved a ``W'' beside
his name in the box score, it was Rey Ordonez. And it was for his
offense on Sunday, not his defense.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez had three hits, scored three runs, including the tie
breaker on a heads-up play, and drove in two key runs to lead the
New York Mets to a come-from-behind 9-6 victory over the St. Louis
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   The Busch Stadium scoreboard said there had been no errors. But
there were mental errors aplenty. And Ordonez capitalized on two of
them on the base paths to lead the comeback, as the Mets finished
off this road trip, 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez raced home from second base on infield grounders twice _
including for the go-ahead run _ to help the Mets (38-31) to their
11th victory in their last 14 games. Mike Piazza, meanwhile,
singled twice to extend his career-best hitting streak to 23 games,
one shy of Hubie Brooks' club-record 24, set in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   So the Mets are back where they were before they went on an
eight-game losing streak: seven games over .500 and in the thick of
the postseason chase. They are off Monday before playing Florida
three games at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Mets rallied from a 6-2 deficit with a five-run
sixth inning, Rick Reed (5-3) was credited with the victory, even
though he allowed six runs and eight hits in five innings. The last
of the Cardinals' runs came on a three-run bomb from Mark McGwire,
his 21st home run of the season and second in two days.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, it could be argued, earned the decision only because there
was no way to give it to someone else _ like Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing like an All-Star,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said
of Ordonez, mindful that his shortstop trails Cincinnati's Barry
Larkin by only a few thousand votes in the balloting for the
midsummer game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my decision,'' Ordonez said, when asked if he would
be interested in being in Boston on July 13 to make his first
All-Star appearance. ``But yes, I want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, he deserves to, too.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Ordonez was benched one game by Valentine for
throwing a tantrum the day before, when Ordonez saw he was not in
the lineup. Since being reinserted in the lineup on April 24,
Ordonez is hitting .333 (50 for 150) to raise his average from .170
to .294.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a decent average for just about anybody. But in
Ordonez's case, it is more like a transformation. The 26-year-old
shortstop has won two Gold Gloves in a row, but he was a career
.242 hitter in the majors before this season and had never hit
higher than .257 in any one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more relaxed right now,'' said Ordonez, who admitted he
had stubbornly refused to listen to others' advice for most of the
last three-plus years. ``And I'm playing every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Added third-base coach Cookie Rojas, who was interpreting for
Ordonez, ``And he's using the whole field now.''
</P>
<P>
   And the base paths.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Ordonez created a run on Sunday was in the top of
the third inning, when he was on second base and caught McGwire
napping at first. While Roger Cedeno was legging out an infield
hit, Ordonez never stopped running, as Rojas waved him home.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire paused as if to question the call of the first-base
umpire, Greg Bonin, on Cedeno, and by the time McGwire realized
Ordonez was flying home, it was too late. Ordonez scored without a
throw to start a two-run rally and erase the 2-0 lead Ray Lankford
had given St. Louis with his first-inning home run.
</P>
<P>
   The second run that Ordonez created was all his own, Rojas said.
</P>
<P>
   With the Mets trailing by 6-2 entering the sixth inning, John
Olerud, Piazza and Robin Ventura delivered consecutive singles off
Jose Jimenez for a run. One out later, Benny Agbayani _ who was 3
for his previous 25 _ grounded a run-scoring double over third
base. Now it was 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Up stepped Ordonez against the reliever Rick Croushore. Ordonez
lined a two-run single past a diving second baseman Joe McEwing to
tie the score at 6-6.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez took second on pinch-hitter Matt Franco's groundout.
Then it was Croushore's turn to freeze. Cedeno pulled a grounder
between first and second, enough to lure McGwire into the hole.
McEwing fielded the ball and tossed to Croushore, who was racing
Cedeno to first. The throw was a little awkward, and Cedeno got
there first.
</P>
<P>
   Croushore, meanwhile, went tumbling. He glanced at third to
check Ordonez, who had stopped after rounding third. Croushore,
seeing that Ordonez was taking a step back toward third, looked
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was stupid,'' Croushore said. ``I sat there for a second.''
He said he was going to give the ball to McEwing. ``I could have
sworn I heard something behind me,'' Croushore said. ``I don't know
if I thought it was the ump calling timeout. But I looked behind
me.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ordonez shot off for home, easily beating Croushore's throw
from his knees, and the Mets led, 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored twice more in the top of the ninth, and then
John Franco closed out his 17th save in 18 tries.

ANGELS BEAT YANKEES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For a week the Anaheim Angels look tired, scared and
not too hungry, perched on a South Bronx street corner with nowhere
to go.
</P>
<P>
   They waited for a break that never came, a base hit that meant
something, a manager with a smile on his face. They waited for a
game like Sunday's, when all that happened and then some.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just one break that made the difference in a 4-2
victory in front of 55,626 fans at Yankee Stadium. There were at
least six breaks, including a phantom catch by Reggie Williams at
the right-field wall that should have tied the game in the eighth,
but wound up being an inning-ending double play that helped break a
six-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly trailing Texas by nine games in the American League
West didn't look so bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it isn't September, but we were facing an absolute
must-win situation today,'' said first baseman Darin Erstad, who
had three hits and drove in the Angels' final two runs. ``If we
continued to play this way, it could be a season that is over at
the All-Star break.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead they head to Erie, Penn. today for a game against the
Angels' Double-A affiliate before moving on to Seattle for three
games against the second-place Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   In one day they will leave New York for the seven-inning
exhibition, fly to Fargo, N.D., to refuel and reach Seattle
sometime Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   It's a veteran's nightmare. But imagine if they had lost Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a great win going into Erie,'' Angels starter Tim
Belcher (5-6) said, laughing after pitching eight solid inning.
``It gives us a lot of confidence. They don't stand a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   He can laugh now, but he spent the ninth in the trainers room
``biting my nails.''
</P>
<P>
   Closer Troy Percival, who hadn't pitched in a week, took over
and quickly allowed a walk, a base hit and an RBI single by Tino
Martinez. With Derek Jeter at third and Martinez (the tying run) at
first, Tony Tarasco fouled off six pitches, including a blooper
down the left-field line that was foul by no more than an inch. He
popped out.
</P>
<P>
   Chili Davis was next and he hit a blooper to the same spot that
landed just a foot foul. He walked to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was agonizing,'' manager Terry Collins said. ``But how many
times during the past few weeks had those been just an inch fair?''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius, almost a .400 hitter last year with runners in
scoring position, grounded into a double play to end the game, and
the Angels rejoiced. Percival, who threw a fist in the air, later
said mechanical problems created poor velocity and location.
Collins hugged him anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all we've been through, that ninth inning was like
climbing Mt. Everest,'' Belcher said.
</P>
<P>
   The other eight were pretty amazing, too.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the second inning, Garret Anderson hit a slow
roller to third. Replays showed that Brosius' throw beat Anderson,
but first-base umpire Mark Johnson ruled him safe. After struggling
Troy Glaus struck out, former Dodger Matt Luke hit a two-run homer
in his first start as an Angel. If Johnson makes the right call,
Luke never comes to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been struggling and maybe this was just their day,''
said losing pitcher David Cone (7-3). ``I threw him a 2-0 fastball
down and away and tried to finesse him. He hit it into the upper
deck.''
</P>
<P>
   An inning earlier, Belcher, who needed just 88 pitches, had
runners at first and second with two outs. The defending World
Series champions had already won the first two games of the series
and looked ready for the sweep.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill hit a sharp one-hopper over the first-base bag that
could have scored both. Instead, Erstad made a diving stop and
raced to the bag to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game had Darin all over it,'' hitting instructor Rod
Carew said. ``He had three hits, but he also stole a base and
showed the kind of aggressiveness that we really need.''

 &HT;    Daly blows cool, takes an 11 at 8th
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ Big John Daly and big numbers seem to go
together as smoothly as his favorite snack, Oreos and milk, even in
a major championship.
</P>
<P>
   Daly took 11 shots on the par-4 8th hole in Sunday's final round
of the U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2, risking a fine by the PGA Tour
when he swatted a ball in motion across the green before it could
roll back to his feet a second time.
</P>
<P>
   Joining other Daly blow-ups, most recently a 6-putt from eight
feet at the Memorial, the hole pushed him to an 83 and a finish of
29-over 309. He received a two-stroke penalty for hitting the ball
as it was rolling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told myself and I told (caddie) Brian (Alexander) that if
that ball dares to come back down the hill, I'm going to do what
Kirk Triplett did last year _ take my two shots so I just don't go
stupid,'' Daly said. ``It's frustrating. I lost my patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly's worst hole was an 18 last year at Bay Hill's sixth hole
in the fourth round. He took a 12 at Atlanta Country Club's eighth
hole in the 1996 BellSouth Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Daly vows he will not play next year's U.S. Open at Pebble
Beach, saying, ``The U.S. Open is not John Daly's style of golf.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to go to Pebble and watch the USGA ruin that
golf course, either,'' said Daly, who apologized on the 10th hole
to playing partner Tom Kite for the tirade.
</P>
<P>
   The 11, blow-by-blow:
</P>
<P>
   1 _ Drive.
</P>
<P>
   2 _ Approach over the green.
</P>
<P>
   3 _ Putt back up slope to green rolls back.
</P>
<P>
   4 _ Another putt back up slope rolls back.
</P>
<P>
   5 _ Hits putt while still rolling and sends ball across and off
front of the green.
</P>
<P>
   6 _ Chip back to front of green.
</P>
<P>
   7 _ Putt 10 feet past hole.
</P>
<P>
   8 _ Putt to just left of hole.
</P>
<P>
   9 _ Taps in.
</P>
<P>
   11 _ After two-stroke penalty for hitting ball in motion.
</P>
<P>
   Love never threatened
</P>
<P>
   One of the pre-tournament favorites, Davis Love III opened with
a 70 and never made a contending move. He shot 72 Sunday and
finished at 9-over 289. ``I just didn't hit my irons good enough,''
Love said. ``I didn't get close enough to the pin. I knew this
course would stand the test. If we had four sunny days with no
rain, 15-over would have won.'' . . . After a solid opening 69,
Columbus' Larry Mize found the opposite Saturday with a nightmarish
84, when the course turned windy and wild. The 1987 Masters
champion shot a 76 Sunday for 24-over 304. ``I just picked a bad
time to have a poor iron game and not make any putts,'' Mize said.
While he heard Jack Nicklaus say during a practice round that No.
2's greens were the toughest he ever had putted, Mize cited the
real problem as ``the slopes that run you off the greens and down
in the little valleys and swales. I've never putted so much from
off the green in my life.'' . . . Paul Goydos' wife, Wendy, pulled
a brain cramp Friday. Temporarily misplacing her wedding ring when
she removed it to wash her hands, she decided to tell Paul about it
while he was waiting on the fifth tee. He parred the hole. She
found the ring and told Paul, who eventually would go from 67 to
74, on the next hole. . . . The head of Ted Tryba's sand iron flew
off the shaft as he played a bunker shot at the 18th hole. . . .
U.S. Amateur champion Hank Kuehne, who will turn pro this week,
finished with a 78 for 26-over. ``I had a good week,'' he said. ``I
didn't finish last. I probably beat about 100 guys.'' . . . Tim
Herron, who played with Tiger Woods Sunday, defeated a 15-year-old
Woods in the second round of the 1992 U.S. Amateur. . . . European
fans had little to cheer about this week, beginning with the hand

YANKEES LOSING THEIR MARGIN FOR ERROR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mo.)   By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees have lost their compass, the magnetism
that steered them safely through the crossroads that appear in
every game. They have been a team that gets the big outs, but
Sunday, there was David Cone making a costly pitch. They have been
a team that gets big hits, like they were blessed with a special
power, but a botched umpire's call left them feeling fated.
</P>
<P>
   They have been a team that starts and finishes rallies, but
after jabbing away at the Anaheim closer Troy Percival in the
bottom of the ninth and thrilling those who remained in a sellout
crowd of 55,626, the Yankees were knocked out, 4-2. They have been
a team that buries mediocre opponents, and yet for the third
consecutive series, they failed to sweep after winning the first
two games.
</P>
<P>
   They lead the American League East with a 39-28 record, but it
is hard to say whether the Yankees are going north or south; since
May 7, they are 20-19, and for every sign of progress there have
been setbacks. Their starting rotation is doing well now, but they
aren't hitting consistently. Their bullpen has been terrific, but
their defense often lousy. They had great reason to be frustrated
with the first-base umpire Mark Johnson Sunday, but the Yankees
have rarely created margin for error this season.
</P>
<P>
   After a respite Monday, the Yankees may have to resume their
schedule without right fielder Paul O'Neill, who could be sidelined
for a few days after a frightening incident in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez, the Yankees' first baseman, broke his bat hitting
a pop-up, the wood snapping just above Martinez's hands. The barrel
of the bat somersaulted wildly in the air toward the on-deck circle
and caromed off O'Neill's thigh, just above his knee. O'Neill _ who
never saw the broken bat flying in his direction _ fell to the
ground, and though he took his at-bat and singled, he was replaced
before the next inning.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, O'Neill said his leg was bruised and sore, and
the Yankees are unsure whether he will be out of the lineup against
Tampa Bay this week. ``It's just a weird thing,'' O'Neill said.
``That will probably never happen to me again.''
</P>
<P>
   Mistakes by Johnson, the umpire, weren't quite so rare Sunday.
Replays showed he probably missed a call in the second inning,
after Garret Anderson rolled a ground ball to third base that Scott
Brosius barehanded and threw to first.
</P>
<P>
   Safe, Johnson called, and with two out, Matt Luke slugged a
two-run homer into the upper deck off Cone. But the Yankees really
weren't upset with Johnson for that: It was a close call, several
said, and Cone felt he made a terrible pitch to Luke, after falling
behind by two balls and no strikes. ``I don't want to blame the
game on breaks or bad luck,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson missed another call at first base in the sixth _ the
umpire said Martinez's foot was not on the bag, and replays showed
that it was _ but Johnson infuriated the Yankees in the bottom of
the eighth inning. Jorge Posada was on first with one out, and
Chuck Knoblauch smacked a high drive to right field off Tim
Belcher.
</P>
<P>
   Angels right fielder Reggie Williams, who had just entered as a
defensive replacement, misjudged the placement of the wall, backing
and bumping into it, and reaching up with his glove for Knoblauch's
drive. Posada, at second base, saw the ball ricochet off the wall
and bolted for third (As Posada acknowledged with a smile later,
his eyesight was deemed perfect when tested last week).
</P>
<P>
   The ball caromed down, off Williams' neck or head, and he
juggled it in front of him briefly before gathering it. Johnson
called Knoblauch out, ruling that Williams caught the ball on the
fly, and Williams fired to first to double off Posada and end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees Manager Joe Torre didn't argue, having a poor vantage
point from the dugout, but the Yankees' relievers, stationed in the
bullpen in left-center field, were screaming and hollering that
Knoblauch's drive had thumped against the wall. ``You could hear
it,'' one pitcher said, ``and you could see it easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, replays showed Johnson was wrong _ the ball went
over Williams' glove and hit the wall _ and that Johnson had hardly
moved from first base. ``It's not necessarily impossible'' for
umpires to see that kind of play, Torre said dryly, ``if they move
toward it, like they're supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels scored in the ninth to move ahead, 4-1, and Percival
entered in the bottom of the inning to close out the Yankees,
having shut them out for 211/3 consecutive innings. But he allowed
a walk and a hit, and another hit and a run, and soon the Yankees
had runners at first and third and nobody out, with the potential
winning run at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Tarasco smashed a liner over third, down the line, and
thought he saw the ball land and raise chalk _ a foul ball, by an
inch or so. On the 10th pitch of his at-bat, Tarasco popped up.
Chili Davis also ripped a ball down the left-field line _ foul, by
a foot, the crowd groaning again. If either liner had been fair,
the Yankees would have at least tied the game.
</P>
<P>
   Davis walked on Percival's 26th pitch of the inning, loading the
bases for Brosius, and Brosius went to a full count. But he bounced
to third baseman Troy Glaus, who stepped on the bag and threw to
first _ double play _ and the Angels' six-game losing streak was
over.

KOSOVO REBELS SIGN DISARMAMENT PACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The Kosovo Liberation Army's status as a
military force officially ended early Monday morning as NATO and
the rebels signed an accord providing for the demilitarization of
the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   The accord states that the KLA must follow a strict timetable
for placing its weapons in storage depots, taking down roadblocks
and checkpoints and stopping its fighters from appearing in public
in military uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is a turning point in our mission to establish an
enduring climate of peace and security for all the people of
Kosovo,'' British Lieutenant General Michael Jackson, NATO's Kosovo
commander, said at the signing ceremony a few minutes after
midnight in the provincial capital of Pristina. Hashim Thaci,
political head of the KLA also signed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   And as the last of Yugoslavia's troop's left Kosovo a half-day
ahead of schedule, the United Nations hoisted its blue flag over
the former Yugoslav Army headquarters here and NATO formally
declared an end to its bombing campaign Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But the hard work of making peace, rebuilding a devastated
province, returning hundreds of thousands of refugees, and actually
disarming the KLA is still months, perhaps even years, away.
</P>
<P>
   Identifying and dismantling the land mines and booby-traps that
litter the countryside, UN officials say, will almost certainly
take years.
</P>
<P>
   Some doubt whether the ravages of this war can ever be healed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the greatest challenge the UN has faced since
the launching in the late 1940s of the concept of peacekeeping,''
said Sergio Vieira de Mello, head of the UN mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As the last column of the 40,000 Yugoslav troops rolled out of
northern Kosovo hours ahead of Sunday's UN-imposed deadline, they
towed broken-down tanks and military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said they believe only stragglers in the Yugoslav
Army are left behind, but expressed concern that members of the
brutal and murderous Serb paramilitary forces have switched to
civilian clothing and are staying on in Serb villages.
</P>
<P>
   The province's infrastructure is severely damaged. In an early
assessment, UN officials said 50 percent of the housing in the
province is damaged or destroyed. Government institutions such as
police and courts are nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations plans the monumental task of trying to
rebuild Kosovo and attempting to keep the peace amid the chaos and
the seething atmosphere of vengeance on the part of returning
ethnic Albanians refugees and fear on the part of the Serb
population left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful that the departure of the Serbian troops would leave
them vulnerable to attacks, thousands of Kosovar Serbs are fleeing
in an exodus that mirrors the flight of ethnic Albanians two months
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has tried to conceal the
Serb exodus, which he reportedly sees as a sign of defeat his
enemies could use to unseat him. The government has prevented the
refugees from getting near Belgrade, blocked their attempts to set
up tent cities, and urged them to go home to the province many
Serbs consider the cradle of their culture.
</P>
<P>
   Some reports indicated that thousands of Kosovar Serb refugees
were being loaded onto buses and forced back to the province they
had fled.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the ceremonial UN flag raising here on his first day
heading the mission in Pristina, de Mello seemed to recognize the
difficult task ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please bear with us if we do not respond instantaneously to
the many challenges that are emerging day after day. . . . We will
try to cope,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The UN mission will begin by trying to help the province put
into place a 3,000-member police force and to establish a newly
fashioned judicial system and an interim government.
</P>
<P>
   The future of Kosovo will depend in large part on what the KLA
rebels do. Since the peace deal, the rebels have been asserting
themselves across the province, even appointing an administration
and police force in the city of Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   A top KLA official, Mehmet Hajrizi, said the group intends to
``transform itself into a security force for Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The intention runs up against NATO's insistence that it will be
the sole security force for the time being. And Sunday NATO forces
continued the thorny task of demilitarizing the rebels. At
checkpoints around the province Sunday, NATO troops were stripping
KLA soldiers of hand grenades and machine guns even before the
demilitarization agreement was reached.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the KLA agreed to stop carrying weapons in
many parts of Kosovo and to place anything bigger than a sidearm or
hunting rifle in storage within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also calls for the rebels to maintain a
cease-fire, expel all foreign members, and respect the
peacekeepers' authority on security matters.
</P>
<P>
   Buja Bukoshi, who is the former prime minister of the so-called
shadow government established by Albanian Kosovars, said Kosovo
must rebuild a government ``that belongs to the people who live
here.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of his return to Kosovo since the fighting
began, Bukoshi said, ``The first phase of euphoria and enthusiasm
will end. And in the next phase we will have to face reality.''
</P>
<P>
   A glimpse of just how complex, and explosive, that next phase
will be was evident on the streets of the northern city of
Mitrovica Sunday. Deep divisions between the minority Serbs and the
ethnic Albanians seemed only to be widening since the Serb forces
withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian Kosovars, who for nearly three months hid in fear
in their apartments, camped in the surrounding mountains, or fled
to refugee camps, were on the streets looting and burning Serb
homes and stores.
</P>
<P>
   At a shoe store, a dozen ethnic Albanian Kosovars smashed the
window and lugged out bags full of leather dress shoes and Nike
sneakers. NATO forces in the area did little to stop them. At
approximately 2 p.m., gunfire erupted on Ducica Street.
</P>
<P>
   A Serb man in the building was taken into custody by French
paratroopers assigned to police the town. From the back of the
armored personnel carrier he said he was shooting because Albanians
had broken into his home.
</P>
<P>
   Two Albanian men were also detained and a machine gun was taken
from one of the men.
</P>
<P>
   ``That man was in the police forces. He knows what he did,''
said an ethnic Albanian woman, referring to the Serb man in
custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deserves everything he gets,'' she added bitterly.
</P>
<P>
   As the NATO forces moved in and tried to restore order, an
elderly Serb couple emerged from the building with bags and boxes
full of their belongings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it, we can't stay here if we want to live,'' said
Ratome Istanisovic, 60, who struggled with his wife to carry the
few belongings they could gather.
</P>
<P>
   The couple said they were going to a predominantly Serbian
neighborhood across town where they felt they would be safer.
</P>
<P>
   They walked to a bridge that has become a new dividing line,
separating the southern and predominantly Albanian part of town
from the Serbian north.
</P>
<P>
   NATO tanks flanked both ends of the bridge as an angry crowd of
Serbs gathered on the northern side and a jeering crowd of
Albanians gathered on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb crowd was stopping anyone they suspected of being
ethnic Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a de facto dividing of the city going on,'' said S.
Jesseume, a French paratrooper in one of the tanks. ``We do not
have the forces to keep these people from hurting each other. Can
you imagine if we had to go to protect each person? We can't do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   An ethnic Albanian, Agim Hassani, shook his head as he watched
the looting going on and the yelling and taunting back and forth
across the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the future,'' he said. ``Look at what is happening. I
am afraid that there are only worse things to come.''

DUDLEY'S CRUSADE IS BATTLING DIABETES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Ore., Pa.)  (rk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sometimes in the middle of a game _ and always during
intermission _ Chris Dudley opens a small black box about the size
of a sewing kit. He pulls out a small needle, pricks his finger and
transfers the blood to a test strip, which is used to read his
blood-sugar level.
</P>
<P>
   If the reading is normal, he can go back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Among all the halftime rituals during NBA games, Dudley's is
easily the most vital. It is the difference between the Knicks'
veteran center coping with diabetes and controlling the disease
completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to know your own body; you have to be your own
doctor,'' Dudley said Sunday after practice as he sat in the
Knicks' locker room. ``The biggest difference from other diseases
is that it's 24-7. You can't take a break. You always have it. It's
not like you can work out hard for a week and then take a week off.
You have to deal with diabetes constantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Game 3 of the NBA finals is Monday night at Madison Square
Garden, where the brawny, 6-foot-11-inch Dudley will pull a black
rubber sleeve over his injured right elbow so he can bang bodies
with San Antonio's 7-foot bookends, Tim Duncan and David Robinson.
His elbow is in enough pain that he is considering shooting free
throws left-handed, his battered body a symbol for how beat up the
Knicks have been the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the icing, electrode stimulation and various physical
therapies are merely a small part of Dudley's preparation. Beyond
testing his blood sugar, he administers four insulin injections a
day into his right or left thigh _ one before each meal and another
before he goes to sleep. He has been doing it since he learned he
had diabetes at the age of 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of scary to be told you're diabetic,'' he said.
``The thing that helped me was that my uncle has it. So I knew
something of it and knew it could be dealt with. The first question
I asked was, would I still be able to play basketball?
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Yes, but you have to take care of yourself.'''
</P>
<P>
   For the past 18 years, that has been his mantra. It has not only
enabled him to thrive as a defender and rebounder the past 13 years
in the NBA, but also inspired him to help children living with
diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   For the last four years, 64 children have traveled to Veronia,
Ore., a hamlet 30 miles west of Portland, where Dudley used to
play. At the camp, called Chris Dudley's Basketball Camp for
Children With Diabetes, they not only learn to dribble, shoot and
rebound better, but they also learn to live with diabetes _ just as
Dudley learned to live with the disease as a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these kids come from areas where they may be the only
kid in school who has diabetes and they've never met another kid
who has it,'' Dudley said. ``And at that age, a lot of kids feel
self-conscious. I think it's real helpful to not make them feel
self-conscious. They learn they're not alone. The other message
they take is, you can do anything you want as long as you take care
of yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the more than 400 NBA players put on off-season
camps that bear their name or likeness. Few attend the camps full
time, instead letting assistants or friends run the drills. Some
athletes show up as a courtesy on the first and last days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris is there morning until night every day,'' said
Christine, Dudley's wife. ``He goes on the slip-and-slide with
them, runs through the drills, talks to them about anything they
want. He never leaves the kids. You literally have to drag him out
of there.''
</P>
<P>
   Children ages 10 through 16 from as far away as Denmark have
attended the camp, whose national profile has helped raise
consciousness about the disease. While in Indianapolis for the
Knicks-Pacers series, the Colts center Jay Leeuwenburg, who is
diabetic, waited for Dudley and visited him after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Dudley had his own diabetic role model growing up. Part of his
childhood was spent in Philadelphia, where the Flyers Hall of Famer
Bobby Clarke dealt with the disease while becoming a hockey legend.
</P>
<P>
   The fraternity of athletes living with diabetes is small, Dudley
being the only known player in the NBA, where high-energy demands
hit the body all game, with the disease. Dudley has Type 1
diabetes, which is usually hereditary and characterized by its
juvenile onset. It is more severe than Type 2 diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, it starts when the pancreas no longer produces
insulin, the hormone that regulates the metabolism of glucose and
other carbohydrates. Once the disease is diagnosed, a constant
balancing act of blood-sugar levels takes place between insulin and
the food a person takes in. If the balance is seriously off, a
diabetic coma is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Dudley's discipline has helped him avoid any episodes. He
remembers feeling dazed his rookie year in Cleveland, and the
trainer's having to run and find him some juice to raise his
blood-sugar level. But that was an isolated incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just times when you know you have it,'' he said. ``You
just have a reaction. You might start having a cold sweat. You're
kind of out of it. Dazed. I don't know how else to describe it.
You're not all there.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has been religious about his routine. Monday will
be just another day Dudley deals with the disease during the
season. He will rise at about 8:30 a.m., test his blood-sugar
level, inject himself in his right thigh, eat breakfast, attend a
morning practice and repeat the process two more times before Game
3. He will test his blood-sugar level as many as 12 times a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shots don't hurt at all,'' said Dudley, pulling out a
syringe about the size of a felt marker from his right pants
pocket. ``See, it's not that long. It's easier than carrying a
needle and a vial. I have the regular set-up at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Christine said: ``If there is a blessing to it, it's made Chris
incredibly tolerant to adversity. He plays through pain. There are
no excuses. He plays through everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he ever wondered why he had to live with this disease
and its daily demands, Dudley said, ``There are times I thought
about that, but I always quickly remind myself that I've been
blessed in a lot of other areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``For one, I can help other kids. When I found out, I told only
my close friends. I didn't tell everybody. And that's one thing we
try to tell kids at the camp, to be open about it. People don't
treat you different.''

   LOS ANGELES _ You knew this was coming. So bring it on.
</P>
<P>
   We're taking nominations for our own annoying millennium sports
project: The 100 worst athletes of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Early candidates include: Eddie ``The Eagle'' Edwards, Jack
Haley, Chuck Nevett, Buster Douglas, Peter McNeeley, Butterbean,
Brian Bosworth, Mel Rojas, Herb Washington (remember the Oakland
A's one-time designated runner?), Bob Uecker, Marv Thornberry,
Mario Mendoza and the entire 1997 Clippers roster.
</P>
<P>
   No golfers, bowlers or dart throwers will be accepted, for
obvious reasons....
</P>
<P>
   _Former Kings owner Bruce McNall has been in solitary
confinement the last four months in the Lompoc pen for abusing his
phone privileges and failing to rat-out a prison guard who assisted
him....
</P>
<P>
   _John Elway's first big post-retirement endorsement is from a
Denver-based jewelry store. It's a trade-for-merchandise deal _
which Janet Elway fully endorses as well....
</P>
<P>
   _What could L.A.'s Arena Football League Avengers possibly be
avenging before they even play their first game? ...
</P>
<P>
   _The latest promotions we're fighting to support are the local
sporting events that stage a live boxing card. Saturday at Los
Alamitos, it's ``Rumble at the Races'' with the scheduled pugilism
taking place a half-hour before the night's first harness race.
It's happened at Del Mar last summer as well. And on July 18,
``Showdown at Mo Town'' features six pro fights starting three
hours before the Angels-San Diego Padres game at 5 p.m.,
specifically aimed at drawing more Latinos to the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers ought to consider this, too. How about some sort of
Jackie Chan-Ho-Park kickboxing exhibition followed by a Carlos
Perez water-cooler Samuri demolition show? ...
</P>
<P>
   _If the U.S. women's national soccer team wins the World Cup,
each player gets a bonus of $12,500 on top of $2,500 for making the
team. The U.S. men who finished last in France a year ago received
$20,000 just for making the team....
</P>
<P>
   _Valerie Still, a former ABA player who was passed up in the
recent WNBA draft because she has been outspoken against the
league, wrote in a New York Times op-ed piece recently, ``I still
believe the WNBA was trying to hide the fact that a majority of the
players in women's professional basketball are homosexual by
selectively marketing heterosexual players. And I said so. Why must
these players have to hide who they really are?'' ...
</P>
<P>
   _The NBA will probably avoid scheduling games on Dec. 31, 1999
or on Jan. 1 or 2, 2000 because of the Y2K scare. That, and the
scare that Dennis Rodman will stumble into one of their games naked
in a New Year's Eve stupor....
</P>
<P>
   _ESPN The Store in Glendale and Torrance have Rodman No.73
Lakers jerseys out on the racks. Just $44....
</P>
<P>
   _Our local Toys R Us also had a Katarina Witt ``Stars On Ice''
Barbie-like doll on the sale-item shelf going for three bucks. And
that's !ital!including her skating outfit....
</P>
<P>
   _And yes, we do watch in horror as Steve Garvey pitches on that
infomercial for stuff called ``Exercise in a Bottle'' and ``Fat
Thrasher.'' That's not how he developed those forearms, ladies and
gentlemen....
</P>
<P>
   _The NCAA recently said it supports a ban on betting on college
sporting events and has renewed its call for media outlets to stop
publishing point spreads on college games. Except the odds of
either of those two things happening are pretty darn slim.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Recently I've been preparing a course for the fall semester,
``Strategies in Prose.'' My writing students, a cohort of fiction
writers in the MFA program at the University of Michigan, will read
modern masterworks like ``The Good Soldier,'' ``To the
Lighthouse,'' ``As I Lay Dying,'' ``A Farewell to Arms'' and
``Ulysses.'' As readers we will focus on aspects of technique, and
the strategy for written assignments is that of emulation, the
close copy and pastiche.
</P>
<P>
   I've taught a version of this class before, both to
undergraduate and graduate students, and the results have been
remarkable. To engage in imitation is to begin to understand what
originality means.
</P>
<P>
   I'm hoping for additional language in the mode of Joyce or
Faulkner, for paragraphs that Ford or Woolf might well have drafted
and cut. While reading Hemingway, for instance, we might take the
final rain-drenched scene of ``A Farewell to Arms'' and see what
would have happened to the mood of its conclusion if the weather
that day had been bright. Or if, instead, it had snowed. What would
happen to the dinner scene at Woolf's Ramsay family table if the
fare were not a boeuf en daube that ``partook ... of eternity'' but
pigs' trotters in wax paper or a fresh-caught trout?
</P>
<P>
   We'll alter intonation, so that Joyce's Stephen Dedalus will
hail from the Deep South; we'll give Faulkner's Anse Bundren the
Irish accent of Leopold Bloom. We'll make Ford's Edward Ashburnam
take a walk with Woolf's Lily Briscoe and see who proposes to whom.
Much of this results in parody, of course, and it requires a tongue
lodged in cheek, but I want to release young writers from the
foredoomed expectation that their work must prove original. I want
them to focus on manner, not matter, to study our great
predecessors in an attempt to analyze not so much subject as style.
</P>
<P>
   It's my conviction, moreover, that the two are inextricable,
that Hemingway's short sentences stand in more than merely
stylistic opposition to Faulkner's long ones. In the former, things
are separable; in the latter, linked. We can tell the way a writer
thinks by looking at his or her desire to use, say, the opposite
comma or, as a sentence nears completion, the subordinate clause.
</P>
<P>
   A system of values attaches to style. In ``To the Lighthouse,''
for example, the protagonist dies in a parenthesis, yet Virginia
Woolf's decision to excise Mrs. Ramsay from the text in such a
manner has as much to do with the conventions of her syntax as it
does with her sense of mortality.
</P>
<P>
   A characteristic device in the punctuation of Ford Madox Ford is
the ellipsis, and this tells the reader something about what's
unsayable or, in a scene, unsaid. There's an important difference,
clearly, between a character whose mode is associative, digressive,
trailing off into silence ... and one who ends his sentence
fragment with exclamation points!
</P>
<P>
   If art is an act of mimesis, a mirror held to nature, then it
follows as the night the day that what we write must be
impersonation, a way of tricking out 26 letters in order to ape
``reality.'' That thing in quotes. We do this unconsciously always,
sometimes consciously, in a kind of infection by inflection, a
nearly viral transmission of a world view via words. And in this
forward-facing moment at the end of the millennium it seems we've
acquired the Janus-faced habit of also looking back.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cunningham's prize-winning book ``The Hours'' is an
extended act of imitation, that sincerest form of flattery; he
enters the world both of Clarissa Dalloway and her creator, Woolf.
``Shakespeare in Love'' is highly allusive, a comedic tip of the
cap to the language of Elizabethan England; the joke of ``Romeo and
Ethel and the Pirate's Daughter'' requires prior knowledge of
``Romeo and Juliet.'' Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey and Maturin novels
constitute an almost uninterrupted foray into the imaginative
discourse of a world at war 200 years ago, and large swatches of
the story pay homage to Jane Austen or borrow from naval accounts.
And these are just the iceberg's tip; present examples abound.
</P>
<P>
   In other forms of performance we take repetition for granted,
and personal expressiveness may even be a mistake. The members of a
dance troupe must follow their choreographer's lead, moving in
trained unison, and woe betide that member of the string section of
an orchestra who chooses an exotic bowing.
</P>
<P>
   The apprentice in an artist's shop might have mixed paint for
years or learned to dado joints for what must have felt like
forever; only slowly and under supervision could he approach the
artifact as such. The French luthier J.B. Vuillaume took his
pattern for stringed instruments unabashedly from his much-admired
predecessor Stradivarius. This is not forgery so much as emulation,
a willing admission that others have gone this way before.
</P>
<P>
   Imitation is deeply rooted as a form of cultural transmission;
we tell our old stories again and again. The bard in training had
to memorize long histories verbatim, saying or singing what others
had sung. In the oral formulaic tradition, indeed, the whole point
was retentiveness; the impulse toward individual expression is a
recent and a possibly aberrant one in art.
</P>
<P>
   In this regard at least the early authors had it easier, had
fewer doubts. They would have found nothing shameful in prescribed
subjects or in avoiding the first-person pronoun. Since the stuff
of the epic was constant, the apprentice could focus on style. A
copyist must pay the kind of close attention to the model that a
counterfeiter does, and though such results may not be art, they
are, when successful, real proof of technique.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible, in other words, that the problem is not what to
write but how to write it, and that a great weight can be lifted
from young writers' shoulders if subject matter is predetermined,
not something they need to invent.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is signature important. The bulk of our literature's
triumphs have been collective or anonymous. Who can identify the
authors of the Bible, the ``Ramayana,'' ``Beowulf''? More to the
point, who cares? The ``Iliad'' and ``Odyssey'' are by an unknown
bard, as are, for all practical purposes, the plays of Shakespeare.
This is not to say that these works don't display personality _ the
reverse is more nearly true _ but rather that the cult of
personality should fade. It, too, is recent and, I think, aberrant;
it has nothing to do with the labor of writing as such.
</P>
<P>
   All this conjoins with the nature of language and our presumed
literacy: a native familiarity with English that more often than
not breeds contempt. No one presumes to give a dance recital
without having first mastered the rudiments of dance, to perform
Mozart before playing scales or to enter a weight-lifting contest
without first hoisting weights. Yet because we've been reading
since age 5, we blithely assume we can read; because we scrawled
our signature when 6, we glibly aspire to write.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So one task of the teacher is to point out antecedents. ``Tom,
you might want to look at what Dick did with this plot device;
Harriet, you might (re)read the novel by X, which your Y appears to
follow.'' And more often than not the student has no notion that
it's been tried before. Often the apprentice has not seen the model
he or she has somehow come to imitate, and there's a way in which
such ignorance is bliss, a precondition of the imagination engaged.
Yet Ezra Pound's injunction ``Make it new'' predicates some
knowledge of what was yesterday's news.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore my students in September will look at the use of
incantatory repetition, not the meaning of the snowstorm in ``The
Dead.'' We'll study image clusters in Virginia Woolf, and the way
the lighthouse looks to the separate characters who look at it, and
why a sentence that has commas differs from one that does not. By
semester's end these writers may not know the map of Dublin or the
population of Yoknapatawpha County, but they will know _ or the
course will have failed _ in what ways Hemingway's good soldier
talks differently from Ford's.
</P>
<P>
   Originality is rare indeed, not subject to instruction; and in
any case it's not the purpose of ``Strategies in Prose.'' Still, I
expect that, having studied and absorbed these inimitable voices,
their own voices will start to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   The first phrase of what follows is the first of ``The Good
Soldier,'' the last the last of ``Ulysses.'' The speaker of the
second sentence is Faulkner's troubled Vardaman, and the third
sentence of this brief pastiche belongs to a bitter Jake Barnes.
Each of the words deployed are Anglo-Saxon in their origin, not
Latinate; the longest have two syllables, yet authorial intention,
tone, alters altogether from first to last:
</P>
<P>
   This is the saddest story I have ever heard.
</P>
<P>
   My mother is a fish.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, isn't it pretty to think so.
</P>
<P>
   Yes yes yes yes yes.

 CLINTON, YELTSIN PUT DIFFERENCES BEHIND THEM
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ His face was puffy, his balance unsteady, and
his remarks sometimes left his listeners puzzled. But by the time
President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia left here Sunday, the biggest
chill in US-Russia relations since the Cold War, ignited by Kosovo,
was beginning to thaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two countries are back in business,'' declared Samuel R.
Berger, the White House national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   In an hourlong meeting with President Clinton, their first
face-to-face since last September, the two leaders acknowledged
that disagreement over Kosovo had strained their relations. Russia
opposed NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But now, they said, it was time to put their differences behind
them. With presidential elections next year in the United States
and Russia, the two lame ducks agreed it was in their best interest
to use the rest of their terms to get things done for their
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Also in that spirit of good will, Clinton told Yeltsin he would
raise with his counterparts whether debt forgiveness for Russia was
possible, though he thought it unlikely. But Clinton said Russia
should at least be allowed to reschedule the $69 billion in debt,
run up by communist governments, through the Paris Club of
government creditors. First, however, Moscow would have to reach
agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, they pledged to reduce the level of
nuclear warheads, among other arms control measures. They also
agreed to hold talks on changes in the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty to allow the possible development of a US defense system
against missiles, something Russia has long resisted _ and to begin
discussions of a START III nuclear reduction treaty this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Berger quoted Yeltsin as saying he wanted to maintain ``personal
control'' over the arms reduction efforts. Yeltsin, in a display of
humor, added: ``If we left things only to the experts, nothing
would get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin also gave Clinton a thick file of Russian civilian,
military, and private documents that he ordered declassified
several years ago relating to the assassination of President John
F. Kennedy. US officials said the documents were in Russian and
they did not yet know what they contained. Lee Harvey Oswald,
Kennedy's accused killer, had lived in the former Soviet Union and
married a Russian woman.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's stay, which was only eight hours, occurred on the last
day of a three-day summit of the leaders of the United States,
Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy, and Canada. During the
meeting's first two days, he was represented by his prime minister,
Sergei Stepashin.
</P>
<P>
   Before he arrived, Yeltsin said he was ``in a fighting mood.''
But shortly before meeting with Clinton, he said, ``We need to make
up after our fight. That is the main thing.''
</P>
<P>
   US officials portrayed Yeltsin as robust and forceful, not the
figure whose wobbly descent from his plane raised questions not
only about the status of his health but also whether he was still
in control of his country.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, who sat across the table from Yeltsin during his meeting
with Clinton, said Yeltsin was animated, pounded the table for
emphasis, and displayed a sense of humor, though he walked ``a bit
stiffly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When some of his colleagues, his ministers, and others, made
points and he didn't agree with them, he said, `No, that's not what
_ I don't believe that,' '' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a CNN interview, said Yeltsin's ``behavior was
neither erratic nor shaky today. He was strong, clear, forceful,
and looking to the future. We actually had quite a good meeting. We
got a lot done.''
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting, which Berger described as one of the best of
17 between the two leaders, Yeltsin invited Clinton to Moscow. No
date has been set, but Stepashin is expected to meet with Vice
President Al Gore in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let them get together as fast as they can and get down to
business _ and help Secretary Albright,'' Yeltsin said, leaving
unclear what he meant by the last statement that referred to
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.
</P>
<P>
   During their meeting, Clinton did not ask Yeltsin why Russian
forces had moved into Kosovo ahead of NATO and seized control of
the airport near Pristina. Yeltsin did not challenge Clinton on the
opposition by the United States and its allies on reconstruction
aid to Serbia as part of a costly rebuilding package for Kosovo and
its neighbors in southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This entire difficulty in Kosovo has been a great test for the
relationship between the United States and Russia,'' Clinton said
in a taped interview with Russian television. ``But it is a test, I
believe, that both countries have passed.''
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, however, Clinton, had some firm words about
Russia's economic situation. In an interview with Russian
television Sunday, he said no amount of outside help could bolster
Russia's economy unless the nation made some fundamental changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how much the'' International Monetary Fund ``tries
to help Russia, until your country makes the basic changes every
country must make to function in the global economy'' Russia will
not prosper, Clinton said on the program Itogi.

DESCENDANT OF FRENCH ROYAL FAMILY DIES AT 90 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Henri VI, Count of Paris, who might have been king if
France were still a monarchy, died Saturday in the family home in
Dreux. He was 90 and had been suffering from prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   His eldest son, also Henri, 66 _ one of nine surviving children,
six of them daughters _ immediately claimed the titles of Count of
Paris and Duke of France.
</P>
<P>
   Henri VI bore his royal heritage with such political finesse
that French republican leaders on both the right and the left
mourned his passing.
</P>
<P>
   But, the count said five years ago, in the turmoil caused in
France by Algerian independence in 1960, a French president who
ruled like a monarch, Gen. Charles de Gaulle, told the count,
``Monseigneur, I believe deeply in the value of the monarchy, and I
am certain as well that this regime is the one best suited to our
poor country.''
</P>
<P>
   De Gaulle ran for the presidency again in 1965, and the count
never found out whether French voters agreed on the subject of
monarchy. In 1988, the count scandalized some of his backers by
supporting the re-election of another president with regal airs,
Francois Mitterrand, a socialist.
</P>
<P>
   But from the time he became heir apparent to the throne in 1926
until 1950, the count did not even have the right to live here. A
French law passed in 1886, after royalists thronged around the
Orleans family residence in Paris during a wedding and made leaders
of the shaky Third Republic nervous, banned claimants to the throne
from French soil.
</P>
<P>
   The count violated that law at least once, flying in from
Belgium in 1938 to warn that the Munich Agreement would lead to no
good and then flying out again to avoid arrest.
</P>
<P>
   When war broke out, he enlisted in the Foreign Legion under the
pseudonym d'Orliac and fought in North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   A solemn, trim man with a trademark mustache, Henri Robert
Ferdinand Marie Louis-Philippe d'Orleans was born in France, the
eldest son of the Duke de Guise, but spent his early childhood in
Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   The pretender to the French throne at the time was not his
father but his uncle, the Duke of Orleans. He had no sons, and
named Henri his successor in 1926. Henri attended the University of
Louvain in Belgium, and married Isabelle, granddaughter of the last
Empress of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Henri and his wife separated after 52 years of marriage. They
had 41 grandchildren, one of whom, Eudes, was being married when
his grandfather died.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, the family lived in Morocco until the
Allies occupied it and expelled them to Spain. Henri later moved
them to Portugal, but after the war, the French allowed his heir to
go to school in Bordeaux in 1947 and, three years later, abolished
the law of exile.
</P>
<P>
   Henri moved the family back to France and, proclaiming loyalty
to humanist democracy, established its seat at Dreux. The count set
up a foundation that restored the Orleans castle at Amboise, and,
with considerable government funding, kept it open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Diehard supporters of the senior Bourbon branch of the French
royal family sometimes contested Henri's right to claim royal
succession, because one of his ancestors had taken the name
Philippe Egalite after the French Revolution and voted as a member
of the National Assembly to send Louis XVI to the guillotine.
</P>
<P>
   But his legitimacy was never seriously doubted by most of the
tens of thousands of French royalists who read respectful articles
about him in celebrity magazines like Point de Vue.
</P>
<P>
   There were periodic scandals. In 1984, he stripped his eldest
son of his position as heir apparent for getting a divorce and then
marrying a Chilean divorcee. The father relented in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is someone I mourn,'' the new Count of Paris said of his
father. The new head of the royal family survives on _ what else? _
royalties from a line of perfume called Royalissime and by making
sketches and watercolors. He is also the author of a cookbook,
published by Michel Lafon in 1994, whose title may explain why he
collected so many recipes: ``Terribly Sorry, Highness, It's my Day
Off.''

 &HT;    Clutch putts bring Stewart 2nd Open
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ One classic met another late Sunday afternoon
in the Sandhills. Pinehurst No. 2 and Payne Stewart's U.S. Open win
No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   We might be in for a quite a wait to match the drama that played
out on Donald Ross' famous old track Sunday beneath a cool mist
that would have suited the architect's Scottish blood. With a
pressure-packed stretch run worthy of a thoroughbred, 42-year-old
Payne Stewart snatched his second U.S. Open title, defeating Phil
Mickelson by one stroke on the 72nd hole with a par putt of 15 feet
that dropped into the middle of the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who closed with a 70 for a 1-under 279, the only
under-par score on the leaderboard, stuck his right fist into the
sky and screamed, unloading the emotions that had tumbled in his
gut all afternoon. He put a bear hug on caddie Mike Hicks that
lifted him completely off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything bubbles inside of you and then all of a sudden it's
over and you did it _ you did it again,'' Stewart said, savoring
the ultimate Father's Day. ``I'm tired. I'm worn out and I'm
whipped, but I don't think I'll be sleeping much tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   On the green, as the gallery in the bleachers around the 18th
erupted, tears already filled Stewart's eyes. He cradled Phil
Mickelson's face in his hands and said, ``You're going to love
being a father.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson would have loved being a U.S. Open champion just as
much, but will have to wait until next year, when the tournament
moves to Pebble Beach and familiar California soil. He and his
expecting wife, Amy, who thankfully never dialed the beeper in his
golf bag, will have substitute the loss with their own private
major championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a disappointing day right now,'' said Mickelson, who
3-putted the 16th hole to lose his advantage down the stretch, then
pulled a 7-foot birdie try at the 17th, ``but in the next few days,
we're expecting our first child, so that should even things out.''
</P>
<P>
   To speak of any evening out process was particularly meaningful.
Stewart had rebounded from last year's deflating U.S. Open, when
after leading for 54 holes he failed at the end, with a closing 74,
thwarted by a sand divot and winner Lee Janzen's good fortune to
have bounced out of a tree to the middle of a fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, who tied for third with a 70, joining Vijay Singh
(69), grabbed a piece of the closing script. He finished two
strokes back, at 1-over 281, lipping out a 5-foot par putt at the
17th after pulling to within one on a 12-foot birdie at 16. He
curled a 35-foot try for birdie just by the hole at 18. Happy that
Stewart exorcised the demons of Opens past, Woods added, ``From a
selfish standpoint, I'm glad he made it. It would have been tough
sleeping for the next few nights. To lose the U.S. Open by one
would be hard to swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrilled with the chase, despite the outcome, Woods said, ``This
is what it's all about, to be able to step back on 18 and handle
it, like Payne did.''
</P>
<P>
   David Duval, the world's No, 1-ranked player, spent another
major championship to forget, slipping to a 75 and tying for
seventh, eight shots back.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to measure his disappointment, Duval said it was
``probably more than you can imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart won his first U.S. Open in 1991 in a Monday playoff over
Scott Simpson. He avoided one this time by grabbing hold of the
moment and refusing to let go.
</P>
<P>
   At the 16th, after chipping poorly, Stewart rolled in a
25-footer for par. At the 17th, he sent a 6-iron three feet from
the hole and nailed it for birdie to retake the lead while
Mickelson missed.
</P>
<P>
   At the 18th, after driving in the rough and hacking out to 77
yards away, he settled his nerves and knocked a wedge 15 feet below
the hole. After Mickelson missed his putt, Stewart, taking a tip
from his wife Tracey to keep his head still during the stroke,
struck the putt he read as inside-left and watched its sweet path.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I looked up, it was about two feet from the hole and
breaking right in,'' Stewart said. ``I couldn't believe I had just
accomplished another dream. I told you before I'd enjoy it more if
I won again, and I will.''
</P>
<P>
   Clutching the U.S. Open trophy, Stewart felt the additional
satisfaction of officially having clinched a spot on the Ryder Cup
team. ``It's time for us to hold that cup again,'' he said, ``just
like I'm doing right now.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Maybe it was the cresting frustration caused by a
sprained knee that had limited him, a miracle touch that had
deserted him and a talented Tim Duncan who had dominated him.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Larry Johnson was simply reacting to the weight of an
unsettling situation: If he cannot muster a better performance for
Game 3 at Madison Square Garden Monday night _ and offset the heavy
burden on Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell _ the Knicks could be
setting themselves up to be swept in the NBA finals.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, Johnson's mercurial mood ring turned as
dark as coal Sunday. He went on a profane tirade after two league
officials requested that he stop shooting for a moment and
participate in a mandatory interview session before the Knicks'
practice at the Garden. Johnson was fined $25,000 for his obscene
remarks and the Knicks were also fined $25,000 for his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   His behavior opened a window into his disappointment concerning
his play in the finals. After granting interviews for about the
last five minutes of the 30-minute session and going on his
unsolicited and obscene outburst against the league officials,
Johnson finished by saying between expletives, ``I've got a job to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of that job is the thankless one of guarding Duncan even
though Johnson is banged up and undersized, and part of it is the
challenge of scoring points around Duncan in the paint and beyond
him on the perimeter. So far, Johnson has shot an abysmal 20
percent in the finals and was 1 for 7 from 3-point range in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to get some balanced scoring on the floor,''
Johnson said Sunday after cooling down. ``For me, I've got to make
shots. My knee wasn't affecting my mechanics, just the fact I
hadn't been able to practice. My knee is better. But now, I can't
get shots up'' with the league officials ``bothering me.''
</P>
<P>
   He had all the time in the world for extra shooting after
practice. But this was not a day for such considerations. This was
the team's co-captain _ a player who had been at the center of
glory during the Eastern Conference finals _ knowing that he has to
find a way to produce for a team shooting 35.6 percent in Games 1
and 2. A team desperate for points.
</P>
<P>
   But apparently not desperate enough to make a change in the
starting lineup. Although coach Jeff Van Gundy said that a plan to
play a big backcourt of Houston and Sprewell was a viable strategy
for some stretches, he said there was no reason to tinker with his
starters.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs' David Robinson agreed, saying: ``To be honest, I
think it's beyond that. I think it's very hard to come up with some
magic in the end. I think you have got to go with what got you
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have got away from that formula. Faced with the
intense defense of the Spurs, they have failed to move the ball, to
get to the free-throw line or to create better shots for their
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   To Van Gundy, improving the offense is a matter of ``how we've
finished games'' and not who has been starting them. And it is a
matter of his team getting into its offense quicker, making the
shots that are open and keeping positive about overcoming the
ominous pairing of Duncan and Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main question is: Are we trying to avoid getting swept or
do we believe we can win the series?'' Van Gundy said. ``To me,
that's critical. If we're trying to just avoid getting swept, when
our resolve is tested in a tight situation, we're not going to have
the determination to get through it. If we really still believe in
our heart that we can do this, then I believe in our heart that we
can do this. I believe that mind-set will go a long way toward
helping us get a win. That's what we need to get back in the
series. We need one win.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   One victory would give the Knicks hope. So far, they have been
unable to decode the Spurs' defense by having Sprewell and Houston
go one-on-one, with each banging his head against a 7-foot wall on
every drive to the basket. Even if the Knicks go with a big
backcourt and try to post up Spurs point guard Avery Johnson with
Sprewell or Houston, the Spurs can double-team them and force the
two clumsy ballhandlers to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel our team is versatile,'' Avery Johnson said. ``When we
played Orlando, I had to guard Penny Hardaway. We were still
successful because we have guys who can trap. I mean, we have a
little fear in our attitude because if I guard Houston, he's a
terrific scorer. But we feel we can do some things to counteract
that. The thing is, with Patrick Ewing not being there, we know the
offense is going to end up in one of those guys' hands down the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   It is too predictable. Sprewell and Houston need someone else,
to throw off the pattern. That player could be Marcus Camby or Kurt
Thomas. But neither of those players is capable of affecting the
game as Larry Johnson is when his 3-point shot goes down.
</P>
<P>
   Against Indiana in the conference finals, he shot 39 percent
from 3-point range and averaged 16.5 points a game. He also became
a part of Garden lore when his miracle four-point play won Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   That seems long ago for Johnson. He has been a study in futility
during the finals with a mismatch against Duncan and a knee that
will not allow him full mobility.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.J.'s out there giving his heart,'' Spurs guard Mario Elie
said. ``But I feel like he may have been better off if he had taken
Game 1 and 2 off. But he's a warrior. He wants to help his team
win. But I feel like now it's hurting them. With him having to
guard Tim and David, he's 6-foot-5 and they're 7-foot and they're a
handful. Then he tries to guard me and Sean Elliott and we make him
move to see how his knee reacts.''
</P>
<P>
   But that knee is better. Now, Johnson may go from a hindrance to
a help. By being able to practice his jump shot Sunday, he may
start feeling more comfortable on the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Once he calmed down Sunday, he seemed more upbeat. Minutes
before, he was out of control. The incident occurred after Johnson
ignored the two league officials' request to make himself available
for the interview session. All players must abide by the league
rule or risk a fine.
</P>
<P>
   Terri Washington, the NBA's director for sports media services,
allowed Johnson to shoot for about 15 minutes before she approached
him. He nodded yes to her, but mumbled an expletive and kept
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Terry Lyons, the vice president for
international public relations, spoke with Johnson. Johnson cursed
him, too, and continued to shoot until there were about 5 or 10
minutes left in the interview session. As reporters circled him to
ask about the health of his knee, he unleashed an unsolicited
stream of obscenities.
</P>
<P>
   The league _ which by its existence allows players like Johnson
to make millions _ also took away Sunday. Of Johnson's $84 million
contract, $25,000 is gone through a fine after a tirade that seemed
born out of Johnson's frustration. &QL;

STEWART RIDES HIS PUTTER TO U.S. OPEN VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ With one last courageous putt, Payne Stewart
won the U.S. Open, climaxed a day of high drama and authored the
signature moment of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Capturing his second U.S. Open title and winning his third major
championship at age 42, Stewart edged Phil Mickelson by one stroke
by making a 15-foot putt on the tournament's final hole, a putt
that instantly became part of golf lore. It ended a day of
roller-coaster emotional swings, with four players dueling for
victory on the back nine of a course that ranks among the world's
toughest.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Stewart conquered everything _ the difficulty of
Pinehurst Resort &AMP; Country Club's No. 2 course, the challenges of
Mickelson, Tiger Woods and Vijay Singh, the intense pressure that
would have cracked a lesser player, and the disappointment of
losing last year's Open by one stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart shot an even-par 70 on Sunday to finish at 1 under par
for the tournament (279), one stroke ahead of Mickelson, who
finished at even par after Sunday's 70, and two strokes ahead of
Singh (69) and Woods (70), who tied for third place.
</P>
<P>
   You can call Stewart many things _ resilient, experienced,
confident, talented. But after this day, it was most fitting to
call Stewart a champion. Because only a champion would have found
the resolve to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never gave up, I got the job done, and that means a lot to
me,'' said Stewart, who won $625,000 with his victory. ``I knew it
was going to come down to having to make putts. I've heard on
television before that one of the detriments of Payne Stewart's
golf game is that he's not a good putter. Well, maybe I squelched
those rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   The final moments were about as good as it gets, with thousands
of people surrounding the 18th green, some sitting on the clubhouse
roof, a few in the trees, and everyone holding their breath
watching the national championship unfold. It came down to this,
Stewart leading by one stroke, Mickelson on the green with a
20-foot putt for birdie, while Stewart faced a 15-foot putt for
par.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson's putt was difficult, and he missed it right, and then
tapped in for par. That left Stewart with a chance to win on a
15-footer, uphill, that broke right to left. Stewart read the putt,
while thousands around the green remained quieter than a Sunday
afternoon prayer meeting.
</P>
<P>
   As Stewart struck the putt, Mickelson watched with a slight
smile, knowing that his fate was out of his hands. Either Mickelson
and Stewart were headed for an 18-hole Monday playoff, or Stewart's
putt would win it.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart held the path to victory on the blade of his steady
putter. And even before the ball dived into the hole, Stewart knew
that his putt was true.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I looked up, it was about 2 feet from the hole, and it
was breaking right in the center,'' he said. ``I couldn't believe
it. I couldn't believe that I'd accomplished another dream of
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   After the putt went in, the crowd roared, Stewart hugged his
caddy, Mike Hicks, and then Stewart and Mickelson congratulated
each other, with Stewart holding both sides of Mickelson's face.
Moments later, Stewart's wife, Tracey, rushed onto the green to hug
her husband, and Stewart trembled with emotion as they embraced.
</P>
<P>
   Despite winning the 1991 U.S. Open and the 1989 PGA
Championship, Stewart has been on a mission the past year. He
entered the final round of last year's U.S. Open with a four-stroke
lead, only to lose by one stroke to Lee Janzen. Stewart wanted
another chance to win the Open; he played well enough to get it,
and this time, instead of faltering down the stretch, he
flourished.
</P>
<P>
   There were many key final-round moments. Stewart took the lead
for good with a birdie at the par-3, 191-yard No. 17, when he hit a
terrific 6-iron tee shot to 3 feet and then made the putt.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson followed Stewart's tee shot at No. 17 with a terrific
tee shot of his own, but Mickelson missed an 8-foot birdie putt
that would have kept him tied for the lead. Mickelson also made a
crucial bogey at No. 16, his only bogey, when he failed to get up
and down for par, missing an 8-foot putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Payne's tee shot at No. 17 where he knocked it close
where the realization that he could beat me entered my mind,'' said
Mickelson, who made the strongest bid to win his first major
championship at age 29. ``Until then, I felt like I was in control.
I just didn't have that little extra that Payne showed. Payne came
through on a couple of putts, and I ended up missing mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Woods also missed a crucial putt at No. 17, an
8-footer that gave him a bogey and dropped him to 1 over par for
the tournament. Woods also missed a 2{-foot putt at No. 11, and if
he had made those two putts, he would have finished at 1 over
instead of 1 under. But Woods left believing that at age 23, a U.S.
Open victory was in his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 11 was a putt I should have made, but if you look at my
entire week, I made a lot of putts,'' he said. ``I know I have the
game to win a U.S. Open; I know I have the mind. I'm glad Payne
made that putt at No. 18, so I could sleep a little better
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh got within one stroke of the lead on the back nine, but he
bogeyed No. 16 to fall two strokes behind and he never recovered.
In the end, Stewart was too determined, too steady and too focused.
And when it was over, he vowed to enjoy the U.S. Open title more
than he did in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where it puts me in the golf world is that I'm a pretty
accomplished player,'' he said. ``It felt so good to accomplish
what I did today. And nobody can ever take that away from me.''

WRITER STEPHEN KING STABLE AFTER SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH LOVELL, Maine _ Stephen King, chronicler of the sinister
potential in everyday landscapes, met with his own nightmare
Saturday afternoon on a ferny stretch of road near his summer home.
</P>
<P>
   King, 51, whose writing lends a permanent dark tone to such
previously benign phenomena as the high school prom and the
unoccupied summer resort, had gone for his regular walk when he was
hit from behind by a motorist who had swiveled toward the back seat
of his Dodge Caravan to subdue an unruly Rottweiler.
</P>
<P>
   The best-selling author was thrown 14 feet into a depression by
the side of Route 5 and lay ``covered with blood'' and in obvious
pain, according to Oxford County Sheriff's patrol deputy Matt
Baker.
</P>
<P>
   King was flown by helicopter to Central Maine Medical Center in
Lewiston, where he was treated for a collapsed lung and multiple
fractures of the right leg and hip early Sunday morning. He was in
stable but serious condition Sunday night, and will be operated on
again Monday to repair his right leg, according to hospital
spokesman Chuck Gill.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the driver who hit King, identified as Bryan
Smith, 41, of Fryeburg, has not been charged. In fact, despite
disorienting pain, King was characteristically unassuming, Baker
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He actually apologized to the driver,'' said Baker. ``There
certainly was no animosity there.''
</P>
<P>
   As word of King's accident spread, his readers all over the
world were straining for information about the acknowledged master
of horror who burst onto the scene with ``Carrie,'' in 1974, going
on to dominate the genre for 25 years. Camera crews clustered along
the empty roadside where King had been hit, looking for anything at
all to film. Swamped dispatchers from the sheriff's office were
fielding calls from London and Seattle and CNN.
</P>
<P>
   But here in this town of 1,000, people were just worried about a
local luminary who ``made the earth and started it twirling,'' as
one neighbor put it.
</P>
<P>
   Friends say King's life has never been like his novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, because he's who he is, people are going to read
something spooky into what happened, but the reason I like him is
because he's the most normal, sane, down-to-earth person in the
world,'' said humor columnist Dave Barry, in a phone interview from
his home in Florida. Barry plays with King in the Rock Bottom
Remainders, a group made up of writers, which he described as ``not
a good band.''
</P>
<P>
   It's precisely King's ability to tap into the submerged fears of
ordinary people that has brought him such success, Barry said.
``Stephen is very good at staying sane and being totally insane at
the same time. He can communicate between two worlds _ the
unconscious and the conscious. He has this amazing ability to say
or write what you are thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   King was a high school English teacher when he published
``Carrie,'' the gruesome tale of an unpopular girl's prom-night
revenge. That was a year after ``The Exorcist'' raised the stakes
for the horror genre. Though Doubleday paid only $2,500 for the
hard-cover rights to ``Carrie,'' the book soon got a purchase offer
from Brian de Palma, who went on to make the movie starring Sissy
Spacek. Months later, the paperback rights sold for $400,000, said
Gary Goshgarian of Arlington, Mass., who teaches a course on horror
fiction at Northeastern University.
</P>
<P>
   King quit his day job and started the run of bestsellers _ among
them ``The Shining,'' ``Pet Sematary,'' and ``The Stand'' _ that
would secure his status as the hottest commodity in publishing.
King's influence was so strong that for years in the late 1980s,
publishing houses were so inundated by his imitators that they
wouldn't even look at horror manuscripts, Goshgarian said.
</P>
<P>
   The King phenomenon was not confined to America. ``I was in New
Guinea about 10 years ago and Stephen King's books were there in a
bookstore beside the jungle,'' said Goshgarian.
</P>
<P>
   King, who was born in Portland and lives in Bangor, has spent
summers in North Lovell for over 20 years. That makes him the
biggest Kezar Lake celebrity since Rudy Vallee, who could be heard
singing from the opposite shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maine is a poor state, and we don't have a lot of superhero
kinds of people,'' said George Westerberg, 66, who lives in Lovell.
``He's one of the people Maine can take some pride in. Every time
someone sees him there's a Stephen King report.''
</P>
<P>
   As for King's reported status as the world's wealthiest writer _
Forbes said he earned $84 million in 1996 and 1997 alone _ it
doesn't really make much difference in North Lovell, locals said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't know he makes that kind of money if you ran into
him in the market,'' said James Randall, 73, who said King recently
let him cut in line at the market because he had fewer items.

 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Rep. Tom Tancredo, a Republican with a libertarian
streak, was elected to Congress last fall with donations that
included $9,900 from the National Rifle Association, the group's
largest contribution to one of Colorado's six representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on Friday, Tancredo stood out as the only representative
from Colorado to vote for the final gun-control bill, which allowed
just 24 hours for background checks at gun shows but also placed
some restrictions on semiautomatic rifles and high-capacity
ammunition clips.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made the difference?'' Tancredo asked, repeating the
question Saturday during a visit to his home. ``Twelve dead
children, one dead adult, 24 injured kids, and a community that has
had its heart broken _ that made the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Tancredo lives in Littleton, six blocks from Columbine High
School. Before entering politics, he taught in Jefferson County
schools. His wife, Jackie, just retired from a lifetime career of
teaching in the district, now known around the world for the
shootings on April 20. The Tancredos knew Dave Sanders, the teacher
who was fatally shot at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``My neighbor's son held Sanders' head in his arms when he
died,'' Tancredo said, numbly remembering the horror stories told
by neighbors and friends. ``I can't go home to them and say we
didn't do anything, because guns aren't an issue. Guns are an
issue, they did take children's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The House gun-control bill died in a lopsided vote, a victim of
Democrats who thought it too weak as well as Republicans who
thought it too strong.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to his conservative, suburban district this weekend,
Tancredo met with support.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, at a Denver summit on youth violence sponsored by
Colorado Gov. Bill Owens, Steven Vieregg, a Littleton resident,
sought out Tancredo, his congressman, in a crowded hall. He shook
Tancredo's hand and said, ``It took some guts to vote that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Rising from a folding chair nearby, Carol Williams-Craigie, a
Littleton resident who does not often agree with Tancredo, said,
``I'm glad to see someone voted for gun control.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the rest of the Colorado delegation _ three
Republicans and two Democrats who all voted against the final bill
_ she said, ``I was disgusted that they don't seem to be paying
attention to what the public is saying.''
</P>
<P>
   A trace of uneasiness came from Jon Caldara, Tancredo's
successor as president of the Independence Institute, a libertarian
research group based in the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom is learning the art of politics,'' he said, choosing his
words carefully. ``I hope he is not changing his views on the
Second Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing alone with his thoughts was Tom Mauser, whose only son,
Daniel, was killed at Columbine. Aware of Tancredo's strongly held
conservative beliefs, Mauser had traveled to Washington a week
before the vote, urging him to vote for gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked beyond ideology,'' Mauser said, adding that Tancredo
had called him on Friday, the day of the vote. Mauser said he had
asked some of Colorado's other Republicans in Congress, who all
oppose expanding gun control, ``How many shootings does it take to
move away from ideology?''
</P>
<P>
   Over a box lunch during a break in the panels and speeches,
Tancredo, who boycotted President Clinton's State of the Union
speech last January, freely admitted that geography had influenced
his vote. The Columbine shootings, he said, did not hit as close to
home for his colleagues in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life in El Paso County, life on the Western Slope, life in
eastern Colorado, is a lot different than life in Littleton,
Colo.,'' he said. ``My community is in shock, and I am speaking
literally. Movie houses are half empty, the same for restaurants,
the shopping mall. Family groups are staying closer together, not
going out in the evenings.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Saturday, Tancredo called the shooting incident
``a seminal event.'' In an indirect reference to his gun-control
vote, he added: ``April 20, 1999, marked that date for us. It will
always be in our hearts as something that changed our lives. It
made us do things we would not have done before.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience of 600 gave him tepid applause, which Tancredo
later attributed to the fact that he had minimized gun control and
warned that ``the scariest thing of all is we only get focused on
the guns and not on the sickness in our society.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tancredo said later in an interview that ``gun control is a
bandage,'' a superficial covering for societal sores, adding that
the legislation he voted for would not have kept Eric Harris and
Dylan Klebold from obtaining the guns they used in Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   He urged restoring prayer and moral education in public schools,
slashing income taxes so more mothers could afford to be home when
their children returned from school, and shielding children from
violence and sexuality in videos, videogames and on the Internet.
Tancredo said that Harris and Klebold had soaked up negative
influences like sponges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that any amount of counseling would have
helped Klebold and Harris _ they needed an exorcist,'' said
Tancredo, a conservative Christian. ``It was pure evil in their
hearts _ and it got there because there was no goodness coming
in.''
</P>
<P>
   The week before he spoke here, Tancredo used the Republican
Party's weekly radio address to expound on the same themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our material wealth has increased, but our cultural wealth has
been squandered,'' he said, voicing support for laws to curb
children's access to violent movies and videogames. ``We have come
to tolerate ever more outrageous behavior, choosing to look the
other way rather than to appear to be judgmental.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Tancredo said he was frustrated by America's
unwillingness to debate its social decay and angered by
exploitation of the human tragedy of Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet you it was used 1,000 times, for every possible
amendment, they would invoke Columbine High School,'' he said of
last week's congressional debate. Referring to his colleagues in
the House of Representatives, he said: ``I wanted to throttle them.
I finally had to leave.''

   When the final gun-control vote came, he says, ``I'm the only
guy in the Colorado delegation that ends up voting for the bill.''
Recalling his years of ideological opposition to expanding controls
on guns, he said, ``Sometimes, I stop and think, `Boy, have I
changed since Columbine.'''

GERMANY TIES ON PENALTY KICK 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Germany, the top-seeded team in Group B and
the 1995 Women's World Cup runner-up, scored its only goal on a
penalty kick in the second half and settled for a 1-1 tie with
Italy on Sunday in an opening first-round game at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Bettina Wiegmann blasted the goal past Italy goalkeeper Biorgia
Brenzan (11 saves) in the 62nd minute after defender Roberta
Stefanelli tackled Birgit Pirnz in the penalty box. That countered
the Italian goal by striker Patrizia Panico, who headed in a pass
to beat goalkeeper Silke Rottenberg in the 36th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's offense, determined to penetrate Germany's defense with
short passes and solo dribbling, succeeded after defender Doris
Fitschen, the German captain, took down midfielder Manuela Tesse
near the corner for a foul.
</P>
<P>
   Antonella Carta, Italy's captain, received the ensuing short
free kick and sent a cross to the far side of the goal, where
Panico had slipped free from Fitschen. Panico headed the pass into
the bottom right corner of the net to beat Rottenberg, who was late
reacting.
</P>
<P>
   To that point, the game was an even struggle between contrasting
offensive styles, Germany countering Italy's short game with
repeated long passes and shots that kept Brenzan busy. Germany
increased the pressure in the second half and it paid off.

SOFTWARE WIZARDS TEST WITS IN CITY-SPANNING GAME

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the custodial worker at the World Trade Center
Marriott found a bottle of green liquid labeled ``Caution:
Radioactive Material'' on Sunday, he did the only responsible
thing: notified security officials, who evacuated the entire 14th
floor.
</P>
<P>
   How were they to know that it was only Palmolive dish detergent?
After all, they were not in the Game.
</P>
<P>
   While other natives and out-of-towners lazed in the warmth of a
sunny Father's Day weekend, another group of highly unusual
tourists turned New York City into their own private game board
over the weekend, racing from one borough to the next on a frantic
24-hour mission that was half spy chase, half mind-bending puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Game,'' as the players call it, is a sophisticated
scavenger hunt for computer geeks _ mostly current and former
employees of Microsoft. It is normally played in Seattle, near the
home of Microsoft, but this year the organizers decided to ``raise
the rims'' and bring the Game to New York City, to add a new level
of complexity.
</P>
<P>
   And so from Saturday morning to Sunday afternoon, 60 players in
11 teams raced across four boroughs, with forays as far as the
Hudson Highlands in Putnam County, trying to solve a series of
puzzles. Some involved secret codes. Some were mathematical
problems. Others required quick deductions of logic. Many involved
whimsical and puzzling artifacts, like the radioactive detergent.
</P>
<P>
   Each puzzle yielded a clue, which in turn sent the team to the
location of the next mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The players _ more than a handful of them millionaires _ were
armed with their wits and an arsenal of technological gadgets.
Their rented vans were equipped with laptop computers, night-vision
goggles, portable photocopiers, in-line skates, police scanners,
radios, cell phones and global-positioning systems.
</P>
<P>
   At its root, the Game is a frivolous adventure, but one that
reflects the players' and designers' creativity, not to mention
their stock options and not inconsiderable egos.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing goes to the winners except a small black obelisk, a
year's worth of bragging rights and, if they want, a chance to
design the puzzles next year. It is, participants say, an
expression, celebration and product of the intense competition
within Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our self-esteem is based on the fact we think we are smart, so
we constantly need reinforcement,'' said Cy Cedar, a 33-year-old
retiree from Microsoft, and one of only a handful of women playing
on the predominantly male teams.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 11 teams, only one, Team Brown, had no ties to Microsoft.
But misfortune waylaid it early in the hunt. Outside Central Park,
the team locked the keys in its minivan and paid a locksmith $145
to open it. In SoHo traffic, they crashed the van into a sport
utility vehicle, and at an Astor Place pizza restaurant, a fireball
erupted from an oven, singeing the hair of a team member as he
worked on one of the clues at a table nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission control? There has been an assassination attempt _ a
pizza oven exploded,'' Jason Tulley, 28, told game organizers by
cell phone shortly after the fireball. ``No, I am not kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   The Game began at 10 a.m. Saturday at Horace Mann School in the
Bronx. The first puzzle required teams to answer 28 questions,
formatted like a standardized test, and then hold the answer key
behind a two-page essay on New York City. That revealed the next
clue: ``Central Park Castle, Writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting inconspicuously on the steps of the castle was a man
writing in a notebook. The ``writer'' handed each team the next
clue. The teams then spent the rest of the day searching for clues
in Manhattan. As night fell, the game organizers sent the players
north first to Riverdale, in the Bronx, then to the Palisades State
Parkway, then halfway up a mountain outside Cold Spring.
</P>
<P>
   By noon on Sunday, most of the teams were at the Unisphere, a
landmark in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens, trying to solve
a puzzle based on the etchings around the landmark globe. The
winning team, Team Silver, finished the game at 1:10 p.m. Sunday,
driving from Floyd Bennett Field in southeastern Brooklyn to
Drovers Tap Room in Greenwich Village, where the game organizers
held a party.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While the vast majority of the clues were intensely difficult, a
good number exhibited an equally sharp sense of humor. In the
southwest corner of Central Park, game designers posted a mime,
Darian Corley, and forced teams to play charades to learn the next
clue. Next to the mime was Dr. Geek, a New York rapper dressed in
overalls, a red T-shirt and a billowing polka-dot top hat who
offered passers-by a little bit of an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are playing a scavenger hunt, trying to find out what
they can scavenge. You understand what I mean? Are you above
average?'' he rapped. ``You got to be like that if you are playing
the Game; you got to understand and use your brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Scenes like that left more than a few locals scratching their
heads. Puzzled hotel operators across lower Manhattan fielded calls
for ``Joe Scorpion's room,'' and Columbia University security
guards kicked out the teams after one inadvertently set off a
burglar alarm. The evacuation in the Palmolive scare lasted two
hours.
</P>
<P>
   But some New Yorkers were all too happy to play along. This
weekend, the Pop International Galleries in SoHo offered works from
the likes of Andy Warhol and Keith Haring. But there were also two
paintings by the lesser-known, and completely fictional, Mathias
Sandorf.
</P>
<P>
   When alert team members asked about the Sandorf works, they
received a packet of information that included a copy of the
painting. Players had to cut up the pieces, reassembling them into
a grid, and then extract a hidden message.
</P>
<P>
   The painting was actually the work of J. Allard, 30, a pop-art
collector on sabbatical from Microsoft, who is also one of the game
organizers. ``It's my first showing,'' Allard joked. ``You know how
hard it is to get into a SoHo gallery?''

COMMENTARY: AL GORE TURNS THE VOLUME WAY, WAY UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore has been trying to be more exciting on the stump _
trying so hard that if he keeps it up, he'll rupture his vocal
cords before the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   The new Al Gore yells quite a lot. Caught between Bill Clinton
and George W. Bush, two natural campaigners, the vice president is
trying to make up in decibels what he lacks in spontaneity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not satisfied! INDEED I AM RESTLESS!'' he cried in New
York, announcing his candidacy for president with a list of
promises about what he would do to move the country TOWARD
AMERICA'S NEW HORIZONS, a goal that will involve eliminating EVERY
LAST DIME OF WASTE, fighting GLOBAL WARMING and making our public
schools THE FINEST AND BEST IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.
</P>
<P>
   This is our fault. We have been carping about how boring Al Gore
is, and the poor man is all but howling at the moon in an effort to
sound more compelling. We are being forced to watch him go through
an enormous effort to look effortless, and it is as discomfiting as
looking at the underside of a swan swimming on the lake.
</P>
<P>
   The public is not going to elect a president who makes them feel
like nervous parents at the second-grade class play. Gore has to
give up this futile attempt to become Kennedyesque and embrace the
boredom.
</P>
<P>
   Let Gore be Gore! Where is it written that the American people
want a fun guy for president? True, but most of our chief
executives weren't people you would necessarily want to pal around
with. No one ever accused George Washington of being the life of
the party. ``Today I dined with the president, and as usual the
company was as grave as if at a funeral,'' reported one of his
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it is a disadvantage to have to campaign in the age of
mass media when the only TV star you resemble is Howdy Doody. But
history shows that when America is in a period of economic boom,
the public is comfortable having someone in the White House who is
more stolid than the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   During the Roaring Twenties, the electorate fell in love with
Calvin Coolidge, a monosyllabic politician who barely had the
energy to get out of bed in the morning. (Coolidge was also, as far
as we know, the first vice president to serve while his boss was
having sex with a woman not his wife in a room just off the Oval
Office. He never felt compelled to point out that this was
outrageous.)
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Coolidge, Al Gore is an energetic politician, and you
only have to listen to his speeches to know that there will
probably be A LOT OF INITIATIVES in a Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   Even though George Bush has been gloriously unspecific about his
own agenda, it is already easy to see that the two front-runners
for the presidential nominations have very different outlooks.
Gore, for all his worries about BUREAUCRATIC EXCESS, is a
government activist, and Bush, for all his talk about being a
compassionate conservative, does not seem to really have many new
initiatives in mind.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to describe the difference between them so far is
that Gore promises to make ``high quality preschool available to
EVERY CHILD IN EVERY FAMILY'' and Bush promises to get the Head
Start classes to teach phonics.
</P>
<P>
   The first time I saw Al Gore, he was running in the New York
Democratic primary in 1988, a contest the Gore people thought they
had wrapped up when they won the endorsement of New York City Mayor
Ed Koch.
</P>
<P>
   But Koch was in full-throttle third-term hysteria, having
insulted or alienated almost every conceivable section of the city
population. The mayor led Gore around like a spaniel, and at almost
every stop the Tennessee senator was asked to apologize for
something Koch had said or done to somebody. During that campaign
Gore did not look so much stiff as numb, as if he had been knocked
over the head with a bat.
</P>
<P>
   The second time I saw Gore was when he returned to New York City
for an environmental conference. He was happy as a clam, discussing
dire predictions of receding shores and expanding populations.
Reading the text of his remarks would probably have been pretty
boring then, too. But in person, Gore was utterly at ease with
himself and his audience. Even his hair looked less stiff.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Olivari, who worked for Gore in that fatal 1988 primary,
claims his candidate was at his best in Staten Island, the home of
the nation's largest landfill, where people were actually
interested in hearing him talk about solid waste. ``He had a very
good first day and then it went downhill,'' recalled Olivari last
week, at a fund-raising cocktail party for Gore in Manhattan.
``Maybe he should just try being who he is and things will work
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Seize the moment, Gore. Dare to be dull.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE LONGEST FINAL PUTT TO WIN THE OPEN
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ On the 18th green that was as hard as Payne
Stewart's determination, the putt was 15 feet long, slightly
uphill, with a slight break to the right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told myself, `This is an inside-left putt. Just believe
that,''' he would say later. ``I remembered what my wife Tracey had
told me Saturday night, to keep my head still when I putted, that I
had been moving my head. And two feet from the hole, it was
breaking right in the center. I couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   When that putt plunked into the cup, the 40,000 who had been
holding their breath around the 18th green at Pinehurst No. 2,
exploded in a roar that reverberated through more than a century of
U.S. Open Championship history.
</P>
<P>
   In the most theatrical situation in golf, Stewart had won the
Open with the last putt of the tournament for a par 4, a final
round of par 70 and a 72-hole score of 279. If he had missed, he
would have been in an 18-hole playoff Monday with Phil Mickelson,
who was standing nearby after having already putted out for a 70
and 280, even par.
</P>
<P>
   In this 99th Open, the 42-year-old Stewart, the only pro who
wears the plus fours that were popular a century ago, had put an
exclamation point on one of the most dramatic Opens in golf
history.
</P>
<P>
   According to the archivists of the U.S. Golf Association, which
governs the Open, this was the first time that the championship was
won with the last putt of any substantial length.
</P>
<P>
   The important word there is substantial. In the 1996 Open at
Oakland Hills, for example, Steve Jones holed a last putt of about
3 feet to win. In other years, other golfers have tapped in to win.
But until now, no golfer had ever made a lengthy last putt to
snatch the huge silver trophy that Jack Nicklaus, Ben Hogan and
Bobby Jones each won four times.
</P>
<P>
   What Stewart did belongs up there on the same pedestal with what
Arnold Palmer did with a final-round 65 at Cherry Hills in 1960;
what Ben Hogan did at Merion in 1950 only 16 months after the
head-on collision with a bus that nearly killed him; what Jones did
at Winged Foot in 1929 with a curling putt to force a 36-hole
playoff with Al Espinosa that he won.
</P>
<P>
   But none of those Opens came down to the last putt as Sunday's
shootout here in the Sandhills of North Carolina did.
</P>
<P>
   Every Open has its moments, but none of the golf historians
could remember an Open quite like this one. Throughout the cloudy,
misty afternoon, Stewart and Mickelson, in the last pairing,
swapped the lead as Tiger Woods, the precocious 23-year-old who won
the 1997 Masters, and Vijay Singh, the reigning PGA champion,
lurked a stroke or two behind.
</P>
<P>
   On the green of the 489-yard 16th hole, the longest par 4 in
Open history, Stewart holed a 25-footer to save par and Mickelson
missed an 8-footer for par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I needed to chip that ball in there,'' Stewart said,
alluding to his shot from left rough, ``but I hit a very poor chip.
I shouldn't have thought that way. On the putt, I got my line, went
through my routine, looked up and it's going into the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Now they were tied. With the honor on the 17th, Stewart lofted a
6-iron that spun to a stop about three feet away. ``When I won the
1991 Open at Hazeltine,'' he recalled, ``on the 17th hole there,
all my shots were right at the pin. And all four of my shots here
at the 17th were right at the pin.''
</P>
<P>
   So was Mickelson's shot, a 7-iron that floated in there about
eight feet, but he missed the putt, the stroke that would make the
ultimate difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``That putt broke left early and right at the end,'' Mickelson
said later. ``But it didn't take the break and I left it too far
out on the right.''
</P>
<P>
   With the opportunity to take the lead with what Stewart called
an ``inside left putt,'' he knocked it in for the lead at 1-under
par for the tournament and strode to the 18th tee with a one-stroke
lead. By then Singh was already in with a 69 for 281, 1-over par,
and Woods would miss a 35-footer for a par 70 and 281.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I could make it, and I almost made it,'' Woods said
later.
</P>
<P>
   On the 18th hole, a slightly uphill par-4 of 446 yards that had
yielded only one birdie (by Colin Montgomerie) Sunday, Mickelson
was in the fairway, but Stewart put his drive in the right rough,
then hit a wedge short of the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I collected myself,'' Stewart said. ``I had no chance to think
about getting to the green. I took my medicine. I didn't compound
my situation by making two mistakes in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart made history instead. He wedged his third shot to 15
feet, watched Mickelson miss a 20-footer, then made the putt that
will be remembered as long as the Open is played. As long as golf
is played, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Open, you usually play for pars and wait for somebody
to falter,'' Mickelson said, ``but Payne made something happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne Stewart had one-putted the last three holes. And the putt
that he made on the 18th green now enters the next century as the
longest last putt to win the Open. &QL;

IT'S NEW YORK FOR BOTH OF US, CLINTON SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Sunday that he and first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton intend to ``get a place'' in New York _
soon enough to allow Mrs. Clinton to use it as a residence if she
decides to run for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Answering the question about a possible move more clearly than
he has in the past, Clinton, in an interview on CNN's ``Late
Edition,'' left the impression that the first couple might be
house-hunting soon. He did not say where in New York they wanted to
live.
</P>
<P>
   Under New York law, a U.S. Senate candidate does not have to
establish residency in the state until the election.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said earlier this month that she would form an
exploratory committee for a possible campaign in 2000 for the
Senate seat being vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., who
is retiring after four terms.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton dismissed a report in U.S. News and World Report that
said Mrs. Clinton's move to New York was already ``in the works,''
apparently without her husband.
</P>
<P>
   That report, in the issue that goes on sale Monday, said that
Mrs. Clinton would move out of the White House by the fall and
suggested that she would return sporadically for official events.
</P>
<P>
   In the CNN interview, Clinton said, ``Well, it's not true that
she's going to move out of the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Months ago, we said that we intended to get a place
in New York. We talked, we started talking not long after we moved
to the White House about where we would live when we got out. She's
always wanted to live in New York, so we said we'd do that. And I
would divide my time between New York and going home to Arkansas
and finishing my library and doing my work there.''
</P>
<P>
   In his comments, the president said that if Mrs. Clinton ran for
the Senate, she would spend part of her time away from the White
House, but not all of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now if she runs for the Senate, she'll obviously have to spend
a lot more time there,'' Clinton said. ``But it will be more like
an incumbent member of Congress running for re-election; that is,
she's not going to stop being first lady and doing her other
responsibilities, but she'll have to spend a lot more time in New
York, and we'll have to get a place there for her to be while she's
spending the time there.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said he might change his own residency from
Arkansas to New York before he left office so that he could vote
for his wife in the Senate race.

<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ The reasonable face of Russia, President
Boris Yeltsin, walked stiffly, but his presence here Sunday was
enough to reassure President Clinton and other leaders that
dialogue with Moscow was possible in the aftermath of the Kosovo
war.
</P>
<P>
   After months of tensions since the start of the war, culminating
in an unnerving standoff between Russian and NATO troops at the
main airport in Kosovo, the Russian and American leaders met Sunday
and decided to let bygones be bygones, according to Clinton's
aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're actually in a position to have a stronger
relationship with Russia in the future than before the conflict
started,'' Clinton said after their hourlong session.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to give a fresh start to the frayed relationship, the
aides said, the two leaders instead focused in their meeting on the
Russian economy, Moscow's sharing of nuclear technology with Iran,
and arms control.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, in a joint statement, agreed for the first time to begin
discussions on changes to the linchpin accord on nuclear weapons
between the two countries, something desired by successive American
presidents, including Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The encounter between Clinton and Yeltsin, their first since the
president was in Moscow last September, was set in the context of
the summit meeting of the Group of Eight _ the world's seven
leading industrial nations and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was included in the prestigious club several years ago as
a way of showing that Moscow counted as a major power, and
Yeltsin's appearance, truncated to about seven hours and uncertain
until the last moment because of the precariousness of his health
and tensions over Kosovo, was as important for him as it was for
the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make up after our fight,'' Yeltsin said of the
heated differences over Kosovo between the NATO allies and Russia.
As a traditional ally of Yugoslavia, Russia vehemently opposed
NATO's bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The other leaders, who had watched the roller-coaster behavior
of Russia over Kosovo _ helpful, then obstinate over the role of
its troops, then helpful again in arriving at a solution two days
ago _ were relieved and grateful.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing buoyed by Sunday's encounter with the Russian
president, Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said
the meeting was ``one of the best'' the two leaders had held.
Despite the concerns about the health of Yeltsin, who appeared
uncertain on his feet at times, Berger described the Russian leader
as ``pounding the table'' and being very ``forceful'' in overruling
his aides arrayed on either side of him.
</P>
<P>
   The French president, Jacques Chirac, spoke warmly of
``reconciliation'' between Russia and the West.
</P>
<P>
   But the summit leaders, in a reflection of their underlying
uncertainty about Russia's political and economic future, offered
only modest economic assistance.
</P>
<P>
   In the summit's final communique Sunday, Russia was urged to
step up its economic reforms so it could meet requirements set by
the International Monetary Fund for an agreement on a $4.5 billion
loan.
</P>
<P>
   Only after the agreement with the fund was in place should the
Paris Club of sovereign creditors ``act expeditiously'' to
negotiate a debt rescheduling agreement, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for the Paris Club debt relief was a ``little thank you
by the West'' for Russia's final role in resolving the Kosovo
crisis, Karl Kaiser, a German foreign ministry official, said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half of Russia's total debt of about $150 billion is owed
to Germany, and further debt relief would require a ``green light''
from the German government, Kaiser said. So far, such a go-ahead
was not in sight, he added.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several weeks, as the negotiations over Kosovo went
up and down, the White House had prepared several scenarios for the
meeting between Clinton and Yeltsin. In a worst-case scenario, some
officials were ready for a total blowup.
</P>
<P>
   Until almost the last moment, it looked as though the two men
would talk almost exclusively about Kosovo and finalize an
agreement on how Russian soldiers would operate with NATO in the
province.
</P>
<P>
   But with Yeltsin apparently giving the order to settle the talks
in Helsinki, Finland, before the summit meeting, the way was
cleared, according to Berger, for the two countries to be ``back in
business.''
</P>
<P>
   In their face-to-face meeting, held in an bland conference room
in a local hotel where the Russian delegation was staying _ a
locale chosen so Yeltsin would not have to move around too much _
Clinton reiterated the position of the other summit leaders on
economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Russia must meet the revenue-raising requirements set by the IMF
in order to start the disbursement of the $4.5 billion loan, the
president said. Berger quoted Yeltsin as saying: ``I am personally
committed'' to finalizing the IMF agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In agreeing in the joint Russian-American statement to discuss
the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty between the the two countries,
Yeltsin acceded to a process the Russians had previously refused to
consider, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration wants to start these discussions because
modifications to the treaty are needed if a decision is made to
deploy the national missile defense system proposed by Clinton in
his State of the Union address in January.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, the statement also said, pledged to work toward the
ratification of the START II treaty _ stalled by Russia's
Communist-dominated Parliament _ but that is a pledge the Yeltsin
government has made many times before. The two sides also agreed to
continue discussions on the START III treaty, which aims to reduce
both sides' nuclear arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   According to Berger's account, the Russian foreign minister,
Igor Ivanov, said that it was unlikely that the Russian Parliament
would deal with the START II ratification before its summer recess.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Yeltsin raised the issue of
Congress' lifting the Jackson-Vanik Act, a 1974 law that forbids
Russia to be automatically granted normal trading relations with
the United States because of Moscow's Soviet-era refusal to permit
freedom of emigration.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been declared eligible for normal trading relations
status, even though the law remains on the books, so the law has
little practical effect. Recent expressions of anti-Semitism by
Communist Party politicians in Russia have made Congress reluctant
to repeal the law, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   When told that those Russian politicians were blocking
congressional action, Yeltsin, according to a White House official,
replied: ``Give me the names. I will grind them down and come at
them like a ton of bricks.''
</P>
<P>
   On the question of Russia's helping Iran with nuclear
technology, Yeltsin said he wanted to be co-operative in working
out disagreements, administration officials said. He said he wanted
to revive what had been the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission _ named
after Vice President Al Gore and the former Russian prime minister,
Victor Chernomyrdin _ by including the new prime minister, Sergei
Stepashin. The proliferation issues could be dealt with under the
aegis of the new commission, Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
   As a special gesture to Clinton, Yeltsin presented the president
with documents on President Kennedy and his assassination which had
been declassified by Russian military and civilian archives at
Yeltsin's request, Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview afterward with CNN's Late Edition, Clinton
expanded on his thinking at the start of NATO's air campaign and on
his foreign policy generally. Asked if he thought the bombing of
Yugoslavia would last 78 days before Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic agreed to NATO's terms, he said: ``I thought that there
was maybe a 50 percent chance it would be over in a week.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``I knew if he decided to take the punishment of
the air campaign, it could go a long _ quite a long _ while.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was a doctrine that best characterized his
foreign policy, Clinton said it was that ``whether within or
beyond'' a country's borders, ``if the world community has the
power to stop it, we ought to stop genocide and ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   After Yeltsin flew back to Moscow, Clinton spoke Sunday night at
a short ceremony marking the move of the American Embassy in
Germany from Bonn to Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the summit meeting, Clinton said, coincided with a
potential turning point in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find ourselves at that pivotal moment between winning a
conflict and winning the peace,'' he said. ``Today the last Serb
forces are leaving Kosovo, in accordance with the deadline that has
been set.'' What happened now, the president said, ``will determine
the character of this Continent, the shape of our alliance and the
nature of our partnership with Russia for years and years to
come.''

PAK EASES THE PRESSURE WITH LPGA VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABSECON, N.J. _ With a horde of media from her native Korea
descending upon the Seaview Marriott Resort here, Se Ri Pak was
under enormous pressure Sunday. The 21-year-old felt the burden of
having to please an entire country, and she responded by winning
her first tournament of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Pak captured the $1 million Shoprite Ladies Professional Golf
Association Classic with a round of 5-under-par 66 for a total of
198 on the 6,051-yard Bay Course, an original design of Donald
Ross. She was spurred on by shooting a course and tournament record
of 63 on opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy I finally got one in 1999,'' said Pak, who won
four tournaments in her rookie season last year. ``No more
questions about winning one. I think my fans in my country will
start to trust me.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak, who presented the trophy to her father, Joon Chul, as a
Father's Day present, earned $150,000 by finishing two shots ahead
of Trish Johnson, who shot 65, tied for the best round of the day.
It was the best finish of the year for Johnson, who in 12 years on
the tour has three victories, the last in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who earned $93,092, narrowed the gap to one stroke with
birdies on 16 and 17, but that was the closest she could come to
Pak.
</P>
<P>
   Juli Inkster, the winner of three events this season, including
the U. S. Open two weeks ago, finished third at 10 under after
shooting 69.
</P>
<P>
   Pak started Sunday's round with a birdie on the second hole, the
most difficult on the course, chipping in with her sand wedge from
about 25 yards. She also made another birdie on the next hole, a
475-yard par-5, which played the easiest all three days of the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``That chip was great,'' she said. ``I felt confident that
everything would be OK the rest of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak said the victory came at the perfect time. She said it gave
her confidence to defend next week's McDonald's LPGA Championship,
the major she captured last year before winning the U.S. Open to
become the first rookie to capture two major titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a perfect week,'' Pak said. ``Everything is good going
into next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosie Jones matched Johnson's best round of the day in the
persistent drizzle coming off the bay. Jones shot 65 to finish in
fourth at 204 for her fourth top-10 finish in her last five events.
Jones has nine career victories, but none this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fairway woods were awful, but my short game took over,''
Jones said. ``I haven't been playing well on Sundays, so this is
nice to have going into next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Tammie Green got her fifth hole-in-one when she aced the
179-yard 14th with a 9-wood and won a Mercury Cougar.

LOUIS GLICKMAN, 94, REAL-ESTATE INVESTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Fla.)  (lb) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Louis J. Glickman, a widely known real-estate
investor and philanthropist, died on Friday at New York Hospital.
He was 94 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman formed a Manhattan-based real-estate investment company
in 1942 and was widely active in real-estate investments in the
United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   One of his best-known deals was not completed. In 1956, he made
it known that he had arranged to buy Carnegie Hall and planned to
tear it down and replace it with a 40-story office building.
Demolition was to begin when the Philharmonic-Symphony Society's
lease expired in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   But Glickman later dropped his option to buy the building, and
it was unclear whether a Save Carnegie Hall campaign or an
inability to finance the project on profitable terms led to his
backing out. The building was eventually preserved.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman's son Adam said that his father ``never had any
intention of demolishing Carnegie Hall; he basically got involved
with that to get some publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, Glickman offered $4.6 million for the Dakota apartment
building on West 72nd Street and for an adjoining lot. Soon after
acquiring the properties, he sold the Dakota to its tenants and the
lot to other developers, who built an apartment house, the Mayfair
Tower, there.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman was born and raised in Brooklyn, attended Brown
University and the University of Virginia, and entered the New
York-based real-estate and construction firm of his father, Pincus
Glickman, in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Glickman founded his real-estate investment company in
1942 and was its chairman after it became a corporation, his son
said. But in 1962 he was forced out of the corporation. His son
said he ``was overextended in some personal investments at that
time,'' and the corporation was acquired by a group of investors.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, Adam Glickman said, Louis Glickman was an
independent real-estate investor. He was dictating letters to his
secretary an hour before his death.
</P>
<P>
   The objects of his philanthropy included the United Jewish
Appeal, nonprofit organizations concerned with cerebral palsy and
epilepsy, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and Yeshiva and
Brandeis universities.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his son Adam, of Millburn, N.J., he is survived by his
wife of 67 years, the former Helene Hauptmann; another son, Warren,
who lives in Israel; four grandsons, and a sister, Ruth Gleen, who
lives near Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

HEADY PLAY: UMP WALLEYED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Sidebar to Angels-Yankees game story) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Of all the wacky moments in Sunday's 4-2 Anaheim
Angels victory at Yankee Stadium, the greatest was the catch, or
noncatch, by Reggie Williams against the right-field wall with one
on and one out in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who took over as a pinch-runner and defensive
replacement for Todd Greene in the top of the inning with the score
3-1, raced back to the wall on Chuck Knoblauch. At first, it
appeared to hit his glove, then his head before he grabbed it off
his chest. First-base umpire Mark Johnson signaled out and Williams
threw to first to complete a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Only problem: Replays showed that the ball hit the fence above
Williams' glove. It would have meant extra bases for Knoblauch and
an RBI. Surprisingly, Yankees manager Joe Torre never argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't see it from where we were,'' Torre said. ``We
couldn't tell if it hit his glove or hit behind, but obviously it
hit behind and the umpire didn't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   That play was one of at least a half-dozen breaks the Angels got
Sunday. But after ending a losing streak at six games, they could
only smile and tease Williams in the postgame clubhouse .
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I thought I caught it and if the man says so, that's good
enough for me,'' Williams said. ``No, I don't think I'll be
watching that replay.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ The morning spent watching tape promised to be rough. It
was worse. The spacing was terrible, the shooting even poorer. Big
men were fooled by double teams. Reserves were completely out of
sync.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was but one saving grace: The Spurs did lead the NBA
Finals 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   As the series moves to Madison Square Garden tonight, a New York
turnaround is looking much less likely than the Knicks'
inexplicable run to the Finals. But even though they are halfway to
a championship, the Spurs have struggled enough themselves on
offense to maintain the humility they seek when on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of funny,'' San Antonio forward Sean Elliott said.
``We feel like we're 2-0, but it's not as gratifying a 2-0 as we
wanted. We can't be picky about it, but we don't feel like we've
played well at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In the big-picture pursuit of their first championship,
aesthetics do not matter. The Spurs have won 13 of 14 playoff
games, including an NBA-record 12 straight. They have won 44 of
their past 50 games overall, losing just once in 53 days.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the chances of a Knicks comeback, Spurs guard Mario
Elie said, ``I just can't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Elie's vision is fine. New York's chances might be too small to
be detected by the human eye.
</P>
<P>
   But backed into a corner, the Knicks are expected to lift their
level of play at home. And even though the Spurs would still be
awarded the title with two more ``ugly'' wins, they cannot help but
want to play well on offense for its own sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us want to show the country how good we are,''
Elliott said. ``We sit out there in San Antonio, which is the 37th
(largest) media market in the country. A lot of people don't see
what we're all about. This is a great stage to show everybody we're
a great team. I know we have a lot better games in us.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a pair of convincing wins so far, the Spurs shot only
27-of-63 from the field in taking Game 2 80-67 on Friday night,
contributing to the lowest-scoring Finals contest since 1955.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offense was a little sluggish,'' Elie said. ``I expect it
to be a better game. They weren't really double-teaming. They were
sort of faking. But our big guys got a little confused. They need
to dribble a little bit and extend the double team a little longer.
Dave (Robinson) and Tim (Duncan) need to hold the ball a little
longer, give our outside guys time to shoot or set up the drives.
We have a couple things we know we can do better. I know we can
shoot better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we play better on the road. Our confidence level gets
higher on the road. It's sometimes tough playing in that (Alamo)
dome, getting a good look at the basket. You come in the Garden _
man, the rims look good. I saw all the guys smiling today. Shots
were going good. It's going to be good for us. When we went to LA,
Minnesota, Portland _ that Game 3, we played great.''
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 has been the Spurs' worst throughout the playoffs. They
defeated the Trail Blazers by one, beat the Lakers by three and
lost to the Timberwolves by nine. In Game 3 on the road, they beat
the Trail Blazers by 22, the Lakers by 11 and the Timberwolves by
14.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we went to LA after we had those two games that were
low-scoring, we got it up to 115,'' Spurs guard Avery Johnson
noted. ``As long as we've got more points, I don't care if it's
69-60 or 115-110. But it (the Spurs' offense) is not good. We saw
it on the film. That's one of the reasons when we come on the road
we play better. We come on the road with so many problems. And we
seem to correct those problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is because the Spurs are so unimpressed with
themselves that they don't allow the home adulation to go to their
heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our attitude has been the constant,'' Elliott said. ``It's
almost us against the world. We like people cheering against us. We
like when the fans get up and cheer for their team. It helps us get
sharp and get focused. Whenever teams make runs at us, we just
respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crowds don't bother us, and Tim is unfazed by anything. Who
knows what's going to happen in this building (the Garden)? But
it's not going to bother us.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Knicks refuse to consider the return home a panacea,
something needs to be. If San Antonio's offense has been
``sluggish,'' New York's has been downright atrocious.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs' defense deserves much of the credit for that, but the
Knicks are not about to concede that the combination of Duncan and
Robinson inside and the Spurs' sticky man-to-man defense outside
will paralyze their ability to get good shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, we usually learn from the first loss, and we
didn't,'' Knicks guard Allan Houston said. ``We played very
similarly. We have to rely and depend on each other instead of
doing it on our own. They are a very good defensive team, but we're
giving them too much credit by not playing together.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the Spurs can be motivated by seeing their sloppy play on
tape, the Knicks can see the same thing and find hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we can win,'' Houston said. ``I would be worried if I
looked at the tape and said, `This team is that much superior to
us.' We don't believe that. They are a very good team. They have
done what they've done for a reason. We're here for a reason also.
We've got ourselves in a hole, but we can win.''

In a notable triumph of practical politics over ideology, House
Republicans this year picked an advocate of abortion rights, Rep.
Thomas M. Davis of Virginia, center, to head the National
Republican Congressional Committee, which is responsible for the
party's drive to retain its House majority next year. The
Republican Party has undergone a fundamental repositioning, and
softening, of its stand on abortion, recognizing that a more
tolerant position on probably the most divisive issue in American
politics is crucial to its hopes of reclaiming the White House.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Even in death, Bob Bullock was bigger than life
Sunday, as several hundred friends and admirers _ including a
``Who's Who'' from two generations of Texas politics _ gathered to
pay their last respects.
</P>
<P>
   Central Christian Church, located two blocks from the state
Capitol, was filled with legislators, former legislators, members
of Congress, lobbyists and scores of what one former Bullock
staffer called the ``little people'' who at one time or another had
worked for one of state government's most influential _ and
demanding _ bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Mourners included every living former Texas governor and Lady
Bird Johnson, the widow of a president. The current governor and,
perhaps, future president eulogized Bullock as a mentor and the
``essence of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What a man! What a man!'' Gov. George W. Bush declared. ``Can
you imagine Bob Bullock and St. Peter? Bob's got him locked in a
conference room, and he won't let him out until he is happy with
his plan for eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Dr. Fabaus Landry, who officiated, said the former
lieutenant governor, comptroller, secretary of state and state
legislator was ``one of the giant oaks of Texas,'' who had worked
tirelessly to make life in his state better for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Rangers, the state's elite, legendary law-enforcement
force, were pallbearers, laying Bullock to rest on a rainy day in
the historic State Cemetery, not far from Texas founder Stephen F.
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, whose strong relationship to the veteran Democratic
officeholder crossed generational and partisan lines, said the
church wasn't big enough to hold all of Bullock's admirers.
</P>
<P>
   And, referring to the political tempests that periodically
rocked Bullock's four decades in state government, Bush joked, ``I
bet a few would come just to make sure he was really dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was one of the last people to visit with Bullock, 69,
before he died Friday, five months after leaving office. He had
been undergoing chemotherapy for lung cancer and recently developed
pneumonia and congestive heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``His (Bullock's) temper could break like a summer storm. His
tongue should have been registered as a concealed weapon. His
passions came out undiluted,'' the governor continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Bob, there were steel and acid. But there were also loyalty
and friendship and love. And there was something more _ the essence
of Texas: a frontier toughness, a sentimental heart, a rough-hewn
grace.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Bullock ``embodied the Texas of our myths and our
hearts.'' He compared his passing to Texans losing ``our tie to an
age of giants.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he learned from Bullock and ``will miss him as a
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullock angered some Democrats last year when he not only
endorsed the Republican governor for re-election over Democratic
nominee Garry Mauro, a former Bullock aide, but also said Bush
would make a good president. The statement came months before Bush
launched his campaign for the GOP presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But Mauro, ironically, was one of the first mourners to arrive
at the church for Bullock's services.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who visited Bullock last week after returning from a
campaign trip to Iowa and New Hampshire, said Bullock already had
lived, at that point, longer than his doctors had predicted and
bragged to Bush, ``Governor, I showed them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that Bullock, when asked about his health a couple of
years ago, was quoted as saying, ``I'm so busy, I ain't got time to
die.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the governor added: ``We all make time for death. And I
know, after a life of fighting, he has found a peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Former longtime aide Claudia Stravato said Bullock hired the
``best and the brightest'' but also hired people no one else wanted
and taught them to be the best and to be proud to work for the
state of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Bullock friend Byron Tunnell, a former speaker of the
Texas House and former member of the Texas Railroad Commission,
said he watched the transformation of Bullock from a law student
more than 40 years ago to the ``giant of a man he ultimately
became.''
</P>
<P>
   Tunnell said he will miss Bullock the most as a friend. But he
added, ``Though he would scoff at me for saying it, this man, this
friend of ours, has achieved true greatness ... by hard work, long
hours ... and sheer determination to do the job right.''
</P>
<P>
   Tunnell said Bullock _ who was a major budgetary player during
16 years as comptroller and had an active hand in virtually every
piece of major legislation enacted during eight years as lieutenant
governor _ didn't subscribe to the old government axiom, ``If it
ain't broke, don't fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he took it on, he fully intended to fix it whether it was
broken or not,'' Tunnell said.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Pete Laney noted that Bullock, in retirement,
continued to follow the Legislature's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, at the end of another legislative session, as if he was
finally satisfied that we could carry on without him, he left us,''
Laney said.
</P>
<P>
   Five former governors _ Democrats Ann Richards, Mark White,
Dolph Briscoe and Preston Smith and Republican Bill Clements _
attended Bullock's services. They all were in office during the
Bullock era, which began in 1956 with his election to the Texas
House from his hometown of Hillsboro.
</P>
<P>
   Smith hired Bullock as an aide and later appointed him secretary
of state.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred people, many huddled under umbrellas, stood in
the rain for the graveside ceremony that followed the church
services.
</P>
<P>
   A Texas Department of Public Safety honor guard presented
Bullock's widow, Jan, with the Texas flag that had draped the
former lieutenant governor's coffin.
</P>
<P>
   DPS troopers also fired three rifle volleys, and a bagpiper
played ``Amazing Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   The church service included audio and video highlights of
Bullock's recent public years, which closed with Bullock delivering
his trademark line, ``God Bless Texas.''

NEW YORK: our shows.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Similarly, the ascendant daytime format is the blend of talk,
drama, confession and theater seen on shows like Springer and Rikki
Lake.
</P>
<P>
   There is competition from the Internet, so that teenagers who
might have become hooked on the soaps in the past, now come home
and log onto their favorite sites on the Web. Or teenagers looking
for episodic domestic drama may be more likely to plug into MTV's
``The Real World,'' which follows the domestic lives and romantic
entanglements of actual twentysomethings.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, soaps face the problems confronted by all network
shows, in a new cable universe full of hundreds of choices.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fundamental soap opera convention is that no reversal
_ apparent death, doomed love, seeming ruin _ need be permanent,
and the news for the soaps is not all bad.
</P>
<P>
   Two cable channels have announced all-soap formats to debut next
year in the hope of rebroadcasting shows so more people can see
them. USA Network is introducing a show, ``The Avenue,'' which is
designed to be less like a conventional soap and more like a
British serial _ with more realism and less melodrama _ with the
goal of hooking viewers looking for different serial fare.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lee of NBC said that while the soap audience is down from
its peak, it is not clear how far it is down. Unlike the 1970s, she
said, Nielson ratings are an inadequate gauge for who is watching
soaps. More people now tape them and watch at night or watch in
groups that cannot be registered, like the eight teachers and 80
students she cited who watch daily after school on a big-screen
television at North Hollywood High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our problems is that we have no idea how big this
audience is,'' she said. ``That's a big problem, because I have a
business based on Nielson numbers, even if I might fantasize I have
a business three times bigger than the numbers show.''
</P>
<P>
   So, she said, even if the soaps may be reeling, they need not be
reeling toward oblivion. In the hope of making new technology work
for the format, NBC has set up a Website and a town map on the
Internet to help young people get hooked on ``Passions,'' which
makes its debut next month.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the 50 or so women who will show up at Blondie's talk
about the end of ``Another World'' as something very close to a
death in the family, Ms. Lee said women still crave the sense of
intense, personal involvement that soaps provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``If soaps have a future, and I think they do, it is in the
intimacy of the genre and the way it affects women viewers more
than anything else on television, even the talk shows,'' she said.
``We do focus groups on talk shows and soaps, and people see Jerry
Springer as entertainment, a circus. There's fantasy in the soaps,
but there's a lot of reality, too. People see real people with real
problems they can't see anyplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans take ``Another World'' so seriously that some are citing
the show's history in a last-ditch effort to save it. The Committee
to Save Another World, saying it represents 3,000 viewers, says it
is preparing a 400-page document to send to NBC's corporate
ownership and seeking a meeting with Jack Welch, chief executive of
General Electric, which owns NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we have learned from this 35 year experience with
`Another World' is that if you honestly believe in something you
must fight for it,'' Charlotte Swank, chair of the group, said in a
statement released via E-mail. ``This show has been a leader in
empowering women and men in the social turmoil of the last 35
years.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, the group concedes it is highly unlikely NBC will
continue the show.
</P>
<P>
   If most nonviewers would find it hard to see the decline of the
soaps as a major cultural loss, Ms. Leahey said in its own way it
does reflect the passing of something valuable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are deciding they'd rather spend that time working
on homework with their kids, you'll get no argument from me,'' she
said. ``But soaps have filled a need in people's lives. It was a
nice place to go, a nice, warm, cozy hour that was a little treat,
like visiting an old friend. There are a lot worse habits you can
have.''

NUMBERS THERE FOR KARROS, BUT HE'S HARDLY THRILLED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Eric Karros is a long-haul kind of guy. He knows
it, too. He might not dazzle you with his daily athletic
brilliance, but by the end of the season, his numbers are always
there.
</P>
<P>
   Few players have averaged 30 home runs and 102 RBI over the past
four years like Karros. And this year he is again on pace for
another typical Karros season.
</P>
<P>
   After he hit two home runs Sunday in the Los Angeles Dodgers'
3-2 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies, he was left with 12
home runs and 36 RBI (both third on the team) in 66 games.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he's getting too worked up about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody can say they're having a good season,
because we're not winning,'' Karros said. ``To say I'm having a
good season because I'm hitting a lot of home runs is (baloney).
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is having a great season. That's evident in the
win-loss column, not individual stats.''
</P>
<P>
   Rotation shuffle: That big shakeup of the rotation has turned
into a minor tweaking. Left-hander Carlos Perez, banned to the
bullpen after his latest disastrous outing, has been given a quick
reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said Perez (2-8, 7.38 ERA) will
likely start the Dodgers' second game in San Francisco on Friday,
the next time a fifth starter will be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Darren Dreifort was originally going to be bumped
from the rotation, too, but ended up taking his turn Saturday,
holding the Phillies to one run in 62/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Perez has been working with pitching coach Claude
Osteen since his infamous last outing Wednesday, trying to build
arm strength and loosen his delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue Squad: Hey, it was fun while it lasted. Like one entire
game.
</P>
<P>
   But one day after Johnson filled his lineup with reserves and
they responded with a 13-hit, 8-1 victory, it was back to the
regulars Sunday. Only Gary Sheffield and his sore knee remained out
of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we don't score runs, I reserve the right to mess with it
again,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson wanted to give Raul Mondesi his first day off of the
season Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but he didn't want it,'' Johnson said. ``He wanted to
play and we have (today) off. I'll get him some rest, though.''
</P>
<P>
   FYI: Sheffield said he expects to return to the lineup when the
Dodgers open a three-game series at home Tuesday against the
Padres. Sheffield said the right knee has bothered him occasionally
for the past two years, and he aggravated it diving for a ball....
With Kevin Brown's eight-inning start Sunday, the Dodgers starters
reached at least the seventh inning in four consecutive games for
only the third time this season.... More hope for a struggling
rotation: In the three games against the Phillies, Dodgers starters
allowed just five runs in 26 innings.

LONG DAY FOR DALY ENDS IN LAST PLACE 
DUVAL'S DISAPPOINTMENT 
PERRY SURRENDERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ Add another bizarre day to the wild life of
John Daly. Daly shot a 13-over-par 83 Sunday, including an 11 on
the par-4, 446-yard No. 8.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting his approach shot over the green, Daly twice tried
to putt up the slope onto the green, but the ball rolled back down
the hill.
</P>
<P>
   On his third putt, the ball started to roll back again, and Daly
lost patience.
</P>
<P>
   While the ball was still rolling backward, Daly gave it a whack
and sent the ball across the green and off the front edge.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Daly chipped and three-putted, then was assessed a
two-stroke penalty for hitting a ball in motion.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Daly, who shot a first-round 68 but ended up at
29-over and in last place, said he might skip the U.S. Open next
year at Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think it's worth my time,'' Daly said of the 2000
Open. ``I just feel the courses are set up too unfair. I'm not
going to go to Pebble and watch the USGA ruin that golf course
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval's Disappointment
</P>
<P>
   David Duval, the world's No. 1-ranked player, started the day
just three strokes off the lead, but he shot a 5-over-par 75 to
finish tied for seventh. A bogey at No. 7 and a double bogey at No.
9 took Duval out of contention for his first major championship.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he were disappointed, Duval said: ``Probably more than
you can imagine. Coming in, I felt good about my chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry Surrenders
</P>
<P>
   Showing his respect for Pinehurst, and a sense of humor, Chris
Perry dropped to his hands and knees, then crawled the final 10
feet to the 18th green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be kind of funny,'' said Perry, who
finished at 17-over par for the tournament. ``I knew the crowd
would like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year at the Open at the Olympic Club in San Francisco,
three golfers finished at 20 over or worse. At Pinehurst, 16
golfers who made the cut were 20 over or worse, including Tom
Watson, Tom Kite and last week's winner on the PGA Tour, Ted Tryba.
</P>
<P>
   Tryba was 19 under in winning the FedEx St. Jude Classic. He
finished at 28 over this week.

EXCLUSIVE: INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE REPORT WON'T LINK BREAST IMPLANTS
TO DISEASES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: CORRECTS amount to $7 billion in last graf) (rk) 
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   An independent panel of 13 scientists convened by the Institute
of Medicine at the request of Congress has concluded that silicone
breast implants do not cause any major diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some women with breast implants are indeed very ill and the
IOM committee is very sympathetic to their distress,'' the group
wrote in a report to be made public on Tuesday. ``However, it can
find no evidence that these women are ill because of their
implants.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, more than 400 pages long, says that the ``primary
safety issue'' with implants is their tendency to rupture or
deflate and to lead to infections or hardening or scarring of the
breast tissue. There is little argument about these localized
problems, which can be painful and disfiguring and which often lead
women to have additional surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But the report asserts in forceful terms that there is no reason
to believe that the implants cause rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or
any other systemic disease. Women who say their implants have
caused them to suffer these or related problems have turned breast
implants into a leading source of liability litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The report was provided to The New York Times by an organization
that consults in the breast implant matter and, a spokesman said,
that ``is pleased with the report's conclusions.'' The report is
the latest in a series of evaluations that have concluded there is
no scientific evidence to support the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Because it comes from the Institute of Medicine, the medical arm
of the National Academy of Sciences, the nation's most prestigious
scientific organization, it is expected to be influential in
setting scientific agendas and encouraging women to accept
settlements from implant makers rather than take their cases to
court.
</P>
<P>
   In preparing the report, panel members held public hearings, met
in private and evaluated more than a thousand research reports. The
Institute panel did not conduct any original research. Rather, the
panel relied primarily on research reported by other scientists.
But the report said that since lawsuits were first filed in the
late 1980s and early 1990s, there have been many scientific studies
upon which to make an evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, scientists appointed by the judge overseeing
implant liability litigation, Sam C. Pointer Jr., of U.S. District
Court in Alabama, came to a similar conclusion as the Institute
panel and a report issued last July by scientists in Britain who
had been charged by the British minister of health to review
implant safety.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists appointed by Judge Robert E. Jones of U.S. District
Court in Oregon, reached a comparable conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Dow Corning Corp., which filed for bankruptcy
citing the burden of its breast implant litigation, has agreed to
pay women $3.2 billion to settle their claims. Other implant
manufacturers, Baxter International, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and
Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, have agreed to a settlement
estimated at $3 billion combined.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, thousands of women have settled their cases in
private agreements with implant makers or gone to trial and won
awards that reached millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Medicine committee estimated that about 1.5
million to 1.8 million American women have had silicone breast
implants, about 70 percent for breast enlargement, the rest as
reconstruction after mastectomy.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the committee, headed by Dr. Stuart Bondurant, a
professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill, and Dr. Virginia Ernster, a professor of epidemiology at the
University of California in San Francisco, were prohibited from
discussing the report until it is officially made public.
</P>
<P>
   Sybil Goldrich, founder of Command Trust Network, an information
clearing house for women with silicone problems, said, ``I find it
extremely difficult to accept what the Institute of Medicine says
because those studies are paid for by the manufacturers. They have
not convinced me that their review is correct. It is as simple as
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Jacks, a lawyer in Austin, Tex., whose firm has
represented 425 women with implants, said he doubts that the report
will be the last word on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report is simply a review of the literature by a
committee that's reached some conclusion,'' Jacks said. ``It is
premature to conclude that reports like this are the last word that
scientists and physicians will have about the safety of breast
implants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But medical experts informed of the committee's conclusions,
applauded them.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Shaun Ruddy, the chairman of the rheumatology, allergy, and
immunology division at Virginia Commonwealth University's Medical
College of Virginia in Richmond, said that the conclusions were
``very forthright and outspoken'' and that he was glad the group
was attempting to put the disease hypotheses to rest. Ruddy, a past
president of the American College of Rheumatology, said he has had
no part in any of the litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Medicine committee was set up at the behest of
Congress. It's work began with a public hearing on July 24, 1997,
when almost 700 people filled an auditorium at the National Academy
of Sciences in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of medical professional associations made
statements, scientists spoke about their research, and women with
implants spoke of how their lives had been ruined by them. Some
said that they were so ill that they needed canes or wheelchairs to
get around, conditions they blamed on the implants. Others
testified that after they breast fed their babies, their children
developed the same debilitating symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Examining more than 1,200 references, the group addressed the
major questions about implants: Do they cause established
connective tissue diseases, like arthritis or lupus? Do they cause
breast cancer, nerve diseases, like multiple sclerosis, or new
diseases with symptoms like aches and pains and overwhelming
fatigue? Are children of women with breast implants at risk for
disease because of silicone transmitted across the placenta or in
breast milk? Do breast implants produce immunological reactions
that could cause disease?
</P>
<P>
   In every case, the committee concluded, there was no convincing
evidence that implants were at fault. When lawsuits were filed in
the late 1980s and early 1990s there was a lack of research on the
topic. Since then, according to the report, ``a number of strong,
well-designed epidemiological studies involving large numbers of
women and clear results have been published.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For example, the group wrote, the evidence is ``insufficient or
flawed.'' that implants cause ``atypical disease,'' a term covering
signs and symptoms like weakness, fatigue, and diffuse muscle pain.
But the group said that evidence on the other side is strong.
``Controlled epidemiologic studies cited'' led the committee to
conclude that ``there is no novel syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   On the question of established connective tissue diseases, like
lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, the group reviewed 17
epidemiological studies and concluded that they were ``remarkable
for the consistency of finding no elevated risk or odds for an
association of implants with disease.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing a description of the report, David Bernstein, a
law professor and adviser for the American Tort Reform Foundation,
a business-sponsored group, said that, coming as it does in the
wake of similar reports, the report ``might have a dramatic effect
in hastening the end of the litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very strong statement,'' Bernstein said. But he added
that it was a shame that the legal system went ahead on the
litigation in the absence of science, with companies paying
billions to compensate women with implants. ``It would have been
nice to have had this $7 billion ago,'' Bernstein said.

   WASHINGTON _ The hodgepodge gun-control bill that died on the
floor of the House of Representatives on Friday was as much
political Rorschach test as legislation. Turn it one way, and a
congressman might look like a gun-control zealot. Turn it another,
and he might look like a die-hard defender of the Second Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Take Rep. Rick Lazio, a Republican from Suffolk County on Long
Island who is a virtual candidate for the Republican nomination for
U.S. Senate. (Although he has not declared his candidacy, Lazio
said on Friday that an official announcement would be ``pro forma''
at this point.)
</P>
<P>
   To win the nomination, Lazio, who is generally viewed as a
moderate, must broaden his appeal among the conservatives who
dominate Republican primaries. But he must also differentiate
himself from his apparent chief rival, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of
New York City, who is arguably more liberal than Lazio on several
fronts.
</P>
<P>
   So, many analysts wondered last week, would Lazio follow other
moderate Republicans and buck his party's conservative leaders by
voting for a Democratic measure requiring criminal background
checks for gun buyers at gun shows? Or would he heed the call of
the right and support a much weaker gun-show amendment endorsed by
the National Rifle Association?
</P>
<P>
   The answer was: both.
</P>
<P>
   In a crucial vote late Thursday, Lazio sided with gun-control
advocates, voting against the weaker gun-show measure and for the
stronger one, which was sponsored by Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y.,
whose husband was killed and son seriously injured by a gunman on
the Long Island Rail Road in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But the weaker measure, sponsored by Rep. John D. Dingell,
D-Mich., prevailed and was incorporated into a broader gun-control
bill that the House voted on Friday. At the urging of his
leadership, Lazio voted for the final bill, breaking with
gun-control advocates in both parties who argued that no bill was
better than one with Dingell's amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The final bill was defeated, 280 to 147, as some conservative
Republicans, who thought the gun-control measure too strong, joined
with almost all the Democrats, who thought it too weak.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Lazio's fellow moderate Republicans joined with the
Democrats in voting no, but Lazio was one of only about a dozen
Republicans who voted for both the McCarthy amendment and the final
bill. Among that group was another potential New York Senate
candidate, Rep. Peter King of Nassau County.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said Lazio's votes were a classic bit of fence
straddling. On the one hand, he could tell gun-control advocates
that he had voted for the McCarthy amendment; on the other, he
could also assure gun-control opponents that he had voted for the
Dingell amendment that was part of the final bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``As usual, he tries to split the baby,'' said David Bishop, a
Suffolk County legislator who is considering seeking the Democratic
nomination next year for Lazio's seat.
</P>
<P>
   But Lazio said in an interview that there was no inconsistency
in his votes. He said he supported the McCarthy measure because it
closed a loophole in the Brady law, which he also supported. But he
said he voted for the final bill because he thought it included
other important gun restrictions. (The bill's provisions included
mandatory trigger locks, new restrictions on the possession of
semiautomatic rifles by children under 18 and a ban on the
importing of high-capacity ammunition clips.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be folks who grumble no matter what I do,'' he
said. ``It's important for me to be true to what I believe and stay
consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, this vote typifies Lazio's struggles to bridge the
gap between the centrist and conservative camps in his party.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he supports abortion rights but has voted for
prohibiting late-term abortions and against Medicaid financing of
abortions. And while he has often supported President Clinton's
policies, he voted for impeachment. And while he calls himself a
fiscal conservative, he regularly opposes Republican efforts to cut
spending on federal programs, including health care and the
National Endowment for the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   He is a leading member of several moderate Republican groups in
Congress, but he has also worked to get closer to the conservative
House majority leader, Dick Armey of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats see in Lazio's record a calculating politician who can
be portrayed on the stump as an opportunist with no clear
philosophical core. ``What we need are solutions, not political
votes,'' said Bishop, the county legislator.
</P>
<P>
   To which Lazio replies, ``It is my goal to see if I can
transcend a label.'' But he does not deny that he has tried to cut
a more conservative image in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   He is also very openly courting leaders of the Conservative
Party in New York state. For the last 20 years, Republicans have
needed help from third parties to win statewide elections.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Long, the party's state chairman, described Lazio as a
``moderate conservative'' with a mixed record on issues of concern
to conservatives. He said, for example, that some conservatives
would be disappointed that Lazio had voted for Mrs. McCarthy's
gun-show amendment, which he described as extreme.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said that Lazio might have helped himself by voting
for the final gun-show bill, which he called ``decent
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, the final one is the one that counts,'' Long
said.  &QL;

ROAD, SWEET ROAD: SPURS ARE UNFAZED BY GARDEN'S AURA
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ First, the good news for the Knicks entering Game 3:
they're at home.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news? The Spurs aren't.
</P>
<P>
   As the Knicks return to the presumably friendly confines of
Madison Square Garden Monday night down by 2-0 in the best-of-7
championship series, they face an obstacle even more ominous than
Tim Duncan: the San Antonio Spurs play better on the road than in
the Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs haven't lost on the road in almost two months, since a
104-100 defeat to Sacramento on April 27. They finished the regular
season 16-9 on the road, and have won all six of their road playoff
games by an average margin of 13.4 points. That is six points more
than their margin of victory in their seven home playoff victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concentration level seems to get higher,'' said the Spurs'
Mario Elie, a New Yorker. ``When you're on the road and in a
hostile environment, all you've got is your team and your coaches.
Your focus has to be high.''
</P>
<P>
   Bumpy mattresses, crummy room service, bad choices on
pay-per-view television. Nothing seems to unsettle a team that,
according to David Robinson, even manages to thrive on the energy
of the unfamiliar pre-game pyrotechnics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just a little more fearful of the road,'' Steve Kerr
said. ``We have a little more edge. When you play that way, you're
a little more dangerous. We tend to get a little too confident at
home.
</P>
<P>
   During the playoffs, playing at home is tougher. You've got all
the distractions, the tickets, family staying with you. When you go
on the road, you stay in a hotel, you're isolated, it's easier to
lock in.''
</P>
<P>
   That is terrifying news for the Knicks. The Spurs, although
nobody in New York may have noticed, have not played their best
game in the finals. Their perimeter shooting, for one thing, has
been subpar.
</P>
<P>
   The antidote for that seems to be to get away from the
notoriously difficult dome setting. The Spurs shoot better from the
field, from the 3-point arc and from the free-throw line on the
road than at home. They also rebound, assist and steal better.
</P>
<P>
   And their defense, already the best in the league, even seems to
rise a level on the road. A final indignity for opponents: the
Spurs make them shoot worse from the field and from 3-point range
in their own building than they do in the Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been able to ignore external circumstances because we're
a grind-it-out team,'' Robinson said. ``We have that good
mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, the Spurs figure, is the result of years of churning
through big games. Although most of the Spurs _ with Kerr, Will
Perdue and Mario Elie the notable exceptions _ have never won a
championship before, this is a veteran group, with years of
experience in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Spurs paid homage to Madison Square Garden, to the
New York fans, even to the celebrities who will be courtside. And
then they coolly dismissed the notion that any crowd, any setting,
could rattle them. They won two in Minnesota, two in Los Angeles
and two in Portland. The Garden, for all its glamour, should be no
different, they feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out attitude has been a constant,'' Sean Elliott said. ``It's
like us against the world. It helps us get sharp. I've been in the
league for 10 years, David for 10 years, Avery for 11, Mario for 9
or so. Crowds don't bother us. Tim is unfazed by anything. Who
knows what could happen in this building, and it's not going to
bother him.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery Johnson said: ``When teams go on a 10-2 run and the crowd
gets into a game in the middle of the fourth quarter, we don't
expect to crack up. You always see guys pointing to their heads on
this team, reminding ourselves to stay mentally tough. I guess age
and maturity have something to do with it.''

STATE'S `TOBACCO SLAYING' ATTORNEY GENERAL HONORED BY MAGAZINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN PAYNTER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ With the character issue now a top campaign priority,
Good Housekeeping magazine's golden seal of approval is something
any officeholder would love to take to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   But while Washington state Attorney General Christine Gregoire
will get the magazine's highest award for women in government on
Wednesday in Washington, D.C., she will not be allowed to accept
the $25,000 check that comes with it.
</P>
<P>
   Why not?
</P>
<P>
   Because the rules of the Washington State Ethics Commission,
which works for the Attorney General's Office, say that no one in
state government can receive any additional compensation for simply
doing his or her job. No matter how far beyond the call of duty
they may go and no matter where the money comes from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crazy as it may sound, the Ethics Board is very strict about
this,'' Marty Brown, Gov. Gary Locke's deputy chief of staff and
legislative director, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Gregoire was chosen first among 10 ``women who made a
difference'' in 1999. ``The Tobacco Slayer,'' as the article calls
her, is being honored for tenaciously waging the tireless
negotiations that ultimately forced the nation's top cigarette
makers to pay taxpayers a $206 billion settlement. And for ridding
the landscape of Joe Camel and other cigarette ads aimed at kids.
And for helping to secure millions of dollars from big tobacco for
a campaign to discourage teen smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, if you were in the private sector, you would get a
bonus or a contingency fee for something like this,'' Brown said.
``But that's not the way the Ethics Board works. Unfortunately,
it's just seen as doing your job _ really, really well.''
</P>
<P>
   No one argues the months Gregoire spent separated from her
family to hammer out the settlement in New York City amounted to a
huge sacrifice, Brown said. ``But the problem is where do you draw
the line?''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, nobody in the Department of Labor and Industries
got a reward for the $4.4 million settlement _ including a record
$1.1 million fine _ that was paid to the state by Equilon Puget
Sound Refining after the Anacortes, Wash., explosion in November
that killed six.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gregoire is reportedly the only winner of the Good
Housekeeping prize who ever had to turn down the money. She admits
she was surprised and she says the people from Good Housekeeping
were ``shocked'' when she told them she couldn't take the money.
</P>
<P>
   The award was established with the thinking that people who go
into public service are less handsomely paid than those in the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Last month a citizens panel raised Gregoire's salary from
$93,000 a year to $123,000. Commission members noted that some
state officials hadn't seen any raises, including cost-of-living
adjustments, since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Gregoire has no intention of fighting the ethics rule and
emphasizes that, check or no check, she is thrilled with the award.
</P>
<P>
   Gregoire didn't even know she had been nominated for the award
by Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Margaret McKeown until an
editor from the magazine called for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went home and told my family and they couldn't believe it,''
Gregoire said on Friday while en route to meet Vice President Al
Gore on his presidential campaign stop in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Gregoire had told her two teenage daughters,
Courtney and Michelle, the $25,000 would be equally spent on their
educations.
</P>
<P>
   The other nine winners will receive $2,500 each.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend the Gregoire family got together via conference
call to decide which charities will get the money.
</P>
<P>
   Gregoire, her husband, Mike, and their daughters will donate
$5,000 each to the charity of their choice. Then, as a family, they
will give the remaining $5,000 to one charity they all like.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney, 19, is working in Washington, D.C. this summer and
will join her mother there for the awards ceremony while Mike stays
home to take Michelle, who just finished the eighth grade, to her
soccer game.
</P>
<P>
   Gregoire took a red-eye flight home from the tobacco
negotiations last year to be in the bleachers for one of Michelle's
games. But she missed too many others, she admits.
</P>
<P>
   Mike takes in stride the good-natured kidding he sometimes gets
as the husband of one of only seven female attorneys general in the
country. When he goes to events for spouses, the outings are
usually shopping trips and museum tours.
</P>
<P>
   He'll change that when he takes charge of spouse events when the
National Association of Attorneys General has its annual meeting in
Seattle next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Next week Gregoire will travel to Nashville, Tenn., for this
year's annual convention. The group recently elected Gregoire
president by a unanimous vote.
</P>
<P>
   And what's next for the ``tobacco slaying'' medal winner, the
woman Mississippi Attorney General Michael Moore nicknamed the
``Tiger Lady'' for her never-back-down style?
</P>
<P>
   Since the settlement victory, and since deciding not to run
against Sen. Slade Gorton for a seat in the U.S. Senate, Gregoire
pondered her options.
</P>
<P>
   Some say she will surely be offered a presidential Cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
   She says she'll believe that when she sees it. And she won't
talk about it until then.
</P>
<P>
   She has also been urged to run for governor and Gregoire says
she is not ruling that out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say that the state may very well be the key,''
Gregoire said. ``At this point, I haven't seen the federal
government capable of reaching into the lives of everyday people to
help them solve their problems.''

 &HT;    Braves pound big lumps on `Big Unit,' 10-4
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The biggest shame for Braves fans back in Atlanta is
that they couldn't see this one.
</P>
<P>
   In the Braves' first game not televised back East, they pulled
off the remarkable and dwarfed the other accomplishments of this
road trip _ the back-to-back wins by Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux,
winning three of four from the NL Central-leading Astros.
</P>
<P>
   They raked Randy Johnson and hit five home runs in a 10-4 romp
over the Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the 6-foot-10, 100-mph pitcher known as ``Big Unit,'' who
had humbled the Braves with 15 strikeouts on April 10, was chased
after five innings, having allowed four homers for the first time
in his 11-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Javy Lopez hit for two of them, both two-run shots, and Gerald
Williams hit one of his two for the night off Johnson to lead off
the game. Lopez, who started this road trip with six home runs, now
has 11.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves completed their two-city swing with a 5-2 record,
having beaten the top teams in the NL Central and NL West, and
return to Atlanta with the league's best record at 42-27.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who had won five starts in a row, surrendered seven
runs on nine hits, the most runs he has allowed since coming over
to the National League from Seattle last July. The Braves had four
consecutive hits off him in the fifth inning, including
back-to-back home runs by Lopez and Andruw Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the first inning, it was going to be Glavine who
would have the long night. He needed 41 pitches to get through the
inning after he loaded the bases twice, walked three batters and
gave up a hit. But he allowed only one run, on a Steve Finley
sacrifice fly, and gave himself a chance to win in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks manufactured three runs off Glavine, one each
in the first three innings, but once he got the 7-3 lead in the top
of the fifth he buckled down.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves wanted to get to Johnson early, and Williams, the
leadoff hitter, took it to heart, sending the first pitch of the
game to the right field seats.

MUSIC REVIEW: THE VIRTUE OF THE SIDELINES, WITH TIME TO TOY AROUND
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ten years after it got started, Pavement still makes its songs
sound shaky. It could by now crank up its guitars in big resounding
chords; it could notch up its tempos to push people around.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, briefly, it does, only to let the sound and momentum
subside within moments. Its guitars slip out of unison, picking
instead of chording and hollowing out the music. Stephen Malkmus,
Pavement's main singer and songwriter, keeps his voice
conversational, though he sometimes works up to an exasperated
yelp. Pavement has held its place as a paragon of indie rock by
refusing to project rock's illusion of authority.
</P>
<P>
   Pavement is comfortable now that indie rock has moved back to
the commercial sidelines. Its following is large enough to sell out
three shows at Irving Plaza; it's not being pressed to come up with
a hit single. On Pavement's early albums, Malkmus ruminated about
the meaning of success and how it could corrupt him. Now he has
calmed down, stringing together non sequiturs and toying with song
structures.
</P>
<P>
   He writes choruses that are tuneful and direct _ ``Ann, don't
you cry'' _ between verses full of fractured observations. Malkmus
knows Pavement's fans will ponder the songs and tease out meanings;
it's a collegiate crowd, one that burst into applause on Wednesday
night when he sang, ``Architecture students are like virgins with
an itch they cannot scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   Malkmus grows a little too relaxed on the band's new album,
``Terror Twilight'' (Matador). The songs are more evasive than
usual, perhaps because more than one alludes to a painful breakup:
``Time is a one-way track/I am not coming back,'' Malkmus sang in
``You Are a Light.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet onstage, the songs seemed less opaque. Their meaning was in
the way the music would rise, lurch in a new direction, settle for
a moment into a chorus or a big riff and then crumble, as if
sabotaging itself before outside forces could do any damage.
``Platform Blues'' drifted through folksy finger-picking, a
harmonica-driven shuffle, chugging rock with extroverted lead
guitars, a slow deflation and a final burst of harmonica: not a
dramatic arc but a wayward ramble.
</P>
<P>
   Older songs like ``Summer Babe'' and ``Stereo'' chipped away at
their verses before allowing their choruses to break through.
Teetering between fragility and determination, Pavement still has
the courage of its halfheartedness.

   John P.Lopez
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PINEHURST, N.C. _ He has walked among golf's legends but always a
couple of paces back, never really being one of them.
</P>
<P>
   He was like a nervous hanger-on among a generation of names
you'll never forget: Fred Couples, Greg Norman, Ben Crenshaw, Nick
Price, Nick Faldo and Seve Ballesteros.
</P>
<P>
   They all had something Payne Stewart didn't have. They had green
jackets or big, powerful swings. They had passionate looks in their
eyes, like those of Ballesteros and Crenshaw. They had machine-like
precision, like Faldo and Norman.
</P>
<P>
   And they had moments _ something Stewart never had, at least not
until a damp, unforgettable Sunday evening at a place called
Pinehurst No. 2, where Stewart finally earned what money and
knickers couldn't buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid, I used to imagine I was Jack Nicklaus,
putting on the green for a win,'' Stewart said. ``I used to think,
`I'm going to be Jack today. I'm going to make this putt and win
the U.S. Open.'''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he was. What happened on No. 18 at Pinehurst was a
moment that might surpass anything anyone in his generation has
produced.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart sank a 15-foot putt on the 72nd hole of the U.S. Open.
It was as dramatic as anything you'll see. And it was something you
can only feel. It made Stewart a legend.
</P>
<P>
   No longer is he only the guy in the funny knickers. No longer is
he merely a great pro but nothing special to the masses. No longer
just a golfer who has won more than $10 million on tour and even a
couple of major championships but somehow never chased away the
reputation that hounded him.
</P>
<P>
   He had no nerve. He lost leads. He played only for the money. He
was great but not special.
</P>
<P>
   ``I considered myself a pretty good and pretty accomplished
player,'' Stewart said. ``I thought nobody could ever take that
away from me no matter what was written and said about me.''
</P>
<P>
   But things definitely were written and said.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't putt under pressure. His irons faded on Sunday
afternoons. Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson would take him.
</P>
<P>
   For so long he was the guy who used props, not a clutch game, to
bring attention to himself, dressing in those wild outfits. For
some reason, not even a couple of major championships _ the PGA in
1989 and the U.S. Open in 1991 _ could earn Stewart a spot among
his generation's greats.
</P>
<P>
   Those others, those Faldos and Normans, all seemed to have
something something that made crowds gather 10-deep against the
ropes and watch in awe. They all seemed to have something that made
imaginations dance.
</P>
<P>
   They were a generation of super-talents that arrived after Jack
Nicklaus, Lee Trevino and Gary Player, then dominated the tour and
bridged the game into the era of David Duval, Justin Leonard,
Mickelson and Woods.
</P>
<P>
   And somewhere there was Stewart, always walking a couple of
paces back. But then there was Sunday afternoon, when Stewart
walked across Pinehurst No. 2 with a game and an outfit that
turn-of-the-century Pinehurst designer Donald Ross would have
loved.
</P>
<P>
   He did things he never had done before and earned something he
never had before.
</P>
<P>
   His irons were true and his putting spectacular. Through much of
the day it was Mickelson's putter that looked unshakable. But every
time Mickelson made a big putt down the stretch, Stewart's face
showed no emotion as he walked calmly to the next hole.
</P>
<P>
   Then, it was Mickelson who began to waver, yanking a couple of
big putts on the final three holes. Later, Mickelson admitted that
he began to feel things slipping away going into those final three
holes.
</P>
<P>
   And it was there where Stewart finally gripped his place in the
game. The 25-foot putt on No. 16 to save par was one of the most
clutch shots the tour has seen in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought,'' Mickelson said, ``he could beat me.''
</P>
<P>
   The tee shot to within five feet and a birdie on the 191-yard
17th, which gave Stewart the lead, was dead-on. And then there was
18.
</P>
<P>
   There was a wayward tee shot and no choice but to lay up 77
yards from the hole with the Open championship on the line. There
was the chip that landed well short, rolling back slightly to 15
feet. There was the stunning silence and Stewart leaning over the
putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was telling myself, `You've given yourself a chance. Do
it,''' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   And he did. The putt never wavered, like he never wavered.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart jumped into the air, hugged his caddie, kissed his wife,
cried, yelled and shook his head over how unbelievable the moment
was. It was a moment like few before, a moment the nation had to
embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where this puts me in the golf world,'' he said later, ``I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is all so clear now. Maybe today, some kid somewhere will
hitch up the hems of his pants, stand over a putt and imagine that
he is Payne Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``To question his toughness is not right,'' Mickelson said. ``I
have to admit, he had something that I didn't have in the last few
holes.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because Stewart is something that Mickelson and the
entire next generation of greats can only aspire to be. A golfing
legend, finally.

BROWN PITCHES DODGERS TO VICTORY
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just as Kevin Brown had stopped acting as though
he were the only one on the Los Angeles Dodgers who could be
counted on, stability returned to their stormy seas.
</P>
<P>
   And Phillies started going down faster than tired ``Austin
Powers'' jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off his worst outing of the season, Brown struggled in
the first inning Sunday afternoon before settling down and
recording 18 consecutive outs on the way to a 3-2 Dodgers victory
before a Dodger Stadium crowd of 46,347.
</P>
<P>
   He was helped along the way by three solo home runs _ two by
Eric Karros and one by Devon White _ and having two Phillies thrown
out at the plate, but Brown was in complete control after
surrendering two runs on the only five hits he allowed in the first
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was all over the place in the first inning,'' Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson said. ``He made about three mistakes, and
they got 'em all. But then he settled in and was pretty much
perfect from then on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing was Brownie putting seven zeros up after a shaky
start and a shaky last outing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the Dodgers had managed consecutive
victories in more than two weeks. They have won more than two
straight only once this year after a season-opening, three-game
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   With most of his regulars back in the lineup after going largely
with reserves Saturday, Johnson hardly saw the Dodgers play perfect
baseball. There was this little problem remembering how many outs
there were.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, catcher Angel Pena started walking off the field
after Brown struck out Kevin Jordan ... for only the second out.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the eighth, after Brown walked pinch-hitter Kevin Sefcik
with one out to snap his 17-consecutive batter streak and Sefcik
was sacrificed to second, Brown forgot how many outs there were.
</P>
<P>
   Pena flashed the sign for a fastball, but thinking there was
only one out, Brown thought he called for a slider. Surprised by
the pitch, Pena let the ball sail past deep to the backstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real bad play on my part,'' Brown said. ``I crossed
Pena up. It was my fault, and then we came out smelling like a
rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was brain dead right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sefcik charged around third and tried to score. Pena retrieved
the ball and fired to Brown at the plate; Brown's tag just beat the
sliding Sefcik.
</P>
<P>
   Brown left after eight innings, having allowed two runs on five
hits and two walks. He struck out five. Jeff Shaw pitched a
scoreless ninth for his 16th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brown kept us close all game long and we were able to scratch
back,'' Karros said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had to turn to their comeback routine because Brown
(8-4) again struggled to open the game. In his previous start,
Brown gave up eight runs (four earned) on eight hits in just three
innings.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as though it would be more of the same in the first
when Doug Glanville opened by bouncing a hit up the middle. Rob
Ducey doubled to left, and when Todd Hollandsworth tried to field
the ball, spin and come up throwing, he threw about 10 feet for an
error to allow the first run to score and Ducey to take third.
</P>
<P>
   After Ducey scored on a Bobby Abreu groundout, Scott Rolen
singled. Brown struck out Mike Lieberthal, but Kevin Jordan and
Marlon Anderson added base hits.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Eric Young made a nice stop up the middle on
Anderson's hit and fired off-balance to home, where he just nipped
Rolen trying to score.
</P>
<P>
   After Brown gave up a one-out walk in the second, he induced
Glanville into a double play to begin his string of 18 consecutive
outs.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers came back against Chad Ogea (3-6), who entered
having won only one of his past 10 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Karros homered in the second, White in the fourth, and Karros
for a second time in the seventh for his 12th home run of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Brown did the rest, giving the Dodgers a little something to
count on.

WARHERO (Phoenix) _ Edward Sherlock doesn't have much time left.
</P>
<P>
   A stomach problem, which has plagued him since being released as
a prisoner of war during World War II, has slowly deteriorated his
body. For now, most of what he sees is in room 526, bed B, at a
hospital in Sun City West. And some days, his family feared, there
wasn't much more for the 75-year-old. But as Sherlock's wife, Anna,
and son, J.W., searched through his old Army records, trying to
find something that might increase his veteran's benefits and help
pay his bills, they discovered a secret of his past. Sherlock is a
war hero. They already knew he had spent 27 months as a prisoner of
war. But what they didn't know was that his efforts fighting in
three battles in North Africa during World War II had earned him a
Bronze Star, a Purple Heart and several other ribbons for his
service. By LAURA TRUJILLO. Story will move in the ``A'' category.

   ALS (Phoenix) _ The hard part about having a fatal disease in
1999 is that the promises of miracle cures, genetic antidotes and
biococktails twinkle all around like lights of distant rescue ships
_ too far off to be of assistance. ``It's very maddening,'' said
Kevin Spicer, afflicted with Lou Gehrig's disease. ``I wish those
breakthroughs would be available right now, before the disease
takes over more of my body.'' Lacking the muscle control to speak,
the Tucson man communicates these thoughts through his computer
e-mail system. Spicer's disease, named for the baseball legend who
died of it in 1941, is scientifically known as amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, or ALS. Though the disease has no cure, many of its
victims do not sit and wait. An estimated 20 percent of Arizonans
with ALS, including Spicer, are enrolled in research projects. ALS
gradually destroys the motor nerves, causing muscles to atrophy,
leading to paralysis. Arizona's 250 to 300 victims of Lou Gehrig's
disease know that three to five more years of life is the most they
can expect after diagnosis. In Arizona, at least four major studies
are under way at Mayo Clinic Scottsdale and at the University of
Arizona. Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix also is
nationally known for its research on ALS, though it doesn't have a
study under way presently. &QL;
