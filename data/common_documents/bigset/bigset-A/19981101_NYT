A&AMP;M RIDES TAYLOR, DEFENSE PAST OKLAHOMA ST.
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STILLWATER, Okla. _ Texas A&AMP;M's Chris Taylor is fast gaining a
reputation as a game-breaker on a team sorely in need of one.
</P>
<P>
   On a night when they lost their leading rusher and starting
quarterback to injury, the Aggies definitely needed their fleet
wide receiver in order to escape rain-swept Lewis Field with a 17-6
victory over Oklahoma State. The victory officially qualified A&AMP;M
for a bowl game and kept the Aggies a game ahead of oncoming Texas
in the Big 12 South with three games to play.
</P>
<P>
   Eighth-ranked A&AMP;M is now 8-1 and unbeaten in five conference
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really concerned about this game,'' coach R.C. Slocum
said. ``Coming up here and playing on Halloween night and the whole
shebang. It was a patchwork kind of thing, but it was a neat team
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Running back Dante Hall left in the first quarter with a nerve
stinger in his left shoulder. Quarterback Randy McCown did not
return after bruising his right shoulder early in the third
quarter. Both are questionable for this week's game with Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor, who was timed in 4.31 seconds in the 40-yard dash
last spring, thrice added to a big-play portfolio established
earlier against Baylor and Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor caught a 34-yard scoring pass, returned a kickoff 84
yards to set up the go-ahead touchdown and set the table for a
37-yard field goal by Russell Bynum with a 19-yard grab.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to make some plays,'' said Taylor _ who had
scored on a 61-yard reverse against Baylor and caught an 81-yard
scoring pass against Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's long kick return midway in the second quarter was the
exclamation point to a Wrecking Crew defensive stand that forced
OSU to settle for Tim Sydnes' 27-yard field goal after the Cowboys
were in a first-and-goal situation at the Aggies' 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris Taylor is really coming on as a player,'' Slocum said.
``That was a big play. But if I look at a turning point, it was
when the defense went out there after \RTrent Alexander's
interception of a McCown pass\S and held them to a field goal. Then
we run the kick back.''
</P>
<P>
   OSU was up, 6-0. Taylor took the high kick at his 3-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up the field and saw a few seams,'' he said. ``I just
picked one and hit it. I wanted to go left, but decided to go
right. I ran out of energy about the 19.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where OSU's Evan Howell tripped him up. Taylor stumbled
to the OSU 13. After two 3-yard gains by Ja'Mar Toombs, McCown hit
receiver Max Bumgardner on a slant for the TD and a 7-6 lead after
Bynum's point-after kick with 6:44 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of jump-started the offense,'' said Taylor, whose
19-yard catch was the key play in an ensuing 58-yard drive to a
37-yard field goal by Bynum and a 10-6 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   McCown and the Aggies took the second-half kickoff from their 20
to a first-down at the Cowboys' 27 in seven plays. But after a
20-yard completion to Dan Spiller, McCown was jarred on an option
pitch that went out of bounds for a 7-yard loss. He threw
incomplete on the next down and left the game with a bruised right
shoulder, not to return.
</P>
<P>
   Enter once-deposed Branndon Stewart, who on his first snap threw
a 34-yard strike to Taylor on another slant pattern for the TD less
than three minutes into the half. He finished the game and in
Hall's absence, Toombs split time at fullback and tailback and
gained a career-high 111 yards on 23 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Wrecking Crew held the Cowboys to 172 yards total
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pretty much shut them down the whole game,'' safety Rich
Coady said. ``We never gave them much hope of winning this game.''

HACKETT PLAYED THE FOOL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On Tuesday USC head coach Paul Hackett said he'd
dress up as a clown whenever he decided to change his starting
quarterback. Who knew he was divulging his Halloween costume?
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone should have been surprised. What else was he
supposed to come to the Coliseum disguised as Saturday, John McKay?
</P>
<P>
   Hackett started Carson Palmer in place of Mike Van Raaphorst in
the Trojans' pivotal Pacific-10 game against Washington and Palmer
made him look silly for having waited so long.
</P>
<P>
   The freshman from Orange County passed for 279 yards and one
touchdown in USC's 33-10 win. He threw across his body and he threw
his body around. He threw so far his receivers needed binoculars to
track the ball and a track sprinter's speed to catch up to it. He
threw on the run and ran for first downs.
</P>
<P>
   On the field Palmer was a study in democracy, spreading his 18
completions among nine receivers. In the locker room afterward he
was a model of diplomacy, deflecting questions about whether or not
he should have been starting say, seven weeks ago, as deftly as he
did would-be Huskies blitzers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a good decision,'' Palmer said of Hackett's
stubborn insistence on starting the incumbent, Van Raaphorst, in
the first eight games and substituting Palmer at prescribed points.
``I don't think I could have started before this week. I don't
think I would have done very well. I wasn't mentally ready.''
</P>
<P>
   If Palmer's point was he didn't have a prompt solution for every
conceivable situation that could have cropped up in the first two
months, he's right. The thing is, hatching a collegiate football
career is a lot like having a baby.
</P>
<P>
   No amount of careful planning can prepare you for every little
thing that little bundle of joy will throw at you for the next 18
years. Similarly, no amount of film study can prepare you for what
it feels like to have an eight-man front breathing in your face.
</P>
<P>
   There is only so much you can learn without doing. In the end,
anticipation is no match for experience. But how can a kid with
only nine weeks of college behind him be expected to figure that
out?
</P>
<P>
   Hackett is old enough to know better than to let Palmer sit and
sit and sit while half the season lurched past. He certainly has a
few years on senior split end Mike Bastianelli, who nonetheless
read the situation right. He told fellow receiver R. Jay Soward
earlier in the week, ``If Carson is going to be the man of the
future, they might as well throw him in there to get his feet
wet.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how Soward recalled the conversation, anyway. On this
afternoon the speedy junior was more quiet on the field (three
catches for 16 yards) than off it, though you could see the
potential for a lot of noise from Soward down the stretch. He and
Palmer were slightly out of sync on a couple of long balls and
Soward dropped a couple of other perfectly thrown passes.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, Soward said. ``He has a great arm and with my
speed we should (click),'' he said. ``We've just got to get on the
same page.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever page Palmer is on, you can bet it's dog-eared.
</P>
<P>
   The thing about Palmer, said USC senior Chad Morton, ``is he
wants to be the absolute best. He wants to know everything about
the offense. He's a great student of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer gave himself average marks for a performance that
included a 26-yard scramble for a first down on the third play of
the Trojans' opening series, a 57-yard scoring pass to Billy Miller
in the final minute of the first quarter and an interception inside
the Huskies 30 in the fourth quarter that was wiped out by a
Washington pass interference penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I did anything special,'' he said. ``The
receivers were open. I had plenty of time to throw. I did all
right.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the interception, don't tell Palmer it didn't officially
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I shouldn't have thrown that ball,'' he said, sounding
disgusted with himself. ``It was a stupid mistake. I was trying to
make too much happen. I should have just thrown it away.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the most emotion Palmer displayed during his post-game
group interview with reporters. His demeanor generally ranged from
bland to vanilla. Of course, the same could be said of the
Homecoming crowd of 62,276, which must have torn into its bags of
Halloween candy for breakfast, so appallingly low was the energy
level throughout the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Palmer's pyrotechnics couldn't light a fire under the
crowd. But his agility and his arm sure sparked the offense. The
Huskies blitzed on nearly every play in the early going, but the
18-year-old Palmer maintained his poise.
</P>
<P>
   That impressed Hackett, who said, ``How he handled himself, I'm
really pleased with.''
</P>
<P>
   After catching five of Palmer's passes for 109 yards, Miller had
every reason to be winded. He didn't need to waste much breath to
give his slant on Palmer. ``The kid,'' he said, ``is talented.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, he's more mobile than Van Raaphorst. Indeed, there
are cellular telephones that don't roam as well as Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times he got chased out of the pocket and created
things,'' said Morton, who broke a 10-yard touchdown run and a
50-yard run on his way to 110 yards. ``He moves around great and
that opens up a lot of things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carson doesn't even really act like a freshman,'' Morton
concluded. ``He's not goofy or anything. He's got this stern look
on his face all the time. He's all business.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result Hackett was able to indulge his playful side.
Mindful of his clown comment, he strode to the interview platform
with a bag containing a multi-hued wig. You know, the kind clowns
wear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to put it on,'' Hackett quipped, ``but I did
bring it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first of hopefully many Saturdays to come, so did
Palmer. &QL;

VAN RAAPHORST UNHAPPY WITH BACKUP STATUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While USC quarterback Carson Palmer was drawing
raves for his first career start, previous starter Mike Van
Raaphorst was virtually forgotten, forced to watch much of the game
sitting on a bench among the Trojans' redshirts.
</P>
<P>
   Although Van Raaphorst said he had been informed Tuesday he lost
the starting job to Palmer, he was hardly taking the situation any
better after the Trojans' 33-10 victory over Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I'm not happy I didn't get to play,'' Van Raaphorst
said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Van Raaphorst was disappointed because he believed USC
coach Paul Hackett had told him both quarterbacks would play
against the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to play,'' Van Raaphorst said.
``(Hackett) said they were going to handle it the way it was
handled all season. It's his team and his decision. I really have
no influence on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I would like to play, but we won today and I'm glad for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said his plan the rest of the season was to have Palmer
start and play exclusively, with Van Raaphorst the designated
backup.
</P>
<P>
   Bastianelli at kicker?: Hackett was so upset over the Trojans'
kicking woes he threatened to give wide receiver Mike Bastianelli a
chance to win the position.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Adam Abrams missed two field goals, and is two for his
last seven. Hackett sent junior David Bell in to kick an extra
point, but it was blocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got obviously a major problem with the field-goal
situation. We're bad,'' Hackett said. ``I told Adam, `You're done.'
I wanted to go with David, and he kicked the ball into a guard's
rear. We've got a problem. I'm upset.''
</P>
<P>
   And with that, Hackett said he might let Bastianelli try kicking
in practice.
</P>
<P>
   McCutcheon plays through pain: Cornerback Daylon McCutcheon
experienced numbness in his shoulder and hip after two separate
incidents in the first quarter. McCutcheon was forced to sit out
several series in the first half while being treated by trainers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time, I think it was a stinger in my neck,''
McCutcheon said. ``The second time, I never felt anything like it.
I went numb. I felt better in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   McCutcheon said if he doesn't feel better today, he will
probably undergo tests to see if the cause of the numbness can be
determined.
</P>
<P>
   Morton hits 100: Tailback Chad Morton rushed for 110 yards,
giving him six 100-yard games in his career, including four this
season. &QL;

NORTHRIDGE PICKS APART WEBER STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OGDEN, Utah _ Officially, it took linebacker Shayne Blakey 10
seconds to run 76 yards with an interception for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, a muddy and sloppy Stewart Stadium field hampered his
speed, but it felt like Blakey was running for an eternity. Perhaps
because so many things happened during it, including a shift in the
game's tenor and the destruction of Weber State's season.
</P>
<P>
   However, the most important thing to come of it was the life it
gave Cal State Northridge. The Matadors snapped a two-game losing
streak and remained in the slowly-thinning Big Sky Conference title
hunt by virtue of a 26-10 triumph against the No. 23 Wildcats on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, after two losses it's huge to get a win,''
Matadors coach Ron Ponciano said. ``I really believe there was a
little doubt amongst this team, but as the game went on they
started believing a little bit. I saw it in the team that they
weren't 100 percent believing they could come up here and win.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN did win. And now the Matadors (5-3, 4-2 Big Sky) are in a
three-way tie with Portland State (5-3, 4-2) and Montana (6-3, 4-2)
for second place in the Big Sky. Montana State (6-2, 4-1) remains
in first after rallying to beat Northern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, kiss Weber State goodbye. The Wildcats (5-4, 3-3)
lost for the fourth consecutive time and saw its season combust and
evaporate into fumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our dreams are shattered for providing a championship and an
opportunity to continue to play for our seniors,'' Weber State
coach Jerry Graybeal said. ``My thing now is to build on the
character of the guys who will be with us for the seasons to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that aggravation was caused by CSUN quarterback Marcus
Brady. He shook off a shaky game a week ago to complete a
career-high 27 passes (in 39 attempts) for 264 yards and three
touchdowns. Once-forgotten Drew Hill was Brady's receiver of the
day, catching a season-high 10 passes for 92 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But what made Brady so much more effective against Weber State
was a return to his type of play calls. Brady likes throwing
crossing patterns, which he did with tremendous accuracy against
the Wildcats' zone.
</P>
<P>
   After displaying a nice touch on a fade route to Aaron Arnold
for CSUN's first score, Brady found Mike Ogas between the safeties
late in the first quarter for a 35-yard scoring strike and a 14-7
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to a lot more quick passes, underneath stuff because
they were dropping back into a zone,'' Brady said. ``It's easier to
see because the receivers are coming across the middle. We haven't
been doing that much this season so it was open.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing CSUN wasn't able to do during its losing streak was
force turnovers, but that changed. Weber State turned the ball over
five times, which led to 13 CSUN points.
</P>
<P>
   Ogas' score was set up after Eric Carpenter forced and recovered
a fumble on a punt return, though that served only as a delicious
prelude to Blakey.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh out of halftime and trailing 14-7, Weber State quickly
moved the Matadors 25.
</P>
<P>
   But on second down Blakey stepped in front of Chris Wallace's
pass to Bryan Rubin coming out of the backfield. The pick in hand,
all Blakey had to do was sidestep Wallace downfield before huffing
and puffing into the end zone as the Matadors took a 20-7 lead 1:47
into the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone keeps telling me (I'm slow), but that ground was wet
out there and my legs felt like they weighed 50 pounds,'' Blakey
said. ``I was like, `Oh, Oh,' and I saw (Wallace) coming and I was
wondering if he was going to get me. I stopped and saw him slide
past, but I was still 15 yards away and I was like, `Oh, man.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did CSUN's defense intercept Wallace three times, it
also halted the second-best running attack in the league. Morgan
Welch, who ran for 61 yards on 15 carries, was held over 100 yards
below his average before being benched in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense played their tails off,'' Ponciano said. ``Our
whole thing was not to flinch during the game because we knew Weber
State would move it. We knew they'd pop a run, but we didn't want
to flinch. And they wind up getting 10 on us, which is good.''

WOMAN HELD IN CASE OF NEWBORN IN DUMPSTER

   GLENDALE, Ariz. _ A dazed Iran Jimenez stared straight ahead
Friday as she limped toward a trash bin near her apartment,
cradling a grocery bag under her arm, neighbors said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale police believe Jimemez, 21, placed her newborn baby
girl in the dumpster, wrapped in a towel and a grocery bag.
</P>
<P>
   She was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and child
abuse Saturday and booked into a Maricopa County jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``She looked dazed, confused, she couldn't walk, her hair was
all messed up,'' Cicilia Ledesma said Saturday. She believes she
saw her next-door neighbor place the infant in a trash bin.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't look around. She did not seem to care who was
looking or what. She just was quiet and she just waited there,''
Ledesma said. ``It looked like she was going to faint.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez, who neighbors said has a 4- or 5-year-old son, declined
requests to be interviewed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Jimenez gave birth to the infant at 1 p.m. Friday
and placed her in the dumpster about 1:30 p.m. at the Maryland West
Apartments, 4530 West McLellan Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investigators believe she discarded the baby in the dumpster
because the father of the baby is no longer in her life,'' Glendale
police Officer Matthew Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby Sarah,'' named by hospital nurses, still had her
umbilical cord attached when she was pulled out of the trash
container and taken to the hospital, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The infant weighs 6 pounds, 12 ounces and is 19.5 inches long
and healthy, a hospital spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   She is at least the fifth abandoned baby found in the Valley in
the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Four neighborhood kids discovered the infant, about 10 minutes
after she had been placed there, when they heard crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just, like, walking out there and we heard a noise. It
sort of sounded like a cat,'' said Kathy Kennedy, 10, one of the
children who found the infant.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy's friend Alicia Hinds, 12, peered into the trash bin and
noticed something move, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby was in a plastic bag, wrapped in a maroon towel, with
a whole bunch of garbage in it,'' Alicia said.
</P>
<P>
   The girls went to the hospital Saturday to see the infant and to
drop off stuffed animals for her. ``I felt good that it was alive
and healthy,'' Kathy said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said Jimenez spoke little English and kept to herself.
</P>
<P>
   She appeared to be an attentive, caring mother to her young son,
who was always well dressed and cheerful, Angie Reyna said.

NO PLACE TO GET KICKS  
 ASU, UA LACK SOCCER PROGRAMS FOR MEN

<P>
   PHOENIX - David Rawlings lives just a few miles from Arizona
State. He wishes he could go there, wear maroon and gold, make his
family and friends proud. But he can't even think about it.
</P>
<P>
   ASU does not have a Division I men's soccer program. Neither do
Arizona and Northern Arizona, for that matter. The issue is
complex, and athletic directors agonize over the dilemma. They say
they'd like to offer men's soccer, but must solidify gender equity
in their departments first.
</P>
<P>
   So, the state's best high school player works concession booths
at Valley concerts to earn enough money to travel with his club
team to California every other weekend. There, he can showcase his
talents to UCLA, Santa Clara, California-Irvine, San Diego State,
San Jose State, Stanford _ anybody with a Division I soccer
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real unfortunate for me,'' said Rawlings, a Mesa Dobson
High senior. ``If ASU had a soccer program, it would be a
no-brainer. I'd be there in a second.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Rawlings weighs offers from California schools and
hopes to get something close to a full scholarship to make his
trips worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings is special in Arizona. Last season, the forward was the
only junior to make the All-Arizona team. He had 26 goals, three in
the final minutes of a heart-stopping state semifinal match to
rally Dobson past Brophy.
</P>
<P>
   In California, where there are more than 290,000 registered
youth players, there are a lot of David Rawlingses, and Division I
coaches are more apt to pay for two in-state college educations at
the price of one out-of-state superstar.
</P>
<P>
   ``David will get his scholarship,'' said Mike Robasco, coach of
the Arizona Football Club team, the Hammers, who comprise most of
the Valley's best prep juniors and seniors, including Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real tragedy comes with the fringe players, those guys who
aren't the Gatorade players of the year. Most college teams have
three superstars. The rest are role players around them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do they go?''
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, they pay their way onto Division I campuses, if
they've got about $20,000. Or they head north to Yavapai College,
which has taken advantage of some of this state's best talent to
win three national junior college championships in the '90s. Or
they attend one of the state's other junior colleges. Or they join
the only intercollegiate soccer program this state has to offer _
Grand Canyon University, which two years ago won the NCAA Division
II national title.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Ehren Nelson, end up leaving their soccer ball at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, a star defender at North Canyon High last year, was
recruited by Stanford, but the Cardinal decided to save money by
offering local scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Nelson was set to go to St. Mary's University in
California on a half-scholarship. But, Robasco said, Nelson figured
why should he spend $10,000 on a college education when he can get
a free one at either ASU or UA on an academic scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's now at UA and I don't think he's even playing for their
club team,'' Robasco said. ``It's a shame. He can't play what he
loves. That's the bigger tragedy.'' &QL; 
Equity issues
</P>
<P>
   Stories like these exasperate soccer aficionados, whose passions
run deep in Arizona. They see the flame burn among Arizona youth,
only to watch it flicker out after high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand it,'' said Aaron Muth, the boys soccer
coach at Gilbert High, who, after graduating from Mesa Westwood in
the late '80s, left Arizona for a partial scholarship at UCLA.
``The best players have to get out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Title IX has led to an influx of women's soccer programs, but it
has tied those same schools' hands when it comes to adding the
sport for men. Of the 310 NCAA Division I member schools, 250 have
soccer programs for women and only 191 for men. Ten years ago,
there were only 72 Division I women's programs and 191 men's
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Schools have to abide by gender-equity regulations. Scholarships
need to be balanced. Most go to the football program, which is
allowed 85 scholarships. No women's sport comes close to that many.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we get Title IX, gender equity solidified, we probably
won't have (men's) soccer as an intercollegiate program,'' UA
Athletic Director Jim Livengood said. ``If we added it, we'd have
to add a couple of women's sports to balance out.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU and UA started their women's teams about three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great that ASU started a women's program, but you'd think
the men's program would be a priority,'' said Willie Watson, a
former professional player from Scotland, who coaches the Glendale
Community College men's team.
</P>
<P>
   Both ASU and UA have men's club programs that battle obstacles,
such as sharing the women's field, finding sponsors, trying to get
an ounce of recognition from their universities.
</P>
<P>
   But they stand in line with the rugby, lacrosse, ice hockey and
water polo clubs that also seek intercollegiate status.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a money issue,'' Livengood said. ``It falls in
line with the equity issues. I believe in every one of these
activities.'' &QL; 
Closed doors &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't satisfy people in the soccer world such as Muth,
who knows how fast soccer has grown in America since his youth, how
more Americans dominate the pro game than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of silly,'' Muth said. ``You have a fully funded
women's program. To not have any men's program there at that level
is stupid. Not even UCLA has a fully funded men's soccer program.
They give six to eight scholarships. Who cares if ASU doesn't have
it fully funded? Give them something. It's not like they can't
afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   Records indicate more than 11 million males play the game across
the nation, that more boys compete in soccer than football and
baseball in the United States and that nearly 30,000 youngsters are
registered in youth soccer in this state.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how I look at it and the passion for the sport in
the soccer community, it's difficult to add it as a sport at ASU,''
said Herman Frazier, ASU's senior associate athletic director.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Canyon Coach Petar Draksin says he would welcome the
competition. Now, he gets players after their two years at Yavapai
and other top juco programs in the state. This summer, he said he
was lucky to snag forward Manoel Coehlo from Mesa Community
College. Coehlo has set the Grand Canyon season record for points
with 47. He has 20 goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some say if the other universities had programs, it would hurt
Grand Canyon,'' Draksin said. ``No, it would not hurt Grand Canyon.
Intrastate rivalries are nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to be intimidated, we don't belong here as
coaches. Let's face it, we're all in this because we love the game
of soccer.'' &QL; 
`A wasteland'
</P>
<P>
   Three players with Arizona ties play in Major League Soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Brophy graduate Scott Garlick is the goalie for DC United. Dusty
Hudock, who was at Grand Canyon one year, is a backup goalie for
the Chicago Fire. And Greg Vanney, who set a state scoring record
at Tempe Marcos de Niza in the early '90s, plays midfield for the
Los Angeles Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Arizona sent six high school players to top Division
I programs, such as Santa Clara, South Carolina and Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Robasco says he currently has 12 players with the Hammers who he
believes can play collegiately next season, nine of them at a
top-20 Division I program. But maybe a handful will land a
scholarship out of state, he figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grand Canyon is not a horrible option,'' said Muth, who
finished his collegiate career there, ``but, if you're a good
soccer player and you want to play D-I soccer, it's a shame you
have to go out of this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Valley stars Evan Whit field and Jac Gould were lucky
enough to do so. Whitfield, who played at Brophy, is a starting
defender at Duke, which has been ranked No. 2 in the nation this
year. Gould, who starred at Thunderbird two years ago, was accepted
at Yale, where he has scored nine goals.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Gould helped Valley club power Cisco capture the
under-19 national championship.
</P>
<P>
   More than four years ago, Whitfield said he was recruited by
UCLA, Notre Dame and Santa Clara, besides Duke. Both of his parents
graduated from ASU. He also had a sister who went there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know one thing, if ASU had a program, it would have been a
lot tougher choice,'' Whitfield said. ``I would have definitely
considered ASU.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of friends here whose brothers and sisters go to
ASU. A lot of East Coast people like Arizona. They'd have great
recruiting potential with the climate and atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   About 15 years ago, when soccer was considered the
fastest-growing youth sport in America, Cary Gould had his son,
Jac, in the sport, figuring ASU and UA would be dangling recruiting
carrots in front of their son's face by the time he reached his
senior year at Thunderbird.
</P>
<P>
   ``We luckily bucked the odds,'' said Cary, who assists Willie
Watson's soccer program at GCC. ``But if I knew then what I know
now, he would have played football. Or we would have moved to
California. Arizona is a wasteland.'' &QL; 
Untapped market &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's not a wasteland at the junior colleges and at Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Canyon won the national championship two years ago with 13
in-state players.
</P>
<P>
   Yavapai won the national junior college title last year, and, in
a recent national poll, is ranked No. 2. In the same poll, Mesa is
ranked sixth and Glendale 15th.
</P>
<P>
   Cary Gould believes if ASU had a men's program, top coaches
across the country would line up outside Athletic Director Kevin
White's office, and it would take less than three years for the Sun
Devils to compete with a UCLA or Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   Yavapai has built a dynasty recruiting mostly Arizona talent.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Pantalione's teams play before large, rockin' crowds in
Prescott, where his Yavapai teams have lost only two home games in
10 years. Pantalione said he had 20 former Arizona prep players on
the roster when the team won its first national title, in '90.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since then, four-year college coaches have come into this
state and seen this as an untapped market,'' Pantalione said.
``They've come into the Phoenix and Tucson areas and taken some of
the best players.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody goes Division I, though, and some good players
have been left home, wondering when and if ASU and UA and NAU will
ever open their doors to men's soccer programs.
</P>
<P>
   The answer for now is no.
</P>
<P>
   But they keep kicking, if not screaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would make life so much easier if there was a program
here,'' 17-year-old David Rawlings said. ``I just have to write
letters, keep in contact, and hope things work out.'' &QL;

COYOTES TRADE RONNING TO NASHVILLE FOR PICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - It was a move that left the Coyotes' locker
room in silence and had General Manager Bobby Smith talking about
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes were greeted at their morning skate Saturday with
news that veteran second-line center Cliff Ronning and defenseman
Richard Litner, a young prospect playing for AHL Springfield, were
traded to expansion Nashville for an undisclosed draft pick in next
summer's draft.
</P>
<P>
   Ronning, who played an integral role in the drive to the
playoffs last season, was tied for team lead in scoring with two
goals and five assists and was averaging a point a game while
centering second-line wings Rick Tocchet and Greg Adams.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the evolution of a hockey team, this is something you have
to do sometime,'' Smith explained. ``It's a risk. I take
responsibility for the risk. We're making room for our young
players to progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to look at Daniel Briere. He's not a player who's
going to improve in the AHL (Springfield). He was the best player
in that league last year. And he's not going to improve playing a
minor role on our team. He's a player who can significantly improve
our team if he comes in an improves over the season, as can Juha
Ylonen. He's tough, plays at a high tempo and can play alongside
top players.''
</P>
<P>
   A risk is putting it mildly, considering the compensation the
team will receive is undetermined and Ronning is a known commodity
who scored 106 points (51 and 55) in two previous seasons in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``The compensation depends on how those guys perform. We're not
going to speculate on what the draft pick will be,'' said Smith,
who added at this point Phoenix won't receive a player.
</P>
<P>
   Ronning was puzzled by the trade, which was consummated Saturday
morning after 10 days of talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I was surprised,'' he said. ``Especially after I just
read in ``(The Republic)'' about how well the second line was
playing. No one has indicated to me what the situation is. Who
knows? It's probably a business decision. It didn't seem it was
because of my play.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith conceded business was involved. Ronning, 33, is in the
final year of a $1.5 million contract and becomes an unrestricted
free agent at the season's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had something to do with it, but not as much as wanting to
make room for our young guys to play,'' Smith said. ``Cliff was a
very valuable player last year, but I don't look at it like we're
subtracting his offense from our team. He was given prime ice time
with top-rate linemates and whoever plays in that position and get
the ice time is going to be productive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cliff is more experienced and is a better player today, but
Briere is capable of playing defensively, very capable of playing a
top player and capable of playing in traffic. He was a marked man
in the AHL and the more they focused on him, the more he scored.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Schoenfeld concurred the move is risky, knowing
Ronning was a bird in the hand and Briere, 21, and Ylonen, 26, are
projections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate what Cliff did for this organization,'' he said.
``Last year, during the second half when the injuries mounted, he
was one of those guys who made a great push for the team. He
accomplished a lot and we're grateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I said earlier that the greatest improvement for this team
will come from our corps of youngsters. See what Oleg (Tverdovsky)
is doing with more ice time. Organizations have to make decisions
to allow for growth. The pressure doesn't fall on Danny's
shoulders, or Juha's. It falls on the entire team to keep
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Briere, 5 feet 9, 185 pounds, is scoreless in limited play in
three games after suffering a concussion in the final preseason
game. He was the AHL's Rookie of the Year last season, scoring 36
goals with 56 assists for 92 points.
</P>
<P>
   Ylonen has three points in seven games after scoring 12 in 55
games last season. He's excellent on the penalty kill and in
defensive situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' Ronning's linemate Tocchet said. ``Cliff
and I played together almost a year and had a good chemistry going.
They wanted a goal a game from the second line and we were giving
it to them. There is a lot of stuff going on in this league that
doesn't make sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter who you play with you have to produce. Danny has a
shot now. I remember when I was young and given my shot. As a vet,
I have to help out Danny and Juha as much as I can, maybe elevate
my game even more.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams, who was also Ronning's teammate in Vancouver, said he's
losing more than a center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing from a personal standpoint; he's the only
one I knew before I came here,'' Adams said. ``We have guys who can
replace him on the ice, but you can't replace a friend off the
ice.'' &QL;

USC BEATS WASHINGTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With USC one more slip-up away from becoming
irrelevant, coach Paul Hackett finally made the decision he
steadfastly avoided for eight games.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of stubbornly clinging to his two-quarterback
rotation, Hackett abruptly ended the Trojans' long-simmering
uncertainty at the position by going with true freshman Carson
Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   And it may have just been a coincidence, but USC's season
retained some semblance of importance just as clarity came to the
quarterback controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans defeated Washington 33-10 Saturday before 62,276 at
the Coliseum, vastly improving their bowl hopes while anointing an
18-year-old as their No. 1 quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't all Palmer's doing. The Trojans' defense did its part
by intercepting five passes, returning two for touchdowns and
keeping Huskies quarterback Brock Huard from making many big plays.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems Carsonmania has enveloped USC since the
season-opener against Purdue, and Saturday was no different. He
certainly met all expectations as he became just the second true
freshman to ever start at quarterback for the Trojans (the first
was Rob Johnson in 1991).
</P>
<P>
   Palmer did not disappoint. He completed 18 of 31 passes for 279
yards and one touchdown. He also provided the swagger and
confidence to the offense that seemed to be missing so often this
season.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise wasn't that Palmer played well, but that Hackett
pulled the trigger on the decision. He had angrily told reporters
last week he would ``wear a clown suit'' when he made the decision
to replace Mike Van Raaphorst, and said he would personally call
each one to inform them of the change.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Hackett kept mum all week and brought a clown's wig to
the post-game press conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to put it on, but I did bring it,'' Hackett
said.
</P>
<P>
   He informed Palmer on Tuesday that he would start, but told him
to keep it quiet because he didn't want to tip off Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett not only made Palmer the starter, but decided to play
him the entire game, the first time this season a Trojan
quarterback has gone all four quarters. It will be this way the
rest of the season, especially if Palmer continues to play like he
did against the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, Mike had eight starts and opportunities to lead
the team,'' Hackett said. ``I felt Carson deserved an opportunity
to show what kind of player he could be as the clear-cut leader of
this football team.''
</P>
<P>
   It also happened to be a move that preceded the Trojans' most
desperate circumstance of the season.
</P>
<P>
   If USC (6-3, 4-2) had lost to Washington, the Trojans would have
needed two victories in their final three games against Stanford,
UCLA and Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a make it or break it game,'' linebacker David Gibson
said. ``If we lose, the whole season goes down the tubes. Today was
now or never.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone didn't feel that sense of urgency, it was Palmer, the
super-cool freshman who threw a 57-yard touchdown pass to Billy
Miller in the first quarter and never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I did all right. I didn't do anything special,''
Palmer said. ``I was excited. I couldn't wait. I don't know if I
was ready mentally (to start) until this week. I was anxious.
Tuesday night. I couldn't wait. It seemed like it took forever (to
reach Saturday).''
</P>
<P>
   Although Palmer helped stake USC to a 14-0 halftime lead, the
Trojans were hardly in control. Hackett blistered them in the
locker room, upset over a missed field goal, a fumble and costly
holding penalty on a run by R. Jay Soward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came in the locker room and coach Hackett let us have it,''
Miller said. ``We were making mistakes and letting Washington back
into it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans didn't exactly stop making mistakes in the third
quarter. Washington (5-3, 3-2) cut the lead to 14-10, as Huard got
hot during his 62-pass performance, which tied the Pacific-10
Conference record for passes in a single game.
</P>
<P>
   The game got away from the Huskies, however, when Grant Pearsall
intercepted a Huard pass at the Washington 20. Three plays later,
Palmer threw his worst pass of the game, and it was intercepted by
Anthony Vontoure.
</P>
<P>
   But officials called defensive back Nigel Burton for pass
interference against Mike Bastianelli, and the Trojans kept the
ball. Petros Papadakis scored on a 1-yard run and USC went ahead
20-10. Antuan Simmons put the finishing touches on the victory by
returning a pair of interceptions for touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do some things really well,'' Hackett said. ``Last week we
let one get away from us. The maturation process has to do with how
we respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about Carson Palmer. I'm not not worried about him at
all. It's how the rest of the team responded to Carson Palmer. Our
defense really responded. They just kept coming at Brock Huard, who
is a fine quarterback, and all of a sudden he threw it to us.''

STARS CLIP WINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Mike Modano said he hasn't once this season heard
linemate and renowned puck hog Brett Hull call for the biscuit.
</P>
<P>
   Until last night.
</P>
<P>
   Skating wide open in the left circle with the Stars and Detroit
Red Wings locked in a titanic struggle, Hull called for the puck
with six minutes remaining, and Modano delivered. The combination
clicked as Hull rocketed his patented, screaming one-timer just
between the inside post and goalie Chris Osgood for the game-winner
in a 3-2 victory that almost every Stars player called their best
game this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was huge,'' said goalie Ed Belfour, who bounced back after
giving up two goals in the first nine minutes. ``It's going to help
our team to gel.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull was in the middle of it all. The free-agent winger acquired
in the off-season for $17 million over three seasons for the
express purpose of beating the Red Wings, owner Tom Hicks said,
paid off in spades. He had two goals, fired eight shots and made
the Red Wings think twice all night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having him out there opens things up for everyone,'' Modano
said. ``He's got a great shot.''
</P>
<P>
   It was pretty much a perfect Halloween for the 6-1-2 Stars, who
were the victim of a trick Friday night before when they yielded
two goals in the final minute of a 3-3 tie with the Mighty Ducks of
Anaheim. As a treat for Stars fans, many of whom dressed in
costumes, Hull came out of his goal-scoring slump (he has three
this season), the Stars boosted their flagging confidence, and they
gave their top rival something to think about.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, who were defeated last season by the Red Wings in the
Western Conference Finals and who this season are considered the
leading challenger as the Wings attempt to win a third consecutive
Stanley Cup, met the challenge in a way they didn't in the
playoffs. In fact, by game's end, the teams had pretty much
reversed roles as the 6-4 Red Wings were grousing about officiating
and an embattled Osgood was explaining a late game blowup in which
he and Stars winger Pat Verbeek engaged in a wrestling match.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Stars were adjusting to the erratic officiating,
and Belfour _ the man expected to explode _ was playing the role of
the quiet goalie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just such a character-builder for us,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``Especially after getting down 2-0.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings scored a minute and 12 seconds into the game on a
Kirk Maltby knucklepuck, and the game looked eerily like last
season's playoff as the Wings got early leads and key performances
from role players. A sold-out Reunion Arena grew quieter when the
Wings took a 2-0 lead on a Steve Yzerman power-play goal.
</P>
<P>
   But when it looked as if the Stars would continue to be
befuddled by the Wings, Hull stepped up. He and Jere Lehtinen
outworked Detroit's Nicklas Lidstrom for the puck and Lehtinen
skated to the high slot, firing a shot that Hull tipped in at 18:32
of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Modano fed Lehtinen for a short-handed goal 22 seconds into the
second period, and the Stars were even at 2-2. By the end of the
game, the Stars had outshot the Red Wings, 33-24, outhit them
31-15, and proved that they can win without their power play, which
was 0-for-8.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hull's goal was the laser that ignited the building,
the Stars had already proved something when the score was tied.
With a strong team effort and outstanding performances by Modano,
Lehtinen, Guy Carbonneau, Richard Matvichuk (five hits, five
blocked shots) and Sergei Zubov, the Stars proved that they might
have cleared one more mental hurdle on the path to knocking off the
Red Wings as Stanley Cup champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit's offense was way above us in the playoff last year.
We don't like to admit that, but they were,'' Hicks said. ``Now
with \RJoe\S Nieuwendyk back, and Hull, I think we're at even
strength with them. I think we've always had a better defense and I
think Eddie is a better goalie than theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should compare ourselves to them, and that's the only
person we should compare ourselves to,'' Hicks said. ``There's a
period of time when you have to pay your dues to win, and we've
paid our dues. This is our year to win.''

UCLA SURVIVES SCARE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ For now, the UCLA Bruins are No.1 with a bullet-proof
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   But come Monday, will they be all right? Come Monday, they'll be
holding on tight _ and wondering if the Bowl Championship Series
rankings reward (or punish) fourth-quarter escapes against
last-place teams?
</P>
<P>
   ``Close, close, close _ too close,'' UCLA senior safety Larry
Atkins said. ``(Stanford) gave us their best effort, and it was far
from our best effort. I don't know if we took them lightly in the
beginning, but their intensity was higher than ours. It took them
getting the lead to wake us up.''
</P>
<P>
   Five days after becoming No.1 in the only poll that matters _
and almost 10 years to the day No.1 UCLA lost to Washington State _
the Bruins dodged an upset for the ages and remained unbeaten with
a 28-24 victory before 64,820 in the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to survive Oregon; at the time, the Ducks were
one of the top teams in the Pac-10. Even the edgy victory over Cal
last week seemed impressive, considering the Bears' fabulous
defense and UCLA's depleted roster.
</P>
<P>
   But Stanford? One-win Stanford? A four-touchdown underdog, the
Cardinal had the Pac-10's worst defense and only one chance to
compete Saturday afternoon: if the Bruins (7-0, 5-0) made mistakes.
And sure as a Stanford third-down pass, they committed 12 penalties
for 125 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's ridiculous,'' UCLA guard Andy Meyers said. ``We're not
the Raiders.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the timing and type of mistakes, not the quantity, that
nearly cost them: personal fouls, holdings, pass interferences,
even a roughing-the-passer penalty. They were big, bad,
drive-killing mistakes, including a holding penalty on guard Jim
Ghezzi that erased a first-quarter touchdown pass to Danny Farmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a long time for us to realize Stanford was probably a
better club than we gave them credit for,'' said UCLA quarterback
Cade McNown, who threw two interceptions in a four-play sequence in
the first half. ``I wish we had played better. In the last couple
weeks, we've escaped. We didn't dominate, we've escaped.''
</P>
<P>
   They needed help from several unlikely sources to extended their
winning streak to 17 games. Tailback DeShaun Foster, recovering
from a sprained knee, was supposed to play in an emergency
situation only. Guess what? With starting tailback Jermaine Lewis
unavailable (bruised lower leg) and Keith Brown fatigued, Foster
got the call. He gained 51 yards and scored the winning touchdown,
an 8-yard run with eight minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve cornerback Marques Anderson, whose availability was in
question because of a sprained toe, made the game's biggest play,
knocking the ball from Stanford receiver Jeff Allen at the 1-yard
line with four minutes left. Atkins pounced in the end zone, giving
UCLA possession and preventing a go-ahead touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came with the rake (a ball-stripping technique) to try to
make him fumble,'' Anderson said. ``The defense needed to make a
big play.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. For much of the game, Stanford quarterback Todd Husak
shredded the Bruins like an Iran-Contra document. He completed 25
of 45 passes for 419 yards and teamed with receiver Troy Walters
(10 catches) to keep numerous drives alive. Taking advantage of
UCLA's blitzes with short patterns, the Cardinal converted 11 of 18
third-down opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We truly expected to win,'' Walters said. ``We thought they
might be taking us lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins squashed any suggestions that they had overlooked the
Cardinal, but it was clear from the outset that events would not
unfold as expected.
</P>
<P>
   The teams exchanged touchdowns in the first half, with UCLA
needing a 53-yard touchdown pass from McNown to Brian Poli-Dixon to
tie the score 14-14 entering halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal bolted to a 24-14 lead in the third quarter,
blocking Chris Sailer's 50-yard field goal attempt and scooting 39
yards in five plays. For the first time since its winning streak
began almost 14 months ago, UCLA faced a double-digit deficit in
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would go overtime,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo
said. ``I thought we'd score and get a field goal. I was planning
for overtime.''
</P>
<P>
   But McNown had other plans. He bulled 3 yards on a third-and-1
to keep one touchdown drive alive, then hit Danny Farmer on
third-and-8 to preserve the game-winning charge.

DREAM BLUE PRINT REBUILDS D-BACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - I dozed off while at the computer and dreamed I was
the Diamondbacks' general manager.
</P>
<P>
   It was every baseball fan's fantasy come true. There were free
agents to sign, trades to be made and making it all come together
was the reality that this is a club with financial clout, not one
of those small-market clubs that has to squeeze for every cent.
</P>
<P>
   There were calls to be received, mostly from agents wanting to
peddle their players, and those to be made, for the players I
wanted. And tampering rumors to deny. Here's the Cliff's Notes
version of the dream:
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks were definitely a flawed club during their
inaugural season in 1998. The reality of it all: There was
absolutely no shame in the club having cracks in its foundation.
The expansion draft yielded only so much.
</P>
<P>
   But with a full big-league season now in the books, it's time to
look toward the second year and realize the National League West
will probably not be the strongest division in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road, this could be a monster division, but for next
year, the separation between the best and worst won't be as large
as it was last season, when San Diego was the class of the division
while the Diamondbacks were its pond scum.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to prioritize the Diamondbacks problems, and no
weakness was more glaring than middle relief. Getting the game from
the sixth inning to the ninth, where closer Gregg Olson proved to
be a major coup, was among the most conspicuous problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks went through middle relievers all season,
trying to find the right combination. At first, Clint Sodowsky and
Russ Springer manned the seventh and eighth innings.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was Amaury Telemaco and Omar Daal, who each eventually
wound up in the rotation. Then it was Willie Banks and Aaron Small.
Also thrown into the mix were Alan Embree, Felix Rodriguez, Scott
Brow, Barry Manuel _ and who could ever forget Efrain Valdez and
Ricky Pickett?
</P>
<P>
   Quality middle relievers are a must. This is really where the
haves separate themselves from the have-nots. Getting safely from
Andy Benes, Daal and Brian Anderson to Olson on a consistent basis
could, all by itself, translate into another 12 or so victories.
</P>
<P>
   The other glaring area of concern was the bench. When a club
like San Diego is bringing John Vander Wal, Greg Myers and Ruben
Rivera off its bench and you're calling on Brent Brede, Hensley
Muelens and Karim Garcia to win a game, well . . . the chances of
winning with a big hit late are not very good.
</P>
<P>
   While we're talking about serious necessities, how about
acquiring a speedy leadoff hitter, one who might be able to play
center field at the same time? San Francisco might be willing to
part with Dante Powell, a former Phoenix Firebird whose minor
league numbers indicate he could blossom into a Doug Glanville-type
of player but with more power.
</P>
<P>
   If a deal cannot be worked out, Devon White is always in the
neighborhood and probably willing to play at home for a little less
than elsewhere. If, however, he wants a three-year deal (which is
rumored to be what he is seeking) then biting the bullet in center
for another year while someone develops is probably the best
option.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of speed last season was evident on many fronts.
Manager Buck Showalter couldn't signal a steal or bunt nearly as
often as he would have liked. It's not as if the club needs to add
two or three speed burners. One key guy at the top of the order
would be enough to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   The top three pitchers in the rotation _ Benes, Anderson and
Daal _ were very good and reliable, even against the top clubs in
the league. Adding one more to the mix, say Randy Johnson, would be
enough to push this rotation into the upper half.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson won't come cheap, but his desire to remain in the Valley
throughout the year could make it a marriage made in heaven. At the
very least, Johnson could wind up with the Diamondbacks for less
than he could make elsewhere. If, that is, he truly wants to stay
near home. That could be the one big-money move worth making this
winter because everything revolves around pitching.
</P>
<P>
   The middle infield questions must be squared away before opening
day next year. Jay Bell's move to second should be solidified,
while the Danny Klassen/Tony Batista battle at shortstop needs to
be rectified. Klassen seems the answer on a long-term basis, but
it's difficult to overlook Batista's 18 home runs in just half a
season.
</P>
<P>
   With so much money tied up on Matt Williams, there is no
alternative other than hoping he returns to his All-Star form. The
guess here says Williams will hit about 35 home runs and drive in
110 runs, exactly what you'd expect from Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The club needs a bopper in the middle of the lineup, one that
would help flesh out the batting order and allow Williams to bat
fifth or sixth while letting Travis Lee become the No. 3 hitter he
appears to be.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Bernard Gilkey, a more likely No. 2 hitter, is not
really the answer to finding a legitimate cleanup hitter. With
right field open and some extra cash to spend, finding the right
free agent here could help solve the dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle would be perfect except, like Gilkey, he can really
play only left field. Karim Garcia had a shot and didn't look up to
being the everyday guy in right. Yamil Benitez has pop in his bat,
but his defense needs a serious transformation.
</P>
<P>
   The two-headed catching tandem of Kelly Stinnett and Damian
Miller is fine for now but will need to be upgraded at some time.
Living with these two is more than acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Since there's all this money, why not tie up super utility
player Andy Fox, who will be eligible for arbitration after next
season, now to a two- or three-year contract that, in the end, will
save money?
</P>
<P>
   There it is. My master plan to build the Diamondbacks into a
contender. It's not perfect . . . but so few clubs in the majors
are these days. &QL;

SMALLER HEAD DRAWN ON NEW DREW PICTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Of all the sports fans in all the towns in all the
world, J.D. Drew picked the most emotional, the most vitriolic, the
most unforgiving to tick off.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps embattled Eagles Coach Ray Rhodes heads the list of
those being sliced, diced and grilled like a cheese steak by
frustrated Philadelphians, but Drew is right there.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Drew isn't right there. Not in Philly. Where he is
for now is right here, playing the outfield for the Peoria
Javelinas of the Arizona Fall League.
</P>
<P>
   His jersey reads ``Cardinals,'' as in St. Louis Cardinals, the
team that drafted him in June. The Phillies did the same thing the
year before, with one key difference. They couldn't sign Drew. The
Cardinals could, and did, and are quite happy about it, especially
after Drew hit .417 with five homers during a brief September
call-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players like him don't come along in a long time,'' Mike
Jorgensen, the St. Louis director of player development, said the
other day while watching Drew at the Peoria Sports Complex. ``And
I'm sure glad we were able to get him.''
</P>
<P>
   All it took was a shade under $7 million over four years, with
incentives that could bump the total to $9 million.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the $10 million the Diamondbacks gave Travis Lee, but
the sum is significant. This is what Cardinals outfielder Brian
Jordan said the day Drew signed: ``Outrageous. Wow. Amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Others used more colorful language. During the holdout, one
writer said Drew had a ``swelled head,'' was a victim of agent
Scott Boras' ``brainwashing process,'' called him a ``pious
poseur'' (translation: basically a phony) and a ``moral coward''
and referred to him as the ``Hahira Hick,'' Hahira, Ga., being his
hometown.
</P>
<P>
   And this was just in the first four paragraphs.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's top collegiate player at Florida State in 1997,
Drew announced through Boras that it would take an unprecedented
$11 million to sign him. The Phillies took Drew anyway, No. 2
overall. As Drew proved he wasn't kidding, opting instead to play
for St. Paul (Minn.) in the independent Northern League, the
outrage sparked, kindled and became a firestorm. &QL; 
Notorious tag team &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies couldn't (or wouldn't) come close to what Boras and
Drew wanted, and Drew went back in the draft. The Cardinals picked
him fifth overall and signed him a month later, even though fans,
media, prospective Phillies teammates and eventually, most of
baseball had targeted Drew and Boras as the most notorious tag team
this side of Buff Bagwell and Scotty Steiner.
</P>
<P>
   Quoth Phillies pitcher Curt Schilling during spring training,
1998: ``If I'm a major league baseball team, I've got to question
this kid's desire to play at this point. It can't be principle,
because he knows he's going to get more than any player who's ever
gone through the draft. So he needs to stop listening to his agent
and make up his own mind. He's supposed to be a grown man, isn't
he?''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch. Not quite 23, a rock-solid 6-foot-1, 195 pounds, Drew is
indeed a man, although he certainly has more growing to do. Drew
disagrees with Schilling. It always was about principle, he said.
His demands were made known from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philadelphia knew where I stood before the draft,'' Drew said.
``I was very up-front and honest. If I hadn't been so honest with
them, it probably would have gotten to me a little bit. But I knew
where I stood.
</P>
<P>
   ``People drew their own conclusions and had their own opinions,
but it was just one of those things I had to endure. I knew what my
principles were.'' &QL; 
`Laid-back guy' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drew speaks in a soft Georgia accent, mostly avoiding eye
contact. He has been through this before, countless times, in St.
Paul, Double-A Arkansas, Triple-A Memphis, St. Louis and all the
road stops in between. His expression ranges from bored to
disinterested. Clearly, he would rather be somewhere else. A
baseball field would do.
</P>
<P>
   Part of it is who he is, a self-described ``pretty laid-back
guy.'' Peoria Manager Dan Rohn said, ``Being the quiet, southern
Georgia boy that he is, he doesn't say a whole lot.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Rohn added, ``I know some of that stuff does bother him.
Down deep, you can see it. Hopefully, he'll learn how to let it
wash off his back.''
</P>
<P>
   Rohn spent six years in the minors before getting his shot with
the Chicago Cubs. In all, he played a total of 54 games with the
Cubs and Cleveland Indians during the 1980s. Since then, he has
coached and managed at virtually every level except the big
leagues. He has devoted his life to the game, probably given more
than he's gotten back, and felt pretty much like everyone else
about Drew at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear about all the stuff,'' Rohn said, ``all the
background and the contract and this and that, and you think, `What
kind of kid is this? I've been in this game 22 years I haven't made
eight million dollars in my career, and he's got eight million
right now. Is he gonna be an (expletive)?
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's a down-to-earth, great guy. He really is. A good kid.
He just wants to play the game. That's the bottom line. He just
wants to play the game.'' &QL; 
Not a monster &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Drew has been well-received by teammates. Shane
Monahan, who expects to be part of Seattle's annual left-field
sweepstakes next spring, calls Drew ``a great guy,'' not anything
like he was portrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what, exactly?
</P>
<P>
   ``A greedy monster,'' Monahan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone made him out like all he was was about
money,'' Monahan said. ``And he's not that way at all. To me, he's
one of the most humble guys I've ever met. He just comes out and
plays hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Monahan attended Clemson and recalls playing against Florida
State during Drew's sophomore year, before he blossomed. But,
Monahan said, ``You could sense there was something there.''
</P>
<P>
   In high school, Drew was picked in the 20th round by San
Francisco. He always wanted to go to Florida State, but the best
Seminoles Coach Mike Martin could come up with was a partial
scholarship. Drew took it, even though the Giants kept increasing
their offer. Drew kept improving until he became a dominant
all-around player as a junior, hitting .455 with 31 homers and 100
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best hitter I've ever had,'' said Martin, who has
coached the Seminoles for 20 years. ``And I've never had a better
person.'' &QL; 
Great scenario &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drew tore up the Northern League in 1997 and again in 1998, and
did the same thing in Double-A, Triple-A, and for that matter, the
National League. He caught an immense break by joining the
Cardinals in September, at the height of McGwire Mania. Any other
time, any other place, he would have been the stellar attraction,
under intense pressure and scrutiny. He wasn't exactly ignored, but
his debut was only a sideshow.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't have asked for a better scenario,'' Jorgensen
said.
</P>
<P>
   And Drew made the most of it. (P.S. One of those who had been
critical of Drew before he showed up was Mark McGwire.)
</P>
<P>
   Drew is off to a modest start in the Fall League, but the
ability he has shown and what lies ahead have observers scrambling
for superlatives. Jorgensen said Drew demonstrated all five tools _
hitting, hitting with power, running, throwing, defense _ the first
time he saw him in Double-A. By the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The ill will seems to be subsiding. Drew, accepted by his
teammates, likely will start next season in the Cardinals'
outfield. There was talk that once Drew signed, he would be a
pitcher's target. But it hasn't happened, ``and it's not gonna
happen,'' Jorgensen said.
</P>
<P>
   With one caveat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may still have a tough time,'' Jorgensen said, ``when he
goes to Philadelphia.'' &QL;

KEEPING WOLF FROM NBA DOOR

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - NBA players, whose middle class earned $2.6 million
last year, are unified in their stand against economic oppression.
</P>
<P>
   But how about their spouses?
</P>
<P>
   We don't see them on television, locked arm in arm, singing,
```We'' ``shall overcome.'' . . .''
</P>
<P>
   November games are canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas is coming.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue, the most important question players may be
asking themselves, or soon will, is how many paychecks their
``wives'' are willing to miss.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA workforce already has lost $200 million in salaries.
</P>
<P>
   It's my belief that pro basketball's labor strife won't be
settled by the commissioner or the owners or the union, but rather
by the players' spouses or significant others.
</P>
<P>
   A friend may have described many marriages when he said of his
own, ``I make all the big decisions. My wife makes the little ones.
And she decides which ones are which.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point, as the bills stack up, Mrs. So and So is going to
slap her husband's size 15EEEs off the coffee table as he sits on
the couch, unshaven, sipping a cold one and watching the debating
skills of a love triangle on the ``Jerry Springer Show.'' Hands on
hips, she will ask the family's primary breadwinner, ``Sweetheart,
when exactly ``do'' you think you'll go back to work?'' or words to
that effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon,'' the player says, belching.
</P>
<P>
   ````How'' soon!?''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing wrong with athletes wanting everything they can
get. We all want more. NBA players are determined not to allow
greedy owners to railroad them into what they believe is a bad
deal.
</P>
<P>
   But this could last awhile. The lockout is essentially funded by
NBC and Turner Broadcasting, which are paying the league $2.65
``billion'' in a 4-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 15, most players will receive $25,000 each for their
share of the licensing fee for NBA merchandise. Many American
families live for a year on less. But these guys don't shop at
Price Club.
</P>
<P>
   The smart ones have invested wisely. Charles Barkley, for one,
isn't going to run out of money during his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   I once accompanied Charles on a shopping trip in downtown
Seattle. Barkley spotted a watch gleaming in a jewelry store
window. A Rolex Daytona Chronograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much?'' Barkley inquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighteen,'' the salesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighteen what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighteen thousand.''
</P>
<P>
   Eyes big as door knobs, Barkley gasped and took a shambling step
backward. ``EIGHTEEN THOUSAND! OH, MY GOD!'' Around the store,
heads turned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles,'' the salesman reminded, in a calming cultured voice,
``this isn't ``any'' watch. It's a special timepiece.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No (expletive),'' Barkley said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   The Chuckster slipped the handsome watch on his wrist.
``Eigh-teen thou-sand,'' he murmured, stretching out the words.
Charles cocked his shaved head and did some mental arithmetic. ``Do
you realize,'' he said, grinning ear to ear, ``I'd have to play two
quarters to make enough to buy that watch?''
</P>
<P>
   True. Barkley made $3 million that year with the Suns, or
$36,000 a game.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck settled for a $9,000 Cartier.

`SASSY' BASS FOUND IN LAKE PLEASANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - This year was not a banner one for fishing at Lake
Pleasant, although things are picking up nicely now, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Anglers have wondered what's wrong. The easy fishing for bass _
many big ones _ had spoiled them. When a new Waddell Dam was
completed and the lake filled to a higher level, nutrients
abounded. Fish grew in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly this year, all that tailed off. Sure, bass could be
caught and big ones, but the average angler had a lot more trouble
catching a bass.
</P>
<P>
   Well, apparently nothing is wrong with the fish.
</P>
<P>
   During the week of Oct. 19, Arizona Game and Fish Department
biologists completed electrofishing and gill netting operations at
the lake. Results were obtained last week.
</P>
<P>
   Largemouth bass were by far the most numerous species taken in
the samples. In fact more than 620 bass were sampled.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, Jim Warnecke, the regional fisheries manager,
wrote that samples ``bode well for the fishery.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest bass populations were represented in four age groups
_ 6-, 10-, 13- and 15{-inch categories. Most were in the 10- and
15{-inch groupings, weighing one-half and 2 pounds, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Warnecke reported that the bass were ``fat and sassy'' with
plenty of internal fat for the approaching winter.
</P>
<P>
   Since the electrofishing part of the sample is effective only in
shallow water, the biologists were rather surprised when they
picked a 11{-pound largemouth in the Agua Fria arm of the lake. It
is one of the biggest ever electroshocked in Arizona. The huge fish
was measured and weighed, then released.
</P>
<P>
   The second largest sampling taken was 315 white bass. The
largest year class weighed about 2\ pounds. Those are big white
bass. The largest weighed more than 3{ pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant is the only lake in Arizona with abundant populations
of white bass.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 55 channel catfish were taken with an average weight
of 2} pounds. The largest was a 12{-pound cat found in Humbug Cove.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared the cats were feeding both in daylight and night
hours since field crews were catching 4-pounders on hook and line
during off-hours.
</P>
<P>
   Although crappie fishing hasn't been good the past two years,
biologists collected 19 black and five white crappie.
Traditionally, black crappie are the most numerous in Pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   The largest black crappie weighed more than 2 pounds, but the
average was 1{ pounds. A 1-pound white crappie was collected in the
Agua Fria arm.
</P>
<P>
   The biologists also collected some three-inch crappie, which
probably represented fish produced this year.
</P>
<P>
   Anglers have reported catching striped bass in Pleasant for the
past four years, but this is the first time any were picked up in a
survey. Stripers most likely enter the lake from the CAP canal.
</P>
<P>
   The five specimens collected averaged 2{ pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Warnecke wrote that striper reproduction in Pleasant seems
unlikely since so few fish were collected. Stripers are especially
susceptible to gill-netting. A lack of different sizes also
indicates a low population.
</P>
<P>
   The main forage fish in desert lakes _ the threadfin shad _ was
collected in large numbers. Four- to six-inch shad were taken,
which is quite large for threadfins.
</P>
<P>
   Four- to six-inch golden shiners, an illegal baitfish, also were
taken. These fish compete with young game fish for food and habitat
and aren't legal for use in the desert lakes. &QL;

TRADE SUGGESTS BRIERE IS READY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If  &UR; Daniel Briere is as good as advertised, and the rookie
center can live up to all of the hype as perhaps the Coyotes' best
natural playmaker, then Saturday's trade of  &UR; Cliff Ronning to the
expansion Nashville Predators was the right move.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, they think the 5-foot-9 Briere can step right in and
fill Ronning's skates on the No. 2 line or they wouldn't have
swapped the veteran along with minor league defenseman  &UR; Richard
Litner for a conditional draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   During the past few weeks, however, Coach  &UR; Jim Schoenfeld and
General Manager  &UR; Bobby Smith each suggested Briere might not be
ready to assume such a role. At least not right away. Maybe not
even this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what his role will be,'' Smith said after Briere
was recalled from Las Vegas last weekend. ``He could be thrown into
a pretty prime role, it's quite possible he could play in the
minors, or he could end up being more of a specialist for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Smith was either blowing smoke or he honestly had no
idea where and how to use the former dynamo of the Quebec Major
Junior Hockey League, who averaged 57 goals and 139 points during
his final three seasons in juniors. Perhaps he was vague out of
courtesy to Ronning, and because he already had been working on a
deal with Nashville GM  &UR; David Poile.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld, for his part, squelched speculation during the
preseason about Briere possibly being a suitable center for left
wing  &UR; Keith
 &UR; Tkachuk on the team's No. 1 line.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon, we're not going to throw Danny into the fire like
that,'' Schoenfeld said. ``No way. He's not ready for that kind of
pressure yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't there just as much pressure centering the other top line,
which he now figures to do with Ronning's departure? Of course
there is. Briere can probably handle it, too. He's that good.
Scouts have compared him to a smaller version
 &UR; of Wayne Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   That's saying something. So is the fact that, with Ronning, the
Coyotes had three centers who barely could see over a steering
wheel. Briere, Ronning and  &UR; Mike Stapleton are all 5-10 or shorter,
and that's awfully thin down the middle for any club this side of
pee-wee hockey. Especially in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Schoenfeld and Smith both say size wasn't an influence in
trading Ronning. In fact, they said the same thing during training
camp when asked if one of the smallish centers needed to be dealt
for that very reason. But it had to be a factor, every bit as valid
as the fact he was set to become an unrestricted free agent next
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Ronning, tied for the team lead in scoring with seven points,
insists he plans to make the most out of his new start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at the positives,'' he said. ``It's a great
opportunity to play on a team that thinks team first. I've heard
real good things about the way things are there and I hear it's a
great atmosphere.'' &QL; 
Scoring down, again &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You probably noticed some of the crazy scores around the league
last week. Detroit 7, Florida 2. Boston 9, Montreal 2. Edmonton 8,
Washington 2. And that was all on the same night.
</P>
<P>
   But even with those unusually high-scoring games, scoring
actually has dipped in the NHL to 4.8 goals a game from 5.3 last
season, when it was the lowest in modern history and prompted all
the off-season rule changes.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto defenseman  &UR; Sylvain Cote says bigger nets are the
answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Build 'em four inches wider and three inches taller,'' said
Cote, a 15-year veteran. ``I think (low scoring) is the natural
progression of the game. The guys are bigger, faster and stronger,
which means there is less room on the ice. At the same time, the
position where we've seen the greatest improvement the past 15
years is goaltending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen years ago, goalies weren't as big as they are now. But
the nets have stayed the same size.''
</P>
<P>
   Bigger nets sounds like a good idea, until you consider how many
records, both by scorers and goalies, would become either obsolete
or never threatened again. &QL; 
Dirty laundry &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a wild and wacky two weeks for goalie  &UR; Manny Legace. He
was with the Long Beach Ice Dogs of the International Hockey
League, starting a road trip in Winnipeg, when the Los Angeles
Kings called and said they needed him after both of their goalies,
 &UR; Stephane Fiset and  &UR; Jammie Storr, suffered groin injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Legace wound up spending nine straight days on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran out of clothes five days ago,'' he said before finally
returning home. ``I tried to wash my underwear in the sink. I've
got two golf shirts and one dress shirt. The dress shirt has got to
get a vaccination when we get back home. It's pretty raunchy. It's
got to have some kind of disease growing on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Legace also wore the same black sports jacket during the entire
trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can probably stand up on its own and walk home,'' he
joked. &QL; 
Tony's on a tear &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With six goals in his first eight games, Chicago's  &UR; Tony Amonte
was on a pace for a 50-goal season, something no Blackhawk has been
able to manage since  &UR; Jeremy Roenick scored 53 in 1991-92.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they come fast and hard, and other times it's tough
to score,'' said Amonte, who had 31 goals last season after scoring
a career-high 41 two years ago. ``But when the sun is shining, I
don't question it.''
</P>
<P>
   Only four players hit the 50-goal mark last season: Washington's
 &UR; Peter Bondra, Anaheim's  &UR; Teemu Selanne, Philadelphia's  &UR; John
LeClair and Vancouver's  &UR; Pavel Bure. &QL; 
The Grim Reaper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that was  &UR; Stu Grimson who pumped in two goals during a span
of 2:43 last week against Tampa Bay. Not bad for a guy who scores
an average of once every 56.7 games. The pair of goals puts Grimson
just one away from tying his career high _ three.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a guy like me, it doesn't flow that smoothly very often,''
Grimson said. ``Do I have a scoring clause in my contract? I've got
to call my agent. I don't think so.'' &QL; 
The Kings and I &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Robbie Ftorek, the new head coach of the New Jersey Devils,
faced the team he used to coach 10 years ago for the first time
last week. The Los Angeles Kings greeted him with a 4-0 rout.
</P>
<P>
   Many still question why the Kings fired him in the first place.
Ftorek guided Los Angeles to a respectable 42-31-7 record and got
the Kings into the second round of the playoffs the year he was
canned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wasn't the coach for that team,'' Ftorek said. ``I went
in to coach a young team. All of a sudden, it was an older team.''

RONNING TRADE OPENS ICE FOR YOUNGSTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -The trade of second-line center  &UR; Cliff
Ronning to Nashville on Saturday opened the door to more ice time
for rookie
 &UR; Daniel Briere and second-year center  &UR; Juha Ylonen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have mixed emotions,'' said Briere, 21, who is expected by
many to become an NHL star. ``Cliff is a great player and a good
guy to have in the locker room, too. It's sad to see him leave. He
was good to me, helping me a lot before and during games by going
over defensemen and showing me what teams were doing right and
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was helping me be a better hockey player. But at the same
time, this is a chance for me to get more ice time. That's the way
this business goes. It's bad, but it's not bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Ylonen concurred, saying, ``You hate to lose a teammate like
this, but hopefully, it will mean more ice time for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes Coach  &UR; Jim Schoenfeld said whoever receives the lion's
share of ice time will have to earn it. Neither player will receive
a free pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really excited about having a chance to play next to  &UR; Rick
 &UR; Tocchet and  &UR; Greg Adams,'' Briere said. ``I've watched those guys
play since I was a young kid, and now I have a chance to play next
to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I haven't played much, I've been trying to learn
on the bench. During games I've been asking guys like Adams,
Tocchet and
 &UR; Keith Tkachuk where they like to play on the ice, where they like
to handle the puck and where they want to shoot it from.''
</P>
<P>
   Few have doubted Briere's skills. But they do doubt his size (5
feet 9, 185 pounds) and whether he can withstand the rigors of an
NHL season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been that way at every level I've played,'' he said.
``This is the last step _ a major step for me. I've done it before,
and it doesn't scare me.'' &QL; 
Call me Duncan &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Talk about you're human yo-yos. Coyotes defenseman  &UR; Bryan Helmer
has been reassigned to Las Vegas of the IHL twice this season, only
to be recalled before he left town.
</P>
<P>
   The latest example came this weekend when he was en route to the
airport Friday but was recalled when it was learned that forward
 &UR; Mike
 &UR; Stapleton has the flu and won't be available today.
</P>
<P>
   The team also recalled winger Louie DeBrusk from Las Vegas to
fill the roster spot opened by Ronning's trade. &QL;

ASU MEN MUST PAY TO PLAY SOCCER  
 CLUB HAS DRIVE, BUT NOT DOLLARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Their field was taken away. The women's field is
off-limits. They search the Arizona State campus for a patch of
grass.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the men's club soccer players gather on the band
field off Rural Road that also is used for lacrosse, rugby and
Ultimate Frisbee games.
</P>
<P>
   The field is narrow, and the lines for the various sports
criss-cross, symbolic of the campus clubs marking territory in a
battle for intercollegiate status.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK,'' said Carlos Corzo, the school's soccer club
president and a player. ``At least we've got something.''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't exactly what Corzo had in mind in 1992 when he left
Glendale Deer Valley High, looking for big-time college soccer near
home.
</P>
<P>
   There are no Division I men's soccer programs in Arizona. There
are, however, clubs at the major universities, filled with guys
still trying to live out soccer dreams, most of whom would be
walk-ons at Division I programs.
</P>
<P>
   They're far removed from the rest of the school's athletic
programs. They have no trainers. They wrap their own ankles.
They're about as visible on campus as the hiking club.
</P>
<P>
   Before a recent practice, Corzo went around to a half-dozen
players and passed out paperwork that showed how much money they
owed. It was a solemn lot. It's hard enough trying to make it
through college on shoestring budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Players, many of whom come from other states, need to come up
with money to make trips to California or New Mexico to play games
against other university club teams who experience similar
hardships and feelings of not being wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to UA once, and we didn't have enough players, so one
of our coaches had to play,'' said Sandy MacDonald, head coach of
the ASU club team. ``He is a graduate from here and close to these
players' age.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzo and MacDonald had no trouble getting players to try out.
More than 100 players showed up. The hard part was keeping them.
</P>
<P>
   After they found out they each had to come up with $125 for
membership, not to mention money for air travel, car rentals and
hotel accommodations, and how they could raise a few bucks by
passing out entertainment guides and coupon booklets around the
Memorial Union, they were gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these guys came from Division I programs,'' Corzo
said. ``They're used to having everything covered for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys want to play, and here I am asking them to pass out
books in front of the MU so they can pay $20 less. It's hard for
some of them to swallow their pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Archeletta and Dave Cameron, who play professionally for
the Arizona Thunder indoor team, are finishing work toward degrees
at ASU. They occasionally play for the club team and dominate
games. Cameron came once, scored three goals and left.
</P>
<P>
   The ASU Recreation Center gave $350 for league fees, and the
team has received financial assistance from several companies in
Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's hardly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Corzo said he tried to get a sponsorship from Nike.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked how many people go to our games,'' Corzo said. ``I
couldn't lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Players' girlfriends usually make up the crowd. Nike said no.
</P>
<P>
   Corzo said that Kinko's gave him 500 ASU men's club soccer
schedule cards to distribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still couldn't get anyone out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once, during a game against Thunderbird International, Corzo
said the lights kept shutting off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to call maintenance, and I couldn't get through, so we
just left,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More frustrating was the team losing its soccer field in
September, Corzo said. He said it was turned into a turf practice
field for the football team. The power lines to the lights were
cut.
</P>
<P>
   He voiced his frustrations with ASU associate senior athletic
director Herman Frazier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, in the long run, we'll be able to allow them some
access and use of the facility a couple of times a year,'' Frazier
said. ``Because of the infancy stages of the women's playing
surface, no outside competition can be on there yet. We lost some
grass. As soon as that matures, it would be good to help them with
a tournament and give them access.''
</P>
<P>
   The club season winds down in November with regionals in
Prescott and nationals in Phoenix. That should save on the trips
and give Corzo a full team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's embarrassing to have so much local talent and it's hard
to get people out there,'' he said. ``There's no recognition to it.
They love the sport, but they're used to the glamour.'' &QL;

WEARY A'S PROSPECT THROWS IN TOWEL FOR FALL 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX -  &UR; Eric Chavez had some personal problems that needed
tending, which is one reason he suddenly bolted from the Peoria
Javelinas last week. But the likely starter at third base for the
Oakland Athletics next season also suffered from a malady common to
other Fall Leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he was just burned out,'' said  &UR; Keith Lieppman, A's
director of player development.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a long year, and he didn't feel like he could give 100
percent to play in this league. Obviously, we were disappointed
with that decision. But he's a 20-year-old kid. I certainly
understand. But we, as an organization, don't condone what he
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, who returned home to San Diego, played in 135 games in
the minors last season. He hit .328 for Double-A Huntsville, .325
for Triple-A Edmonton, and was named ``Baseball America's'' minor
league Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Then in September, Chavez was called up to the big club. Playing
in another 16 games, he hit .311. But that taste of major league
life made the switch to the Fall League even tougher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reaches a point where maybe it (the Fall League) is
anti-climactic,'' Lieppman said.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in the majors ``has an effect on you, subconsciously or
in reality. . . . I told him, `This is a long grind, it's a fight.'
But when reality comes to you, it slaps you in the face a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Chavez's Peoria teammates, outfielder  &UR; Shane Monahan,
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a hard time myself right now,'' he said. ``I can
understand Chavez leaving. I'm going on my 10th month playing
baseball, and I'm mentally and physically tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Monahan spent even more time than Chavez in the majors, three
months with the Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a letdown in competition,'' he said. ``We've got
great arms and great players. But when you're used every night to
eating sirloin steak and you come down and you're eating hamburger,
it's not the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no fans here, no nothing. If we had 6,000 people in
the stands, maybe it would be easier to get up. But when you get 28
people a game, it's kind of tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Monahan exaggerates. Fall League crowds number well into the
hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a letdown,'' he said. ``For guys who have played in
big-league camps and played in September, it's hard. It wears on
your body a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Chavez, who figures to start for the A's, Monahan,
competing for the Mariners' starting left-fielder spot, plans to
stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to,'' he said. ``I'm not secure right now with the
left-field job in Seattle. Chavez has a great situation in Oakland
at third base.'' &QL; 
Short hops &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sun Cities pitcher  &UR; Jeremy Powell (Montreal) had an interesting
outing against Peoria this week. Powell struck out St. Louis
Cardinals flash  &UR; J.D. Drew twice, once swinging, once looking, but
gave up a two-run homer to  &UR; Tarrick Brock and fell to 0-4 in a 6-3
loss to the Javalinas.
</P>
<P>
   He is only 23, but Maryvale outfielder  &UR; Roosevelt
 &UR; Brown, who is leading the league in homers and RBIs, is
well-traveled. The Chicago Cubs are his third major league team. He
was drafted by Atlanta in 1993, traded to Florida in the  &UR; Terry
Pendleton deal in 1996 and was picked by the Cubs in the Rule 5
minor league draft last December. He already has played six pro
seasons. &QL;

BRUINS AWOKE IN TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ After UCLA cleared its throat of Stanford in time to
record a 28-24 win Saturday at the Rose Bowl, Travor Turner took a
deep breath and leaned forward into the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to give thanks to the Lord,'' Turner said. ``The
Lord waited until the right time, but the Lord is blessing this
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA decided to take a siesta on Saturday and it nearly ruined
their plans for a Fiesta. Maybe somebody up there woke the Bruins
up in time.
</P>
<P>
   Cade McNown, their Heisman Trophy candidate of a quarterback,
threw two interceptions on the same drive. They couldn't even run
the final 4:19 off the clock against a Stanford team that was the
worst in the Pac-10 Conference against the rush and had no timeouts
left.
</P>
<P>
   They committed 12 penalties for 125 yards, including one that
cost them a touchdown and another that forced a 35-yard extra
point. They asked a kicker, Chris Sailer, who practiced Wednesday
for the first time in four weeks because of a sore groin, to try
two field goals from 50 yards and beyond. (One was blocked to set
up a Stanford score.)
</P>
<P>
   And the offense matched the low-point total of their
nation-leading 17-game winning streak against a school that
couldn't even defend its own mascot. (The Stanford Tree, by the
way, has been rescued.)
</P>
<P>
   So, this adds up to No.1 in the Bowl Championship Series
formula?
</P>
<P>
   It certainly won't in the coaches' or writers' polls, where the
Bruins _ considering Kansas State and Tennessee each won by at
least 35 points _ may be lucky to hold on to No.2.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (7-0, 5-0 Pac-10) caught a break in the BCS' strength
of schedule component when Texas upset Nebraska, but it certainly
won't help when the computer ratings crunch how Stanford (1-7, 0-4)
played UCLA tougher than it did San Jose State.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA coach Bob Toledo has his own equation. W x 11  &QC;  Good
enough for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have any control over those things,'' Toledo said of
the polls. ``The only thing you have control over is the game
you're playing. The key thing is to win the football game _ find a
way to win. I can't worry about those polls at this point. I just
hope we continue to win and it gets down to Dec. 5 and it's all
decided at that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the worst game we've play all year and to play as bad
as we did and still win says something. I'm very proud of the way
our kids battled back. Our guys rose to the occasion and won. Our
kids played hard 'til the end. Our players know how to win.''
</P>
<P>
   And they went to extraordinary lengths to do so against a
28{-point underdog.
</P>
<P>
   They needed an 8-yard touchdown run, the game-winner, by
freshman DeShaun Foster, who was supposed to rest his injured knee
this week. They needed Marques Anderson, beaten by Jeff Allen for
the apparent go-ahead touchdown with 4:19 left, to recover in time
to strip Allen of the ball and have Larry Atkins recover for a
Bruin touchback.
</P>
<P>
   And they needed Turner, the defensive end whose nickname is The
Sackmaster, to get his first sack of the season on the final play
of the seventh game of the season, bringing down Stanford
quarterback Todd Husak at the UCLA 45 to end the madness.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, to a man, say they'll play much better next week
against Oregon State. They also insisted they were ready to play
against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal, though, weren't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Bill Harris, whose team hadn't given up
less than 30 points this season, said his unit didn't play all that
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just had a bad night,'' Harris said. ``They usually hit
on 100 cylinders and tonight they hit on two. When McNown throws
two interceptions on the same drive, something's not right in Bruin
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Husak didn't see a sense of urgency in the Bruins' eyes when
Stanford drove 65 yards for a touchdown on their first drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're so good,'' Husak said. ``Maybe you start believing
the hype.''
</P>
<P>
   Which begs the question: Should we?

USC DEFENSE STEPS UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Most of the attention at the Coliseum on Saturday
turned toward a switch at the USC quarterback position. That's
understandable. Carson Palmer's starting debut is big news.
</P>
<P>
   But, in reality, the 33-10 USC victory over Washington wasn't
about the play of the 18-year-old freshman. It was about an
experienced group on the other side of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' proclaimed USC linebacker Chris Claiborne, ``is a
defensive team.''
</P>
<P>
   For the sixth time in nine games this season, the defense
directed the Trojans' victory. And they did it by worrying more
about Washington's two-quarterback system of Brock Huard and
Marques Tuiasosopo than USC's two-quarterback question of Palmer
and Mike Van Raaphorst.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter to us who (the USC) quarterback is,''
Trojans safety Rashard Cook said. ``We can't worry about that on
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, USC's defense was far too busy to fret about
anything but the Huskies' offense. Washington snapped the ball 98
times, had possession for 36 minutes and 40 seconds of the
60-minute game and, despite the lack of running success, kept the
pressure on by putting the ball in the air 68 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a defensive back, if you can't look forward to a game like
this, then don't bother showing up,'' cornerback Daylon McCutcheon
said.
</P>
<P>
   There were some impressive defensive numbers. Claiborne had 13
tackles and strongside linebacker Zeke Moreno added 11. And
cornerbacks Antuan Simmons (eight tackles, six pass breakups),
McCutcheon (eight tackles, four pass breakups) and Ken Haslip (four
tackles, three pass breakups) performed well.
</P>
<P>
   But a pair of key numbers _ 10 and five _ jump out. Ten is what
Washington scored, which is 19 under its season average. Five
represents the sum total of two interceptions by Simmons and one
each by Haslip, McCutcheon and Grant Pearsall.
</P>
<P>
   Huard put up some head-turning numbers _ 33 of 62 for 301 yards
_ but he also was intercepted four times, three in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense just kept coming at Brock Huard, who is a fine
quarterback, and all of a sudden he threw it to us,'' USC coach
Paul Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   USC took a 14-0 lead just over 15 minutes into the game, but
``14 points is not a big lead,'' Gibson said. Fourteen points was
basically one Washington play away from a precarious lead.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, two plays in the third quarter a 34-yard field goal by
Joe Jarzynka and a 23-yard connection from Huard to Chris Juergens
tightened things up.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long, though, for the defense to loosen things
up.
</P>
<P>
   Pearsall's interception a tumbling grab of Huard's floater down
the middle of the field set the Trojans' offense up 34 yards away
from a two-possession advantage. It took USC five plays to score on
a drive which, ironically, was extended when a Washington
interception was negated by a pass interference flag.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, Simmons gave the Trojans a 27-10 advantage when
he picked off an overthrown Huard pass and raced 29 yards into the
end zone with 10:48 left. He ended the afternoon with a 90-yard
interception return the Trojans' fifth touchdown return of the
season moments after Tuiasosopo stopped the clock by spiking the
ball to get one final play.
</P>
<P>
   Which, according to Claiborne, sets the tone for next week at
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go out and ball every week,'' Claiborne said. ``That's
happened every game and it's not going to change.''

WYOMING TOPS GROUNDED FROGS
</HEADLINE>
 By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The number 240 was magical for football
teams coached by Dennis Franchione.
</P>
<P>
   Gain that many yards on the ground, and Franchione could almost
count on a victory. His New Mexico teams were 16-3 when hitting
that number, and TCU was 4-0 when doing it this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Horned Frogs hit the number last night, but it didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rushing for 294 yards, their second-highest output this
year, the Horned Frogs fell to Wyoming, 34-27, at Amon Carter
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   TCU lost its third consecutive game, and dropped to 2-3 in the
Western Athletic Conference, 4-4 overall. The Mountain
Division-leading Cowboys improved to 7-1 overall, 5-0 in the WAC.
</P>
<P>
   The 240-yard formula didn't work this time because the ground
game had no support from the air.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Patrick Batteaux, who got the start even though he
was relieved early in the second quarter of a 42-21 loss to
Colorado State last weekend, did his usual adept job of handling
the ground game. But he had his worst game of the season as a
passer, completing just 3 of 8 passes for 17 yards. He had two
interceptions, one that was returned for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made some mistakes, and our mistakes really cost us,''
Franchione said. ``It just gives you a sick feeling because you
know you had a chance to win it and just didn't take advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   His first pass was intercepted, setting the Cowboys up at the
TCU 43. The defense held that time.
</P>
<P>
   His second pass also was picked off, and this time there was
nothing the defense could do about it. Wyoming cornerback Robbie
Duncan returned it 58 yards for a touchdown with 23 seconds
remaining in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   That proved to be the turning point.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs had built a 17-7 lead on the strength of the running
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys scored the first time they had the ball, getting the
score on a 69-yard pass from quarterback Jay Stoner to Kofi Shuck.
TCU cornerback Andre Bruce had the coverage, but fell down as Shuck
went up for the catch at midfield.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs answered on their first possession, going 58 yards on
the ground. Tailback Basil Mitchell, who gained 51 of the yards,
got the touchdown on a 15-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   The defense put TCU ahead on the first play of the second
quarter. Safety Curtis Fuller intercepted Stoner at the Wyoming 26,
and weaved his way into the end zone. It was his second touchdown
in as many games.
</P>
<P>
   TCU extended the lead with a 23-yard field goal by Chris
Kaylakie with 6:33 remaining in the half. The kick was set up by a
60-yard drive, again exclusively on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The drive stalled on a third-and-four from the Wyoming eight,
when Batteaux gained one yard on a run.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys closed to within a touchdown on a 54-yard field goal
by Aaron Elling, but with just 1:35 to go before halftime it
appeared the Frogs would take a lead to the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   However, Batteaux threw the interception. He was hit as he let
the ball go, and it was underthrown. Duncan had an easy pick, and
an easy touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs picked up on where they left off in the second half,
moving from their 32 to the Wyoming 16, again with all the yards
coming on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   And again the lack of a passing attack hurt. On third-and-five,
Mitchell ran for one yard. Chris Kaylakie then missed a 32-yard
field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys began to shut down the running game after that
drive, and the Frogs were in trouble. Wyoming took the lead early
in the fourth quarter on a 36-yard field goal by Elling, and
extended it on a 71-yard run by Marques Brigham.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first half everything we had was working,'' Mitchell
said. ``In the second half Wyoming adjusted by staggering
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Frogs trailing by 10 Franchione pulled Batteaux in
favor of Jeff Dover. Dover misfired on his first three passes, the
final one on a fourth down from the TCU 26. The Cowboys marched for
the clinching touchdown with 3:05 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Dover passed for 117 yards and a touchdown in a frenetic final
three minutes to make the final score look respectable.

IDAHO BLOWS AWAY UNT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GENE MENEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENTON, Texas _ The Fouts Field scoreboard displayed, ``Idaho
41, North Texas 23.'' And that was only half of the double team
that might have sacked the Eagles' bowl hopes.
</P>
<P>
   With a chance to grab sole possession of first place in the Big
West Conference last night, North Texas got plowed over and picked
apart by a balanced Vandals' offensive attack that rolled up 478
yards of total offense. And if that was not enough, the Eagles
might play the last three weeks of the season with third-string
quarterback Chase Corley under center.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to losing a crucial contest before 7,112 spectators,
North Texas most likely has lost starting quarterback Jason Attaway
for the season with a right knee injury. Backup LaDarrin McLane did
not play the second half because of a right shoulder injury, and
more will be known about his status after he is examined today.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the chances of playing in the Humanitarian Bowl on
Dec. 30 in Boise, Idaho, took two steps back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to get tough fast,'' UNT running back Hut
Allred said.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles (2-6, 2-1 Big West Conference) showed little
toughness against Idaho. North Texas fell behind 24-7, allowed its
most points this season and gave up 260 yards rushing, including
142 yards and two touchdowns to Vandals running back Joel Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, the Eagles began the fourth quarter trailing just
31-23, but Idaho quarterback John Welsh, who entered the game in
the first quarter, hit Ryan Prestimonico on a 2-yard pass with 12
minutes, 4 seconds remaining in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Davis added a 43-yard field goal for the Vandals.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Eagles were outgained by 233 yards. North Texas,
which had developed an identity as a running team, rushed for 121
yards on 34 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``They outplayed us in every phase of the game _ offensive,
defensive, kicking game,'' Eagles coach Darrell Dickey said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Idaho coach Chris Tormey: ``We were concerned coming into
this game about how we'd match up physically with this team, and we
beat them at their own game.''
</P>
<P>
   McLane, who threw a touchdown pass to Jay Young shortly before
halftime to bring the Eagles within 24-7, injured his right,
throwing shoulder and did not play again. Attaway went out in the
third quarter after he hit the turf on an option play. A magnetic
resonance imaging test is scheduled for tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Corley _ who had thrown eight, garbage-time passes in the second
game this season against Texas Tech, his only appearance this
season _ could not rally the Eagles. He was 7-of-19 for 74 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Another backup, Welsh, shined. He completed 17 of 27 passes for
214 yards and two touchdowns in place of Gregory Robertson, who was
knocked out of the game in the first quarter on a crushing blow by
UNT defensive end Scott Blank.
</P>
<P>
   It might have been the worst thing Blank could have done. Welsh
continually found open receivers in the middle of the Eagles'
defense in directing the Vandals to three touchdowns on his first
four possessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like it's the defense's worst game this season,'' UNT
defensive back Phillip Littlejohn said. ``I just didn't feel we
really were into the game. We weren't as intense as we should have
been.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the only thing worse than the performance was the timing.
With New Mexico State also losing last night, the Eagles could have
grabbed sole possession of first place in the conference with two
Big West contests remaining. By virtue of the outcome, Idaho (6-3,
2-1) and UNT are tied for first place, with New Mexico State (3-5,
1-1) behind. Extra points UNT's Garrett Courtney kicked a
wind-aided 61-yard field goal in the third quarter for the
second-longest field goal in UNT history. The longest is a
62-yarder by Iseed Khoury against Richmond in 1977. Courtney also
had field goals of 49 and 37 yards.

HULL GIVES HOME CROWD SHOT OF HOPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Like any new kid on the block, Brett Hull has just
needed time to get used to the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what always happens, doesn't it?'' Stars owner Tom
Hicks asked. ``You move into a new neighborhood, and it takes time
to get used to things.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks was beaming. Another hefty, high-profile investment has
begun to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   On a festive Halloween night at Reunion Arena, the new kid,
Hull, gave the neighborhood an engaging treat _ two goals and a 3-2
victory over the defending Stanley Cup champions.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Ken Hitchcock called it Hull's ``best hockey game for
us,'' and it was hard to argue. His deflection that whisked past
Detroit goalie Chris Osgood late in the first period was his first
goal at Reunion Arena in a Stars uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with six minutes left, Hull one-timed a game-winning
cannon shot from the left circle that Osgood may have heard, but
probably never saw.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' Halloween message to the rival Red Wings: Boo!
</P>
<P>
   With Hull and a healthy Joe Nieuwendyk, Hitchcock's team has two
more, direly needed weapons to throw at the champions.
</P>
<P>
   Let's be frank here. It's the offense, stupid. It was the
offense _ or lack thereof _ that mostly spelled the Stars' doom in
last season's Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the coaching. It wasn't the Russians. It wasn't the
much-discussed, alleged mental unraveling of goaltender Ed Belfour
that made the difference last spring against the Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Let's also be catty here. How is Detroit ever going to win
another Stanley Cup with a goalie that cracks, like that Osgood
guy?
</P>
<P>
   With less than two minutes to play, the Wings' man in the crease
tentacled himself to Pat Verbeek, and the next thing you knew, the
two were whaling on each other. Osgood's brief meltdown left his
team short-handed for its last-minute comeback attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought a lot of players put a lot of emotion in this,''
Hitchcock said. ``I thought it was a game that was a real joy to
coach in. You treasure a game like that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a game laced with hitting and with passion. An October
game, of all things.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game that, for now, means so little in the standings,
but maybe a lot more in the heart.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars might think so, if no one else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to play well,'' Hitchcock said. ``After nine games,
we wanted to have a strong assessment of where we are as a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to be playing well at home, and we wanted to play
well against the good teams.''
</P>
<P>
   For that, alas, the Stars needed to be scoring. The dearth of
offense _ they were shut out twice by Osgood _ sent them home in
six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all went to the same playoffs,'' Hicks said last night.
``You were there. We all saw. There was a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, Hicks and the front office felt, can be Hull. With
his 557 career goals, Hull is now the 14th-highest goal scorer in
NHL history.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but there's a new neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a different game than what Brett Hull has been playing
in,'' Hitchcock explained. ``He's being asked to be physical. He's
being asked to attack the net and to work low more.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Stars' system, Hull has been assigned to play left wing,
a position where he last logged meaningful minutes during the 1995
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The transition has been inconsistent. Hull had seven points
before last night, but not a single goal before the home crowd.
</P>
<P>
   He also was an on-ice bystander at Friday night's giveaway 3-3
tie with the Anaheim Mighty Ducks. Hitchcock said of Hull's
performance, ``I didn't think he was a factor in the game. I didn't
notice him.''
</P>
<P>
   Boo!
</P>
<P>
   Hull didn't need the wakeup comments. ``As a line we've played
very hard in all the games,'' he said. ``The puck just hasn't gone
in for us. And a lot of that has to do with the transition I'm
trying to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull admitted that part of last night's incentive, besides the
familiar sight of those winged-wheel Detroit jerseys, was
recovering from the decision they squandered against Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   It ended up being a showdown in which the Stars that have to
carry the team for it to beat the Red Wings did. The Hull-Mike
Modano-Jere Lehtinen line carried the night. Nieuwendyk commanded
the Wings' attention. Belfour stood tall in the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still the Stanley Cup champions, and it's going to
take a lot more than one game before we send them any messages,''
Hull cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   True, but in the corridor outside of the home team's locker
room, the new owner was enjoying a day that had reaped bountiful
success.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks had spent his afternoon in Lincoln, Neb., where he had
watched the Texas Longhorns humble mighty Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great doubleheader,'' the owner said, grinning.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns had won. Brett Hull had scored twice. It was a
beautiful day in the neighborhood.

ONE BASIC TRUTH: FOOTBALL SURELY LONE STAR GLORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. _ Hand that man in the dreadlocks a Heisman
Trophy. Raise a toast to the continuing resurgence of college
football in the state of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And, above all else, circle Nov. 27 as a morning of must-see TV.
Texas and Texas A&AMP;M tangle at 10 a.m. in Austin to determine which
team will be recognized as the nation's leading Big Red Basher, if
not also the Big 12 South Division champion.
</P>
<P>
   Incredible, isn't it? Three times, the most dominant college
football team of the 1990s has fallen to a conference opponent
since joining the Big 12. And on each occasion, it has been at the
hands of a double-digit underdog from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of your rooting interest locally, college football
fans from the Lone Star State should be giggling today over Texas
20, Nebraska 16. Just as they should have relished A&AMP;M's 28-21
triumph on Oct. 10.
</P>
<P>
   As Texans, we can't take credit for inventing football. But
we're pretty sure we've perfected the sport.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, our lone NFL entry, have been to more Super Bowls
(8) than any team. They've got as many Lombardi Trophies (5) as any
team. At the college level, three of the game's most innovative and
devastating offenses of their respective eras _ the wishbone, the
veer and the run-and-shoot _ all trace their roots to Texas. The
quality of high school football in the state is without peer.
</P>
<P>
   Upon these basic truths, we base our swagger every autumn. But
there has been too little to howl about, especially at the college
level, in recent seasons. That's what makes days like yesterday
special.
</P>
<P>
   Texas middle linebacker Dusty Renfro understands. As the
Longhorns' team bus wound its way through legions of Big Red
tailgaters on its way to Memorial Stadium, he reflected on the
challenge at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nebraska is the only Division I team in this state,'' Renfro
said. ``Everybody gets behind them. To come up here and pull this
off, in their place, when they pour everything they have into this
program to make it win ... that's a great accomplishment. It says a
lot about the quality of college football we play in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   It says a lot about preseason expectations when ABC officials
scheduled the A&AMP;M-Texas game as the lead-in to a tussle between
Nebraska and Colorado, rather than the other way around, in the Big
12's nationally televised double-header to close the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   Now that both the Longhorns and Aggies have paddled the
Cornhuskers, it seems appropriate for ABC to flip-flop the starting
times and let the championship contender teams sleep in while the
also-ran Cornhuskers have the eye-opener kickoff. But don't look
for that to happen, said Texas wide receiver Wane McGarity, who
grabbed the winning touchdown pass on a 2-yard strike from
quarterback Major Applewhite with 2:47 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get the respect we deserve, us or A&AMP;M,'' McGarity
said. ``I'm not going to hold my breath waiting for that to happen,
even after this. But we should have opened some eyes, if people
were paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, knocking off Nebraska in Lincoln puts the
Longhorns in elite company. The last two teams to do it, Washington
(1991) and Colorado (1990), both won national championships. Texas,
at 6-2, is not in danger of joining that list.
</P>
<P>
   But tailback Ricky Williams should have swung a telling share of
Heisman votes in his direction with yesterday's 37-carry, 150-yard
rushing effort against one of the nation's stingiest defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The think the fact we won helps me more than anything,''
Williams said. ``I wouldn't have come back for my senior year if I
didn't think we could win nine or 10 games. This shows we can.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a signficant rebound from a 4-7 mark last season. Or even
from the ashes of a 48-7 defeat to No. 4 Kansas State on Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, this is a great win for the University of Texas
and the whole state of Texas,'' coach Mack Brown said. ``This gives
us a chance to step forward and get us in the mix for some things
at the end of the year that a lot of people didn't think we had a
chance to get in.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown speaks of potential Big 12 titles. And the Aggies will be
there to join the Longhorns, as fellow front-runners and fellow
Cornhusker conquerors.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to put a little overdue swagger in any Texan's step
as crunch time in the college football season approaches.

ANDERSON MAKES BIG PLAY FOR UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ Marques Anderson had no choice. He could not deflect
the ball. He could not make the tackle. So he watched Stanford
receiver Jeff Allen corral Todd Husak's pass, then did what every
cornerback is taught when times are desperate and the receiver is a
step ahead.
</P>
<P>
   He used the rake _ a ball-stripping technique in which the
defender slaps at the ball carrier's arm with a downward motion,
attempting to force a fumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was supposed to have free safety help,'' Anderson said. ``I
had underneath coverage. I saw he was going to have possession. The
game was on the line. I was lucky the ball came out.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Bruins were lucky to have Anderson, who did not practice
last week because of a sprained big toe on his right foot. He
finished with seven tackles but, like fellow cornerbacks Ryan
Roques and Jason Bell, was beaten time and again by Stanford
quarterback Todd Husak and his trio of receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were quicker than they looked on film, and the
quarterback was better than I thought,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback trio: Starting tailback Jermaine Lewis bruised the
outside of his right calf on UCLA's second series and did not
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got hit with a helmet or somebody's shin or a leg whip,''
Lewis said. ``But I'm fine. I'll be back next week.''
</P>
<P>
   With Lewis out and Keith Brown tiring in the third quarter, the
Bruins inserted freshman DeShaun Foster, who was supposed to play
in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an emergency,'' coach Bob Toledo said. ``He proved he's
an outstanding back.... He gave us a little lift. He made some
outstanding runs down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster gained 51 yards on nine carries in his first action since
the Oregon game two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Boost from the stands: A raucous crowd helped force Stanford to
use its timeouts during a drive midway through the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally have a home-field advantage,'' Toledo said. ``Our
fans were responsible for Stanford calling three timeouts. That's a
home-field advantage. I told the team before the game that people
are finally coming out to see us play instead of the opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Not kicking themselves: UCLA kicker Chris Sailer, recovering
from a strained groin, missed a 53-yard field goal and had a
50-yarder blocked. Each time, Stanford gained superb field
position, but the Bruins did not regret the decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt good,'' offensive coordinator Al Borges said. ``We'd
never try them if we didn't think he could do them. He said he
could. We didn't blink an eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Rest easy: A radical anti-arbor Cal student group, calling
itself the ``Phoenix Five,'' returned the kidnapped Stanford Tree
on Friday, preserving peace and goodwill throughout the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford declined to press charges and is considering the matter
dropped. The Tree's return after a two-week absence means Cal's
mascot, Oski, will be allowed to perform at Big Game on Nov. 21.

MLB NEEDS TO WAIT AWHILE TO BAN ANDRO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is little doubt Major League Baseball will one day ban the
use of the muscle-enhancing supplement androstenedione (andro for
short). To do so now, however, would not only be ridiculous but
extremely short-sighted on the part of baseball officials.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's true that andro is not allowed in the NFL, NCAA and
Olympics, where nasal decongestants also are banned. No one is
certain of andro's long-term effects on the human body and, for
once, baseball and its union officials are actually studying andro.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Toronto Globe and Mail'' reported Thursday that baseball
will ban the substance sometime before spring training. No such
decision has been made. Besides, the powerful players association
would have to agree to the ban and they aren't likely to do so on
something that is legal, not yet anyway.
</P>
<P>
   If baseball decides to ban andro it should, at the very least,
wait a full year. Why? For one very good reason. To ban the drug
now would open a Pandora's Box against the game in general and
 &UR; Mark McGwire in particular.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire slammed a record 70 home runs in 1998 and admitted he
used andro throughout the season (so did Anaheim's  &UR; Dave Hollins
and Colorado's  &UR; Dante
 &UR; Bichette to name just a few). Nonetheless, baseball would mark open
season on McGwire if it banned andro now.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a matter of minutes before every so-called
``expert'' in the country would weigh in with his or her ``adept''
opinion on the matter. Of course, very few of these people would
really know what they're talking about.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a shame for McGwire to be subjected to the certain
torture that will come his way should andro be banned this
off-season. Let's face it, there's virtually no chance McGwire will
come close to hitting 70 home runs next season, with or without
andro.
</P>
<P>
   To make it illegal in baseball in 1999 and then watch McGwire
hit 50 or so home runs and be subjected to the onslaught of bull to
follow would do no good for anyone in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball officials should allow andro to remain legal next
season and then, if they decide to ban it, take it away from the
players the following season. Enough has been said about andro so
far to scare away any thinkers who might have reservations about
the drug.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who will take andro next season, well, they'll
find whatever the next andro will be the following year. &QL; 
Greatness in the Bronx &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the San Diego Padres played the New York Yankees in the
World Series, it meant an obscure streak will remain in tact.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 21 players who have had at least 3,000 hits, all but
three have made an appearance at Yankee Stadium. Those three _
 &UR; Honus Wagner,  &UR; Nap Lajoie and
 &UR; Cap Anson _ never had an opportunity to play at the House That Ruth
Built, which opened its doors for the 1923 season. All three had
retired from baseball before Yankee Stadium opened.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tony Gwynn, who will surely reach the 3,000-hit club next
season, will join six other career National Leaguers who made their
lone appearance at Yankee Stadium in World Series competition.
 &UR; John Lowe of the Detroit ``Free Press'' researched the following
chart:
</P>
<P>
   The six, with their club and the year(s) they played at the most
hallowed stadium in baseball:  &UR; Paul Waner, Pirates (1927);  &UR; Stan
Musial, Cardinals (1942-43);  &UR; Roberto Clemente, Pirates (1960);
 &UR; Willie Mays, Giants (1962);  &UR; Lou
 &UR; Brock, Cardinals (1964) and  &UR; Pete Rose, Reds (1976). &QL; 
Shave and haircut, 2 bits &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New Los Angeles Manager  &UR; Davey Johnson wasted very little time
showing who will be the Dodgers' boss in 1999. During his
introductory press conference, Johnson indirectly challenged his
often moody and mostly coddled superstar outfielders,  &UR; Gary
Sheffield and  &UR; Raul Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson declared the Dodgers will return to a previous club
policy of no facial hair other than a trimmed moustache, no
earrings while in uniform and no blue jeans on the road. The
Dodgers, who figure to take the biggest hits on the changes are
Sheffield and Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to start looking professional, like a team,''
Johnson declared. ``I've had pitchers tell me that the Fu Manchu
mustache makes them look more intimidating. Well, I've been on the
other side (as a hitter), and it doesn't do diddly.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has the full support of new General Manager  &UR; Kevin
Malone, who said, ``We're going to start looking like the Dodgers
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, one potential problem waiting to blow up in Johnson's
face is the fact that Mondesi, who moved to center field after the
blockbuster trade with Florida, and Sheffield each want to play
right field. Stay tuned on that one. &QL; 
A Good Guy award &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Al Leiter, who re-signed with the New York Mets last week, said
his relationship with the Mets was the biggest reason he decided to
forgo testing the free agent waters.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets impressed Leiter last summer when they agreed to give
him the $50,000 bonus he would have received for making the
All-Star team, even though he did not make the National League team
because of an injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was part of coming back, too,'' Leiter said of getting
the bonus. ``When I got injured and the Mets still wanted to give
me the All-Star bonus, I thought that was a classy gesture. Those
kinds of things really made an impression on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter, who was 17-6 with a 2.47 ERA, decided to use the $50,000
to build a baseball field for a teenage league in his hometown in
New Jersey. &QL; 
THE HIT LIST &QL; 
 &UR; One head screwed on as conceivably tight and right as possible:
World Series Most Valuable Player  &UR; Scott Brosius turned down the
chance to be on
 &UR; David Letterman's show and ``Saturday Night Live'' in order to
return to his suburban Portland home to be with his wife and three
kids. ``I wanted to take the kids to school and put them to bed _
things I miss 100 nights a year.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Does he also want a date with Gina Gershon?:  &UR; Dave Stieb's
agent,  &UR; Bob LaMonte, said his client wants to become a four-decade
player, meaning the seven-time All-Star who came back after a
four-year retirement, would pitch in 2000 at 42.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback (in the interest of free-agent busts): Wayne Garland.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; This will not mean twice the number of victories: The Montreal
Expos plan to boost their payroll from around $10 million to
somewhere over $19 million next season. For once, General Manager
 &UR; Jim Beattie knows he does not have to peddle players with
potential big paydays coming.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; There's a reason it's called the American League Comedy
 &UR; Central division: The AL Central champion Cleveland Indians were a
very average 14-12 in April, June and September. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Cubs superstar  &UR; Sammy Sosa, who led the club with 60
two-out RBIs, stands to earn an additional $250,000 if he wins the
MVP award. He already earned a bonus of $50,000 for winning the
Silver Slugger award and $25,000 for being on the post-season
All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   Florida pitcher  &UR; Alex Fernandez, who underwent reconstructive
shoulder surgery one year ago, has moved beyond the rehabilitation
phase and is under a normal off-season throwing program. His
fastball recently registered 88 mph.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that  &UR; Albert Belle has filed for free agency. It is
not true, however, that he will necessarily leave the Chicago White
Sox. Belle has a free look at being a free agent. If he doesn't
like any other offers, he can return to the Sox after 30 days and
return to his old contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers, one of the few clubs that has never
changed its look (even going back to Brooklyn), will introduce new
road uniforms next year that will include gray caps.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati's suspended managing general partner,  &UR; Marge
 &UR; Schott, plans to sell 5{ of her 6{ shares in the club, which is
split between 15 shares. Why will Schott keep one share? In a deal
with Commissioner  &UR; Bud
 &UR; Selig, she can keep one share and still take her dog,  &UR; Schottzie
02, on the field before some games. She can no longer have an
office at the ballpark. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL
</P>
<P>
   San Diego and the New York Mets have shown some interest in the
Dodgers'
 &UR; Bobby Bonilla, who is owed $11.8 million over the next two years.
The Padres have discussed sending closer  &UR; Randy Myers if the
Dodgers include shortstop
 &UR; Jose Vizcaino, while the Mets have tossed around  &UR; Mel Rojas' name.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Orioles, under the new leadership of GM  &UR; Frank
 &UR; Wren, will attempt to upgrade their starting pitching (what a
surprise).
 &UR; Kevin Brown's name has been tossed around but a more realistic
option is  &UR; Todd
 &UR; Stottlemyre, who might not mind pitching for his dad, Mel, in the
south Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's front office isn't exactly denying what  &UR; Pat
 &UR; Hentgen, a former Cy Young Award winner, has been saying recently.
Hentgen has heard Detroit, his hometown, and Seattle are both
interested in acquiring the right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia is very interested in taking outfielder  &UR; Ron
 &UR; Gant off St. Louis' hands. There is, however, a catch (isn't there
always?). The Phillies would like the Cardinals to pick up most of
the remaining $10.5 million due Gant the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Deposed Colorado Manager  &UR; Don Baylor, who declined to become a
club vice president, is mulling coaching offers from Oakland,
Cleveland, Detroit and Atlanta. He appears to be leaning toward the
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins are looking for any takers for second baseman
 &UR; Luis Castillo, a switch-hitting defensive whiz who swings so poorly
from the left side he gave it up during the final month of last
season. Seattle seems interested. &QL; Includes information from other

CRACKDOWN ON QUACKERS  
 ARIZONA PULLS PLUG ON OREGON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON,Ariz. _ Arizona had the better Mr. Smith, an emerging
candidate and a rigorous defense.
</P>
<P>
   All the planks in the platform for perhaps Arizona's best season
ever were in place Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon's Ducks probably feel as though they were caught in a
landslide. Arizona will get one loud vote from all the Quacker
Backers in the collegiate football pond.
</P>
<P>
   But today it is anybody's guess as to whether Arizona's
convincing 38-3 whipping of Oregon will earn enough votes in any of
the various polls to put the Wildcats in line for a major bowl.
</P>
<P>
   For Arizona, major means only one thing: The Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In their two decades in the Pacific-10 Conference, the Wildcats
have never made the postseason journey to Pasadena. Now, in this
first campaign of something called the Bowl Championship Series,
it's hard to evaluate their chances at reaching that elusive
destination.
</P>
<P>
   A Rose is a Rose is a Wildcat?
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Coach Dick Tomey had no answer. Truth is, he didn't need
one about an hour after his Wildcats shut down a team that had been
the Pac-10's most productive offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way this team is playing, it's going somewhere,'' Tomey
said after Oregon failed to score a touchdown for the first time
since losing to Colorado in the 1996 Cotton Bowl. ``We just need to
keep winning.''
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of reasons to believe the Wildcats will
continue to do exactly that through their final three games against
Washington State, California and Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   Improvement was evident everywhere for the Wildcats (8-1, 4-1
Pac-10),who are just one victory away from their best start in
school history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no turnovers, the de fense played well, and our kicking
was solid,'' Tomey said. ``We played well in all phases.''
</P>
<P>
   From a master of careful understatement, even Tomey's comment
was understated.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon (6-2, 3-2 Pac-10) was expected to challenge the Wildcats,
who are now in sole possession of second-place in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to be a high-scoring game. It was billed as a
contest between prolific offenses. Oregon publicists had been
sending out flyers in support of quarterback Akili Smith's run for
the Heisman Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's defense discovered an Achilles' heel in the Oregon
quarterback, who competed 13 of 25 passes and was intercepted
twice. Wildcats defenders rushed him ferociously and repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear he was in for a long day at Arizona Stadium when
Wildcats cornerback Chris McAlister jumped high for an interception
in the end zone on the game's opening drive.
</P>
<P>
   No, this day belonged to another Smith, Keith. He started at
quarterback for Arizona and directed the Wildcats to a quick 10
points in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we put it all together like that, we can handle just
about anybody,'' said Smith, who tossed a 48-yard touchdown strike
to Brad Brennan and then directed a drive that ended with a 38-yard
field goal by Mark McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats, No. 13 in the Associated Press poll and No. 14 in
the Bowl Championship Series ratings, went into the halftime locker
room with a 10-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Ducks, No. 13 in the AP survey and No. 11 in the
BCS, it appeared to be a comfortable margin. In the first halves of
their prior seven games, the Ducks outscored their opposition by an
average of 24-10.
</P>
<P>
   But Arizona wasn't satisfied. The Wildcats had only 34 rushing
yards at halftime. It was cause for concern. Enter Trung Canidate,
a candidate for Arizona's key player in the November campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Canidate, a junior from Central High School, has been erratic
over the last five games. He still showed the effects of a stress
fracture.
</P>
<P>
   But in one dynamic moment, Canidate displayed his importance to
Arizona as he also eliminated any real chance of a late victory by
Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Canidate broke into the open for a 71-yard touchdown. He
finished with 180 rushing yards, 12 fewer than his career high 192
against Alabama-Birmingham last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks also scored a lot of near-misses on Kelvin Eafon, who
followed Canidate with three touchdowns that gave him 14 for the
season and placed him 10th on Arizona's all-time scoring list. &QL;

SUN DEVILS, KEALY SHOW SOME SPARK  
 REDMOND'S EARLY EXIT CREATES INCENTIVE 
</HEADLINE>

   PULLMAN, Wash. _ Gerald Green heard voices.
</P>
<P>
   The mocking from Washington State's sideline filled one ear, the
whispers of encouragement from J.R. Redmond the other.
</P>
<P>
   It was just the fuel Green and the rest of Arizona State's
offense needed Saturday as it survived Redmond's early departure
and beat Washington State, 38-28, in front of 34,039 at Martin
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Cougars) players were saying, `Yea, J.R. hurt his leg. We'll
win this game,' '' Green recalled. ``I thought, `Hey, that's not
how to think.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As crazy as it sounds, the Sun Devils (4-4, 3-2 Pac-10) find
themselves in a three-way tie for fourth place in the conference
with Oregon and California. They still have games remaining against
three of the teams they are tied with or trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just by seeing what's happening in the Pac-10, we're still
very much in it for a bowl game,'' said wide receiver Kenny
Mitchell, who scored two touchdowns. ``We had some tough breaks
early, but now we know we can make our own future.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils, who still have issues to sort out, did have some
key concerns addressed:
</P>
<P>
   Although it's not preferable, they can survive without Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   The junior had a right ankle sprain but told Coach Bruce Snyder
before the game, ``Let me try.'' After one carry, he said, ``I
can't run to the right.'' After two, he said, ``Coach, I'm going to
hurt the team if I stay in.''
</P>
<P>
   Green spelled Redmond and finished with a career-high 119 yards.
Redshirt freshman Davaren Hightower scored a rushing and receiving
touchdown and fullback Jeff Paulk gained 93 yards, 70 coming on one
run.
</P>
<P>
   When Redmond left the game, he pulled aside Green and Hightower
and said, ``Be yourselves. Trust your eyes. The field is 100 yards
long and 50 yards wide. It's yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Snyder, ``(Green and Hightower) really complement each
other. There's no jealousy at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond will be re-evaluated this week but is expected to
available for Saturday's game against California.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Ryan Kealy can be just as effective as he was last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Kealy completed 22 of 33 passes for 248 yards and three
touchdowns. He played with poise, exuded confidence in the huddle,
teammates said, and made many of the right reads.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he seemed unimpressed with his effort, but he is
notorious for being hard on himself. He got enthusiastic approval
from both head coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't surprise me how he played,'' Washington State Coach
Mike Price said. ``I saw him last year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was spectacular,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   The overall difference was turnover margin. The Sun Devils came
into the game ranked last in the Pac-10 in that category. They
converted three Cougars mistakes into touchdowns after having only
scored 21 points off turnovers all season.
</P>
<P>
   Two came in the second quarter. The Cougars' Dee Moronkola, who
entered the game as the nation's top kickoff returner, fumbled a
Stephen Baker punt. ASU's Seanan Kelly recovered at the Washington
State 18 and three plays later, Mitchell caught a 12-yard pass to
give the Sun Devils a 10-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, Mitchell said, was a block thrown by wide
receiver Tariq McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   On the next series, the Cougars fumbled again. This time it was
running back Kevin Brown following a hit by Derrick Ford.
Cornerback Courtney Jackson recovered and seven plays later,
Mitchell scored on a 6-yard pass from Kealy to put the Sun Devils
up, 17-7, at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   After giving up 172 rushing yards in the first half, ASU made
adjustments and allowed only 28 in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Sun Devils still revealed a propensity for giving up big
plays in the secondary, and two were 34- and 44-yard scoring passes
by Paul Mencke in the third quarter that kept the Cougars (3-5,
0-5) alive.
</P>
<P>
   Price platooned Mencke and Steve Birnbaum and alternated them by
series. Mencke showed a strength throwing fade passes and Birnbaum
was better at play-action. They combined to complete 13 of 30
passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went OK, but it wasn't awesome,'' Price said. ``I'll do it
again but use them in a different way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, half the time I didn't even notice
which one was in,'' said freshman Willie Daniel, who started in
place of injured strong safety Christon Rance. ``It was just
important for me to play my game.''
</P>
<P>
   He did and his 37-yard interception return for a touchdown
midway through the fourth quarter seemed to take the life out of
the Cougars. &QL;

SUNDAY'S NOT THE SAME WHEN NFL'S A FLOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Every down cycle begins with whispers, moves into the
arena of disgust and ends with a click of the remote.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is hearing the whispers:
</P>
<P>
   Bad games. Bad teams. Bad football.
</P>
<P>
   Eight weeks into the season, and the King of American sports
rests uneasy on the throne. Television ratings are down. Mediocrity
rules. And just last week, two games were played without a
touchdown being scored.
</P>
<P>
   It's getting harder and harder to justify a Sunday afternoon on
the couch.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the NFL isn't making headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Taylor is busted for crack cocaine and claims he was
set up. Leonard Little allegedly kills a woman while driving under
the influence of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   John Elway pleads with voters to buy the Broncos a new stadium.
A new book says 21 percent of NFL athletes have committed a serious
crime. Taylor files for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ditka, who is taking this Saint business a little too
seriously, announces Kerry Collins needs to find the Lord and a
good woman. And in Tennessee _ a region that is to sports what a
toothless uncle is to the Thanksgiving dinner _ a punter tries a
field goal while the kicker is running onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   Something is seriously wrong here.
</P>
<P>
   By my count, there are four really good teams in the NFL _
Denver, San Francisco, Minnesota and Green Bay. Five others _
Kansas City, Jacksonville, Pittsburgh, Seattle and Tampa Bay _ have
a chance to do something. The rest of the teams are all the same,
thrown in one big hopper, creating a league that is 70 percent
stink bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointments everywhere, and none greater than in our
backyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cardinals, in my opinion, have been the league's most
disappointing team,'' Bill Walsh wrote in ``The Sporting News.''
``And if they had played anywhere near the level I thought they
would, they could be in the driver's seat of a weak NFC East. There
is no way they should be losing by 27 points to the Giants.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem might be parity. A hard cap that affects the bottom
half of every roster. A league with too much sameness and not
enough wacky personalities.
</P>
<P>
   The problem might be coaches. Bad coaches who coach scared. Good
coaches who are too conservative. Old coaches who left their brain
cells in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The problem might be a league straying too far from its history.
Baltimore's memories are in Indianapolis. St. Louis' history is in
Arizona. Houston's team is in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The problem might be an absence of power in the big markets. In
New York, the only thing worth watching is Bill Parcells. In
Chicago, the Bears are boring and barely afloat. In Los Angeles, a
city without a franchise, there is zero passion. Unless the topic
is keeping Al Davis in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The problem might be a league that's gone overboard on size. In
1988, there were 20 players who weighed more than 300 pounds. In
1998, there are 250. A league that may have over-emphasized girth,
underestimated speed, resulting in a plodding product.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the problem is simply a lack of superstars at the
glamour position. Too many young quarterbacks who can't recognize
and burn the zone blitzes. Too many bad quarterbacks who allow
defenses to stack the line. Too much Grbac, not enough Favre.
</P>
<P>
   We should be talking about Jake Plummer and Kordell Stewart.
Instead, we're dwelling on Randall Cunningham, Doug Flutie and
Steve DeBerg.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, as the NFL creeps toward the postseason, the drama will
increase. If Denver and Minnesota flirt with unbeaten seasons _ and
the league is bad enough where it might happen _ it could
compensate for all the blemishes. If Terrell Davis chases Eric
Dickerson, it could provide the Mark McGwire effect.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, this could be a turnabout weekend for the NFL. San
Francisco at Green Bay. Minnesota at Tampa Bay. Miami at Buffalo.
The Big Tuna in Arrowhead Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Or it could be a season perfectly summarized by Monday Night
Football.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys and the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   And in other news, Home Depot reports a 200 percent increase in
Sunday receipts . . . &QL;

NFL'S NEWBIE QBS TRYING TO TAKE CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - If they worked in valet parking, you would hesitate
before handing them keys to a nice car, visions of them peeling out
and reprogramming your radio dancing through your head.
</P>
<P>
   If they worked with you, they would be just above interns on the
organizational chart.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the NFL is booming with babies who have been given the keys
to sophisticated offenses and to franchises' fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Entering this weekend, there have been 15 quarterbacks under age
27 who have started games. Of those 15, three are rookies, two are
in their second seasons and three are in their third seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at the starting quarterbacks in today's NFL games,
and there's a 50-50 chance you'll see peach fuzz peeking out from
beneath chin straps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an alarming trend to me,'' said Gary Horton, a former NFL
scout who publishes ``The War Room,'' which analyzes teams,
personnel and trends in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're close to losing a premium group of quarterbacks _
Marino, Elway, Young, Moon. The changing of the guard is coming
soon. It's scary to look out there and say, `Who is going to
replace these guys?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The league's five highest-rated passers _ Randall Cunningham,
Vinny Testaverde, Steve Young, Doug Flutie and Neil O'Donnell _ all
are over 32. The five lowest-rated passers _ Ryan Leaf, Bobby
Hoying, Kordell Stewart, Tony Banks and Jake Plummer _ are no older
than 26.
</P>
<P>
   Today's match-up between the Cardinals and Detroit could well be
decided by which 23-year-old, Plummer or Lions rookie Charlie
Batch, makes fewer boneheaded mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   The youth movement at quarterback is likely to continue. The
quarterback class next year, which includes UCLA's Cade McNown,
Central Florida's Daunte Culpepper and possibly Washington's Brock
Huard and Kentucky's Tim Couch, is supposed to be the deepest in
years.
</P>
<P>
   There are two main reasons so many young quarterbacks are
playing: a lack of talent at the position, and free agency.
</P>
<P>
   There had been a huge gap in quarterback talent since John
Elway, Dan Marino and Jim Kelly entered the league in 1983 until
recently.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer, for instance, replaced Kent Graham, a journeyman. Batch
replaced Scott Mitchell, who has been a bust in Detroit. Ryan Leaf
took over for Craig Whelihan in San Diego. &QL; 
No time for apprenticeship &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And because of free agency, organizations are playing
quarterbacks almost from the day they sign contracts. No longer can
teams afford to keep a talented young quarterback as a backup for
three or four years while he learns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, you'd draft a guy high and he'd sit on the bench for
three or four years,'' Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin said. ``He would
mature, learn, and when the other guy played out his string . . .
away you went.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, if you sit him on the bench for three or four years,
somebody will come in and bust the bank, and you've lost your
investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, coaches play a young quarterback right away and live
through the growing pains. And in most cases, teams are paying
dearly for starting youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers don't lie &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks 35 and older (Elway, Bubby Brister, Cunningham,
Young, Warren Moon and Flutie) are 28-6 as starters. Quarterbacks
25 and under (Batch, Plummer, Peyton Manning, Rob Johnson, Leaf,
Danny Kanell, Banks, Steve McNair and Danny Wuerffel) are 20-40.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of that can be blamed on young quarterbacks, of course,
because teams forced to play a youngster at the most important
position generally are in bad shape overall.
</P>
<P>
   But many experts agree that it's tougher than ever for a young
quarterback to be successful in his first or second year. Not since
Marino entered the league in 1983 has a rookie quarterback enjoyed
much success.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what separates Dan Marino from someone like John Elway is
that Dan started out with a pretty good football team (that went
12-4),'' New York Giants Coach Jim Fassel said.
</P>
<P>
   Ground attack &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Succeeding with a rookie quarterback requires at least two
things: a dominant defense and a powerful running game. That's how
the Giants won the NFC East last year while starting Kanell, then
23 and in his second season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to minimize what he had to do to win the game,'' Fassel
said.
</P>
<P>
   That's the theory most coaches use when playing a young
quarterback: Take the game out of his hands and don't make him
think he has to win it for you.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, has prompted a change in the way defensive
coordinators think. Increasingly, they are concentrating on
stopping the run and using complicated blitzing schemes to confuse
the youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense are saying, `We're not going to allow quarterbacks
just to be caretakers,' '' Horton said.
</P>
<P>
   There probably never has been a more difficult time in league
history for young quarterbacks to perform successfully. Defenses
have become far more complex in the last five years, coaches said.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s and early '90s, many teams are making gambles,
using a variety of blitzes but always playing man-to-man defense
behind it. The advent of the zone blitz has made it more difficult
for young quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It not only overloads rushes to one side, but it drops a
lineman from the other side into passing lanes, and it gets rid of
the quick, hot read,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Teams used to handle blitzes by throwing short routes, rubbing
the defender off and letting their receivers make big plays after
the catch. Now, there are defenders in the way of those routes
because they are playing zones instead of chasing receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes deciding where to go with the ball that much
harder,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Changing defense &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a much different game today than it was in 1985, when
Cardinals offensive coordinator Marc Trestman entered the league as
an assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got into the league, they said it took four to five
years for a young quarterback to play, and all (defenses) were
doing was rushing four and playing coverage behind it, or rushing
five and playing single coverage,'' Trestman said. ``Or leaving the
middle of the field open and you could throw posts. They don't do
that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenses are using schemes that most young quarterbacks have
never seen. Plummer was asked whether he had ever seen a zone blitz
during his collegiate career at ASU. ``I don't know. I just kind of
ran around and made plays.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a bit more complicated than that, Plummer admitted, but
much of what he did was based on what the other team's safeties
were doing. His reads were simple.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is much more complicated and considerably faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elway, (Brett) Favre, Marino, Cunningham, all of these guys
have the experiences of seeing these teams and defenders and
coverages,'' said Detroit Coach Bobby Ross. ``They can almost take
a look at the alignment of an individual and know what they are
getting. Charlie (Batch) is just experiencing all of this for the
first time. He's meeting new people each and every game.''
</P>
<P>
   In the NFL, a young quarterback now dropping back to the pocket
finds himself in a whirlwind, Trestman said. He has to worry about
where the rush is coming from, if his line is in the right
protection, if his receivers are making the proper sight
adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The older guys are handling it better,'' Trestman said. ``And
only the great ones in the league are the ones teams are laying off
of, the Steve Youngs and guys of that stature.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressure of money &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To be successful with a young quarterback, a coach must have
patience and a long-term contract. The pressure for the young
quarterback to play and perform well right away is greater than
ever before. Part of the reason for that is money. In many cases,
teams are paying exorbitant salaries for young players, and fans
and owners want to see a return.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel, however, thinks there's more to the increased pressure
than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``What hurts young quarterbacks today is our society is into
immediate results,'' he said. ``People have pagers and cell phones
because people want to get a hold of you right now. It's, `I want
this letter faxed to you, I'm not going to mail it. You want this
document? I'll overnight it. I won't put it in the mail.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That, Trestman agreed, is part of what swirls around a young
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be somebody who tries to stay level-headed,'' he
said, ``and says, `this is who we are, we know we are going to get
there, and this is how it's going to be done.' You can't improve
something in a day when it takes time to grow and prosper.'' &QL;

QUESTION IS, WHAT TOOK SO LONG?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Paul Hackett tricked the Washington Huskies
Saturday afternoon he finally started his heralded freshman, Carson
Palmer, at quarterback and what a Halloween treat it turned out to
be for the USC Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   The only question I have after Palmer's inspiring 18-for-31,
279-yard, 1-touchdown performance that triggered a 33-10 Trojans'
win is what took Hackett so long to come to the conclusion that the
Trojans would be better off with Palmer in charge of the offense
instead of Mike Van Raaphorst?
</P>
<P>
   Is Hackett the kind of coach who prefers losing three games and
having the alums grumbling before daring to go with an 18-year who
only last June graduated from Santa Margarita High? Was Hackett and
his assistants the only people in Southern California who didn't
realize since the Trojans' opening game against Purdue that Palmer
was better than Van Raaphorst? Was Hackett intent only getting the
Trojans' fiery athletic director, Mike Garrett, as mad at him as he
got at John Robinson?
</P>
<P>
   To Paul Hackett's credit, he at least early last week finally
decided that he had to do something dramatic about his struggling
offense that simply wasn't productive under the guidance of Mr. Van
Raaphorst, a broadcasting major who has a far brighter future
announcing sports than playing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach told me Tuesday night that I'd be starting,'' said
Palmer after he thrilled a Trojan homecoming crowd of 62,276 fans
with his poised work against the fearsome Husky pass rush.
``Obviously, I was happy about it. But coach told me to keep it a
secret. I didn't tell anyone except my father.''
</P>
<P>
   Carson Palmer was as diplomatic in the interview room afterward
as he was efficient on the field throughout a warm day that I'm
sure caused Trojan patrons afterwards as much if-only-Palmer-
</P>
<P>
   had-been-starting-all-along angst as it did joy over a game that
turned into a runaway on two fourth-period touchdown interceptions
by the USC cornerback Antuan Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked Palmer if he felt he should have been given an
opportunity to take command of the Trojans earlier in the season,
he replied, ``No. I don't think I was ready. I think it would have
hurt me a lot if I had been a starter then. I had too many things
to learn. I've learned a lot alternating with Mike (Van Raaphorst)
the past eight games. I still got a lot to learn, but at least now
I feel a little more comfortable starting.''
</P>
<P>
   I disagree.
</P>
<P>
   I think Paul Hackett might have cost his team two losses the
ones against California and Oregon had he settled earlier this
autumn on this abundantly talented 6-4, 220 pounder with the strong
arm, exceptional athletic skills and even a slight facial
resemblance to Troy Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   From the start Saturday against the Huskies, the Trojans looked
like a different team than the one that has been so erratic in
recent weeks and this phenomenon can be attributed to Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   He drove them to a 14-0 halftime lead, and it easily could have
been larger had Mike Bastianelli not fumbled deep in Washington
territory and had Adam Abrams not blown an easy field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans moved up and down the field on the Huskies, and
Palmer's passes opened up space for Chad Morton, who would wind up
gaining 115 yards on a mere 13 carries for an 8.5 average.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the Trojans kept self-destructing with all their silly
penalties that are a gnawing hangover from the Robinson era members
of the Trojan defensive line seem to feel it is their
cardinal-and-gold duty to jump offside at least four or five times
a game and the Huskies drew within 14-10 late in the third period
in a match that suddenly was looking ominously to USC fans like a
reprise of the team's collapse against California.
</P>
<P>
   But, just as suddenly, the Huskies' QB, Brock Huard, began
throwing interceptions and Carson Palmer kept making all the right
plays for a Trojan squad that this time didn't panic when under
duress.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt about it, Carson Palmer gave us a presence out there
that we haven't had before,'' acknowledged Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   No kidding!
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you regret waiting so long to make Palmer your starter?'' I
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' answered Hackett. ``I just tried to bring Carson
along slowly. He had a lot to learn, and Mike deserved to be our
starter. But Mike had eight starts, and had a chance to lead the
team. I felt it was time to give Palmer an opportunity to show what
kind of player he is. And I'm delighted with the way he played.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unfortunate for USC's football team that Paul Hackett
waited until late October to pull the trigger, because no matter
what he or Carson Palmer say, the bottom line is that the Trojans
have looked like a far more formidable team this season for the
most part when Palmer was leading it.
</P>
<P>
   Can you imagine how much more advanced Carson Palmer would be
now had he been playing four quarters of every Trojan game this
season?
</P>
<P>
   Football coaches are a notoriously conservative species, and
Paul Hackett is a typical one when he keeps insisting that Palmer
was too inexperienced and he wasn't ready to become a starting
signal caller in the sweltering heat of late August against Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   Carson Palmer, a bright young lad who already knows how to
recite all the obligatory cliches, might agree with his coach.
</P>
<P>
   But he's wrong, too.
</P>
<P>
   As he showed against Washington, he is one exceptional talent
who was just as exceptional two months ago when it was so obvious
he was the best quarterback at USC, notwithstanding the spin he and
his coach put on it.

FLUTIE COMES UP SHORT WHEN JOHNSON RETURNS  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   D &UR; oug Flutie knows the Buffalo Bills won't keep a $5
million-a-year quarterback on the bench for long.
</P>
<P>
   So regardless of how many games he wins or how many boxes of
cereal (Flutie Flakes) are sold,  &UR; Rob Johnson is the team's
quarterback of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be just like it was 10 years ago in New England
when I won seven out of my 10 ball games and then  &UR; Tony (Eason)
went back in,'' Flutie said. ``The situation was Tony was the
starter, I was the backup, and when he got healthy he went back in.
And it is just a situation I'm going to have to deal with, and the
fans and everyone is going to have to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Say it ain't so,  &UR; Wade Phillips, first-year coach of the Bills.
Your team was struggling with Johnson. It's unbeaten since Flutie,
the 5-foot-9 sparkplug, took over three games ago.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Bills are 4-3 going into today's game against
Miami. Flutie, who came back to the NFL this year after 10 years in
the Canadian Football League, will keep the job until Johnson
recovers this month from a rib injury. Flutie is the AFC's
second-leading passer, completing 64 percent of his throws for 881
yards and seven touchdowns. He has been intercepted only twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I play well against Miami, it's a surprise (in many
people's eyes),'' Flutie said. ``And when I finally have a rough
day, which is bound to happen, someone is going to beat us or
someone is going to keep us under 150 yards passing, then it will
because I'm too short, not because we got beat. It's what I've
lived with for 14 years.''
</P>
<P>
   After struggling with the Chicago Bears and the New England
Patriots, Flutie left for the CFL in 1988. He was asked if he were
exiled to playing north of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the only option I had at the time,'' he said. ``They
didn't want me down here. No one (in the NFL) was willing to take a
chance. They always look at me as a risk for some reason. It really
irritated me back then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, I wouldn't trade the days I spent in Canada for
anything in the world. I was asked recently if I would trade my
three Grey Cups there for an opportunity to play in the Super Bowl.
That's ridiculous. That was the most enjoyable time in my life
playing football. I am proud of the accomplishments up there. There
is some great football being played up there.''
</P>
<P>
   So when he was dominating the CFL for nine seasons, why did no
NFL team give him another chance until this year?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I got out on the field and don't play well, people say, `Of
course, he didn't play well. He's too short. They should fire the
personnel director. They should fire the general manager.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to cover their butt, and they see it as a risk.
If you bring in a guy that's 6-4, 220, can throw the ball 70 or 80
yards, that's his fault, he's an underachiever. The personnel guy
thinks, `I brought in the guy with all the tools. He just couldn't
perform.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Flutie has advice for the next player who is told he's too
short.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can tell you what you can and can't accomplish in life;
it's limitless,'' he said. ``The doors are wide open. I had people
telling me I was supposed to go to an Ivy League school because I
couldn't play football on a Division I level. That's when I was 17
years old, making decisions that were going to affect the rest of
my life, and these counselors and coaches and all these people that
know ... you can't listen. You've got to make your decisions for
yourself and know what your capabilities are and take chances in
your life.'' &QL; 
Perfect record
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco quarterback  &UR; Steve
 &UR; Young is 0-7 against Green Bay as a starter, including four losses
early in his career with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers have lost four straight to the Packers going into
today's game in Green Bay and have been eliminated by the Packers
in the playoffs the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're trying to win a championship and one team keeps
knocking you down, you tend to remember it,'' Young said. ``We've
been knocked down by them, and we're going to try to change it.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the same Packers team that has dominated the 49ers.
In the playoffs last year, running back  &UR; Dorsey Levens gained 114
yards on 27 carries, establishing a team playoff record. This year,
the Packers, who are without an injured Levens, are last in the NFC
in rushing with 578 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody on the Packers has gained more than 204 yards on the
ground. Meanwhile, Denver's  &UR; Terrell Davis has run for 1,001 yards
already.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Packers go into the game loose.
</P>
<P>
   As he was getting ready to a do a conference call with Bay Area
reporters last Wednesday, Packers quarterback  &UR; Brett Favre was
heard muching on his lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I'm eating chicken dumpling soup, potato salad, a
chicken sandwich and some barbecue chips,'' Favre said. ``Breakfast
of champions.'' &QL; 
In demand
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos (7-0) not only are having a perfect season but also
are keeping folks at the Pro Football Hall of Fame busy.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame officials requested this week the shoe  &UR; Jason Elam
used to kick a record-tying 63-yard field goal last week against
Jacksonville. They also asked for the jersey Davis wore when he
gained 1,000 yards in six games, three quarters and 13 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Someone from the Hall of Fame will be calling the Broncos again
this week if quarterback  &UR; John Elway throws for at least 255 yards
today against Cincinnati, making him the second quarterback in NFL
history to reach 5,000 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Elam said he's not giving up his shoes _ kangaroo-skin, Nike
Tiempos until after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really the only pair I have, so it's be tough to give
them up,'' he said. &QL; 
Short shots
</P>
<P>
   While the Cardinals haven't re-signed any players this season
despite being $3 million under the cap, the Broncos, defending
Super Bowl champions, have 21 of their 22 starters under contract
for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Spending $300 million on stadiums for the Redskins and the
Ravens could cost Maryland Gov.  &UR; Parris Glendenning being
re-elected Tuesday. Glendenning's opponent is running a slogan that
says, `(Glendenning) spent money on stadiums instead of
classrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   If the NFL chooses Los Angeles over Houston for an expansion
team,  &UR; Robert McNair, who is trying to bring pro football back to
Houston, is expected to try to buy the Redskins or the Broncos, if
their stadium initiative fails Tuesday in Denver. McNair would move
the Broncos to Houston but keep the Redskins in the Washington,
D.C., area.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Elway's chances of getting over the 50,000-yard mark
playing against the NFL's worst defense, Bengals Coach  &UR; Bruce
Coslet said, ``I hope he doesn't go over 100,000 against us.''

GOING HOME EMOTIONAL FOR LOMAS BROWN  
 CARDS TACKLE WAS ALL-PRO IN DETROIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. _ Lomas Brown, according to Cardinals defensive
tackle Bernard Wilson, ``is so old he has Roman numerals on his
jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   That might be a little harsh, Cardinals linebacker Terry Irving
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he was at the groundbreaking ceremony at the Hall of
Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   It is good-natured jabbing of a respected colleague who is both
friend and adviser to Cardinals players, kind of a Dr. Laura in a
three-point stance. Brown is their captain. He has represented them
in the players union. He has piled a lot onto those shoulders atop
a 6-foot-4, 290-pound frame.
</P>
<P>
   And, he is a player who, frankly, is old. At 35, Brown is in his
14th season. If he hasn't lost a step, he certainly has received
less leaguewide recognition because of the Cardinals' struggling
running game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day,'' said Wilson, who met Brown when they both
played for the Detroit Lions, ``Lomas and Andre Wadsworth were
talking, and Lomas was saying how he didn't like Hawaii. That's
because Lomas had a bad experience over there some years back.
After his first Pro Bowl, he barely made it out before the Japanese
attacked Pearl Harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates are drawn to Brown not only because he has played the
game a long time at a high level, but also because he has a
fun-loving personality. &QL; 
Silverdome reunion &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But this week, the jolly guy is a man whose guts are churning.
Brown played his first 11 seasons for the Lions and made his name
blocking for one of the greatest backs ever to play, Barry Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's return to the Silverdome today, playing for the
Cardinals, will be awkward, uncomfortable, emotional. Brown's wife
and three adolescent daughters still live in the Detroit area.
Being away from them has created a strain. Brown didn't leave town
on the best terms with the Lions, either.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has found that when you're the leader, there sometimes is
no place on the team to get the kind of support that you give
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reach out to family and friends outside the locker room when
I need to turn to somebody,'' Brown said. ``The thing about it is
that if you have personal problems, you can't carry them in here
because they would know. I think a lot of times they forget I have
a life, I go through problems. They come to you for advice _
football, personal _ and they want you to have the answer for them.
</P>
<P>
   This week's homecoming has increased the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird, real weird,'' Brown said. ``I didn't think it was
going to be an emotional game for me. I was thinking about coming
in a day before or staying a day after, but if I did, I know it
would be hard to get on a plane and come back. It's home. A lot of
my friends are there. I miss the guys. I miss Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong, Brown said, was a deterioration of his
relationship with Chuck Schmidt, Lions executive vice president and
chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just one person in particular, and we kind of grew
apart,'' Brown said. ``They kept slapping the franchise tag on me,
and then once they did that, they never tried to negotiate with me
to make a fair market-value offer. That's what kind of went wrong.
It left a bitter taste.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Brown said, coming back will be more sweet than bitter. He
recalls his early years blocking for Sanders, whom he often used to
invite to the house for dinner. &QL; 
Blocking for Barry &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to experience it,'' said Brown, a grin breaking
across his face. ``Wayne (Fontes, former Lions coach) just let
Barry run wild. You could be backside on the sweep but you had to
block it like you were frontside because Barry would go all the way
to one side and then reverse it all the way back. We never knew
where he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never got a chance to enjoy him until Monday in film. Man,
when we'd sit there watching film it would be like `Ooooo.' He
would just be all over the place. It was hard blocking for him, but
he was the best I've ever seen at setting up blocks. The other
thing we'd get a kick out of was watching the expression of the
defensive players.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, whose career rushing ranks second in the NFL to Walter
Payton, said he, too, misses those days with Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was different after losing Lomas,'' Sanders said. ``I spent
a few evenings over there eating his wife's cooking. Lomas was the
guy who took me under his wing. He was playing really well. I was
disappointed when he left, but I kind of had an idea because we had
the same agent. It was tough, but that's part of the game, and you
learn that at a very early stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders helped launch Brown to seven straight Pro Bowls, a
streak that ended last season. When Brown came to the Cardinals, he
found it very different blocking for Leeland McElroy.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lineman to get recognition, you have to be on a winning
team because an offensive lineman doesn't have stats,'' Brown said.
``There are a a lot of things from Detroit I have to be grateful
for _ everything that I have monetarily, everything that I have in
the community.'' &QL; 
Elder statesman &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have a young, sputtering offense. Brown has tried
to lead them through the growing pains.
</P>
<P>
   ``James Dexter and I were talking today about how he looks like
he's 20 years old,'' said Matt Joyce, Brown's backup and nine years
to the day younger. ``We were watching him go through drills.
Dexter and I looked at him and then looked at each other. He makes
us look like we're all stiff and sore like a guy his age should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the one thing that impresses me is how Lomas commands
respect. He doesn't ask for it, but everyone knows that he is the
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Players tend to have respect for those who have been on the
battlefield, according to Chris Dishman, a second-year guard who
plays next to Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not one of these glamour athletes who thinks he's too big
to lift and run,'' Dishman said. ``When we do conditioning at
training camp, he's always first in line. He's here early in the
morning getting extra work in. Young guys like me can learn from
that. I respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at Jackie Slater, you think about Anthony Munoz,
those type of guys who had a passion for what they did, and you see
the same thing in Lomas,'' Wilson said. ``He loves what he does,
and he does it well. That's a testimony in itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson might be the one player who understands how torn Brown is
this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays with the climate being as it is with free agency,
with people moving around so much, it's hard really to make close,
friends,'' Wilson said. ``Lomas is one of those guys who lifts that
burden up off your shoulders by being whatever you need, the
shoulder to cry on, or somebody to lean on. That's what he means to
the people around him. Even people who give that sometimes need it
themselves.'' &QL;

VERSATILE RECRUIT SPARKLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PULLMAN, Wash. _  &UR; Davaren Hightower was a hot commodity coming
out of his Texas high school, for a variety of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State recruited him at tailback, Texas A&AMP;M wanted him as
a defensive back and Texas envisioned him as a wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Sun Devils are benefitting from his versatility. The
redshirt freshman had a rushing and receiving touchdown in ASU's
38-28 victory over Washington State on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great runner but a really fine receiver, too,'' Snyder
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hightower joined  &UR; Gerald Green in filling in for  &UR; J.R. Redmond,
who left the game early with a continuing ankle problem. Hightower
carried nine times for 19 yards and caught three passes for 37
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Hightower's biggest contribution was a pass play that Redmond
and
 &UR; Ryan Kealy have perfected. The 18-yard scoring pass into the corner
of the end zone gave the Sun Devils a 31-21 lead midway through the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just told me, `Run past (the defenders) and catch the
ball if you can,' '' Hightower said. &QL; 
The Incredible Paulk &QL; 
ASU caught the Cougars' defense off-guard with a handoff to
fullback &UR; Jeff Paulk that he turned into a 70-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   He showed impressive speed for a 6-foot-1, 247-pound back and
Cougars safety  &UR; Earl Riley had to sprint a good distance before
bringing him down at the Washington State 6-yard line. Hightower
scored on a 2-yard run three plays later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an eerie play, because I was watching him and he kept
going and going,'' Kealy said. ``But it was really quiet because
the crowd wasn't cheering. I was so excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Paulk, ``I was surprised at first because no one was around
me. But I had to react because I knew the safety would be coming
down behind me.'' &QL; 
Mr. Versatility &QL; 
Add water boy to the many roles Redmond can play.
</P>
<P>
   The junior, who was wearing sweats after leaving the game in the
first quarter, was seen in the middle of a fourth-quarter huddle
handing water bottles to his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He grabbed the water from (one of the staff) and said, `Give
me that,' '' Snyder said. ``And then he just ran out there. He's
one of the most fun players I've ever coached.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Redmond, ``I just wanted to go out there and tell them they
were doing an excellent job.'' &QL; 
Quick hits &QL; 
Backup quarterback  &UR; Steve Campbell blocked a field goal in the
third quarter, his second this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils missed three fields goals, two by
 &UR; Stephen Baker and one by  &UR; Mike Gauthier, and are 6 for 15 this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver  &UR; Lenzie Jackson, safety  &UR; Mitchell
 &UR; Freedman and center  &UR; Grey Ruegamer have been invited to play in the
East-West Shrine Game in January.

DUCKS LEAVE WITH RUFFLED FEATHERS  
 UA DISMANTLES HIGH-FLYING OREGON OFFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ Referring to Oregon's overtime loss to UCLA, compounded
by the loss of the top running back in the Pac-10, Coach Mike
Bellotti said Saturday night, ``We're not the same team we were two
weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's amend that. The Ducks are not the same team they were only
a few hours earlier, or just before they played Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   And wished they hadn't.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon came into Arizona Stadium 6-1 overall, 3-1 in the Pac-10,
ranked 12th and 13th in the major polls. The Ducks were bursting
with confidence, harboring big dreams that included playing in a
major bowl. They left in a somewhat altered state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big shock, because we worked so hard to get this win on
the road,'' Oregon quarterback Akili Smith said after the Wildcats'
38-3 victory that defied all expectations of a closely contested
game. ``For us to come up short like this _ in a ``big'' loss, it
wasn't close or anything like that _ it's a real disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks hadn't taken such a beating since a 45-7 loss to
California on Oct. 12, 1991. But that was a bad Oregon team,
muddling to a 3-8 season. This year's model was high-powered and
sleek, charged by the strong right arm and nimble legs of Smith.
Coming in, the senior was fifth in the nation in passing efficiency
and ninth in total offense. As a whole, Oregon was second
nationally in scoring offense and sixth in total offense.
</P>
<P>
   But in going without a regular-season touchdown for the first
time in nearly three years, the Ducks gained just 272 yards. They
were averaging more than 500. Smith, trapped and pounded
throughout, completed 13 of 25 passes for 168 yards. He threw two
interceptions and was sacked three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew exactly what they were going to do, but sometimes when
you get into game situations, the speed picks up,'' he said.
``Those guys are real quick to the ball. Real quick.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a nice, little confusing thing they do with that
flex guy in the middle (of the defensive line), and he's twisting
and they're moving and doing all kinds of deals to confuse the
offensive linemen, and they did that tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   It also didn't help that the Ducks were missing tailback Reuben
Droughns, who was lost for the season against UCLA with an ankle
injury. Droughns rushed for 824 yards in his first five games to
lead the Pac-10 by almost 60 yards a game. In fact, Derien Latimer,
who got most of the work, is essentially the Ducks' fourth-string
tailback, due to other injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Latimer rushed 20 times for 47 yards, an average of 2.3 yards a
carry. Oregon, the top rushing team in the league at nearly 230
yards a game, gained a net of 64 against the Wildcats. The Ducks
also are missing their best offensive lineman, tackle Marco
Aguirre, who was hurt against UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Rueben, it makes things a lot more tough for us
offensively,'' Smith said. ``You've got to have that balanced
attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Oregon persisted in running, mainly because ``I don't feel
we were protecting the quarterback very well,'' Bellotti said. ``We
needed to keep them honest. They're an attacking, gambling,
blitzing football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Wildcats ran over and around the Ducks for a
season-high 268 yards. Tailback Trung Canidate gained 180 yards in
just 17 carries, including a 71-yard touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ran it down our throats,'' Bellotti said.

EAGLES GET WALLOPED BY HURRICANE JAMES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MIAMI _ They came to the Orange Bowl on All Hallow's Eve, hoping
for a redemptive victory that would expunge the curse that the
month of October has been for Boston College's football team. But
15 minutes into Saturday night's 35-17 loss to the 25th-ranked
Miami Hurricanes, the Eagles already were staring at a 21-0 deficit
and, worst of all, another 0-fer October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, when you don't tackle on defense and can't control the
line of scrimmage on offense,'' said BC coach Tom O'Brien, ``it
usually adds up to a long night, and that's what happened
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   It could get even longer from here, as BC (3-5, 2-3 Big East)
must now regroup for its home finale Nov. 7 against No. 16 Notre
Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Miami junior running back Edgerrin James, who rushed for a
career-high and Big East-record 271 yards in last year's 45-44
victory in double overtime at BC, made a long night even longer for
the Eagles by rushing 31 times for 182 yards and first-quarter TD
runs of 2 and 1 yards. James paced a frightening Miami attack that
rolled up 582 yards of total offense, including 327 rushing, and
won just about every offensive category save for one. Time of
possession.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, BC held the ball for 30 minutes 47 seconds compared
to 29:13 for Miami. But that was of little consolation to anyone in
BC's locker room, especially after the Eagles were held to 325
yards of total offense _ 2 yards less than Miami's rushing total
for the night.
</P>
<P>
   BC senior running back Mike Cloud, the nation's No. 2 rusher,
was held to a season-low 75 yards on 20 carries, well below his
league-leading average of 164.4 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   Cloud entered the day just 91 yards from Terrell Willis's Big
East career rushing record (3,114 yards), but before Cloud even
stepped on the field, the record had been surpassed by West
Virginia's Amos Zereoue, who needed 26 yards and got 148 in a
losing effort against Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   But Cloud was thinking of team goals. ``We're all disappointed,
because we all came in here thinking we had a chance,'' said Cloud.
``We had a good game plan and everything, and we just didn't
execute X's and O's the way we should have. The mood is down again
once again after another week and another loss, and we have to find
a way to pick ourselves up again.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Eagles' fifth consecutive loss _ and fourth this
month. They allowed Miami to roar up and down the field on its
first three possessions for relatively easy touchdowns. By the end
of the first quarter, Miami had streaked to a stunning 21-0 lead
after rolling up 211 yards of total offense on 23 plays. BC, in
contrast, had managed just 12 plays for 42 yards.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, as a result, barked at his players to get their act
together. According to ESPN2 reports, BC players were seen barking
at each other and flinging their helmets to the ground. ``I didn't
see any of that,'' O'Brien said. ``I can't comment on that.''
</P>
<P>
   With three BC defensive starters sidelined by injuries,
including sixth-year linebacker Brian Maye (right groin pull),
Miami's first-quarter eruption had to amount to O'Brien's worst
nightmare. ``No, I've had a lot of bad nightmares,'' O'Brien said.
``I wouldn't say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course. How could anyone forget last week's fourth-quarter
collapse against Navy? The Eagles squandered a 28-10 lead by giving
up 22 points in the final 12:19. Saturday night, they gave up 21 in
the first 13:04. That amounted to 43 points in 25:23.
</P>
<P>
   After James scored on runs of 2 and 1 yards, giving Miami a 14-0
lead, Scott Covington (17 of 27, 224 yards) connected with Daryl
Jones on a 10-yard TD that made it 21-0 with 1:56 left in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   BC quarterback Scott Mutryn, who was sacked four times but
managed to complete 11 of 17 for 106 yards, put the Eagles on the
board in the second quarter when he hit Anthony DiCosmo for a
20-yard TD with 11:16 left before intermission. Miami extended its
21-7 halftime lead to 28-7 when Najeh Davenport (11 carries, 69
yards) scored the first of his two TD runs on a 7-yard burst with
4:56 to go in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles squandered a prime opportunity when Cloud dropped a
pass at the Miami 7 as BC tried to convert a critical third-and-9
play from the Miami 36. ``I got behind the guy and got turned
around,'' Cloud said. ``I should've had that catch. I just lost my
concentration for that moment.''
</P>
<P>
   BC was forced to settle for a 53-yard field goal by John Matich,
who atoned for the 40-yarder he missed against Navy by converting
the longest kick of his career and the second longest in school
history. (Fred Steinfort had a 55-yarder in 1974.)
</P>
<P>
   Davenport scored on a 2-yard run, capping a five-play, 90-yard
drive that made it 35-10. The Eagles, with Tim Hasselbeck at the
helm, answered with one last bit of razzle-dazzle when sophomore
Cedric Washington connected with Dedrick DeWalt on a 15-yard
halfback pass for a final TD with 1:30 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be able to make first downs on offense and we
couldn't keep the defense off the field and they couldn't get
themselves off the field,'' O'Brien said. ``We didn't make a play.
We had a chance when it was 28-7 and we get the ball to Cloud and
he drops the ball. If we make it 28-14, then who knows what happens
from that point on? But everything's right and the ball's thrown
and we wind up dropping the ball. Those things can't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But those are the things that have plagued the Eagles in this
bewitching month.

YAGUDIN CONQUERS `AMERICA' 
</HEADLINE>
 AMERICA-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ For a while after he won the global title in March,
Alexei Yagudin couldn't deal with the idea of being on top of the
world. ``I was a little bit destroyed,'' the Russian confessed.
``When you want something for your life and you get it, something
changes inside and you can't stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   What Yagudin concluded, finally, was that he was still only 18
and that he had to either compete or retire. So Yagudin went back
to the rink to perfect his jumps and bring his artistry to a new
level. And Saturday afternoon inside Joe Louis Arena, the man from
St. Petersburg blew away an impressive field to win the Skate
America title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say that I am ready for this season,'' Yagudin
proclaimed, after holding off Michael Weiss, former Olympic gold
medalist Alexei Urmanov, and three-time world champion Elvis Stojko
with a brilliant long program that included nine triple jumps. ``I
am happy to be first here because I think Skate America will be the
toughest part of the Grand Prix.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Olympic champion Ilya Kulik and former world titleist Todd
Eldredge are wise to sit out the season. Because anybody who wants
to beat Yagudin needs to be in the land of 5.9s. Yagudin earned 10
of them _ five technical, five artistic _ for a long program
(skated to the ``Lawrence of Arabia'' theme) that deftly wedded
grace to aerials.
</P>
<P>
   That was more than enough to hold off the 22-year-old Weiss, who
skated the best long program of his life, nailing two combination
jumps and a triple axel and barely missing a quadruple toe loop to
grab the silver.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come out here against this group of guys, Olympic and world
champions all around, and skate this well is very encouraging,''
said Weiss, who hadn't won a medal in a major international event
in three years. ``I think I can carry it on and go for it again at
the world championships.''
</P>
<P>
   There was personal satisfaction, too, for Urmanov and Stojko,
both coming off nasty groin tears.
</P>
<P>
   Urmanov, out of competition for 16 months, landed eight triple
jumps to grab the bronze medal. And Stojko, who hadn't competed
since tearing both groin and abdominal muscles at the Olympics,
made it through a demanding long program that included a
double-footed quad, and took fourth. ``I'm just trying to get
back,'' said Stojko, who hadn't finished out of the medals since
the 1996 world championships. ``But I feel good about today.''
</P>
<P>
   The women, meanwhile, had trouble even remaining on their feet
Saturday night. Not that anybody expected perfection after Friday
evening's splatter session in the short program.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Maria Butyrskaya, the 26-year-old world bronze
medalist, held on to win despite doing a facial on a triple salchow
and a double cheek on a triple toe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a good lutz and a good flip and I said, that's it, there
won't be any problem. Now I'm going to win,'' said Butyrskaya.
``Then I had a hard fall (on the salchow) and had to fight to go
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth was, Butyrskaya's pursuers didn't do much better. Angela
Nikodinov, the 18-year-old Californian, landed only two clean
triple jumps and dropped from second to third. And Nicole Bobek,
the former US champ and world medalist, staggered out of two jumps
and touched down on a third. She ended up landing only one triple
cleanly and finished fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really proud of the way I got through the program,''
said Bobek, who at least managed to remain upright, which she
couldn't do at the Olympics. ``It was hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Best of the bunch was Elena Sokolova, Butyrskaya's fellow
Muscovite, who managed four triples and climbed past Nikodinov to
claim the silver.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze, the global
champions, took the pairs crown ahead of Canada's Kristy Sargeant
and Kris Wirtz despite a ragged performance that included a fall by
Berezhnaya on a throw. Russia's Victoria Maksuta and Vladislav
Zhovnirsky climbed out of fourth to grab the bronze medal from US
brother-and-sister entry Danielle and Steve Hartsell.
</P>
<P>
   France's Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat, who led from
beginning to end, captured the free dance ahead of Russia's Irina
Lobacheva and Ilya Averbukh and Italy's Barbara Fusar-Poli and
Maurizio Margaglio.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eldredge, who wanted to perform in Sunday's Skate America
exhibition even though he didn't compete in the event, decided
against it after the International Skating Union said it was
against the rules. ``I was not aware that the exhibitions were part
of the competition for all the Grand Prix events,'' said Eldredge,
who is sitting out the Grand Prix season. ``After careful thought
and consideration, I have come to the conclusion that it would not
be fair to the competitors who have committed to compete in the
entire series for me to skate in the exhibition.''

IRBE BLANKS BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Fright night at the FleetCenter had nothing at all to
do with it being Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's Bruins game against the Carolina Hurricanes was
a big-time snoozer as well as a 2-0 Boston loss. However, as dull
as it was, it did provide one big eye opener: The Bruins are
offensively challenged, and this season's rule changes _ a smaller
crease, 2 extra feet behind the net, a smaller neutral zone _ have
done nothing to help the club's goal scorers.
</P>
<P>
   The goals are not coming, and they're not coming in bunches. The
lack of finish has been astounding.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Bruins' 9-2 drubbing of the Canadiens in Montreal
last Wednesday night, coach Pat Burns said he was hoping his club
had saved a few goals for other games. It appears from the last two
contests that they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   If you take that nine-goal performance out of the equation, the
Bruins have scored a total of three goals in their last five games.
Three goals in five games. Before being shut out Saturday night,
they had lost to Phoenix, 3-1; been blanked by Anaheim, 3-0; fallen
to New Jersey, 3-1; and tied Montreal, 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Both regular starting goaltender Byron Dafoe and backup Rob
Tallas, who started Saturday night, have been very solid for the
Bruins, but their strong play has not been resulted in wins,
because the Boston offense _ especially on the power play _ has not
produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep on saying this: It's too early to get excited and it's
too early to get disappointed,'' said Burns.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not too early to be worried about the Bruins' lack of
scoring punch. Saturday night they had 34 shots on net and four
power-play opportunities, and the result was zilch.
</P>
<P>
   The top scoring line of Jason Allison, Sergei Samsonov, and
Dmitri Khristich had five shots on net _ three by Allison none by
Khristich.
</P>
<P>
   Left wing Gary Roberts gave the Hurricanes all the offense they
would need just 5:32 into the game, as Carolina took advantage of a
defensive breakdown. Defenseman Dennis Vaske, playing his first
game of the season, gave up the puck at the Bruins' blue line and
the Hurricanes came charging into the zone on a two-on-one break.
Center Jeff O'Neill made the pass to Roberts, who beat Tallas from
the left circle through the five hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a knuckleball,'' said Tallas. ``It was a good
goal. I got a little piece of it, but he didn't have a lot of room
and it just kind of snuck through there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had some golden opportunities in the middle period
but couldn't finish anything off. One of their best chances was at
5:50 when Khristich was on the doorstep with a wide open net to
shoot at. But the puck rolled on him, and his shot went flying high
and wide of the cage.
</P>
<P>
   Boston had another really good chance during a power play midway
through. With center Ron Francis in the penalty box for
cross-checking Chris Taylor, Ray Bourque ripped a one-timer from
the right point, with Khristich trying to deflect it from in front.
But goalie Arturs Irbe saw it all the way and made the stop at
9:34.
</P>
<P>
   Tallas was called on to make a difficult save at 16:01 with the
Hurricanes coming in on a three-on-two break. Right wing Ray
Sheppard sailed a backhand shot from the slot, but the goalie came
up with it.
</P>
<P>
   The third period was even tougher sledding for Boston, as the
Hurricanes applied even tighter defensive pressure. Burns tried to
tie it by pulling Tallas for the final minute, but Sheppard potted
an empty-netter with 27.1 seconds remaining to seal the win and
give Irbe his 15th career shutout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't get by them in the third period in the neutral
zone,'' said Burns. ``They were trapping us and we were trying to
get to the red line and get the puck in behind them and they just
blocked us right there. We just couldn't seem to get by them.''

IRBE AN UNBEATABLE PICKUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He stoned them all, Arturs Irbe did _ Ray Bourque from
the point, Jason Allison from the slot, Sergei Samsonov from the
circle.
</P>
<P>
   Everything the Bruins threw at him _ and they peppered him with
34 shots _ he turned aside.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, there's no one playing goal better than Irbe, as the
Bruins painfully found out Saturday night at the FleetCenter, where
they became Irbe's second shutout victim in his last three starts.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-0 shutout he pitched at the Bruins was the 15th of his
career, which, at the ripe old age of 32, seems to be soaring to
new heights.
</P>
<P>
   And do you think all those teams that said, ``Thanks, but no
thanks,'' when he was a free agent this past summer are fretting
now about letting Irbe slip through their fingers?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say he probably relishes the opportunity to show those
teams that they missed the boat,'' said Carolina head coach Paul
Maurice. ``I'm sure there's a little extra incentive to say, `See
what you could have had?'''
</P>
<P>
   What they could have had was a veteran goaltender who had a
falling out in Vancouver, where he posted a 14-11-6 record and a
2.73 goals-against average in 41 games last season. Irbe and the
Canucks went their separate ways after the season, and the goalie
stayed on the open market until Carolina scooped him up in
September.
</P>
<P>
   How has he repaid the Hurricanes for their faith in him? Try
these figures on for size.
</P>
<P>
   He has a 4-1-2 record and has given up just six goals for a 0.75
goals-against average, the best in the NHL. A 1-0 loss to the
Rangers Friday snapped a shutout streak of 123 minutes 25 seconds,
because 48 hours earlier he had blanked Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Irbe credits his recent success to the defense in front of him.
``It's kind of hard to describe, really,'' he said. ``This was a
little bit unexpected of me, but I have been looking for this
moment for some time now. This team has been just unbelievable so
far, especially the defensive play.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all taking responsibility of their man and making sure
I have a clear view of the shots. That makes the biggest
difference. I want to do especially well when they play like that
in front of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Irbe says he has no ill feelings for those teams that passed him
by. ``There were a lot of big-name goalies out there this year, and
certain teams made certain choices,'' he said. ``I don't know if
they regret their decision now, but they went with what was best
for them, and God bless. Luckily, I got to the team that believed
in me and gave me this chance. There couldn't be any better feeling
than that. Carolina stepped forward, and maybe even they weren't
expecting this much of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurice was most impressed with Irbe's performance. ``That was
Arturs's toughest game,'' said the coach. ``He faced a lot of
shots, quality shots. It was a tough game, and we showed some signs
of being tired after playing three games in three nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bruins are a big, strong team and gave us some problems at
times that Arturs solved. This guy saw his goals-against average go
up (Friday), and gets a chance to bring it down tonight. He's just
been great.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been in position for shots, he hasn't been scrambling,
and he doesn't allow enough rebounds to get hurt if he finds
himself out of position. No one is playing goal better right now in
the NHL than Arturs is.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, Allison, Samsonov, and company can attest to that.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Nine telephone lines blink insistently at the
new $4.45 million University Interscholastic League administrative
offices.
</P>
<P>
   Associate athletic director Cynthia Doyle cradles an ear to the
first of some 40 calls she'll take throughout the day. Another 50
or so e-mails await her attention.
</P>
<P>
   Each question begs an answer contained somewhere in the 236-page
UIL Contest Rules and Constitution. Approximately half of the Texas
public school students participate in at least one activity
governed by the UIL before they graduate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning, UIL. This is Cynthia Doyle.''
</P>
<P>
   `` . . . My husband is being transferred overseas with the Air
Force and my son will be moving in with his grandparents to finish
his senior year. Can he still play football?''
</P>
<P>
   `` . . . Why can't my daughter play in both of these all-star
softball games?''
</P>
<P>
   `` . . . My coach wants me to take Creatine to bulk up. I don't
know how I feel about it. Is there anything I can do without
getting kicked off the team?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You usually have someone on the phone, someone on hold and
someone in the hole,'' Doyle explained. ``Anybody has the right to
call this office and ask a question.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the UIL, the nation's largest high school activities
organization. It oversees 2.2 million student participants in 65
activities and 1,220 member schools, including 22 boys' and girls'
sports.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the football playoffs two weeks away, is when the UIL
typically becomes the focal point of controversy. Charges of
wrongdoing by playoff-bound schools and other complaints pour into
the organization, which derives the bulk of its revenues from
athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Sports also generate most of the attention and regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work very hard as a staff to promote academics and music
and all our fine arts,'' explained Bonnie Northcutt, director of
policy for the UIL. ``Still, the majority of questions come from
athletics because the whole country is focused on pro teams, sports
pages and the like.''
</P>
<P>
   And the 40 full-time employees of the UIL, despite being
perceived as everything from bumbling to tyrannical, represent one
of the most successful organizations of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are some people that do not know how the UIL
works and have a misunderstanding of it,'' said James Hyden,
Arlington school district athletic director. ``The schools make the
rules here. (UIL Director) Bill Farney or (Athletic Director)
Charles Breithaupt will tell you, they are merely interpreting
rules that are set up by the schools.''
The schools rule
</P>
<P>
   The UIL's administrative staff has two primary responsibilities:
Conducting state championship meets for the activities they govern,
and disseminating information about the rules and their
interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   When students, parents, coaches or teachers break those rules,
it is the locally based district executive committees and
ultimately the Texas Education Agency-appointed State Executive
Council that administer the penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that people may not be happy with the enforcement
of the rules or the impact of the rules,'' Farney said. ``We have
done surveys among the superintendents and the schools have said
overwhelmingly that they like the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The UIL staff _ specifically the 11-person athletic office _
becomes the flashpoint.
</P>
<P>
   When the UIL was created in 1913, it had only four rules for
participation: Students had to be under the age of 21; they had to
be United States citizens; they had to be representing the schools
that they attended; and they had to pass 2 1/2 ``solid courses.''
</P>
<P>
   Four simple eligibility rules have grown into six pages crammed
with sometimes confusing terminology that elicits the hundreds of
phone calls and questions Doyle fields every week.
</P>
<P>
   Today, students must meet 10 requirements to compete in all UIL
activities. They must not have changed schools strictly for the
purpose of participating in those activities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, athletes must meet requirements outlined in five
subsections, covering three pages of text, ranging from amateur
status to the parent-residence rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, there is only one basic rule for all extracurricular
activities and that's no-pass, no-play,'' Farney explained. ``In
varsity athletics, there are a lot more rules involved. ... We just
don't have as many problems in the other areas because the
eligibility rules aren't as strenuous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The schools have stated over and over that the primary
foundation for athletics is the parent-residence rule, especially
in metropolitan areas, because without it, the schools believe one
program would be able to gather all the athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Northcutt had only to field one telephone call from a parent
offering to get a divorce so his child could play sports for
another school in another attendance zone to understand the truth
in Farney's words.
Rule making, rule breaking
</P>
<P>
   Anyone _ parents, teachers, players, accountants _ can come
before the UIL seeking to change the rules: The league has standing
committees on athletics, academics, music and policy that hold open
meetings throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   Those are filtered to the 28-member UIL Legislative Council _ 20
members of which are elected by school superintendents, while the
remaining eight are appointed by the council chairman.
</P>
<P>
   On the third Sunday in October, the council convenes to address
proposals brought by groups or individuals. Based on
recommendations from the standing committees, the council can
survey schools for input or vote to approve or reject proposals.
Approved rules are then forwarded to the State Board of Education
for implementation.
</P>
<P>
   What they create is a living document _ the UIL Constitution and
Contest Rules _ that changes as demands from parents, athletes and
schools change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a grass-roots organization _ we have to be as flexible
as the schools are,'' Breithaupt said. ``At one time we had some of
the strictest transfer rules in the country, but society has
changed so much over the past 20 years with respect to
demographics. We have a more mobile society, so our transfer rules
had to become more liberal. We had to create a waiver system, and
now we have waivers for every rule but one: No-pass, no-play.''
</P>
<P>
   The UIL athletic department must rely on the member schools to
abide by and enforce the rules, including those local school boards
have enacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, a child may want to play sports but the travel
involved may violate their parole,'' Doyle said. ``That's not
really our jurisdiction. Usually people are just asking for
information on rules, but sometimes people will call, ask about a
rule and then say, `Now how do I get around that?'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like asking a police officer how to break the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The UIL staffers are sometimes misunderstood, sometimes hated,
and even sometimes praised.
</P>
<P>
   They can take on a variety of problems and challenges, even
though their essential duty is simple and basic: make certain that
teams and individuals arrive at the state championships through
fair and equitable means: Abiding by the rules that those schools
have made.

 &HT;    ISLAMIC WORLD'S SEX-AND-POLITICS SCANDAL UNFOLDS IN COURT MONDAY
 &HT;    EDS: We expect this story to be updated by 11 p.m. ET with fresh
information from the start of the trial Monday in Malaysia.
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service (at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia The Islamic world's biggest
sex-and-politics scandal begins unfolding in the Malaysian High
Court on Monday as six prosecutors try to convict the nation's most
charismatic politician of covering up homosexual sex acts with
former office subordinates and others.
</P>
<P>
   The jailed defendant is Anwar Ibrahim, 51, who was sacked as
deputy prime minister in September and faces up to 34 years in
prison and a public whipping if convicted. He has pleaded not
guilty to the five charges of sodomy and five charges of
``corruption'' growing out of his alleged attempts to cover up
``unnatural'' sexual conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I have to expect the best and be prepared for the
worst,'' Anwar's 45-year-old wife and most vocal defender, Wan
Azizah Wan Ismail, said in an interview on the eve of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Like Washington's Monica Lewinsky scandal, the Anwar case
promises to drag on for months, producing a stream of kinky sexual
details and politically charged innuendoes that will roil this
country well into next year.
</P>
<P>
   After an opening 12-day barrage of testimony, the trial is set
to recess in mid-November while Malaysia hosts President Clinton
and more than a dozen other foreign heads of state. They are
converging on this capital for two days of talks on the world
economic crisis at the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
summit.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony is set to resume in December and there will be further
trial sessions in February, March, April and June, according to a
trial calendar released a few days ago by Attorney General Mohtar
Abdullah. Under non-jury trial procedures growing out of Malaysia's
history as a British colony, the verdict will be rendered by a
trial judge after Anwar has had a chance to offer either statements
from the dock or submit himself to cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed Sunday inside the Anwar family's spacious house in
the Plaza Damansara neighborhood three miles west of the
courthouse, Anwar's wife said ``I find it strange'' that the court
has adopted such a protracted trial calendar. She said her husband
has lost 18 pounds since being jailed on Sept. 20 but appeared to
be ``in good spirits'' when she was allowed to see him in jail on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our justice is on trial here,'' she said. ``This is a golden
opportunity for our courts to prove that our judiciary really is
independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Homosexual sex is considered a dangerously deviant form of sin
by the 58-percent Muslim majority that controls the politics of
this relatively prosperous Asian nation. Even so, a good many of
the 22 million Malaysians are inclined to accept Anwar's
explanation that his sudden arrest in September resulted from
``fabrication and political conspiracy'' inspired by his rivals for
future national leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar is due to be tried for having consensual sex on four
instances over the past five years with four different men,
including his driver Azizan Abu Bakar, his Pakistani speechwriter
Munawar Ahmad Anees and his Indonesian adopted brother Sukma
Darmawan Sasmitaat Madja. The prosecution has also hinted that
Anwar may later be hit with new accusations under a 1973 criminal
statute barring sex with underage girls.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than open its case with sordid details of sexual
gratification, the prosecution has chosen to devote the first 12
days of testimony to Anwar's alleged attempts to salvage his career
last summer after a ``poison pen letter'' from an unknown accuser
circulated details of Anwar's alleged homosexual escapades to
members of the Malaysian dominant Muslim party UMNO.
</P>
<P>
   The ``poison pen letter'' surfaced at a time when Anwar was seen
by many in UMNO as mounting a challenge to the continued leadership
of his longtime political patron, Malaysia's iron-fisted prime
minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has ruled the country for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the ``poison pen letter,'' the 73-year-old
Mahathir turned against Anwar, who had been his official heir
apparent, and used his power as home minister to direct the police
investigation that led to Anwar's downfall.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Anwar's chief accuser is likely to be police Special
Branch chief Mohamad Said Awang, who has charged that last August,
Anwar tried to defend himself against the ``poison pen letter'' by
ordering the Special Branch to secure false statements from two
potential witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Special Branch version is that under Anwar's prodding, the
police agents obtained two false statements _ one from the driver
who was alleged to have been Anwar's former sex partner, the other
from the sister of Anwar's former confidential secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Anwar has seized the nation's attention,
stirring weekly demonstrations outside several downtown mosques by
small bands of Anwar's young banner-waving supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Mahathir has lashed out at the pro-Anwar
demonstrators, saying they are trying to drive him from power to
prevent Anwar from facing justice. ``They are hoping the government
will fall, and if the government falls, then there will be no
trial,'' Mahathir said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Interest has spread throughout Asia and beyond, fueled in part
by news clips showing rough police tactics in suppressing the
demonstrations, and by a photo of Anwar being led into his first
court appearance with a black eye allegedly inflicted by the
police.
</P>
<P>
   At least one Asian leader, Philippine president Joseph Estrada,
has vowed to call attention to the Anwar case during the
forthcoming APEC summit, saying he might try to visit his friend
Anwar in jail. Clinton has said he will not hold bilateral meetings
with Mahathir, though he brushed aside calls by several key members
of Congress to get the venue for the APEC meeting changed.
</P>
<P>
   There are now more than 30 Internet sites devoted to all sides
of the Anwar controversy. And Amnesty International has come to
Anwar's defense, describing the former minister and his alleged
sexual accomplices as ``prisoners of conscience detained for their
non-violent political activity, association and expression.''

When demand jumps at the inevitable end of today's worldwide

the pump. But adjustments made by our government, other
governments, Wall Street and the oil industry should prevent the
kind of supply shock that led to gasline lines in 1974 and 1979. If
you are forced in the next few years to wait in line at a service
station for gasoline, it is less likely to be caused by a supply
shortage than it is to be caused (No joke!) by Y2K glitches in the
innards of some gasoline pumps. (Mollison, Cox News Service).

 &HT;    FACING CRACKDOWN, HAMAS FAX THREATENS ARAFAT'S POLICE
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM Threatening for the first time to shed the blood of
fellow Palestinians, Hamas extremists Sunday said they might take
up arms against Yasser Arafat's police if he continues a recent
sweep of arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The threat came in a fax to news agencies after more than 100
arrests of Hamas activists in Gaza including the house arrest of
Hamas leader and Arafat's rival Sheikh Ahmad Yassin.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat ordered the arrests after a suicide bombing Thursday,
which apparently targeted two busses of Israeli children. An
Israeli soldier who blocked the bomber's path was killed.
</P>
<P>
   It is still unclear whether Arafat is cracking down on Hamas,
trying to pressure the group into negotiating with him or just
trying to investigate the bombing. Regardless, the fax was an
escalation in rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that Arafat and his repressive security
apparatus have reached the point of treason and utter loyalty to
Israel,'' it said, according to The Associated Press. ``The
(Palestinian) Authority's security apparatus, its officials and
elements, will never be safe,'' said the leaflet.
</P>
<P>
   However, even as he was presumably wanted by police this
weekend, one Hamas member worked calmly in his Gaza office
Saturday(cq) and said there is no serious crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian police had sought to arrest Ghazi Hamed, editor of
the Hamas newspaper, twice at his house, leaving a summons. But
they did not appear to be actively pursuing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to collect a big number of people and show that
they are doing something,'' said Hamed. ``(Arafat) cannot crack
down. Hamas is a big organization with roots in the society.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamas was formed in the late 1980s with strong support in
refugee camps that house Palestinians who lost land to Israel. The
group opposes Israel's existence as well as peace treaties that
would share land with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Hamas runs health clinics, kindergartens and even soccer teams,
but has also killed scores of Israelis in attacks since the signing
of the Oslo peace accords in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is Arafat's biggest challenger, polls indicate Hamas
has the support of only between 10 and 20 percent of the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Many Palestinians were shocked by the bombing near the school
buses Thursday and said they do not want Hamas to spoil the
possibility that the recent peace agreement would improve their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The deal offers them more freedom of movement and the withdrawal
of Israeli troops from 13 percent more of the Arab land in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Palestinian) authority got us 13 percent, let's see Hamas
get us even one percent,'' said college student Yusef Abu Noor.
``(They) say that we should have everything or nothing. But we are
willing to take a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hamed said that a real crackdown from Arafat could spawn
``other radical groups.'' A group like that could be behind
Sunday's fax.
</P>
<P>
   According to Palestinian political scientist Khalil Shikaki, the
arrests and the responding fax might be a prelude to negotiations
in which Arafat may pressure Hamas to ``exchange its military
apparatus for a political role.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This Hamas statement might be an attempt to preempt any action
Arafat might take . . . to tell Arafat he must negotiate,'' Shikaki
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shikaki said the arrests could also simply be Arafat's attempt
to find out who conducted Thursday's bombing in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Just two days ago, Hamas posted a notice on its Internet home
page promising that it would not shed Palestinian blood in its
dispute with Arafat. The new fax, from the military wing, seemed to
contradict that.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has tried before to offer Hamas power in his government
in an effort to control the group. Israelis often accuse Arafat of
being soft on Hamas in order continue an armed struggle against
Israel or keep pressure on Israel in negotiations.

INTERNET POSING PROBLEMS FOR COMMUNICATIONS REGULATORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The emergence of the Internet is making intellectual
contortionists out of people who try to regulate the communications
industries in a fair and consistent manner.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the regulators' fault. It is just that the Internet is
seeping into the cracks between decades of communications rules
that were built, very carefully, to administer industries based on
two-way phone calls and one-way television transmissions, not the
raucously flexible Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The latest example of the difficulty came Friday at the Federal
Communications Commission. On the surface, the FCC was faced with a
fairly straightforward petition from GTE Corp. for approval of
pricing plans for a new sort of high-speed data connection _
digital subscriber lines.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the surface were questions on regulatory
jurisdiction over the Internet and the nature of competition in the
local telephone business, plus concerns over whether new types of
local phone companies would continue to get more than $500 million
a year from the incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   The commission ruled narrowly. It approved GTE's prices but
declined to respond to the broader, more important, questions,
saying it would start answering them within a week.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the difficulty, not only on Friday but throughout the
commission's attempts to grapple with cyberspace, stems from its
intention to avoid regulating the Internet in the first place. The
problem is that the telephone and cable television industries, on
which the Internet relies to reach homes, remain regulated to
varying degrees.
</P>
<P>
   That regulatory dissimilarity raises hard questions. Should
using a phone line and a modem to reach an Internet provider be
considered a local call or a long-distance call _ something
different from a regulatory standpoint? Should a regulated phone
company be regulated differently when selling Internet service? On
the Internet, should cable television companies have to play by the
same rules as phone companies?
</P>
<P>
   Billions of dollars, the development of communications
industries and the future of how Americans are linked to cyberspace
ride on those questions. And so far, the FCC's attempts to answer
them, raise still more questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has grown up in the unregulated environment,
which is different from the old paradigm of regulation,'' William
Kennard, the commission's chairman, said in an interview Friday.
``There are some areas where the old paradigm intersects with the
new paradigm, and that is where we are presented with some
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people link to the Internet using a standard telephone
line. To the modem-using consumer, it generally seems like a
standard local phone call. The dial-up data communication travels
over the systems of the user's local phone company, which then
hands it off to an Internet access provider like America Online.
The Internet company then arranges for the transit of information,
via long-distance lines, from the user to any one of thousands of
sites around the world.
</P>
<P>
   So does that make America Online, or Joe's Internet Shack, a
long-distance carrier? It is not a whimsical question. The largest
source of revenue for local phone companies _ tens of billions of
dollars a year _ takes the form of so-called access fees from
long-distance providers. When AT&AMP;T carries a call from Atlanta to
Chicago, for instance, it must give a few pennies every minute to
the local phone companies, BellSouth and Ameritech, for the use of
their networks in originating and completing the call.
</P>
<P>
   Were Internet companies forced to pay those per-minute fees,
that would probably be the end of monthly all-you-can-use Internet
pricing for consumers. So the FCC, wanting to expand the Internet,
reaffirmed earlier this year that Internet companies receive a
special exemption from long-distance access fees.
</P>
<P>
   An essential aspect of that policy is that by granting an
exemption, the commission has determined that Internet
communication is an interstate service. (In phone regulation, the
FCC generally has authority only over interstate questions.) And as
a practical matter, interstate communications are almost always
considered long-distance calls.
</P>
<P>
   When new companies emerged a few years ago to compete with the
Bells and GTE, they negotiated deals with the incumbents so that
when a person using Phone Company A made a local call to someone
using rival Phone Company B, Company A had to pay Company B a
per-minute ``reciprocal compensation'' fee for the use of its
network equipment. The assumption was that the fees flowing back
and forth would be roughly in balance.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the new local companies have made a business out of
courting Internet service providers, which need lots of phone lines
for all those dial-up modem calls from their customers. And because
these are almost entirely incoming calls, the ``reciprocal
compensation'' fees have been anything but reciprocal. Instead,
they have flowed largely to the upstarts from the incumbents that
own the residential phone lines on which so many of those modem
calls originate. The result has been more than $500 million in
annual payments from the Bells and GTE to new providers.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the Bells and GTE no longer want to play by
these rules. And one of the arguments the incumbents made in
connection with the GTE filing was that reciprocal compensation
fees should not apply to local modem calls. They reasoned that the
FCC's longstanding rules consider Internet calls to be
long-distance calls.
</P>
<P>
   It is this thorny part of GTE's filing that the commission said
it would take up separately, beginning this week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The conundrums do not stop there. Local phone carriers are
required to sell access to pieces of their networks to other local
companies that want to use them. Partly that is because many of
those systems were built when the phone giants were monopolies and
could use monopoly profits to build the networks. But now, the big
local phone companies are asking the commission to exempt them from
this resale requirement when they build new systems to bring
high-speed data communications to homes. They say that if they have
to resell access to those systems to their competitors, there will
be no incentive to build them.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC desperately wants to support the introduction of
advanced data services. Yet it is afraid that the Bells and GTE
would still have an unfair advantage over new competitors if they
could bundle the new services with the traditional phone service
that is a legacy of their monopoly days.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the separate regulatory structure for the
cable TV companies, some of which are venturing into the business
of connecting their customers to the Internet with cable modems.
Not only are cable companies not bound by the rules of phone rate
regulation; they are not compelled to offer competitors access to
their networks.
</P>
<P>
   The local phone companies, of course, have questioned the
fairness of the perceived regulatory advantages the Internet offers
cable companies. And those issues were raised again in industry
comments filed last week at the FCC, which is considering whether
to approve the acquisition of the cable giant Tele-Communications
Inc. by the No. 1 long-distance company, AT&AMP;T.

THE 2000 BUG IS JUST PART OF THE PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DENISE CARUSO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the romantic lead in that unfolding epic ``The New Economy,''
the technology industry's stage makeup may finally be melting under
the hot lights.
</P>
<P>
   More distressing even than testimony in the antitrust suit
against Microsoft Corp. _ some of which suggests that the computer
industry has been built largely on threats and collusion _ is the
recent flood of evidence that the only thing less reliable than the
memory of Microsoft's chairman is technology itself.
</P>
<P>
   Witness last week's computer glitch that brought down the New
York Stock Exchange, and recent reports about the unreliability of
Windows NT and other software upgrades, as well as the continuing
public anxiety over the year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, a cadre of software engineers has been trying
to insure that ``dependable systems'' _ those that control
aircraft, submarines, electrical power grids, financial systems and
the like _ will operate flawlessly.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Weinstock, a senior member of the technical staff at
Carnegie Mellon University who specializes in dependable systems,
warns, ``You cannot test reliability'' at ultra-high levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will get you are the rare events, and to test very rare
events, you need a lot of experience with the artifact,'' Weinstock
says. Testing an airplane's computer system, for example, ``would
require hundreds of thousands of hours of flying that plane,'' he
says, adding, ``By then, we'd all be dead _ from age, not from
fatal software.''
</P>
<P>
   To help upgrade computers that must operate without a hitch 24
hours a day _ the kind that failed the New York Stock Exchange last
week _ Carnegie Mellon is working on a program called Simplex, a
digital version of the medical profession's Hippocratic oath.
</P>
<P>
   While today a bug-ridden upgrade can crash even a ``dependable''
computer system, Weinstock says, with Simplex, ``if you put an
error in the new code, the guarantee is that it will perform no
worse than the original version.''
</P>
<P>
   But that kind of reliability is not a feature we should expect
anytime soon on our personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get a sense that there's a lot of testing going on
out there,'' says James Love, director of the Consumer Project for
Technology (www.cptech.org), a consumer advocacy organization.
``But once you realize that the company's major goal is to get you
to buy its products again and again, then the fact that they're
being shipped with bugs almost makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Love says that he no longer allows his children to install
software on his computer. ``The more programs you put on, the more
unstable it gets,'' he says. ``I don't know why they don't do
better testing, but it's dangerous to install a new software
program on your computer. It's like having sex with a stranger.''
</P>
<P>
   The same frustration plagues computer professionals. Dana Jones,
who works in technical services for a financial institution in San
Francisco, says he got a call last week from ``some yo-yo
conducting a focus group,'' asking about the future of computing
and what he thought would be ``the next thing.''

   ``I said, `God! I hope there's not a next thing,''' Jones
recalls. ``I wind up holding people's hands as they try to use this
swamp-gas technology _ the latest new application or whatever _
that just doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is also annoyed by the continually evolving technologies
for archiving data, an activity he likens to ``throwing dead cats
over a fence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came to this job, I had the latest technology _
44-megabyte Syquest drives,'' he said. ``That was the standard for
a year. Then came the 88-megabyte drives, then the 200. Then there
was the Zip drive, but then came the Jaz and now the Superjaz. What
if you have data on those old Syquests? How do you get it anywhere
_ and where do you put it?''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Brand, the industry pioneer and cultural icon who
founded the Well online service, bemoans ``the digital dark age
we've been entering for the past 30 years,'' where all our
information is being committed to ephemeral media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can read the technical correspondence from Galileo,'' says
Brand, who co-founded an organization called the Long Now
Foundation (www.longnow.org) to wrestle with the many issues around
this so-called digital dark age. ``But we have no way of finding
the technical correspondence'' of the digital era.
</P>
<P>
   Among the records already lost are data produced by early word
processors, graphics programs and satellites in the pioneering days
of the space program _ much of it stored on obsolete PDP-1
computers that have long since been retired.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of obsolete software code is magnified by computer
networks, Brand says.
</P>
<P>
   Old legacy systems _ what Brand calls ``the swamp gas of ancient
twisted Cobol programs'' _ have for several decades run banks and
many other critical systems, using date formats that recognize
years only in this century. That makes them especially vulnerable
to the much-debated year 2000 crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Even if some companies have fixed their own software's date
formats, ``they're all hooking up to each other, so they give each
other problems,'' Brand says. Thus networks create a much larger
problem, which he calls ``a potential global legacy system from
hell: No one's in charge of it. No one owns it. It's broken, it
can't be fixed, and we all depend on it for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand cites Jaron Lanier, a pioneer of virtual reality
technology who says the situation is creating ``karma vertigo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jaron says that the code we're writing today is in the process
of becoming so fundamental that we'll be stuck with it for a
thousand years,'' Brand says. ``And when you really take that
thought on, he says, you get vertigo.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand thinks that all these problems will be solved eventually.
</P>
<P>
   But he also adds, ``First you have to realize there is a
problem, and the attention span of the computer business doesn't
grasp beyond the upgrade path to Windows 2000.''

NEWSPAPER WAR ESCALATES IN TORONTO 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ When Conrad Black, one of the world's most powerful
media barons, decided to start a national daily newspaper in
Canada, he knew he had to do it in Toronto, the country's largest
city and one of the most competitive newspaper markets in North
America.
</P>
<P>
   But Toronto is already home to Canada's three largest
English-language daily newspapers. Long before The National Post
made its debut last Tuesday, the dailies had prepared for a
newspaper war by fortifying their staffs and adding sections.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe and Mail, Black's primary competition both in Toronto
and nationally, switched to color photographs and expanded its
sports section. To attract attention, all three existing dailies
ran sensational special reports, like the Toronto Sun's weeklong
series on the sexual habits of Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   If that was not enough, Torstar Corp., publisher of The Toronto
Star, Canada's largest newspaper, shook things up even more last
week with a $486 million (U.S.) hostile takeover bid for The
Toronto Sun and 14 other Canadian papers owned by Sun Media Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good old-fashioned newspaper war going on,'' John
Honderich, publisher of The Star, told reporters when the surprise
bid was announced a day after The National Post started publishing.
</P>
<P>
   Sun executives have pledged to fight the takeover. But if the
bid is successful, Torstar would become Canada's second-largest
newspaper chain, putting it in a better position to compete with
The National Post and Black's other papers for national
advertising. Black's companies, including Southam Inc., control
more than half of all Canadian newspapers and account for almost 42
percent of Canada's weekday newspaper circulation.
</P>
<P>
   In one more twist in this newspaper war, Sun Media had provided
Black with ammunition by selling The Financial Post last summer to
Southam, giving him an extensive business section, and a name, for
his national newspaper. In exchange, Black sold the Sun chain four
large dailies in southern Ontario that Torstar now covets.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's newspaper war will test the ability of Canada's
largest city to support four daily, general-interest,
English-language newspapers, something that few other cities in
North America can do. The National Post's goal is a weekday
circulation of about 300,000, with two-thirds outside the Toronto
market.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe and Mail, which considers itself a national paper, has
an audited weekday circulation of 309,000, two-thirds in the
province of Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Star, meanwhile, has a weekday circulation of
463,000, while The Toronto Sun has 238,000; both papers circulate
mainly in Toronto and surrounding Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   While the concept behind The National Post is similar to Gannett
Co.'s USA Today, the two papers share few similarities. With a
daily circulation of 2.2 million, Gannett's paper is most popular
with traveling businessmen who can read it on airplanes and in
hotels where they often get it free. Its articles are quick and to
the point.
</P>
<P>
   The National Post is aiming for ``slightly higher-brow readers
and slightly more sedentary readers,'' than USA Today, said Black,
who is hoping regular buyers will also continue to pick up one of
his local Canadian papers.
</P>
<P>
   Black, a Canadian, is chairman of Hollinger International. The
company and its subsidiaries own 111 daily newspapers from The
Chicago Sun-Times and The Jerusalem Post to 57 dailies in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The National Post's broadsheet format is lightened with color
photographs and line drawings of prominent columnists, some on the
front page.
</P>
<P>
   The new daily's appearance is similar to The Globe and Mail. But
while The Globe's style is formal and comfortably in the center of
the political center, what most sets apart the new daily is its
tone: clubby and confident, with a slight British affectation and a
strong conservative bent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, without presenting me as some raving maverick, you
should note that I do dissent from what I think has been the
consensus on key issues,'' said Black, who speaks out freely
against the ``shrieking leftists'' and ``weedy socialists'' he
blames for many of Canada's ills.
</P>
<P>
   Any doubts about the new paper's line disappeared with the first
issue. The lead article on the front page dealt with a western
provincial premier's hint of support for a ``unite the right''
movement to rebuild the Conservative Party.
</P>
<P>
   The editor in chief of The National Post, Kenneth Whyte, 38, has
a long association with Black and generally supports his ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The paper aims to be national in scope but not nationalistic in
its approach to news. The front page of the first issue carried a
large article on the American astronaut John Glenn, which drew
complaints that the paper was not Canadian enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We judge stories on the basis of whether they are interesting
or not,'' Whyte said, ``not on the basis of whether they are
Canadian.''
</P>
<P>
   Black expects operating losses of about $40 million (U.S.) over
four years before The National Post turns a profit, estimates that
some newspaper analysts find overly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Black made an unsuccessful attempt to buy The
Globe and Mail from Thompson Corp. Many people, including Vince
Carlin, chairman of the Journalism School at Ryerson Polytechnic
University in Toronto, say they believe he still wants to own the
paper. ``The endgame of all this competition is that The Globe ends
up having to sell or be merged,'' Carlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Black said he had wanted The Globe and Mail to give Southam a
presence in Toronto as well as to publish a national newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   With the introduction of The National Post, he said, ``those two
ambitions have now been fulfilled.''

FOX CABLE TV: KARATE FOR BOYS VS. BABY-SITTING FOR GIRLS? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)  (js) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Decades after the rise of feminism, America still has a few
dozen all-women colleges, hundreds of all-girls schools, the Girl
Scouts and scads of magazines, books, movies and toys made
especially for girls. Why not a television network?
</P>
<P>
   That is the question posed by Rich Cronin, the chief executive
of the Fox Family Channel, who announced last week that his company
plans to start two new cable networks _ the Boyz Channel and the
Girlz Channel _ next year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are parents, educators and other television executives
who find the idea upsetting, fearing it will push children at an
early age to label each other based on gender stereotypes. They
worry that a separate boys' channel will feature karate, lasers and
insults, while a girls' channel will be filled with sweet fare
about babysitting and best friends.
</P>
<P>
   And such stereotypes would be reinforced, they fear, in the
commercials, which would sell GI Joe and Space Invader toys on one
channel, and Barbie dolls and Playskool kitchens on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Such commercial targeting would seem imperative in the
fast-approaching era of digital television, when today's 70 or 80
channels will be able to multiply as much as fivefold. Almost every
network is developing specialized channels to attract certain kinds
of viewers who can be sold to advertisers as a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   The original cable concepts _ that ESPN would deliver young male
viewers to advertisers, for example, or that MTV would be a
can't-miss bet for reaching teen-agers _ are being extended into
tinier and tinier slices. Along with ESPN2 and ESPN News, there are
dozens of regional sports networks, a golf channel, an
outdoor-sports channel, and a plan in the works for a horse-sports
channel.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where children will have many channel choices, then,
why not one geared for boys and one for girls?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are clearly certain kinds of entertainment that boys
hate and girls love, and vice versa,'' Cronin said. ``I think it's
legitimate and positive to have something that recognizes the
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Cronin, one of nine children, said one of his sisters is an
airline pilot and another is an eye surgeon; he also has two
daughters, ages 7 and 12, and two sons, ages 4 and 9. ``So the last
thing I'd do is create a girlie-girl network on one hand and a
macho-boy network on the other hand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said, ``We won't go overboard and put a kick-boxing
show on the girls channel and a ballet show on the boys channel
just to show that we're not stereotyping.''
</P>
<P>
   Cronin said shows would be chosen based on what boys and girls
in focus groups said they wanted to watch, with child development
experts consulted to make sure the choices were appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   And he plans to show programs about parenting on both channels
after 9 p.m. most nights, believing that parents confront different
issues in raising boys and girls.
</P>
<P>
   While it may be true that boys enjoy some activities that girls
do not, and vice versa, the question of why that is so bothers
some.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it true because historically we have given girls one kind
of entertainment and boys another, and we've actually led them to
those kinds of differences?'' asked Alice Cahn, the former head of
children's programming for PBS, now an executive at Children's
Television Workshop, and a parent. ``My fear is that we'll get more
polarization of, `Boys like these things, girls like these things,'
and we won't make progress toward letting children grow into and
appreciate their own individualism.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheri Parks, a professor of American Studies at the University
of Maryland who studies how families use various media, said she
was worried about a more subtle message.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're making an inclusive argument, that this is for all
girls or for all boys,'' she said, ``the other half of that is,
this is not for girls or not for boys. What happens to the male
child who is interested in stuff on the girl's channel? What is the
message for him?''
</P>
<P>
   She suggested that defining a channel by an interest or topic
would be psychologically healthier. Viacom Inc.'s Nickelodeon, for
example, is developing a digital channel focused on games and
sports.
</P>
<P>
   The criticisms exasperate Cronin, who said he believes boys and
girls are ``wired differently,'' and sees nothing wrong with
celebrating that.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``If Gerry Laybourne had announced she was starting a girls'
channel, no one would question it,'' he said, referring to
Geraldine Laybourne, the architect of Nickelodeon, the dominant
children's network, and now the head of Oxygen, a company
developing a cable channel and new-media outlets for women.
``Everyone would say, `It's about time someone did something to
empower girls.' So when Rich Cronin says it, why isn't it the
same?''
</P>
<P>
   One answer is that Cronin's parent company, the News Corp. unit
Fox Kids Worldwide, headed by Haim Saban, has a reputation for
promoting boy-oriented action-adventure shows (like ``Mighty
Morphin Power Rangers'') on the Fox network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, you can tell a book by who's talking,'' said Peggy
Charren, the eminence grise of the movement for better-quality
children's programming. ``If it wasn't Fox, you could imagine some
great ideas coming out, but I start out with a deep distrust of Fox
and Saban. And the fact that the words are spelled wrong in the
names of the channels reinforces that.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Nielsen ratings this season, the Fox Kids Network's
audience is 71 percent boys. The next highest are UPN, a Viacom
broadcast network, at 63 percent, and Time Warner Inc.'s WB, at 61
percent. The audiences for Nickelodeon and ABC are divided about
evenly.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Laybourne _ whose 1991 hit show ``Clarissa Explains It All''
is credited with disproving the maxim that boys will not watch
shows starring or about girls _ reserved judgment about Cronin's
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all in the execution,'' she said. ``If it's done well, it
could be good. If it's done as `Boys like action, girls like
cuddly-cuddly' it will be disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cyma Zhargami, the Nickelodeon programming head, questioned
programming a channel primarily by what boys or girls say they
want.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids would watch `South Park' if you put it on for them,'' she
said, referring to the foul-mouthed cartoon that has become a hit
for Comedy Central. ``It's not just about putting on stuff kids
want. It's about doing it responsibly.''

`KING OF THE WORLD':THE FIGHT TO BECOME MUHAMMAD ALI 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes are at the end of review.) 
(js) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unquestionably the most exciting boxing match this reviewer ever
saw was the one between Muhammad Ali (then Cassius Marcellus Clay)
and Charles (Sonny) Liston on Feb. 25, 1964. Not that this fight
was so outstanding as far as the skills on display were concerned,
but the tension and hype building up to it were something else
again.
</P>
<P>
   These days, as David Remnick rightly points out in his
penetrating book ``King of the World: Muhammad Ali and the Rise of
an American Hero,'' ``boxing has become a marginal event in
American life.'' The wonder, then, is that he has managed to
re-evoke the heart-pounding emotion of that evening nearly 35 years
ago, when Clay against all odds and expectations decisively
outfought the man who was predicted to be his destroyer.
</P>
<P>
   Remnick, the recently appointed editor of The New Yorker,
accomplishes this feat in two complementary ways. First, he makes
the fight the climax of a morality play starring not two but three
principal actors. One was Liston, who was perceived in the racially
tense atmosphere of the 1960s as what Remnick calls ``the
Threatening Negro,'' a perception based on his brutal demeanor, his
criminal record and his known connection to the mob element in
boxing.
</P>
<P>
   The second player was Floyd Patterson, seen for his polite,
nervous manner as ``the Good Negro,'' whom Liston thrashed twice in
contests that many in the sports establishment said ought not to
have been permitted to take place because of Liston's unsavory
background. One exception was the newspaper columnist Murray
Kempton, whom Remnick quotes on the subject of Liston, ``He will
help us grow up further if he destroys the illusion that a man
whose trade it is to beat another man senseless for money
represents an image which at all costs must be kept pure for
American youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Then along came Cassius Clay, a man whom Remnick depicts as
being outside any conventional categories. As the child of modestly
better-off people, he felt relatively unoppressed. As a heavyweight
who danced on his toes and carried his fists at his waist, his
style was considered self-destructively unconventional. As a
braggart who wrote poetry predicting the rounds his opponents would
be knocked out in, he was seen as a frivolous showman. No one gave
him even Tweetybird's chance against the sledgehammer that was
Liston.
</P>
<P>
   But astonishingly he won in six rounds, with Liston refusing to
come out of his corner for the seventh. (``That wasn't the guy I
was supposed to fight,'' Liston said afterward. ``That guy could
hit.'') Then he further defied expectations by declaring his
allegiance to Elijah Muhammad's Nation of Islam and by refusing to
be drafted into the Army, saying, ``Man, I ain't got no quarrel
with them Vietcong.'' In every way he was something new and
original on the scene; those who were in favor of him loved him and
those who were against him loathed him.
</P>
<P>
   Another way in which Remnick animates his story is by going
behind the scenes and revealing details that even close followers
of his subject might not have known. How Ali calculatedly psyched
Liston by playing crazy and persuading him he was nothing but a
clown, even though at the start of their first fight he was in fact
afraid of Liston. (``That's the only time I was ever scared in the
ring,'' Ali said. ``Sonny Liston. First time. First round. Said he
was gonna kill me.'')
</P>
<P>
   Or how Liston, when he realized the trouble he was in, probably
told his main cornerman to ``juice the gloves'' with ``a
liniment-like oil of wintergreen, or ferric chloride, which was
used to seal cuts,'' which blinded Ali throughout most of the sixth
round, although he escaped being knocked out by groping for Liston
with one glove and dancing away.
</P>
<P>
   Or how in the rematch 15 months later, in Lewiston, Me., Ali
connected with a punch so difficult to see that many thought, as
the sportswriter Red Smith put it, that Liston had taken a dive
``that raised the level of the Androscoggin River by a foot.'' What
knocked Liston out, Remnick argues, was a combination of the
punch's force and Liston's overtraining to a point where he had
lost his edge.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion of Remnick's account seems a little truncated.
There is so much more to his subject's career than he tells in any
detail, particularly the three draining battles against Joe Frazier
and the rope-a-dope triumph over George Foreman in Kinshasa, Zaire.
But Remnick chooses to conclude with the match, in 1965, against
Patterson, which serves to close the circle of his morality play
and to punctuate the surpassing of the Good Negro by the liberated
black man, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this fight was an ugly, unnecessarily drawn-out
affair in which Ali displayed mainly cruelty in punishing someone
he saw as an ideological rival. It calls to mind a less pleasant
side of Ali's legacy unacknowledged by Remnick, the insufferable
strutting and chest-pounding so prevalent today in professional
football and basketball. ( Remnick fails to mention the fancy
footwork that became known as the Ali Shuffle, or that at the 1960
Olympic Games in Rome, the young boxer was warned that if he danced
unnecessarily in the ring he would be disqualified.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, by the end, ``King of the World'' accomplishes its
author's stated purpose of showing how Ali created himself in the
early 1960s, ``the way a gangly kid from Louisville managed to
become one of the most electric of American characters, a molder of
his age and a reflection of it.'' Somehow, in relatively little
space Remnick transforms the gangly kid into a beloved American. If
Ali wants to be remembered, in his own words, ``as a black man who
won the heavyweight title and who was humorous and who treated
everyone right,'' few will deny him on the basis of the record set
down here.
</P>
<P>
   It has been an amazing story, and Remnick captures the best of
it in ``King of the World.''

   NEW YORK _ Not far from the galleries displaying the Mark Rothko
show, a group of artists including Chuck Close and Philip
Pearlstein appeared at the Whitney Museum of American Art last
month to promote the new book ``A Visual Artist's Guide to Estate
Planning.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Rothko's work provoked the most protracted estate fight
in art-world history, the sponsors of the book described the
juxtaposition as coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we asked if we could use the Whitney, we didn't ask what
would be going on at the time,'' said Joyce Robinson, executive
director of the Marie Walsh Sharpe Art Foundation, the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   The book grew out of a small conference of artists, dealers,
lawyers, accountants and curators in April 1997. The Rothko case
turns up on page 116, where it is described as ``perhaps the most
well-known example of self dealing and breach of fiduciary
obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   To encourage wide distribution, the foundation (711 North Tejon,
Suite B, Colorado Springs, Colo. 80903) is charging $10 for the
book, shipping included.

 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Whitney Museum of American Art entertained a
crowd of 200 collectors and friends a few days before the official
opening of its Mark Rothko retrospective in September, Dr. Kate
Rothko, the artist's daughter, was one of the speakers. Trying to
avoid controversy, she only alluded to the convoluted battle over
her father's estate, a long-ago case of underhanded greed that
bared the inner workings of the supposedly genteel art world.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a friend later told her, someone criticized her for
resurrecting the past. ``There is a feeling in the art world,''
said Dr. Rothko, a pathologist who was 19 when her father committed
suicide in 1970, ``that this is something they'd rather forget.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not that easy. The Rothko case may be rarely mentioned
nowadays, but there is little doubt that it had a lasting effect.
For nearly a dozen years beginning in 1971, the art world and the
public were transfixed by the battle between Rothko's executors,
all of them his good friends, and his two children, who accused the
executors of waste and fraud, and by the ensuing appeals and
related litigation. As a result, many of Rothko's luminous Abstract
Expressionist paintings, which had been sold or consigned by his
estate to the Marlborough Gallery in Manhattan at deflated prices,
were donated to museums, probably enhancing their value.
</P>
<P>
   Rothko and his work became better known, further establishing
his reputation. Marlborough lost its pre-eminence in contemporary
art. Its flamboyant owner, Frank Lloyd, never recouped his
reputation, and neither did Theodoros Stamos, a painter Rothko
chose as an executor. Kate Rothko, who grew up in the middle of the
New York art scene, grew disillusioned with her father's world.
Even the public lost some innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rothko affair was a flashing red light to many that in
this field of high values and mysterious goings-on there's always a
potential for this kind of dealing,'' said Andre Emmerich, the
Manhattan dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, artists, dealers and museums have seen their
share of scandals, but few if any have approached the level of the
Rothko affair in size or notoriety. Day after day, newspapers
recounted courtroom testimony under headlines like ``Angry Exchange
in Rothko Case'' and ``New Rothko Charges Denied by Gallery.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Marlborough was stopped by a court ruling, it had sold
more than 100 paintings _ including a few that Rothko's children
now say they would have kept _ at less than market value to favored
clients while it collected inflated commissions as high as 50
percent, compared with the 30 percent usually charged for an artist
of his caliber. The executors, meanwhile, divided the estate's
proceeds from Marlborough as their fees.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately Dr. Rothko and her brother, Christopher, who was 6
when their father died at 67, were vindicated. In 1975, a New York
state court ousted the executors, canceled their sweetheart
contracts with Marlborough and fined them and the gallery $9.2
million.
</P>
<P>
   Later, while at his home in the Bahamas, Lloyd was indicted by
the Manhattan district attorney for tampering with evidence in the
case. He surrendered after years as a fugitive and was convicted on
three counts in 1983. He died on April 7.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Dr. Rothko, who runs a blood bank in
Washington, recalled that the case marked something of an
intellectual coming of age for her. ``I mainly remember my
disillusionment with the art world,'' she said. ``I hadn't thought
of it as a business world. I had grown up with an idealized view of
the art world.''
</P>
<P>
   Through their legal victory, she and Christopher, who had
directly inherited only a tenth of their father's paintings through
the estate of their mother (who also died in 1970), won possession
of half of the 2,000 works Rothko left behind. In the late 1970s
they were valued at $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rothko, 47, said the case continued to cause her pain.
Although she and her brother still own many of the paintings from
the estate, she said she was frustrated that some paintings were
sold by Marlborough before the ruling. Among those she says she
would have kept is ``Homage to Matisse,'' now owned by the Edward
R. Broida Trust. ``I haven't seen it since the time of my father's
death,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rothko is ``largely outside the art world now,'' she said.
She and her husband, Ilya Prizel, a professor of international
studies at Johns Hopkins University, see only a few people from
those times, like the artist William Scharf.
</P>
<P>
   Her three children, a boy, 17, and girls, 14 and 8, ``are just
finding out about this now,'' she said. ``I'm making them aware of
how difficult it was to get the paintings.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher, 35, is also detached from the art world. He is a
clinical psychologist who lives in Ann Arbor, Mich., and is married
with two toddlers. He remembers nothing about the courtroom drama,
he said, but added that it left him with ``a certain cautiousness
in dealing with the business world, the legal world and the
business side of the art world.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Rothkos are keen protectors of their father's legacy. They
disagree with people who say their father's work is mainly about
beauty, as well as with those who see specific religious references
in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up knowing that content was very important to him,''
Kate Rothko said. ``He did not consider the Color Field artists of
the '70s in any way an outgrowth of his work. He was stressing the
emotional content and a spiritual content in the broad sense.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the case also taught artists a worldly lesson. ``It
opened artists' eyes to the concept that this was a business, not
just an intellectual world,'' she said, ``and it probably affected
their estate planning.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   John Silberman, a lawyer who counts many artists among his
clients, agreed. ``The positive side of the Rothko case was to
heighten artists' sensibilities about the long-term care and
disposal of their estates,'' he said. ``Choosing the right people
is a constant issue.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rothko died, he left his works in the care of three
friends, all of whom have died: Morton Levine, an anthropology
professor; Stamos, a Greek-born Abstract Expressionist; and Bernard
Reis, an accountant and director of Marlborough.
</P>
<P>
   Reis drew up Rothko's will, bequeathing nearly all of his works
to the Mark Rothko Foundation, which was supposed to see that they
went to the right museums and collectors, with the proceeds put to
charitable or educational purposes. In late 1970, the trustees
changed its charter to make it focus on awarding grants to artists,
necessitating sales of Rothko's works and allowing the new
sweetheart deal with Marlborough.
</P>
<P>
   Levine depicted himself as a passive accomplice; he testified
that important details of the contract had been withheld from him.
Stamos was affiliated with Emmerich's gallery but had been offered
a more generous contract by Marlborough, and willingly joined the
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mystery was Bernard Reis,'' said Emmerich, who recently
sold his gallery to Sotheby's and is now semi-retired. ``He
delivered his great good friend Mark Rothko into the hands of Frank
Lloyd. He was seen as a wonderful man, yet he did something so
base, so inexplicable.''
</P>
<P>
   The trustees and Lloyd escaped with what were seen as light
sentences. Reis staved off creditors by filing for bankruptcy 11
months before his death. Stamos paid his share of the fine by
signing over his house to the Rothko estate, but he was granted
life tenancy.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd, who could have served up to four years in prison, was
ordered to create a scholarship fund and to sponsor art lectures
and gallery visits for New York City students. (No one contacted
could recall any details of the program or how long it lasted.)
</P>
<P>
   But Stamos never recovered as an artist. ``His market is weak,''
said Diane Upright, a private dealer in Manhattan. The Rothko case
was less to blame for Stamos' decline than ``a stand-back
assessment of his art,'' she said. ``His work is perceived as low,
second-tier or third-rank Abstract Expressionism.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, after the case, no gallery on Emmerich's level stepped
forward to represent Stamos, and that hurt. ``If he had been
handled by a better gallery, that would have given collectors a
greater sense of security,'' Ms. Upright said.
</P>
<P>
   Art dealers said that the biggest business effect was on
Marlborough, though they would not speak for attribution. ``It
didn't destroy the gallery, but it damaged it severely,'' said one.
``It was at that time the No. 1 gallery for contemporary art in New
York.'' Artists like Robert Motherwell and Adolf Gottlieb fled to
other dealers. Pace Gallery won the Rothko estate.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow art dealers also rejected Lloyd. Richard Feigen, a
Manhattan dealer, remembers a stormy meeting of the Art Dealers
Association of America. Afterward Marlborough resigned its
membership under pressure. Though it is now healthy, Marlborough
has never tried to return to the organization, the most important
dealers' group.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert Edelson, administrative vice president of the
association, maintains, however, that the case made no difference
in the trade because Lloyd was sui generis, a man who always played
by his own rules. ``Everybody talked about it then, but it was a
unique case, so I can't say it had any effect,'' Edelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps paradoxically, Rothko's status benefited from the
scandal, partly from the exposure. ``It didn't hurt his
reputation,'' Emmerich said. ``It's a little like van Gogh's ear.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, the Rothko Foundation, which was
reconstituted by the court and awarded the half of the estate his
children did not receive, made a crucial decision. It shed the idea
of supporting artists and donated the works to museums, 29 in the
United States and six in other countries. ``By having fewer works
on the market, that had a long-term effect,'' said Donald Blinken,
the investment banker who was made foundation president.
</P>
<P>
   Rothko's works are indeed selling well. Last November, the San
Francisco Museum of Modern Art paid a record auction price, $5.9
million, twice the pre-sale estimate, for ``No. 14, 1960,'' a work
in deep red and blue.

 CHARITY'S FILM DOCUMENTS RIDE ACROSS VIETNAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a steamy, windowless office at the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi in
the summer of 1997, a top media investment banker helped negotiate
a very different kind of deal.
</P>
<P>
   The banker, Peter Kiernan III, was with his fellow board members
from a nonprofit charity that sponsors events for disabled and
able-bodied athletes. They were seeking support for a bicycle ride
across Vietnam to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Paris
peace accord, which resulted in America's withdrawal from the
Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   An embassy aide had scoffed at the idea of a 1,200-mile bicycle
ride, warning that the roads were dangerous and that the riders
would never last a hundred miles. But Ambassador Peter Peterson, a
veteran, listened with interest as Kiernan began the group's pitch.
After 10 minutes he stopped him in mid-sentence. ``Do I have
anything on my schedule this afternoon?'' Kiernan said the
ambassador shouted to his secretary. `And do we have any beer back
there?''
</P>
<P>
   Kiernan and his colleagues received the ambassador's blessing
within the hour. So for 16 days last January, 65 cyclists,
including U.S. and Vietnamese veterans and others with disabilities
from the war, pedaled from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City, formerly
Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, several will be on hand for the New York
premiere of ``Vietnam: A Long Time Coming,'' a documentary film
about the ride, which was produced by Sports Illustrated Television
and the producers of ``Hoop Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   The film will have a limited release in theaters and is
scheduled to be broadcast on NBC on Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary is the most visible project yet for the charity,
World Team Sports, which sponsors events to show that people with
disabilities can achieve exceptional athletic feats. The group has
also sponsored a climb up Mount Kilimanjaro and a 13,700-mile
bicycle tour around the world.
</P>
<P>
   For Kiernan, who is involved with several other charities, the
bicycle ride across Vietnam has been his most involved work with
World Team, of which he has been a board member since 1993. He and
another board member, George Puskar, were chief proponents of the
ride.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges of organizing the Vietnam trip were very
different from those Kiernan, 44, faces at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.,
where he has been a partner since 1990. He has made a career out of
advising some of the most influential telecommunications executives
around, including Richard McGinn, chief executive of Lucent
Technologies when it went public, and Leo Hindery Jr., president of
Tele-Communications Inc. He was also active during the recent wave
of mergers in radio and television.
</P>
<P>
   Kiernan had not planned to be a banker. After earning an MBA
from the University of Virginia in 1977, he worked as a reporter
and editor for a brief stint. He joined Goldman, Sachs in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   His most vivid memory of the era is of his mother leading him
and his six brothers and sisters in prayer each night around the
dinner table in Albany, N.Y., asking for peace and a quick end to
the fighting. ``I was never emotionally engaged,'' he said. ``I
wasn't thinking about how the war hurt people.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was not until Kiernan spent a long evening three
years ago listening to a top executive describe his Vietnam
homecoming _ on a stretcher with a bullet in his leg _ that he gave
the idea much thought. ``He said college kids rushed up and poured
rotten vegetables on him,'' Kiernan said. ``They spat on him. He
was so ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   Memories of the war, still raw after more than two decades, made
January's trip to Vietnam fraught with emotions. ``In the beginning
no one trusted anyone,'' Kiernan said, noting that two
psychiatrists were on hand to soothe veterans' frayed nerves.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day, a former combat soldier sniped at a nurse
because she had not fought in battle. She shot back, ``We put you
back together when you were crying for your mothers,'' Kiernan
remembered her saying. ``And then at night we went to the villages
and took care of the children you shot up that day,'' the nurse
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kiernan said he and a founding board member, James Benson, chief
executive and president of New England Financial, were surprised by
the powerful feelings that emerged. ``We had a couple of days early
on where we thought, `What are we doing?''' Kiernan said. ``People
would sit around and talk about these atrocities. At times it was
almost like an encounter group.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, several American veterans refused to visit a
monument at the site of the My Lai massacre, where U.S. soldiers
killed Vietnamese civilians in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   But those tense moments were tempered by some of the eerie sites
encountered on the road. Not far from the demilitarized zone that
once separated North and South Vietnam, a velvety carpet of
wildflowers had sprouted on a hillside still scarred by the blasts
of enemy bombshells. ``It was oddly peaceful,'' he said. ``We just
sat in stunned silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in Vietnam, however, he could not ignore his day job.
Stephen Whisnant, World Team's executive director, said Kiernan
would borrow his cellular phone ``just for a minute.'' But two
hours later _ with the battery nearly dead _ it would find its way
back into Whisnant's hands. Often he found Kiernan at the top of a
hill overlooking acres of lush rice paddies because it was the only
place he could get clear reception.
</P>
<P>
   Other habits were hard to shake, too. Diana Nyad, a World Team
board member and athlete who swam from Cuba to Miami, said Kiernan
took a ribbing from his fellow riders for wearing a suit and tie at
dinner after a 100-mile ride. Plus, he was not above a bit of
frivolity. He and and a few teammates raced wheelchairs down a
hotel hallway the last night of their trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to wonder,'' Ms. Nyad said. ``Where did he put his
clothes? Even his jeans looked like they'd been sent out to the
cleaners.'' Kiernan smiled when asked about his attire, explaining
in painstaking detail how he folded his blazer to avoid crumpling.
And about his reputation as a partyer? ``Guilty as charged,'' he
said, laughing.

`BECKER': A DOCTOR WHOM ONLY A CADAVER COULD LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.)

 By RON WERTHEIMER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the start of the premiere episode of the new sitcom
``Becker,'' Ted Danson defines the cantankerous title character by
delivering the first of many diatribes. The subject of this first
harangue is the abysmal state of television programming: ``It's
like America stepped in something, and it's scraping off its shoe
directly over my TV set.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the best that can be said of ``Becker'': It's not THAT
repellent.
</P>
<P>
   The show, on CBS Monday night, offers Danson as an angry urban
doctor with a discouraging word on every subject, many of which
cannot be repeated here. (The network, which has already maligned
one New York borough with ``The King of Queens,'' says the series
is set in the Bronx, although the name is not uttered in Monday's
half-hour.)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Danson's character is supposed to be a voice of reason
in a world gone mad. Or maybe he's just a nasty jerk with a
stethoscope in his pocket. Does it matter? This is a so-called
comedy without one genuine laugh, although it does include a
7-year-boy who is HIV-positive. That gives the script, written by
the show's creator, Dave Hackel, a chance to show off the doctor's
heart of gold.
</P>
<P>
   Danson has fallen far from ``Cheers.'' His last series, ``Ink,''
was gone before it dried. Now, when he's not at the office yelling
at the zany patients, he's hanging out in a seedy luncheonette,
wiping off the counter with a succession of paper napkins while he
yells at the attractive young proprietor, Reggie (Terry Farrell),
who seems to like him in spite of his bitterness. When he shows up
to order dinner and Reggie is dressed up for a date (with a
dentist, yet), Becker seems angry or jealous or . . .
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute! Napkins. Waitress. Angry outbursts. Sick child.
Heart of gold. Did somebody say, ``As Good as It Gets''?
</P>
<P>

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the non-fiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To, and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Oct. 24,
1998, at almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000
other retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all
such outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of non-fiction can change from week to week,
reflecting changes in book buying.
</P>
<P>
   An (x) following a book's ranking indicates that a book's sales
are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A (b)
indicates that some bookstores report receiving bulk orders for a

   &UR; One Man's America: A Journalist's Search for the Heart of His
Country &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Henry Grunwald. Anchor/Doubleday, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   The former editor in chief of Time Inc. tells of how he arrived
here in 1940 as a 17-year-old Viennese refugee and worked his way
into the house that Henry Luce built, which gave him a terrific
vantage point on his adopted country. This memoir ``percolates with
anecdote, insight and charm,'' Robert W. Merry wrote here last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Complete Stories &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Bernard Malamud. Noonday/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $16.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these 55 tales focus on Jews of amazing variety,
laboring or wandering under the weight of conscience. Whether grim
dramas of workaday existence or ruminations on the meaning of love,
the best stories meld the allegorical and the everyday and brim
with ethical concerns, from the burdens of capitalism to the
enormity of the Holocaust. ``There must be many readers who will be
grateful to 'The Complete Stories' for prompting a return to
Malamud,'' Walter Goodman wrote in these pages in 1997. ```Is
morality a necessary part of fiction?' one of his characters asks.
The answer, in Malamud's revelatory work, remains a resounding
yes.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Adirondacks: A History of America's First Wilderness &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Paul Schneider. John Macrae/Owl/Holt, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   In recounting more than 300 years in the life of what is now the
6-million-acre Adirondack Park, the author argues that wilderness
is not only a human invention but a New York invention. This is ``a
thoroughly readable and entertaining tour'' of the preserve and the
Indians, trappers, redcoats, magnates and others who have passed
through, James Gorman said here last year.  &UR; Heart and Blood: Living
With Deer in America &LR; , by Richard Nelson (Vintage Departures, $14),
raises difficult questions about our complex relationship to deer
and wildlife in general, and tackles the troubling ethical and
ecological contradictions of hunting in the modern age. Last year
our reviewer, Robert Finch, called this ``a brave and beautifully
rendered work.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Mooring of Starting Out: The First Five Books of Poetry &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By John Ashbery. Ecco Press, $18.
</P>
<P>
   In his first five collections of poems (1956-72), the celebrated
author reveals his twin obsessions with self-evasion and
self-renewal, and his enthusiasm for complex poetic schemes and
other forms of lyricism. ``The elusiveness and mysterious promise
of his lines remind us that we always have a future and a condition
of meaningfulness to start out toward,'' Nicholas Jenkins wrote
here earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Book of Famous Iowans &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Douglas Bauer. Owl/Holt, $12.
</P>
<P>
   A middle-aged man tries to make sense of his mother's scandalous
affair when he was a boy in a small Iowa town, a betrayal that
continues to haunt him as an adult. Last year in the Book Review,
Douglas Unger called this a ``moving and lyrical'' novel that
``gracefully works its way back and forth in time.''

<P>
   &UR; Almost No Memory: Stories &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Lydia Davis. Ecco Press, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the characters in these inventive tales, the past is
disturbing, while the present is strange and vivid. Last year our
reviewer, Liam Callanan, said the author writes ``in compressed
prose that is frequently poetic and, without question, memorable.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Last Wish &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Betty Rollin. Public Affairs, $12.
</P>
<P>
   In this revised account of the author's personal encounter with
the assisted suicide issue, she describes what happened when her
terminally ill mother asked that she help her commit suicide in
1983. ``Rollin's loving portrait of her mother's life ... is as
compelling as the account of her death,'' Susan Jacoby said here in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Memoirs &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Sir Georg Solti. A Cappella, $15.95.
</P>
<P>
   The renowned conductor, who died last year at the age of 84,
looks back on an astonishing career driven by an irresistible
addiction to making music. The result is a ``zestful book by a man
whose motto was `Never Give Up' and whose appetite for work and
life comes across as genuinely inspiring,'' Paul Driver wrote here
in 1997.  &UR; Bernstein: A Biography &LR; , by Joan Peyser (Billboard,
$19.95), which was originally published three years before Leonard
Bernstein's death in 1990, has been revised and updated. In 1987
our reviewer, Leon Botstein, found the profile to be gossipy and
repetitious, but said ``Peyser has managed to convey the magnitude
and range of Mr. Bernstein's talent and achievements.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Vaporetto 13 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Robert Girardi. Delta, $11.95.
</P>
<P>
   An American banker in Venice becomes obsessed with a mysterious
young woman with a cool touch who will meet him only at night. Last
year our reviewer, Malachy Duffy, said this ``artful novel ...
invites us to put aside our rational skepticism and enter a world
where the past is still hauntingly present.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Matters of Chance &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Jeannette Haien. Harper Perennial, $13.
</P>
<P>
   The protagonist of this large novel is Morgan Shurtliff, a
wealthy Midwesterner whose character is tested during World War II
and after, when he returns to a changing country. ``Haien
charmingly takes us through more than three decades of one family's
pleasures and sorrows,'' Ruth Coughlin wrote here in 1997.

ADVERTISING: DECISION TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   October ended with tricks for some agencies and treats for
others, as advertisers made decisions on accounts with total
billings estimated at $210 million to $230 million.
</P>
<P>
   Two changes involved units of Leo Burnett Co. in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Hoechst Marion Roussel added Burnett to its agency roster by
naming the Leo Burnett USA unit to handle advertising aimed at
consumers for Allegra, a prescription antihistamine. Billings were
estimated at $45 million to $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   That assignment for Allegra, which is locked in a fierce battle
with the Claritin allergy drug brand marketed by Schering-Plough
Corp., had been handled since 1995 by Medicus International in New
York, a health care agency owned by MacManus Group.
</P>
<P>
   Medicus will continue handling advertising for Allegra aimed at
medical professionals, with billings estimated at $10 million to
$15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Gladman, a spokeswoman for Hoechst Marion, a unit of
Hoechst AG in Kansas City, Mo., described the change as ``a
business decision we felt was in the best interest of the brand.''
The decision came after an informal review, she added, in which the
other participants were not disclosed. Burnett, which has been
working to build up its list of health care accounts, has also
landed assignments from Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. and Searle &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   And Sara Lee Corp. selected the Starcom Media Services unit of
Burnett to handle consolidated media buying on its account, with
billings estimated at $100 million. Creative and media planning
assignments for the various Sara Lee brands continue unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The Sara Lee decision came after a review that included Starcom
and four agencies in New York: Mediacom, part of Grey Advertising;
Optimum Media, part of Omnicom Group, and the team of Ammirati
Puris Lintas and Western International Media, both owned by
Interpublic Group of Cos.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett has been on a winning streak lately after losing several
large, important assignments in 1996. Other recent gains include
accounts from Coca-Cola Co., Fila Holdings SpA, H.J. Heinz Co. and
Procter &AMP; Gamble Co.
</P>
<P>
   And two marketers named Minneapolis shops to handle their
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The first was Starbucks Coffee Co. in Seattle, which selected
the Minneapolis agency Fallon McElligott for its account, with
billings estimated at $5 million to $10 million. The previous
agency, the BBDO West unit of Omnicom in Los Angeles, had handled
the account for 13 months; BBDO West and Starbucks parted ways in
October.
</P>
<P>
   The Starbucks switch came without a review.
</P>
<P>
   The change had been expected since advertising trade
publications reported that Starbucks would leave BBDO West so the
account could follow David Lubars, creative director, who joined
Fallon McElligott from BBDO West in April.
</P>
<P>
   The second was Alberto-Culver Co. in Melrose Park, Ill., which
named the Minneapolis agency Campbell Mithun Esty to handle
creative responsibilities for its St. Ives Swiss Formula Hair and
Skin Care lines. Billings were estimated at $15 million to $20
million.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell Mithun, which is majority-owned by Interpublic, was
awarded the assignment without a review. It is the first creative
agency for the St. Ives lines since Alberto-Culver acquired the
maker of those brands, St. Ives Laboratories, in February 1996. The
media portion of the account is handled by Carat North America in
New York, part of Aegis Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Two account shifts, with combined billings estimated at $15
million, involved Citron Haligman Bedecarre in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The Good Guys Inc., a chain of consumer electronics and computer
stores based in Brisbane, Calif., consolidated its account at
Citron Haligman, which had previously handled only the creative
duties. Citron Haligman was given the media portion of the account,
which had been handled for five years by Publicis &AMP; Hal Riney in
San Francisco, part of Publicis SA.
</P>
<P>
   And Pocket Science Inc. in Santa Clara, Calif., chose Citron
Haligman to introduce Pocket Mail, a portable e-mail message
service. The naming of Citron Haligman as the first agency of
record came after a review in which the other participants were not
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Another change came as Canandaigua Wine Co. in Canandaigua,
N.Y., selected Partners &AMP; Shevack in New York to handle advertising
for its new Arbor Mist line of wine products, which had been
introduced with a campaign by Trone Advertising in Greensboro, N.C.
Billings were estimated at $6 million to $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Partners &AMP; Shevack, owned by Wolf Group, was awarded the
assignment without a review; a sibling shop, Wolf/Rochester,
handles other Canandaigua brands like Dunnewood and Estate Cellars.
Trone continues on the Canandaigua roster, handling such brands as
Paul Masson wines and brandy, Cook's champagne and Wild Irish Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Insure Now Direct in Valley Forge, Pa., an insurance company
that sells directly to consumers, named Doner Direct in Baltimore,
part of W.B. Doner &AMP; Co., as the first agency to handle its
account. Billings were estimated at $10 million. That decision also
came without a review. Insure Now Direct is owned by Peoples
Benefit Life and Health Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Bay Hotels and Resorts in Phoenix, a division of Patriot
American Hospitality Inc., named Tausche Henderson Drake in Atlanta
as the first agency to handle its account. Billings were estimated
at $5 million to $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Tausche Henderson, which had long been the agency for
Ritz-Carlton hotels, was awarded the account after a four-month
review that also included two agencies in New York: Grace &AMP;
Rothschild and Weiss Stagliano Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Shiseido Inc. in New York, the American unit of the Japanese
cosmetics giant Shiseido, named Number 17 in New York to handle
advertising for its 5S line of cosmetic and skin care products,
with billings estimated at $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The 5S account had been handled for 18 months by Badger
Worldwide in New York; that agency and Shiseido parted ways in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Number 17 was awarded the account after a review in which the
other participants were not disclosed. The assignment will focus on
marketing and creative campaigns related to the flagship store in
the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan. A campaign is expected to begin
early this month.
</P>
<P>
   And Michael Foods Inc., a diversified food processor and
distributor in Minneapolis, named Clarity Coverdale Fury in
Minneapolis to handle advertising for its food service division,
which had been handled by Carmichael Lynch in Minneapolis, an
Interpublic agency. Billings were estimated at $2 million.

THE DECLINE OF THE URBAN NEWSPAPER COLUMN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Mass., N.Y., Calif., Md., Fla.)  (mk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A newspaper column about newspaper columnists is not simply a
self-referential exercise. It is an almost inevitable act of
reverence, done when a notable columnist dies or retires or even
quits under fire. The death in 1997 of Mike Royko of The Chicago
Tribune and the recent disgrace of Mike Barnicle of The Boston
Globe _ who made his final farewell on The Globe's Op-Ed page last
week _ created an almost Pavlovian response, sending journalists
scurrying back to the collected works of New York's Damon Runyon or
Baltimore's H.L. Mencken.
</P>
<P>
   The urge is to say that urban columnists aren't as important as
they used to be. Clearly, the big names that resonate around the
country are fewer. Those who mourn bygone days and columnists,
however, are missing the point. What has changed is not so much the
urban column but the way the city and the world have changed around
it.
</P>
<P>
   William Randolph Hearst was running The New York American and
World War I hadn't happened yet when Runyon began writing and
hanging out on Broadway with the people who were the prototypes for
the likes of Sky Masterson. John Glenn was still in astronaut
training when Jimmy Breslin was shooting the breeze under the El on
Jamaica Avenue with the bookie his readers knew as Fat Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Nostalgia for those days has its appeal. For Jimmy Breslin
``there was something to do with the smoke and the noise of
typewriters in a city room at a deadline that produced the nervous
energy that must go into the words of a newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the reporters have two and three college degrees,'' he
said. ``We had high school guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The new generation of journalists, he says, are ``far better
educated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're much better about living,'' he said. ``And they don't
drink. And they don't smoke. And they're probably the most boring
group of people I've ever heard of. The writing has as much
personality as the carpet on the health club floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it isn't all baby carrots and treadmills to blame for the
declining clout of the urban column. Even if newsrooms were still
populated with cigar-smoking guys with flasks in their desk
drawers, the readers they reflect are a declining portion of the
overall circulation. Jimmy Breslin's column in Newsday is still
unique in its Breslin-esque style but its readers are largely
suburban. Many of today's authentic voices have migrated to talk
radio and the cable channels, where they yell at each other
authentically.
</P>
<P>
   The urban column, like newspapers, flourished when the city was
king. A class consciousness that would have pleased Marx filled
workers, immigrant and otherwise, with pride and resentment. The
best columnists heard the music of those feelings and gave it back
with perfect pitch.
</P>
<P>
   It was that tradition that Mike Barnicle invoked last Thursday
when, after lengthy negotiations, his farewell column was published
in The Globe, which is owned by The New York Times Co. He tried to
explain how he produced his column over the years and why he
presented second- and third-hand tales as fact. The tradition
Barnicle invoked _ if not necessarily the technique _ went back to
Chicago in the late 19th century, and continued through Ben Hecht
to Jimmy Breslin and Mike Royko. All its practitioners tied
themselves to a particular physical and emotional geography, with
the aid of stock characters like Breslin's Fat Thomas or Royko's
Slats Grobnik.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the 1970s and 1980s, storytelling techniques began to
migrate to the front page, and urban affairs columns became staples
on the Op-Ed pages. The franchise of the urban columnist changed.
Voice, even more than before, was everything. And there are still
plenty of distinctive voices in cities from coast to coast. But it
is much harder for them to be heard in today's media.
</P>
<P>
   ``What separates the excellent columnist from the so-so
columnist is the refraction of events through a constant
personality that's interesting,'' said John Carroll, editor of The
Baltimore Sun. Herb Caen, the late columnist of The San Francisco
Chronicle, ``did as much to define San Francisco as anyone,''
Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe one of the reasons this form doesn't seem as vital now
as it did then,'' he added, ``is that communities aren't as
cohesive, everything's fragmented, nobody can speak for as many
people.'' Many newspapers now use a constituent approach, with
urban columnists of different backgrounds. And Carroll believes
that the tradition, in these new hands, is very much alive.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best columnists, like the Miami Herald humorist Dave
Barry, find a sense of place in a generic supermarket line, not the
old urban neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   As for a sense of grievance _ well, columnists themselves are a
class these days. Witness this passage from an August column by
Barry, written when the whole business was worried about columnists
and accuracy. ``My statement was that Gleem toothpaste used to have
an ingredient called Gardol, which created an Invisible Protective
Shield that deflected baseballs,'' he wrote. ``This is simply not
true. It was actually COLGATE toothpaste that had Gardol.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I'm thinking maybe Gleem had that obnoxious little
tooth who was always getting tied to the railroad tracks by Mister
Tooth Decay. But I don't want to speculate on this until I have all
the facts.''

 &HT;    WITH ELECTION DAY NEARING CLINTON COURTS AFRICAN AMERICAN VOTERS
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ President Clinton, quoting the Bible with the same
ease as public policy briefs, mixed politics and religion from the
pulpit of a predominantly black church Sunday with a
Scripture-laden get-out-the-vote plea to his most loyal supporters.
</P>
<P>
   With Maryland's top political leaders in tow along with NAACP
President Kwesi Mfume, Clinton said Tuesday's election is about the
biblical commandment to ``love thy neighbor'' and about a ``march
to dignity'' that began in the 1950s with Rosa Parks, a black
seamstress, refusing to move to the back of a racially segregated
bus in Montgomery, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   The president's appearance at the New Psalms Baptist Church, one
Baltimore's oldest and largest black congregations, marked the
culmination of a massive effort by the Democratic Party to motivate
their most faithful followers in order to offset the Republican
Party's advantage in money for TV advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our politics should be guided by what our Lord said was the
first and most important commandment...,'' the president said to
thunderous applause that occassionally shook the balcony of the
6,000-member church. ``First, we must try to love the Lord our God
with all our heart ... and love thy neighbor as thyself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuesday is about whether we'll have a patients bill of rights,
whether we'll have good schools for all our children, whether we'll
raise the minimum wage, whether we'll save Social Security for the
21st century,'' he added. ``But in a larger sense, it's about that
march to dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   From North Carolina to California, the Democratic Party is using
as much of its on-the-ground machinery to reach the country's 14.3
million registered African American voters, an overwhelming
majority of whom not only are Democrats but are unwavering in their
support for the president in the face of possible impeachment by
the Republican-led Congress.
</P>
<P>
   With voter turnout Tuesday expected to be low, as it usually is
in non-presidential elections, both parties are targeting their
core supporters. But no group is as dependable as African Americans
in their support of a political party. In every presidential
election since 1964, no fewer than seven out of 10 blacks have
voted Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   The turnout of African Americans fluctuates significantly,
however. It climbed to 43.2 percent in 1986, the year the
Democratic Party regained control of the Senate. But it dropped to
37.0 percent in 1994, the year the Republican Party ended 40 years
of Democratic rule of the House.
</P>
<P>
   And this year, there has been ``only modest interest'' among
African Americans in the upcoming election, said David Bositis, the
chief researcher at the Joint Center for Political and Economic
Studies, a research organization specializing in issues of
importance to blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the Democratic Party has been unusually ambitious
in its efforts to reach African American voters. On Saturday, for
example, the Congressional Black Caucus wrapped up a three-day
get-out-the-vote bus tour of a half dozen cities in Kentucky, Ohio,
Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the party has been running last-minute ads on
African American media featuring first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. And following his church appearance
Sunday, the president taped a lengthy interview to be broadcast
election eve on the Black Entertainment Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is all about turnout,'' Democratic National
Committee Chairman Steve Grossman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are all 435 seats in the House of Representatives, 34
seats in the Senate and 36 governorships. However, no more than
one-tenth of the House races are considered competitive, and few
experts predict a major shift in the balance of power in Washington
following Tuesday's balloting.
</P>
<P>
   A better-than-expected showing by the Democrats would not only
slow the GOP's drive toward impeachment but enhance the president's
bargaining power in upcoming battles over Social Security,
education and health care, according to party strategists.
</P>
<P>
   Although Democrats have trailed Republicans in polls much of the
fall, on Tuesday ``everything gets evened up again, if you show
up,'' Clinton told his audience at the New Psalms Baptist Church.
``On Tuesday, you're in control of the arithmetic again.''
</P>
<P>
   He included a reminder of the predominantly white religious
conservatives who will ``vote only for people at the extreme right
wing of the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Lashing out at the Republican Congress for opposing his efforts
to regulate tobacco, modernize schools, raise the minimum wage and
reform Social Security, Clinton said, ``They think most people
won't vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The church's minister, the Rev. Walter Thomas, preceded Clinton
in the pulpit with an electrifying sermon that brought the
president to the verge of tears. While he did not mention Clinton
by name, Thomas urged those with ``damaged glory'' to ``fight their
way out'' of the dilemmas.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking the image of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther
King Jr., Thomas urged his congregation to ``keep the leaders who
share our values'' and blamed ``organized evil'' for the
dismantling of affirmative action and the growing gap between rich
and poor.

 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ President Clinton, quoting the Bible with the same
ease as public policy briefs, mixed politics and religion from the
pulpit of a predominantly black church Sunday with a
Scripture-laden get-out-the-vote plea to his most loyal supporters.
</P>
<P>
   With Maryland's top political leaders in tow along with NAACP
President Kwesi Mfume, Clinton said Tuesday's election is about the
biblical commandment to ``love thy neighbor'' and about a ``march
to dignity'' that began in the 1950s with Rosa Parks, a black
seamstress, refusing to move to the back of a racially segregated
bus in Montgomery, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   The president's appearance at the New Psalms Baptist Church, one
Baltimore's oldest and largest black congregations, marked the
culmination of a massive effort by the Democratic Party to motivate
their most faithful followers in order to offset the Republican
Party's advantage in money for TV advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our politics should be guided by what our Lord said was the
first and most important commandment...,'' the president said to
thunderous applause that occassionally shook the balcony of the
6,000-member church. ``First, we must try to love the Lord our God
with all our heart ... and love thy neighbor as thyself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuesday is about whether we'll have a patients bill of rights,
whether we'll have good schools for all our children, whether we'll
raise the minimum wage, whether we'll save Social Security for the
21st century,'' he added. ``But in a larger sense, it's about that
march to dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   From North Carolina to California, the Democratic Party is using
as much of its on-the-ground machinery to reach the country's 14.3
million registered African American voters, an overwhelming
majority of whom not only are Democrats but are unwavering in their
support for the president in the face of possible impeachment by
the Republican-led Congress.
</P>
<P>
   With voter turnout Tuesday expected to be low, as it usually is
in non-presidential elections, both parties are targeting their
core supporters. But no group is as dependable as African Americans
in their support of a political party. In every presidential
election since 1964, no fewer than seven out of 10 blacks have
voted Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   The turnout of African Americans fluctuates significantly,
however. It climbed to 43.2 percent in 1986, the year the
Democratic Party regained control of the Senate. But it dropped to
37.0 percent in 1994, the year the Republican Party ended 40 years
of Democratic rule of the House.
</P>
<P>
   And this year, there has been ``only modest interest'' among
African Americans in the upcoming election, said David Bositis, the
chief researcher at the Joint Center for Political and Economic
Studies, a research organization specializing in issues of
importance to blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the Democratic Party has been unusually ambitious
in its efforts to reach African American voters. On Saturday, for
example, the Congressional Black Caucus wrapped up a three-day
get-out-the-vote bus tour of a half dozen cities in Kentucky, Ohio,
Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the party has been running last-minute ads on
African American media featuring first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. And following his church appearance
Sunday, the president taped a lengthy interview to be broadcast
election eve on the Black Entertainment Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is all about turnout,'' Democratic National
Committee Chairman Steve Grossman said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are all 435 seats in the House of Representatives, 34
seats in the Senate and 36 governorships. However, no more than
one-tenth of the House races are considered competitive, and few
experts predict a major shift in the balance of power in Washington
following Tuesday's balloting.
</P>
<P>
   A better-than-expected showing by the Democrats would not only
slow the GOP's drive toward impeachment but enhance the president's
bargaining power in upcoming battles over Social Security,
education and health care, according to party strategists.
</P>
<P>
   Although Democrats have trailed Republicans in polls much of the
fall, on Tuesday ``everything gets evened up again, if you show
up,'' Clinton told his audience at the New Psalms Baptist Church.
``On Tuesday, you're in control of the arithmetic again.''
</P>
<P>
   He included a reminder of the predominantly white religious
conservatives who will ``vote only for people at the extreme right
wing of the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Lashing out at the Republican Congress for opposing his efforts
to regulate tobacco, modernize schools, raise the minimum wage and
reform Social Security, Clinton said, ``They think most people
won't vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The church's minister, the Rev. Walter Thomas, preceded Clinton
in the pulpit with an electrifying sermon that brought the
president to the verge of tears. While he did not mention Clinton
by name, Thomas urged those with ``damaged glory'' to ``fight their
way out'' of the dilemmas.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking the image of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther
King Jr., Thomas urged his congregation to ``keep the leaders who
share our values'' and blamed ``organized evil'' for the
dismantling of affirmative action and the growing gap between rich
and poor.

DELL BEATS COMPAQ IN BUSINESS MARKET  
 CABLE GETS EVEN MORE CONFUSING  
 UNUSUAL SUPPORT FOR QUITTING SMOKING  
 LIFETIME DEAL SHORT-LIVED

   Market research figures released last week showed that Dell
Computer Corp. has pulled ahead of its archrival, Compaq Computer
Corp., in America's business computer market. Dell's 18.9 percent
share in the third quarter edged out Compaq's 18.4 percent. Though
that may look like a measly spread, it is huge for Dell, which has
been coming in second for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two companies have been battling for some time,'' said
Aaron Goldberg, executive vice president of Ziff-Davis Market
Intelligence, based in La Jolla, Calif. ``Every punch has always
met with a counterpunch.''
</P>
<P>
   In the consumer market, it is a different story. There, Goldberg
says, Compaq remains king. IDC, another market researcher, released
figures last week showing Compaq still holding a firm lead in the
overall market for personal computer shipments, with 15.8 percent
in the third quarter, compared with Dell's 14.1 percent. But in the
business sector, Dell's direct sales approach, along with its high
satisfaction rating, has found a niche with corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Dell and Compaq were not the only companies to swap places on
Goldberg's list. IBM, which had the third-largest share of the
nation's business computer market in the second quarter, fell to
fourth place in the third quarter, edged out by another direct
marketer, Gateway Inc.

   Motorola Organizes Cable Modem Conference
</P>
<P>
   If you thought the cable industry was confusing enough already,
hold on to your remotes. Sometime early next year, an assortment of
companies will start hawking data cable services and technology at
your local consumer electronics store, a move sure to stir things
up.
</P>
<P>
   To help move the process along _ and, presumably, to influence
its direction _ Motorola Inc., the current leader in cable modem
sales through cable companies, has invited just about everyone in
the industry to come chat it up at a first-of-its-kind conference
in Chicago next week. Called ``Retail Forum '98: Cable Modems Go
Retail,'' the industrywide gathering will include cable operators,
cable modem makers, retailers, computer companies and anybody else
who has a stake in high-speed data access. Featured speakers will
include Richard Sharp, chief executive of Circuit City Stores Inc.,
and Richard Borinstein, senior vice president of Radio Shack, a
unit of Tandy Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Cable modems are capable of transmitting data to home computers
at 50 to 100 times the rate of today's conventional modem
technology. Eventually, some analysts say, cable modems will be
ubiquitous and as cheap as modems today, someday even becoming a
standard item included in a home PC. But when the first cable
modems hit store shelves next year, they will be pricey, at
anywhere from $200 to $350.
</P>
<P>
   Cable modem makers like Motorola face a particular challenge as
they make the transition from selling only through cable companies
to selling to retail shoppers. Today, customers lease a cable modem
from their cable company, much as they would a cable transmitter,
and then pay roughly $40 a month for data services.
</P>
<P>
   Although Motorola has a huge lead today in sales through cable
companies, the competition is already fierce, with the likes of
Northern Telecom Ltd., 3Com Corp. and others set to enter the
retail market shortly. Dick Day, a corporate vice president and
general manager in Motorola's Multimedia group, insisted that
Motorola called the meeting not to promote its own agenda but to
insure that the nascent market gets off the ground without any
hitches.

   Cigarette Maker Gives Web Lesson in Quitting
</P>
<P>
   It's not often that a tobacco company tries to teach people how
to quit smoking. Still, Brown &AMP; Williamson, a unit of British
American Tobacco PLC, which makes Kool cigarettes and other brands,
has a section called ``Quitting Smoking'' on its Web site
(www.brownandwilliamson.com) alongside information on matters like
organizing your community to prevent smoking bans.
</P>
<P>
   The item went on the Web in May, and has received 150 to 200
visitors a month, the company said. ``We wanted to help people who
want to quit,'' said Sharon Boyse, director of scientific
communications at Brown &AMP; Williamson. ``That may sound unlikely,
but no manufacturer wants people to be in the position of using the
product if they don't want to.''
</P>
<P>
   The information, which Ms. Boyse said was culled from other Web
sites, including the American Cancer Society's, as well as academic
studies, notes that readers may have been ``persuaded by the media
that you're now an addict and that therefore, quitting is
impossible.'' It points out that 45 million people have quit. It
lists techniques, from drugs to hypnosis, that may be helpful,
adding, ``Many failures are the result of a less-than-100-percent
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   But one expert said he found the information troubling. ``They
are mixing up a concept known as self-efficacy with the statement
that you need to be totally, 100 percent committed and convinced
you can do this,'' said Dr. Michael Fiore, director of the Center
for Tobacco Research and Intervention at the University of
Wisconsin's medical school. ``And the reality is that most American
smokers lack such confidence.'' Of the millions of smokers who try
to quit every year, he said, only 5 percent succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Fiore led the government panel that held hearings and issued
guidelines on the most effective means of quitting smoking. He said
he was also concerned about the Web site's discussion of smoking as
a habit, not an addiction. ``Everyone other than the tobacco
industry,'' he said, ``has recognized that this is a powerfully
addictive drug.''

   Lifetime Internet Access Faces Premature End
</P>
<P>
   Just how long is a lifetime on the Internet? About 21 months, if
you ask Bigger.net. In early 1997, the San Jose, Calif., Internet
service provider promised unlimited lifetime Internet access for a
one-time fee of $59, plus another $10 for a lifetime e-mail
account. Nearly 20,000 people believed it, hoping to rid themselves
forever of those pesky $19.95-a-month access fees.
</P>
<P>
   But as it turns out, the company did not have the technology, or
the management, to succeed. Last week, company executives filed for
bankruptcy. But at the last minute, a buyer appeared:
Brigadoon.com, an Internet service provider in Bellevue, Wash.,
paid an undisclosed sum for the company's assets.

FORMER ESQUIRE EDITOR MAY MOVE TO DAILY NEWS  
 A WAR PHOTOGRAPH LEADS TO FALSE TRAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., N.Y.)  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Edward Kosner, the former editor of Esquire magazine,
has been negotiating with Mortimer Zuckerman, the owner of The New
York Daily News, to become the editor in charge of revitalizing The
Daily News' Sunday newspaper, according to people with knowledge of
the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Zuckerman said he would not comment on the hiring practices of
The Daily News. The editorial director, Harold Evans, did not
return a telephone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   The position of Sunday editor, currently held by Bill Boyle,
could be a pivotal one at The Daily News: Sunday circulation
slipped to 831,824 in September 1997 from 979,030 in September
1995, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. In April 1996,
The News' chief competitor, The New York Post, threw its hat into
the ring with its own Sunday edition. The Daily News costs $1 on
Sundays; The New York Post's Sunday edition costs 50 cents in
Manhattan and 35 cents in Brooklyn and Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Kosner's arrival at The Daily News _ if he comes under the terms
being discussed _ would lead to an erosion of power for the paper's
editor, Debbie Krenek, who now has responsibility for the Sunday
edition. In the spirit of The Sunday Times of London _ a paper
edited by Evans until 1981 _ Kosner, 61, would supervise a separate
Sunday staff. Another high-level position would be found for Boyle.
Kosner's negotiations were reported in The New York Post last week.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday was Ms. Krenek's first anniversary as editor, and
people with knowledge of the negotiations said she would be happier
promoting someone from within the organization. Ms. Krenek did not
return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   But why Kosner? His most recent editorial performance is
considered uneven at best. He left Esquire in May 1997 after he was
unable to halt declines in the magazine's circulation and
advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the year of his arrival at Esquire, the magazine sold
an average of 739,828 copies of each issue; that figure had fallen
to 672,073 by 1997, the year of his departure. Ad pages fell to 597
from 747 during the same period, while ad pages rose for the
magazine's principal rivals.
</P>
<P>
   But Kosner has been praised for his stewardship of New York
magazine, which he edited from 1980 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Kosner would not comment for the record except to offer this
salient, if cryptic, morsel: his dog, a mixed breed, is named
Sunday.

   A War Photograph Leads to False Trail
</P>
<P>
   For three decades, a Vietnam War photograph taken by Frank
Johnston had been a famous image of a nameless man. But in July,
The Washington Post published 15,000 words about an ex-Marine's
search for his dead brother's war. It was built around the belief
of the man, Rob Sutter of Atlanta, that Johnston's image showed his
brother, Richard.
</P>
<P>
   It did not. As The Post disclosed in a front-page article
Tuesday, the photograph showed Mike Tripp, now an accountant from
Providence, R.I. He had been part of a helicopter crew shot down
near a church where Johnston and a Marine unit were under siege.
</P>
<P>
   There was never any proof that Richard Sutter was in the church
then, although former comrades said it was possible he had found
his way there. Richard Sutter was killed in an enemy ambush some
weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Sutter recently got in touch with Johnston, who was a combat
photographer for United Press International. Looking at pictures of
Richard Sutter, Johnston had no reason to doubt the brother's
identification. The articles by Phil McCombs, who had covered
Vietnam as an Army journalist, included one caveat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also remotely possible,'' McCombs wrote, ``that the
picture is not of Richard at all, but of some other Marine _ though
this hardly seems likely, given that the photographer, the family
and photographic specialists who have compared the picture with
others of Richard are convinced that it is indeed him.''
</P>
<P>
   This month, Tripp saw the photo in a Newsweek advertisement for
a Learning Channel series on the war. He called the channel, and
found Johnston. Johnston became convinced of Tripp's claim, as did
Rob Sutter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anguish over identifications all the time,'' Johnston said.
``The thing that always haunted me was I never knew the man's name.
Not really. There was no talk in that church. There was nothing but
what was going on around us. Men were dying in that church. There
wasn't time to sit around and ask who you were and where you were
from.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston quoted Tripp's view of the situation: ``It's not just
me in the picture. It's every Marine who served or died in
Vietnam.''

ANTITRUST CASE IS HIGHLIGHTING ROLE OF E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The outcome of the Microsoft antitrust case may be a long way
off, but one thing is already clear: This is the first major e-mail
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The government's prosecution and Microsoft Corp.'s defense, to a
striking degree, are legal campaigns waged with electronic
messages. The human testimony often pales next to the e-mail
evidence. On the stand or in videotaped testimony, the people being
questioned shrug, mumble and forget. The e-mail is alive with ideas
and competitive zeal, punctuated with profanity and exclamation
points.
</P>
<P>
   The second week of the trial ended with the prosecutors being
frustrated because a lengthy cross-examination by Microsoft's lead
lawyer left no time for the government to show several hours of a
videotaped deposition of Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman. With a
new witness, an executive of Apple Computer Inc., taking the stand
Monday, it is uncertain when the Gates tape will be played.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and the 20 states suing Microsoft believe
that the tape will strengthen their case because it shows Gates
saying he was not involved in plans to take what the government
alleges were illegal steps to stifle competition in the Internet
software market. The Gates videotape, said David Boies, the Justice
Department's trial lawyer, offers an ``opportunity to judge Gates'
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Gates credibility gap, if there is one, becomes an issue
not because of the videotape but because his taped remarks can be
compared and contrasted with the e-mail he wrote and received. The
e-mail record, the government insists, shows Gates waist-deep in
plotting the anti-competitive deals and bullying tactics that he
denies or professes to have never heard of in his taped deposition.
</P>
<P>
   If his machinations are central to the government's case, why
not summon Gates to the trial? ``The government does not need to
put Gates on the stand, because we have his e-mail and memoranda,''
Stephen Houck, a lawyer for the states, told the court.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft legal team has for months been preparing its
e-mail defense. First, Microsoft argues, anything that looks
damaging is taken out of context. ``I urge your honor,'' John
Warden, Microsoft's lead lawyer, told Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson, ``to view with considerable skepticism the crazy quilt of
e-mail fragments that seem to form the core of the government's
case.''
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft has also mounted an e-mail counterattack, culled
from the millions of messages it obtained by subpoena from
competitors in pretrial discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Warden's cross-examination ritual is to present a government
witness with an internal e-mail from his company and then pose a
declaration as a question. These interrogations have two refrains:
Isn't it true your company does exactly what you are accusing
Microsoft of doing, and isn't it true that Microsoft prevailed not
because it is a predatory monopolist but because of its superior
technology?
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is accused of trying to prod companies to stay out of
its way. So last week, for example, Warden produced e-mail from
Stephen Case, the chairman of America Online, suggesting a
partnership with Netscape Communications Corp. in which both
companies would focus on their respective strengths.
</P>
<P>
   That division of labor, Case wrote, would be the best way to
achieve the goal that Marc Andreessen, Netscape's cofounder,
described in an earlier e-mail as beating ``the Beast From Redmond
that wants to see us both dead'' _ a reference to Microsoft's
headquarters in Redmond, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Printouts of e-mail are just another form of written
communication. By the 1920s, as typewriters became common, typed
memoranda started to be used in court cases. From the 1950s through
the 1980s, legal experts say, there was an explosion of
documentation fueled by the new technologies of electric
typewriters, photocopying and fax machines, and then personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   And e-mail, they add, has played an important role in legal
inquiries for years, like the Iran-contra case in the 1980s when
e-mail found in Oliver North's computer proved crucial.
</P>
<P>
   But the Microsoft case is the result of a sweeping government
antitrust investigation of a high-technology company where e-mail
has supplanted the telephone as the most common instrument of
communication. ``E-mail has just revolutionized investigations of
this kind,'' one senior Justice Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   While under investigation, Microsoft has handed over to the
government an estimated 30 million documents, mostly e-mail. In the
trial, the two sides have submitted about 3,000 exhibits, mainly
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   And in their e-mail, people often communicate more frankly and
informally than when writing a letter or a report _ tap it out,
punch a button and it's gone into cyberspace. But e-mail
communication is documentary evidence, which in legal cases
provides a rich, contemporaneous record of what people were
thinking and planning at the time.
</P>
<P>
   It can be a sharp contrast to formal oral testimony, so often
coached by lawyers and crafted by selective memory. ``The e-mail
record certainly makes the I-don't-recall line of response harder
to sustain,'' said Robert Litan, a former senior official in the
Justice Department's antitrust division who is now at the Brookings
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   It can also be powerful ammunition for pointing to
contradictions in testimony. And that is what the government will
do in attacking Gates' credibility with his videotaped deposition,
taken over three days in August.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The government offered a glimpse of that strategy on the first
day of the trial. It showed a few brief clips of a point in the
deposition when Gates was asked about a meeting on June 21, 1995,
at which, the government alleges, Microsoft offered to divide the
browser market with Netscape and to make an investment in the
company, which is its chief rival in that market.
</P>
<P>
   In the taped deposition, Gates says he recalled being asked by
one of his subordinates whether he thought it made sense to invest
in Netscape. He said that he was asked about it after the June 1995
meeting and replied, ``I didn't see that as something that made
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an e-mail on May 31, 1995, Gates urged an alliance with
Netscape. ``We could even pay them money as part of the deal,'' he
wrote, ``buying a piece of them or something.''
</P>
<P>
   The contradiction between Gates' deposition and his e-mail,
though, does not of itself speak to the issue of whether Microsoft
made an illegal offer to Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it is what Microsoft did _ not what it said in
e-mail communications _ that counts most. ``But once the e-mail
that looks bad gets in the record, you end up doing what
Microsoft's lawyers are going to spend much of this trial doing _
trying to explain it away,'' said Stephen Axinn, a leading
antitrust litigator with the firm Axinn, Veltrop &AMP; Harkrider in New
York.

 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Only 18 months ago, NBC's executives were riding a
wave of prime-time success that had raised the network to
record-setting profits. The executives were so confident that they
were occasionally suggesting that they did not merely want to be
the No. 1 network; they wanted to be the only network.
</P>
<P>
   NBC was convinced it had a sound strategy for maintaining its
elevated position in the ratings and could be the first network to
avoid the ride down the bad side of the ratings wheel of fortune.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the edge came off that confidence last Christmas,
when Jerry Seinfeld announced that he was stopping production on
the comedy series that had led NBC to its record profits. Now, in
the first season of no ``Seinfeld,'' NBC finds itself in a suddenly
altered position: on the downside of dominance.
</P>
<P>
   As it did in the early 1990s, NBC is once again struggling to
counteract a combination of familiar factors: the hit that could
not be replaced, the suddenly dry pipeline of new hits, the
ball-and-chain encumbrances of commitments to previous hit makers
and the internal executive turf battles. And once again the network
is looking to a new entertainment executive to help stem the
downward turn of the programming cycle that has inevitably hit
every network that reached a position of prime-time dominance in
the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   If there were ever any doubts about the ratings clout of
``Seinfeld,'' they have now been erased. NBC's ratings are off by
more than 20 percent this fall, a figure surely higher than NBC
expected when it calculated how badly it would be hit by the
departure of ``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, the network's biggest losses have been among younger
men, the biggest fans of ``Seinfeld.'' Some of that is also the
result of NBC's abandonment of National Football League games this
year. But even when all sports programming is factored out (NBC had
the World Series and the Super Bowl last year), among men between
the ages of 18 and 49, NBC is still off by 22 percent. Among men
between 18 and 34 the figure grows to 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That is the state of play that the new executive, Scott Sassa,
encounters as he joins the network as the president of
entertainment. Sassa, 39, former head of all entertainment
operations for the Turner Broadcasting cable channels, was
appointed to replace the longtime NBC programmer, Warren
Littlefield, last week. NBC called the move the first step in a
planned transition that would bring Sassa into total control of NBC
entertainment operations.
</P>
<P>
   For at least a year he will work under Don Ohlmeyer, the
executive brought in the last time NBC, a unit of General Electric,
faced a clouding-over prime-time picture. That was in 1993, and
things were much worse then. Ohlmeyer, who is now widely credited
with providing the leadership that turned NBC around, had to start
almost from scratch. NBC's executive reorganization this time comes
at a far earlier point in NBC's ratings decline.
</P>
<P>
   Still, senior NBC executives acknowledge that they must make
moves now to level off the network; and they believe they can.
NBC's position remains reasonably secure for the moment, because no
other network is making a strong upward movement that would help
force NBC down further, and because NBC still possesses a core of
television's strongest shows _ ``E.R.,'' ``Frasier,'' ``Friends''
and ``Law and Order.''
</P>
<P>
   But NBC is also embroiled in a bitter standoff with the
Hollywood studios that supply all those hits. NBC has demanded an
ownership stake in all new programs and the studios have refused.
Instead, they have begun what is in effect a boycott of NBC. For
the moment, that means those studios will not be supplying NBC with
any of the hits the network needs to pull out of its current slide.
</P>
<P>
   NBC must have those hits because for the last three seasons, no
compelling new program has been added to NBC's store. Network
executives concede that program development has been weak and no
real hits have emerged in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of ``Seinfeld,'' along with the ratings garnered
last year by the World Series and the Super Bowl, helped mask the
problems for a time.
</P>
<P>
   The network's focus on maximizing profits also led to what
several NBC executives said were some questionable strategic moves,
such as attempting in the fall of 1997 to flood the NBC schedule
with comedies, a record 18 of them, primarily because comedies
generally get a higher price from advertisers than any other kind
of programming. Looking to capitalize on that, NBC also dropped its
Monday night movie, which had been reasonably successful.
</P>
<P>
   That led, according to NBC executives, to internal turf battles
as NBC's top movie executive, Lindy DeKoven, was squeezed out by
the rest of the program department.
</P>
<P>
   But few of the comedies NBC introduced worked. Reflecting a
widely held view, one former top program executive from a competing
network suggested a couple of reasons for this. ``It was a
combination of so many shows with the same upscale urban premise
and simple lack of execution,'' the executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, NBC seemed fixated on one kind of show: a vehicle for a
female star playing a single woman in some media surrounding,
usually in New York. The list of shows with that premise introduced
by NBC during the last three years includes ``Caroline in the
City,'' ``Suddenly Susan,'' ``Fired Up,'' ``Naked Truth'' and
``Veronica's Closet.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of these shows was tried in the program slot between
``Seinfeld'' and ``E.R.'' _ arguably the most advantageous place to
build an audience for a new show ever created by television.
</P>
<P>
   But not one of the shows has developed into a bona fide hit.
``We went with this cookie-cutter approach,'' one senior NBC
executive said. ``It just didn't work. And it meant we wasted that
9:30 slot behind `Seinfeld' instead of finding the hit that could
help replace it.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Because no hit emerged from all those attempts, NBC was forced
to move its next best comedy, ``Frasier,'' to Thursday at 9, where
``Seinfeld'' lived. That did help shore up Thursday, which has been
NBC's stronghold for almost two decades. But in so doing, NBC
drastically weakened Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to ``Frasier,'' NBC had erased ABC's former dominance on
Tuesdays. Now ``Frasier'' is relocated and another longtime comedy
hit, ``Mad About You,'' is fading in its last season. With some
stronger ABC comedies on that night, NBC has again fallen well back
of ABC, a unit of Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decline has also been advanced by the failure of one
hoped-for new comedy, ``Encore! Encore!'' That is being pointed to
as evidence that NBC, despite previous assurances that it would not
let commitments to stars or producers of previous hits pull it
down, has fallen prey to the mistake of putting deals instead of
shows on the air. ``Encore! Encore!'' was produced because NBC had
a deal with its star, Nathan Lane, and the producers of
``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   But the show has been a severe disappointment that has damaged
another promising comedy, ``Just Shoot Me,'' which NBC had hoped
would maintain the network's strength on Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Encore! Encore!'' is far from the only failure in the current
fall crop, however. One drama, ``Wind on Water,'' has already been
canceled. Another, ``Trinity'' (created as a result of a deal with
the producer of ``E.R.''), is endangered. Another comedy, ``Conrad
Bloom,'' is listing badly on Mondays. Only ``Will and Grace,'' a
comedy about a gay man living with a straight woman, has shown some
signs of promise.
</P>
<P>
   But that may only be because it has been up against weak
competition. When CBS broadcast a repeat of its best comedy,
``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' against ``Will and Grace'' last week,
the show took a big fall.
</P>
<P>
   Still, NBC, because it owns ``Will and Grace'' and needs it to
succeed, plans to move the show to Thursday, probably in the spot
now occupied by ``Veronica's Closet,'' another significant
disappointment. But several senior NBC executives said the network
could not move ``Veronica'' until 13 episodes have been broadcast
this year as a result of the huge deal with its production company,
Warner Brothers, owned by Time Warner, for the continuation of
``E.R.''
</P>
<P>
   That deal cost NBC $13 million an episode, of course, wiping out
its profitability for NBC. The enormous cost of that deal hardened
NBC's position about insisting on an ownership stake in all its new
shows, and the studios responded by refusing to deal with NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wright, president of NBC, said he believed NBC would solve
its impasse with the studios, but that it did not necessarily need
to. ``We aren't that dependent on the studios,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa, however, seemed to signal that he would take steps to
resolve the standoff. And another senior NBC executive said,
``Scott will solve that.'' What Sassa will do to solve the drought
of hits is less certain. The cupboard is all but bare at the
moment, with only two possible replacement series in production.
And neither of those, a comedy, ``Lateline,'' and a drama,
``Providence,'' is thought to resemble a cavalry charge.
</P>
<P>
   Some competing programmers suggested in interviews that NBC
might be wise to circle its wagons and place its strongest lineup
of shows on Tuesday and Thursday for the time being. One show
several other programmers said NBC might try to rely on is ``Third
Rock From the Sun,'' a once highly regarded comedy that NBC used as
a weapon on Wednesday night to try to damage the ABC hit ``Drew
Carey,'' only to see ``Third Rock'' suffer badly.
</P>
<P>
   NBC might also consider returning the Monday night
made-for-television movie, several programmers suggested, pairing
it with the ever-expanding news magazine ``Dateline,'' and dropping
some of its weak Monday comedies. But the movies that filled that
slot were taken out of development and it would take months to get
any stockpile of movies established.
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer is expected to take a much more hands-on role in
developing the next batch of NBC shows while Sassa learns the
details of running the entertainment division.
</P>
<P>
   Sassa himself refused to say in what direction he planned to
take NBC programming. ``I can't give you the secrets to the nuclear
code,'' he said.

 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The stage was set for a donnybrook, academically
speaking. The American Musicological Society held its annual
meeting here this weekend for the first time since the 1981
gathering, with its great debate between Joshua Rifkin, who argued
that Bach would have performed his ``choral'' works with only one
singer to a part, and Robert Marshall, who vehemently disputed any
such notion. The session almost came to blows, current myth holds,
though Rifkin denies it.
</P>
<P>
   In good Halloween spirit, the session most likely to explode
this year was scheduled for Saturday night in the same room of the
Boston Park Plaza Hotel as that Bach fracas. This time the subject
was Shostakovich, or more precisely, Solomon Volkov, who produced
``Testimony,'' a posthumous volume of Shostakovich memoirs
supposedly based on extensive conversations, the authenticity of
which has been questioned by some since it was published in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``Testimony'' claimed to give Westerners their first nonmusical
glimpse into Shostakovich's inner life: his scorn for the Soviet
regime and the depth of his feeling for his downtrodden nation and
compatriots. What may once have been heard as Soviet triumphalism
in his music, it seemed, should now be heard as sarcasm in the face
of overweening tragedy. Any number of controversies have grown up
around the work, between its avid supporters and its critics.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Ho, a musicologist, and Dmitry Feofanov, a pianist and
lawyer, presented papers in support of Volkov. Ho and Feofanov are
the authors and editors of ``Shostakovich Reconsidered,'' a
787-page book recently published by Toccata Press in Britain.
Emulating the form of a trial, it purports once and for all to
establish Volkov's claims and confound his critics: chief among
them, Laurel Fay, Richard Taruskin and Malcolm Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Volkov, it was said, was unable to attend the meeting; nor were
Ms. Fay and Brown present. But David Fanning, an English
musicologist and sometime Volkov antagonist who recently mitigated
his position, writing that the new book had caused him for the
moment to put ``references to Volkov's dishonesty on ice,''
responded officially to the papers. And well toward the witching
hour, Taruskin, a music historian who writes for many publications,
occasionally including The New York Times, got to speak his piece.
</P>
<P>
   Ho's paper, ``The `Testimony' Affair: An Answer to the
Critics,'' took particular issue with an influential review of
Volkov's book from 1980, in which Ms. Fay raised the specter of
plagiarism, pointing out that seven of the eight chapters begin
with extended passages virtually identical to published writings of
Shostakovich, sometimes decades old. Ho cited testimony from
psychologists to the effect that someone possessed of what they
call ``superior memory,'' as Shostakovich evidently was, might well
recall and regurgitate lines of thought formed long before.
</P>
<P>
   Feofanov's paper, ``Shostakovich the Anti-Communist: Confirming
`Testimony,''' repeatedly attacked Taruskin's alleged
characterization of the composer as ``perhaps Soviet Russia's most
loyal musical son.'' ``To call Shostakovich a Communist is the
ultimate insult,'' Feofanov said. ``Was he, or wasn't he?'' he
asked, providing what he apparently considered an answer, a
recording of Shostakovich and his fellow composer Moisei Vainberg
on the piano, playing the frenetic opening movement of
Shostakovich's 10th Symphony, written shortly after Stalin's death.
``If `Testimony' is authentic, as we prove,'' Feofanov said, ``I
submit that some apologies are in order.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The struggle for Shostakovich's soul is over,'' he added,
brandishing a copy of ``Testimony,'' ``and the truth has won.''
</P>
<P>
   Whereupon the struggle only heated up. Fanning, though speaking
in measured terms, challenged the absent Volkov finally to show the
notes of his conversations with the composer in response to Ms.
Fay's criticisms, to see how continuously they read as
transcriptions of conversations. (Volkov had to leave the notes
behind in the Soviet Union when he emigrated, for reasons of
personal safety, Ho explained. ``They are conceivably now in KGB
archives or destroyed.'')
</P>
<P>
   Fanning also rose to Taruskin's defense, noting that the phrase
repeatedly invoked by Feofanov had been taken damagingly out of
context. ``Thus was Dmitri Shostakovich, perhaps Soviet Russia's
most loyal musical son and certainly its most talented one, made a
sacrificial lamb,'' Taruskin wrote of the composer's treatment
after the creation of ``Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District.''
</P>
<P>
   When his turn came to enter the fray, the feisty Taruskin seemed
as much amused as angered, and was not at all apologetic. Neither
he nor Ms Fay, he said, has ever maintained that ``Testimony'' is
entirely false. He continues to maintain, however, that Volkov has
perpetrated a fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Volkov's claim to authenticity rests heavily on Shostakovich's
say-so: the inscription ``Read: D. Shostakovich'' at the head of
each chapter of the typescript. But such inscriptions, which have
been shown in photocopies, appear precisely on pages containing the
recycled material at the start of each chapter, Taruskin points
out, and they by no means establish the authenticity of the whole.
</P>
<P>
   The composer may have thought he was giving Volkov approval for
publication of an anthology of his writings, Taruskin suggested.
(But Ho pointed out that Shostakovich described the work otherwise
at the start of the first chapter: ``These are not memoirs about
myself. These are memoirs about other people.'' That chapter, too,
was inscribed.)
</P>
<P>
   In any case, those inscriptions ``merely lend authenticity to
material already known to be authentic,'' Taruskin said. ``They
leave it possible for Volkov to have written anything, and we have
no way of knowing that Shostakovich knew anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Others involved themselves in the discussion, several suggesting
that the answers to questions like the one of Shostakovich's
relation to Communism are not simple or susceptible to either-or
answers.
</P>
<P>
   The waning night reached an emotional peak of a subdued rather
than raucous sort when Margarita Mazo, a musicologist born in
Russia, spoke of her feeling for Shostakovich. ``Shostakovich was
one of us, because his hands were dirty, and our hands were
dirty,'' she said. ``I don't think making a spectacle is any
justice to the man who for many of us was almost a saint.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, despite occasional shouts and derisive laughter
and much speaking out of turn, no blows were struck.

   Snow showers will dust the higher elevations of the mountains of
New England, with flurries in a few valleys. The northeast coast
will have more sun than clouds, along with a stiff wind at times.
</P>
<P>
   A new surge of cool air into the mid-Atlantic region will be
preceded by streamers of clouds. The sky will look threatening in
the Carolinas and Georgia ahead of the disturbance in the Missouri
Valley. Several showers will reach the southern Appalachians.
Florida will be bright, but very warm.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and showers will dominate the western Plains and Rockies.
Some wet snow will fall from western Nebraska to southern Wyoming.
Times of snow are expected along the east slopes of mountains from
northern Colorado to western Montana. Clouds will break in parts of
the Northwest, but more showers are poised just offshore. The
Southwest will turn a bit cooler with sunny skies in most of the
deserts.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Wettest Wichita
</P>
<P>
   When it started raining in Wichita, Kan., late last week, no one
expected that nearly 6 inches of rain would fall on the final day
of October. This made it the wettest day on record, eclipsing
another October rainy day in 1985 when 5.03 inches drenched the
city. The month ended with 9.42 inches at the mid-continent
airport, the soggiest October and fourth-wettest month in the past
45 years. Streams of moisture from the Pacific and the Gulf merged
over the western Plains as a sluggish storm churned in New Mexico.
The result was heavy rain from the Texas panhandle to eastern
Kansas.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suddenly on Wall Street, it's the wonderful world of Time
Warner.
</P>
<P>
   In a remarkable turnaround, the media company that investors
love best is no longer Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few years back Walt Disney Co. was seen as the stable,
sure-growth operation that investors adored, while Time Warner Inc.
was tarred as the debt-ridden, cable-crazed drag on many a media
portfolio. But in the last 12 months, Time Warner's stock has risen
61 percent, compared with a rise of only 20 percent for the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index and a 2 percent decline for Disney,
which has historically been the industry's best performer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any sector will have any one or two leading companies,'' said
Christopher Dixon, a media analyst at Paine Webber Inc. ``We are
seeing major rotation from Disney to Time Warner.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Time Warner still has problems _ particularly in the
erratically performing Warner Brothers movie, television and music
units jointly run by Terry Semel and Robert Daly. And overall, Time
Warner, with $13.1 billion in 1997 sales and $246 million in
profits, is dwarfed by Disney's $22 million in sales and $1.9
billion in profits.
</P>
<P>
   But Time Warner's stock price represents at least temporary
vindication of the strategy of the company's chairman, Gerald
Levin, 59. Since taking the job in 1993, he has labored under a
debt that now stands at $16 billion, a big chunk of it from the
$5.5 billion he has spent acquiring additional cable television
systems.
</P>
<P>
   But lately gains in cash flow have investors worrying less about
the debt. Cable systems now account for 40 percent of Time Warner's
operating income, which was $3 billion for the first nine months of
the year, up 16 percent from the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   And with 12 million subscribers, the company under Levin has
become the industry's largest cable operator _ the largest
customer, in other words, for its own CNN, TNT, HBO and other cable
programming services, which together account for an additional 27.2
percent of its operating income.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a phoenix, cable has risen from the ashes, and the stock
has risen with it,'' said Time Warner's president, Richard Parsons.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, Time Warner is benefiting from economic
uncertainty. With some investors fearing a recession, many may feel
that Disney's theme parks, which accounted for about a third of the
company's cash flow through this year's first three quarters, could
be hurt more than Time Warner's less cyclical cable operations.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as owner of ABC, Disney is much more exposed to the
various problems facing the major broadcast networks. ``Cable
advertising is cheaper than broadcast advertising and less likely
to be hurt in a recession,'' said Dixon, the analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, who came up the corporate ladder in the 1970s and '80s
through Time Inc.'s cable business, remained a strong supporter of
cable even when his critics predicted _ incorrectly, so far _ that
it would be rendered obsolete by direct-broadcast satellite
networks. And though his 1996 stock deal to acquire Turner
Broadcasting System for $7.5 billion was criticized by some as far
too costly, Turner's cable programming services have complemented
Time Warner's movie and television production operations.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also brought what have proved to be invaluable
management benefits by making Ted Turner a board member, vice
chairman and 11 percent owner of Time Warner. Under Levin's
predecessor, the late Steve Ross _ who had engineered the
debt-defying $14 billion merger of Time with Warner Communications
in 1989 _ the company developed a reputation for profligate
spending, symbolized by a fleet of corporate jets and huge salaries
and stock-option plans.
</P>
<P>
   Though Levin had trimmed some of those extravagances, the Turner
deal brought on board an owner-shareholder who had run his own
company on a tight budget and was determined to monitor spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry has done a great job,'' Turner said enthusiastically in
a telephone interview. This is despite a difficult time for Levin
after the 1997 murder of his son and in the current widely
publicized trial of one of his son's accused killers.
</P>
<P>
   Levin _ never particularly comfortable with the news media,
declined repeated requests for an interview for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Confounding those who predicted a leadership battle, Levin and
Turner appear to have developed an amicable relationship. They may
not always agree, but Turner probably finds little to be unhappy
about, given that each share of his Time Warner stock has risen
from $41.375 when the merger closed on Oct. 10, 1996, to $92.875
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Levin has been faulted for a shakeup at Warner Music,
once the most successful company in its industry. After the
controversial departure of its veteran management team several
years ago, Levin handed leadership first to Michael Fuchs, the
former chairman of HBO, and then to Daly and Semel. The division is
only now beginning to recover from management turmoil as well as an
industry slump.
</P>
<P>
   But Levin has earned the industry's respect by bringing in
Parsons, formerly chairman of Dime Savings Bank, and promoting a
senior vice president, Richard Bressler, to chief financial
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Levin and Parsons have taken steps to clarify corporate control
and get the company's cable, publishing and entertainment divisions
working together more effectively. Though bonuses are still based
solely on the performance of individual divisions, rather than the
whole company, Levin meets with the six divisional heads a
half-dozen times a year to explore ways their operations can
complement one another better.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, meanwhile, has been particularly active in seeing that
Turner's cable services benefited from their association with
Warner Brothers films. In his most publicized move, he pushed
Warner Brothers to break off a planned sale to CBS and sell a
package of films including ``Space Jam'' and ``Mars Attack'' to
Turner's TNT and TBS cable channels instead.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Still, the road to synergy has had its chuckholes, most notably
an incident last summer involving the cable news network CNN and
the company's prestigious news weekly, Time magazine. After CNN
produced a piece claiming that the U.S. military had used lethal
sarin nerve gas in a secret 1970 mission in Laos, both CNN and
Time, which had published a version of the story, had to issue
retractions.
</P>
<P>
   And by any measure, the company's film business is in disarray.
The Warner studio has had one of Hollywood's weakest records in
recent years with box-office disappointments like ``Midnight in the
Garden of Good and Evil,'' ``Mad City,'' ``The Postman,'' ``Why Do
Fools Fall in Love?'' and ``The Avengers.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood executives and top talent agents pin the blame
squarely on Daly, 61, and Semel, 52, the co-chairman of Warner
Brothers, which accounts for 13.4 percent of Time Warner's cash
flow. During the 1980s the veteran executives were responsible for
hits like the ``Batman'' movies and the television series ``Murphy
Brown. Then, several years ago they took over the music division,
which gave them responsibility for another 10 percent of cash flow,
a move that some critics say spread them too thin.
</P>
<P>
   Daly has argued that if each man were running one division,
there would have been no criticism. But agents, producers and rival
studio executives said that Daly and Semel had lost touch with the
moviegoing public and had focused too much on longstanding stars
like Mel Gibson (``Lethal Weapon'') and Kevin Costner (``The
Postman'').
</P>
<P>
   In one widely related incident, several Warner executives were
discussing a project called ``The Wedding Singer'' that was to star
Adam Sandler, the hot young former ``Saturday Night Live'' comedian
who had broken into films with his role in ``Happy Gilmore.''
Though some younger Warner executives pushed hard for the project,
``the attitude of the bosses was `Who is Adam Sandler anyway?'''
said a person involved in the discussions who insisted that Semel
was offered the project and rejected it. Semel contends that Warner
never had the offer. Another studio, New Line Cinema, subsequently
turned ``The Wedding Singer'' into a hit.
</P>
<P>
   And depending too heavily on established stars is expensive.
Although Warner Brothers claimed that ``Lethal Weapon'' made money,
several Hollywood lawyers said that the payoffs to Gibson, actor
Danny Glover, director Richard Donner and producer Joel Silver
resulted in marginal profits at best for Warner.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Daly argued that the company has simply
been through its share of ups and downs and has invested in many
films that any studio would have bet on. He cited the example of
``The Postman,'' with Kevin Costner and said, ``I don't think there
would have been one studio that would have turned it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Daly and Semel contend that the studio has a strong slate
of films starting with Christmas releases, including ``You've Got
Mail,'' starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. And Daly pointed out that
he and Semel have brought in a younger team led by Lorenzo di
BonAventura, 40, the president of production.
</P>
<P>
   Turner dismissed suggestions by several executives close to the
company that he was unhappy with the film results and particularly
with Semel, who is most directly responsible for the movie
operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's ridiculous,'' Turner said. ``Warner Brothers is not
good, but they are doing great in television,'' he continued. ``The
whole idea of merging was to get new programming for the cable
services. Now we have ``E.R.'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, led by ``E.R.'' and ``Friends,'' both among the most
highly rated shows in prime time and already playing in
syndication, Warner's television and film production business has
shown impressive profit growth. Daly, who was president of CBS
Entertainment until he joined Warner in 1980, is actively involved
in the TV unit and is credited with the deal in which NBC
reportedly paid $13 million an episode for the next five years of
``E.R.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the operational successes and failures of the
Daly-Semel team, speculation about the size of their paychecks
draws almost as much attention in Hollywood, where each man is
widely thought to take home $10 million or more a year in
compensation. The two are not corporate officers, so Time Warner
does not have to divulge their pay and has chosen not to. But
events such as Semel's recent purchase of a $12 million cooperative
apartment have triggered more talk.
</P>
<P>
   Fortune magazine, which is owned by Time Warner, skirted any
discussion of the two men and their pay in an article last June
that took both Paramount Pictures and Disney to task for not
revealing the salaries of their studio heads. Asked about the
article last week, Fortune's editor-in-chief, John Huey, said: ``I
don't recall the particular story. It sounds like it would have
been appropriate to mention Time Warner.''
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing Semel-Daly controversy is not the only challenge
facing Levin. He is still grappling, for instance, with an unwieldy
corporate structure created several months before Ross' death, when
Time Warner sold stakes in Time Warner Entertainment to two
Japanese companies and U S West. Roughly 80 percent of Time
Warner's cable subscribers and all of Home Box Office and Warner
Brothers are owned by Time Warner Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Japanese companies, Toshiba and Itochu, have since
sold the bulk of their stakes, a 25 percent portion is still held
by the U S West cable spinoff, Media One, and Time Warner had tried
to extricate itself from this arrangement. But, unable to reach
severance terms, the company and Media One announced in July 1997
that they had decided to stay together. ``Both companies can
achieve their financial objectives, and there is no need to
restructure,'' Levin said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly a passionate pledge of devotion. And the marriage
remains financially unsatisfying, in the view of Jessica Reif
Cohen, an analyst with Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have two structures _ Time Warner and Time Warner
Entertainment,'' she said. ``Long-term, it is not workable. Just to
get anything done with cable, they have to go to Media One for
approval. It is not the ideal way to do business, having to ask
your partner for permission.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, no one said Time Warner was the ideal media company.
It is just that for now, because of its strong cash flow and in
light of investor disillusionment with Disney, Time Warner is
looking better than it has in years.

NEGOTIATIONS ON INTERNATIONAL GLOBAL WARMING TREATY RESUME 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ International negotiators will resume talks on
Monday in Buenos Aires over details in the treaty to fight global
warming, but with their expectations sharply lowered.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in Kyoto, Japan, more than 150 nations hammered out a
far-reaching agreement for steep reductions in emissions of
heat-trapping greenhouse gases by industrialized countries during
the next 10 to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   They also agreed, in principle, to establish a system that would
allow the sale or trade of emissions permits between countries and
to do more to bring developing countries into the effort, two key
demands made by the United States. In theory, trading emissions
credits would lessen the overall cost of reducing greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere by letting one country pay another to reduce
emissions to meet global targets.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been little progress since the Kyoto Protocol was
approved. And it now appears highly unlikely that an agreement on
the details will be reached in time for the U.S. Senate to vote on
ratification before the presidential elections in 2000. The Kyoto
Protocol continues to face substantial opposition among major U.S.
energy producers and consumers, who say it would be too costly.
</P>
<P>
   Treaty supporters in this country, acknowledging the slow pace
of negotiations, have begun to emphasize steps that can be taken
before mandatory emissions restrictions go into effect. They want
Congress to guarantee that companies voluntarily reducing emissions
of waste industrial gases believed to be a factor in global warming
will receive credit for these actions when a treaty finally takes
shape.
</P>
<P>
   Signaling the lowered expectations, Stuart Eizenstat, the senior
U.S. negotiator, cautioned that the administration's first
objective is to avoid what he called ``backsliding'' by other
nations on the agreement that the United States brokered last year.
</P>
<P>
   In Kyoto, the Clinton administration agreed to cut U.S.
emissions over the next 10 to 15 years to a level 7 percent below
1990's emissions _ if international trading of emissions credits is
allowed. That would let the United States meet a big part of its
obligation by paying other countries to reduce their emissions more
than the treaty requires.
</P>
<P>
   European nations are calling for limits on how much a country
could rely on emissions trading to meet its treaty obligations. But
Eizenstat said: ``I want to drive home as strongly as I can that we
adamantly oppose efforts by the European Union or others to set
arbitrary limits on trading. That is not consistent with either the
letter or the spirit of Kyoto, and it would impose unsustainable
costs on the U.S. economy.''
</P>
<P>
   After Kyoto, the parties to the treaty were also expected to
work out what roles the developing nations would accept and what
aid the industrial powers would provide them.
</P>
<P>
   Big developing nations are expected to overtake the United
States in emissions of greenhouse gases sometime in the next
century. But many developing countries still are resisting
commitments to reduce their emissions until they see action by the
developed countries like the United States, which produces a
quarter of the world's greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
   Some developing nations _ even China, which at Kyoto was
skeptical of measures to increase the role of developing nations _
are said to be intrigued by the ``clean development mechanism''
included in the protocol. It would funnel money and technology to
energy efficiency projects in developing countries, letting
industrialized nations take some of the credit for the resulting
reductions in emissions. But the details of this, too, remain to be
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Another source of delay is scientific uncertainty over how to
count deforestation and reforestation in each country's
contribution to the atmosphere's carbon dioxide. Growing trees
absorb carbon dioxide, storing the carbon in wood and releasing
oxygen. But the treaty partners will not decide how to score
forestry until a science panel reports in about two years.
</P>
<P>
   In the next two weeks, negotiators are expected to do little
more than to agree on a pace for further talks and studies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I think a success at Buenos Aires would be a work plan and
timetable,'' Melinda Kimble, acting assistant secretary of state
for international environmental issues, said at a recent briefing
for foreign reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Flavin, an energy expert at the Worldwatch
Institute, an environmental research organization, said: ``The
Kyoto Protocol has been moving forward more slowly than most people
had hoped for. The number of new, complicated issues added in the
six months before the Kyoto Protocol was negotiated created a level
of negotiating complexity that I fear has got us to the point that
this protocol is in real danger.''
</P>
<P>
   But advocates are pressing industrial companies to reduce their
emissions anyway. In Congress, a bipartisan group has introduced
legislation that would guarantee that those who act soon will be
given financial credits under any final agreement, whether it
applies only in the United States or around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, members of the President's Council on Sustainable
Development, which brings together industry, government and citizen
groups, also endorsed steps to give credit for voluntary early
actions to reduce emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Several big companies, including British Petroleum, United
Technologies and Du Pont, have already pledged to cut their
emissions and have begun to urge Congress to approve credits for
early actions.
</P>
<P>
   Even industry groups like the Global Climate Coalition, which
opposes the Kyoto Protocol, are supporting the administration's
insistence on unfettered trading. ``If emission caps are ever
imposed, these market tools will be absolutely necessary to lessen
high economic burdens placed on our citizens,'' said Connie Holmes,
the organization's chairwoman.

GERMAN NET USERS PROTEST PHONE FEES
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ In a protest by Internet users that is
gaining popularity in Europe, thousands of people and hundreds of
World Wide Web site operators waged a one-day ``boycott'' Sunday
over high telephone and Internet access charges against Germany's
dominant telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   Though the protest posed no financial threat to the company,
Deutsche Telekom, the protesters nevertheless generated a torrent
of publicity that has generally put the company in an unpopular
light.
</P>
<P>
   In what might or might not have been a coincidence, Deutsche
Telekom announced last week that it would soon introduce new price
cuts for Internet users and ordinary phone service.
</P>
<P>
   The protest could signal a new trend in Europe, where many
telephone companies charge by the minute for both local telephone
calls and Internet access. Online consumers in Spain staged a
similar protest in September against Telefonica. Rather than ignore
the complaints, the company opened talks with Internet user groups
and agreed to cut several key rates. Swiss groups are trying to
organize a protest as well.
</P>
<P>
   In both Germany and Spain, boycott organizers urged Internet
users to stay off line for one day. Companies and people that
maintain sites on the Web have been urged to shut down their normal
offerings and put up ``strike'' banners in their place.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in Germany are the Deutsche Telekom fees for Internet
access and for local calls to its access site. German customers pay
$1.10 to $2.90 an hour for local telephone service on top of
Internet access fees that run about $2 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy Internet users can easily run up telephone bills exceeding
$100 a month. By contrast, American customers usually pay a flat
monthly rate of less than $25 for local phone calls and can obtain
basic Internet access for about $20 a month.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how many people had participated in the boycott
Sunday, but support for the idea spread with astonishing speed
after it was first proposed five weeks ago by Thomas von Treichel,
a 20-year-old college student.
</P>
<P>
   ``A company cannot survive economically if it places itself
against the customers,'' said von Treichel, who is studying
computer systems and has been running his campaign from the
basement of his parents' house in Karben, a suburb of Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Von Treichel heads up a small Internet club called Dark Breed.
Sending out e-mail messages proposing the protest in late
September, he quickly attracted support from thousands of people
across Germany and from several companies. His most active
supporter is Serico Internet Services, a Berlin company that
provides Internet access and has complained that high telephone
charges are keeping customers away.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, von Treichel and his colleagues said they had
received 12,000 messages of support from individuals, and hundreds
of organizations had pledged to shut down their home pages on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most active promoters has been a prominent German
publisher of computer magazines, Heinz Heise GmbH.
</P>
<P>
   Spiegel Online, the Internet site operated by the weekly news
magazine Der Spiegel, is not participating in the strike but has
publicly expressed its ``sympathy'' for it. German newspapers,
television and radio shows also have reported heavily on the
campaign.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Internet use is growing rapidly across Europe, but surveys
indicate that that the growth in countries like Germany, with
comparatively high telephone rates, is slower than the growth in
the United States. About 9 percent of Germans use the Internet
frequently, compared with 20 percent to 30 percent of Americans. In
Finland, which has had local telephone competition for several
years and local rates are lower, more than 30 percent of the
population uses the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Ehnert, a spokesman for Deutsche Telekom, said the
company's prices were in line with those in many other countries
and that they would continue to decline. But he acknowledged that
local telephone prices were considerably higher than the flat rates
available in the United States.

THERE ARE MORE PART-TIMERS, AND THEY'RE WORKING LONGER HOURS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By REED ABELSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Working part time used to mean afternoons at home or two or
three days off a week. But as many Americans find themselves
working weeks that stretch to 60 or more hours, ``part time'' can
mean something very different: the ability to leave the office most
nights at 5 or schedule a half-day off every other week.
</P>
<P>
   A new class of part-timers, mostly women, is emerging and
working what used to be considered full-time hours _ 35 to 40 hours
a week. Lawyers, consultants, managers and other professionals,
they want to cut back their official hours so they can spend more
time with their children or deal with other responsibilities. They
want the freedom to miss a meeting occasionally to drop in on a
Tumbling Tots class or visit an ailing parent.
</P>
<P>
   When Sharon Katz Pearlman joined KPMG Peat Marwick five years
ago as a tax lawyer, for example, she wanted to avoid the typical
14-hour days put in by consultants and lawyers and leave the office
when she wished. As a mother of young children, ``it's very
important to me to make potato latkes at Hanukkah for nursery
school,'' she explained. So she accepted a lower salary in exchange
for a schedule of three and, later, four days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Between the time she spent in the office and the late-night
hours at her computer at home, she sometimes worked 40 hours a week
anyway. By becoming more efficient, skipping lunch as well as
chitchat at the office, and working at home after her four children
had gone to bed, Ms. Pearlman discovered that she could ``cram it
all in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be very productive in whatever time I have,'' she
said. Partly because of the freedom to do the work wherever and
whenever she can, she has in recent months been logging more like
60 hours a week, although she still does not feel obliged to make
an appearance at the firm every day. In July, at her supervisor's
insistence, her status was changed to full time _ and she made
partner.
</P>
<P>
   No one, including the government, which automatically classifies
anyone who works 35 or more hours as full time, knows exactly how
many full-time part-timers there are. And companies, which can
report to the minute how long hourly workers put in because they
punch clocks or fill out time sheets, tend to be reluctant to
acknowledge or measure just how much their salaried employees work.
</P>
<P>
   But one study suggests that these workers are a sizable
presence.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 National Study of the Changing Work Force _ conducted
by the Families and Work Institute, a nonprofit research group in
New York _ found that roughly a third of the salaried part-time
employees surveyed said they spent at least 35 hours on the job,
though the sample was small and statisticians say the actual number
could be anywhere from a quarter to almost a half of the millions
of part-timers.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that as the number of women who are
professionals and managers has increased and the number of
dual-career couples has grown, so has this new kind of part-timer.
``The group that needs flexibility and lower work hours is so much
larger than it was,'' said Robert Drago, who teaches economics and
studies workplace issues at the University of Wisconsin at
Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the need stems from the fact that many Americans are
working more: The average workweek for a professional or manager
has stretched in the last 20 years to almost 48 hours from 45,
according to the 1997 work force study.
</P>
<P>
   Whether employees are turning their careers into some sort of
modern religion or corporations are demanding more from them, these
long hours have changed expectations on both sides. ``The
complicated issue is: If a full week is 60 to 80 hours, what is
part time?'' said Ellen Galinsky, president of the institute.
</P>
<P>
   Part time often used to mean a casual commitment to the job on
the part of both the employer and employee. Part-timers came and
went, frequently holding positions with low visibility, and
certainly could not expect much in the way of benefits, status or
job security.
</P>
<P>
   But now, employees who want to keep their careers are
experimenting with different arrangements. Some are trying to
manage nearly the same workload as the full-timers by working more
at home and working more efficiently at the office. Others are
cutting their workloads. Though they typically collect benefits,
many take a cut in pay.
</P>
<P>
   Some employees are thrilled with these more flexible workweeks.
But many are frustrated by the perception among supervisors and
colleagues that they are somehow shirking work unless they are in
the office as long as everyone else is. And they can invite
resentment from colleagues who feel that their own workloads will
only increase to compensate for the part-timer's absence. ``This is
a culture change in process,'' said Ted Childs, vice president for
global work force diversity at IBM Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies, however, still hew to old definitions and reward
their employees based strictly on the amount of time they put in at
the office. ``It's very clear that, culturally, we still have work
organized as if it were back in 1952,'' said Paula Rayman, director
of the Radcliffe Public Policy Institute in Cambridge, Mass., which
studies work issues. Companies, she said, ``still create a sense,
the longer you work, the better, and face time counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rayman recalls talking to one chief executive who was
considering layoffs and was convinced that the least valuable
employees were those who were out the company door the first chance
they got. Though some of those people were not committed, he later
realized that others were among the company's most efficient.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues may also resent a fellow worker who has the luxury of
taking a day off or leaving early while they remain chained to
their desks. One woman who works a short week recalls a male
co-worker telling her that he could not believe that she escaped
without a pay cut. ``Men could never do that,'' he complained.
</P>
<P>
   At IBM, roughly 1,000 people are considered ``regular part
time,'' meaning they have either adjusted or reduced their hours
yet enjoy privileges of full-timers like pension contributions and
health insurance. One of Childs' challenges is to make sure the
employees who do put in traditional hours are not resentful because
they ``don't see a full glass,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But as working husbands and wives, who now make up about 44
percent of the employed population, try to juggle their duties,
they are forcing a change in thinking. They do not necessarily want
less responsibility, according to Sheila W. Wellington, president
of Catalyst, a nonprofit research group in New York that is devoted
to women's work issues. ``They just want to have control over their
schedules at the margins,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are aiming to accommodate. Some are motivated by
sympathetic managers or a desire to have a diverse work force. The
threat or reality of high attrition, which costs an employer money
by forcing it to hire and retrain workers, also pushes companies to
experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Not always with equal success. Maggie Oberst, director of
corporate communications for the Mastech Corp., a Pittsburgh
information technology company, took a 20 percent pay cut when she
decided she wanted to work four days, not five. So when she finds
herself putting in extra hours one week, she said, she pares back
her hours the following week. As a result, her experience has been
satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Melia Strittmatter, on the other hand, soon came to feel that
she had shortchanged herself by agreeing to take a pay cut for
essentially learning how to work smarter. When she decided to cut
back to part time at IBM in 1994, for example, her responsibilities
in software marketing remained virtually unchanged. By becoming
more efficient _ and skipping some late afternoon meetings _ she
was able to shrink her 60-hour workweek by a third and accomplish
about the same amount of work.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Strittmatter, who left IBM in 1997 to join her husband's
interior-room design business for even greater flexibility, said
that she came to resent the colleagues who were paid more simply
for spending more time in the office because they socialized more
or they tended to real estate businesses on the side. ``Many times,
I felt, `Why am I taking less pay for this?''' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Often shouldering more of the burden of minding the children or
caring for elderly relatives, women already make up more of the
traditional part-time work force _ 68 percent, compared with 41
percent of the full-time work force _ and may be quicker to accept
a deal that pays them less for essentially the same job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are total suckers for doing that,'' said Kelly Zuckerman,
who works for a California entertainment company. She said that she
was adamant about collecting a full salary for her four-day week
because her duties did not change.
</P>
<P>
   And much of the problem lies not with company policies but
inconsistent application of the rules by supervisors. Some
employees are able to keep their full salaries, but tailor their
hours to their needs, an arrangement typically known as flex-time.
David and Kara Plonczynski, senior credit analysts at Motorola's
two-way radio business, for instance, each get at least two days a
week to work from home. Any time they give to their two small
children, they make up by working in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   At the accounting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche, where at least 500
employees take advantage of a reduced workweek, professionals who
stop working at 40 hours take a pay cut _ but also have less work
to do. Deloitte, for example, allows Chris Foster, a senior
manager, to bill only three-quarters of what his peers bill so he
can spend more time with his two small children, especially since
his wife travels for her job, and his pay is docked
proportionately. ``I wouldn't have it any other way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But others are not so lucky. How companies treat these
part-timers ``is not equitable,'' said Carol Sladek, the head of
work-life consulting at Hewitt Associates, a human resources
consulting firm in Lincolnshire, Ill. ``It is truly manager
driven.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Merck, IBM and Ralston Purina acknowledge an
ongoing struggle to make sure managers follow through on corporate
policies aimed at encouraging flexibility. ``This is not something
that is going to change overnight,'' said Michele Peterson, senior
director of work/life flexibility at Merck, which has changed how
it compensates its managers to reflect how responsive subordinates
and peers say the managers are to different arrangements. Deloitte,
for instance, checks up quarterly on employees in their first year
of reduced workweeks to make sure the arrangement is fair all
around.
</P>
<P>
   But employees also have to take responsibility for what they
agree to do. ``We need to be honest about how much we are willing
to work,'' said Melanie Berry, who edits a newsletter for working
mothers, Executive Baby, from Mount Airy, Md.
</P>
<P>
   If someone takes a pay cut to gain some control over her hours
and then decides that she is being underpaid _ comparing her deal
with someone who gets a full salary and takes long lunches or to a
flex-timer who collects full salary _ she has little recourse.
Legal experts say the employee would be hard pressed to bring a
discrimination suit as the person who initiated the change. The
colleague whom she resents has ``in a sense negotiated a better
deal,'' said Carol Sanger, a family law professor at Columbia
University who has looked into gender issues.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the way people think about work will never be easy.
Companies may be reluctant to acknowledge that they consider a
full-time job to be 60 hours, and employees may not realize how
inefficient they are at home. ``There is no perfect solution,''
admits Ms. Strittmatter, the former IBM employee.

PATENTS: LABORATORY REPRODUCTION OF IMMUNE CELLS; SELF-OPENING
ENVELOPE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., N.J.)  (lb) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The front-line soldiers of the body's immune system are the
T-cells, which identify, attack and eradicate infection or disease.
But like troops facing an enemy in battle, T-cells can be
outnumbered. Cancerous cells or such viruses as HIV can multiply
and overwhelm them; once the immune system is thus disarmed,
disease or infection can spread freely.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the body cannot simply call in more troops;
T-cell production does not work that way. Vaccines and drugs like
the protease inhibitors given to HIV patients are meant to
stimulate the body's production of T-cells, but their effects are
limited.
</P>
<P>
   That has led to research in adoptive immunotherapy, or the
science of giving patients the T-cells their bodies cannot produce.
First, those cells have to be grown in a laboratory in huge
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the body's T-cells are at least initially so
efficient is that they are essentially programmed to fight specific
diseases. T-cells bear receptors on their surfaces that recognize
specific viruses or malignant cells.
</P>
<P>
   The T-cells grown in a lab, however, tend to lose their ability
to recognize specific diseases. Though scientists have grown
T-cells in culture for decades, they could not grow them for
extended periods of time, or in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Now two researchers at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center in Seattle have patented a method of growing large numbers
of a patient's own T-cells that remain able to identify specific
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stanley Riddell and Dr. Philip Greenberg, both professors at
the University of Washington, say their technique makes it possible
to withdraw a small amount of a patient's blood, isolate the
T-cells needed to fight a specific disease, grow billions more of
them in less than a month and then give those additional cells
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've done is essentially accomplished the kind of cell
proliferation that occurs in the body when it encounters
infection,'' Riddell explained. When a healthy person's T-cells
meet enemy cells, their receptors are activated, and they multiply;
within 20 hours the number of disease-specific T-cells in the body
can double, Riddell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You quickly go from a very few cells that recognize the
pathogen to having many,'' he said. ``That's important in order to
kill the virus before it kills you.'' From that fact, the
researchers knew that in order to grow similar cells in a lab, they
would have to isolate T-cells with specific disease receptors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's new here is that we spent time defining the conditions
used in the culture to expand the cells rapidly,'' Riddell said.
``We tried to provide the one thing we knew was required, the
T-cell antigen receptor signaling. When that receptor engages, the
first signal tells the T-cell to activate and divide. We provided
that signal, and then used a large number of the filler cells that
regulate the T-cell's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That lets us clone out T-cells specific to a tumor or virus,
and give them back to the patient,'' he said. The ability to grow
billions of T-cells ``provides you with an enormous immune
response, much greater than can be grown naturally in the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Riddell said healthy people use about 10 percent of their
T-cells to fight an infection like mononucleosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably in the range of several billion cells,'' he
added. ``We know that to control acute infection, you need an
enormous number of T-cells.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers hope T-cells can be grown to fight cancerous cells
as well as specific viruses, but Riddell cautioned that cancer
presents a separate set of problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficulty with cancer is that cancer cells don't display
the antigens that T-cells can see,'' he explained. In other words,
without the signal to turn on their receptor, T-cells often
overlook cancer cells. One exception is melanoma, which does emit
an antigen.
</P>
<P>
   Riddell and Greenberg have licensed their invention to Targeted
Genetics Corp., a Seattle biotechnology company that has used it in
human clinical trials for treatment of HIV and late-stage melanoma,
and to treat hepatitis B in chimpanzees. The invention received
patent 5,827,642.
</P>
<P>
   Self-Opening Envelope Could End Paper Cuts
</P>
<P>
   Ever used a butter knife, a ballpoint pen or a finger to open
mail when there was no letter opener within reach? Those
improvisations often leave envelopes in a jagged mess, and fingers
with paper cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Castro, president of Lanyard Envelopes Inc., in Budd
Lake, N.J., has patented an envelope with a built-in opener. He has
added a piece of string to conventional envelope design, creating
an opener that mimics those small packages containing adhesive
bandages.
</P>
<P>
   Castro's envelopes follow the conventional pattern cut from a
blank sheet of flat paper stock. Large flaps on three sides are
folded inward to form the body of the envelope, and a fourth
shallow flap serves as the top lip. But Castro glues a piece of
string to the fold between the front of the envelope and one of the
side panels.
</P>
<P>
   The string attaches to a small tab that extends from a corner of
the back of the envelope where the folding side and center panels
meet. If one pulls on the tab, the string slices through the fold
along the envelope's edge from bottom to top, leaving that side
open.
</P>
<P>
   Castro received patent 5,752,652.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

BMC EXPECTED TO BUY BOOLE &AMP; BABBAGE FOR $1 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BMC Software Inc., a Houston-based software company, is expected
to announce Monday that it is acquiring Boole &AMP; Babbage Inc., one
of Silicon Valley's older companies, for nearly $1 billion in
stock, people close to the companies said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The all-stock deal values Boole &AMP; Babbage at a 21 percent
premium over its closing price Friday. The boards of both companies
met last week and have already approved the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   BMC is a large independent software maker with annual sales of
$731 million and a market capitalization of about $10 billion. It
provides software to help corporations manage both mainframe IBM
computers and networks of smaller computers. The addition of the
business of Boole &AMP; Babbage, which creates software to help
corporations stitch together computer networks, would aid BMC in
expanding its product base. Boole &AMP; Babbage caters to a stable of
large companies, including financial institutions, communications
companies and transportation service providers.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition signals what many computer industry analysts
have already been predicting: further consolidation in a field that
is largely dominated by a few large players and a host of smaller
niche concerns. Several smaller Silicon Valley companies are either
reported to be for sale or are looking for partners. But the stock
market's recent turmoil had cooled many discussions during the last
two months.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Boole &AMP; Babbage might be a boost that BMC
needs. In mid-October, two analysts downgraded their
recommendations for BMC Software, saying they had concerns about
the quality of the company's sales in the second quarter. Rick
Sherlund of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., which had the stock on its
recommended list, changed the company's rating to ``market
outperformer.''
</P>
<P>
   After the downgrades on Oct. 16, BMC's stock price fell 14
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-October, Boole &AMP; Babbage, which is based in San Jose,
Calif., announced that it expected to make a positive announcement
about earnings in early November. It said it expected to have
earnings of about 34 cents a share for the quarter ending Sept. 30,
a significant increase over the 24 cents a share posted in the
corresponding quarter of 1997. With the company's earnings on the
upswing, the deal would add quickly to the earnings of BMC.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, each Boole &AMP; Babbage share is
expected to be exchanged for 0.675 of a BMC share, valued at about
$32.44 a share based on Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
   Boole &AMP; Babbage's shares closed at $26.625 on Friday, down $1,
after hitting a 52-week high on Thursday. The stock had a sharp
run-up in October, rebounding from a 52-week low of $16 a share on
Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   BMC is trading off its Sept. 30 high of $60.25, closing on
Friday at $48.0625, down 93.75 cents.
</P>
<P>
   BMC has been on an acquisition binge the last few years. It
recently acquired Datatools, a software company, for about $60
million, and BGS Systems, a software maker that analyzes and
predicts computer system performance, for $285 million.
</P>
<P>
   BMC was founded in 1979 by Scott Boulett, John Moores and Dan
Cloer. (The initial letters of their last names make up the
company's name.) In 1996, BMC announced an alliance with Sun
Microsystems to develop a way to provide customers with integrated
software for managing Lotus products on their servers.
</P>
<P>
   Boole &AMP; Babbage is named after two 19th-century mathematicians
and was founded in 1967. At that time, the company introduced the
first IBM mainframe performance monitor. It, too, has acquired
other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Boole &AMP; Babbage also has a number of alliances with other
technology companies, including IBM, Sun Microsystems and
Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   BMC is expected to retain the Boole &AMP; Babbage offices in Silicon
Valley.

   Ammirati Puris Reorganizes an Office
</P>
<P>
   Ammirati Puris Lintas, part of Interpublic Group of Cos., has
announced a sweeping reorganization of its New York office that
includes the replacement of the top creative executives and the
shuffling of several other managers. The changes come two months
after the appointment of Richard Hadala as chief executive of the
New York office and Ammirati Puris North America.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Johnson, 49, and Tom Nelson, 42, co-creative directors at
the office for the last two years, are leaving, the agency said,
and would be replaced by Rob Feakins, 42, and Roger Bentley, 39,
who had both been executive vice presidents and managing directors
for creative.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Steve Rabosky, 45, who was named four weeks ago as chief
creative officer for the Ammirati Puris office in London, will
assume additional creative duties as he is promoted to a new post,
deputy worldwide creative chairman, and will divide his time
between London and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy McNally, 43, executive vice president and multinational
client director for the Burger King account, was named to the
additional position of client services director. She succeeds Mike
Lotito, 38, who was promoted to the new position of general manager
for technology.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Cunningham, 37, co-media director, was promoted to become
the sole media director; Lee Doyle, 39, who had shared that post
with Cunningham, becomes a media services director. Lance Smith,
43, executive vice president and multinational client director for
the Johnson &AMP; Johnson account, was named to the additional new
position of general manager for process management.

   NEW YORK _ Barbara Montgomery sets the tone in the first minute
of ``The Trial of One Shortsighted Black Woman vs. Mammy Louise and
Safreeta Mae.'' Marcia Leslie's play is set in a courtroom, and the
opening sentence is a marshal's call, ``All rise!'' Ms. Montgomery,
as the judge, strides to the lip of the stage, glares at the
audience and says: ``What kind of court is this? Now, I am going
back out and when I return you will behave.'' Of course, everyone
laughs, but when she returns, the audience members do rise. They
then pay close attention to this often funny but deeply serious
trial, and two hours later, when the last word is said, they rise
again, with a great roar.
</P>
<P>
   First as a one-act and later grown to two, the play has been
staged in many cities in the last eight years, but it is hard to
imagine it has had a more vibrant presentation than it gets in this
new production by the New Federal Theater and the ETA Creative Arts
Foundation of Chicago. It has a seasoned cast, a set designer
(Felix Cochren) with the eye of a painter and a director (Paul
Carter Harrison) who can play viewers' emotions like instruments in
an orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Using the combative rhetoric of a trial, Ms. Leslie lays out an
argument that if black people do not explore their own history, or
if they replace the reality with film and television images, they
will lose the strength that has allowed them to survive in a
hostile world. While some of the play's court arguments, especially
from two lawyers, have little force, Ms. Leslie, whose language is
touched by a poetic gift, knows when to stop arguing and turn her
case over to exploitation of several deeply imagined characters.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the three women involved in the case, there are few
witnesses at this trial: a handful of men and the wife of one of
them, all portrayed by Reg Flowers, an actor with a hundred voices
who can create a whole character with a glance, a few words and a
wave of the hand.
</P>
<P>
   His versatility is like a light show in the background of a dark
storm gathering at the center of the play, foreshadowed when he
takes the stand as an old slaveholder. A lawyer asks if he had
abused his slaves. Flowers makes this courtly master look deeply
puzzled as he replies, ``I do not understand how it is possible to
abuse a slave.'' The effect is stunning; it is as though some
unimaginable evil had stepped onto the stage. It is the perfect
comment on the trial unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria, a young black woman with a lucrative but empty job at
a high-tech company, claims in court that degrading images of black
women created by two 19th-century plantation slaves are ruining her
career. JoAnna Rhinehart convinces us for two-thirds of the play
that her character is a hilarious bubblehead. But she gets a gasp
of admiration when she finally projects right through the
auditorium Victoria's devastation when she suddenly realizes that
her complete ignorance of her own people's history has made her a
woman without friends, without understanding and without any
defense against the casual and subtle, but lethal, discrimination
crushing her in the hot young white world she thought she belonged
to.
</P>
<P>
   Her opponents in court are even more formidable, in part because
at the outset they seem no more involved in the plot than the black
women, in old films or shows, whose faces flit across a pair of
television monitors onstage. Safreeta Mae (Carla Brothers), a
beautiful young woman in a lavish gown made to excite lust, is a
plantation owner's mistress as well as his slave. And Mammy Louise
(Ebony Jo-Ann), another slave, costumed to evoke Aunt Jemima, is
merely her protector, largely mute through the first act. Sitting
off to the side through Act I, the two might be in a tableau of a
gentle, lost time.
</P>
<P>
   When they face the lawyers, however, we know the time was savage
and can never be lost. The revelation by Ms. Brothers of the
scarring and depravity of sexual slavery _ real and legal, at the
hands of a man who was not only her owner but her father _ is
almost unbearable, much of it conveyed by gesture and the anguish
of her eyes as words crumble, whisper and die in the mouth of the
magnificently seductive Safreeta Mae. Then Ms. Jo-Ann turns the
placid figure of the familiar old servant into an angel of
salvation as, more with chants of prayer and snatches of song than
with sentences, Mammy Louise summons up, and transforms herself
into, the spirit of survival, the soul of hope that can take
sustenance even from despair and that accounts for the fact that
blacks could make it out of slavery as people of amazing integrity.
This is one of those embodiments of emotion and idea in theater
that remind you how reasonable the Greeks were when they said a god
emerged from a play and could be sensed in their midst.
</P>
<P>
   Its voice here, passing from one of these women to another and
then to all the characters, recites a litany: the names of scores
of slave ships from the long past. As this prayer of memory echoes
down to a sigh, the huge American flag that had covered the back
wall of the court fades away and we see floating over the heads of
the actors the sails of the slavers heading in from Africa; the
last sounds heard are the groans of masts as the canvases fill with
wind.

 &HT;    Phat Farm offers glimpse of season's hottest styles
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Halloween marked the start of a second wave of
spring/summer '99 runway previews here, and the womenswear shown by
New York designers this week will stand as the last _ if not
definitive _ word on the season's hottest styles.
</P>
<P>
   Sean ``Puffy'' Combs, the Bad Boy Records mogul, needed but a
word to sum up the Phat Farm sports collection shown Halloween
night at the St. Patrick's School gymnasium in SoHo. That word was,
``Booo!''
</P>
<P>
   Not, ``Booo!'' in the critical sense; Combs' front-row seat
showed he's on good terms with Phat Farm's creator, pioneering rap
producer Russell Simmons. Combs was just getting into the spirit of
the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing Simmons decided to stage a straightforward
Phat Farm presentation. There were so many celebrities and costumed
characters in the audience and on the runway that there was no need
for further distraction from the clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate magnate Donald Trump looked uncharacteristicly
casual without his red ``power'' tie. Leon? the actor best known
for roles in ``Waiting to Exhale'', ``Cool Runnings'' and ``The
Five Heartbeats,'' mocked his sex symbol screen image by wearing a
lime green outfit that bordered on drag. Model-actress Lauren
Hutton, wore a vintage mink coat and looked as if she's getting
younger by the day. ``Blade'' co-star Stephen Dorf put forth his
best effort to look menacing in a hooded Phat Farm sweatshirt and
wrap-around shades.
</P>
<P>
   Rapper Heavy D wore brown, industrial strength coveralls that
made him look, well, heavier. And the venerable fashion director
for Bloomingdale's, Kal Ruttenstein, came cloaked in a bright
orange parka that he joked was an homage to the ``South Park''
cartoon character, Kenny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy Hilfiger sent me this coat,'' Ruttenstein said. ``And I
thought, 'What better day than (Halloween) to wear it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruttenstein also said he was giving ``serious consideration'' to
introducing Phat Farm sportswear to Bloomingdale's customers next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   If Phat Farm's spring/summer '99 styles are any indication of
where hip-hop fashion's headed, expect rap to take on a kindler,
gentler image. For guys, there were a multitude of rather preppy,
plaid shirts with button-down collars and plenty of cargo pants
(denim and khaki) worn with much less sag in the seat than the
hip-hop standard. For women, there was the Baby Phat assortment
string bikinis and slinky slip dresses and skirts worn with
body-hugging silk Ts.
</P>
<P>
   Placing far less emphasis on logos than contemporaries like Fubu
or Wu-Wear tend to, Phat Farm stressed fabric quality and soft
color combinations.
</P>
<P>
   The rap group Gangstarr's frontman, Guru, modeled a butter soft,
white leather jacket over a mossy green T-shirt and grey fleece
pants. The MTV veejay Ananda Lewis modeled a clingy, silk T-shirt
with white fleece pants and Phat Farm's innovative new footwear
style, the Vita shoe, that would look appropriate both on the court
and at the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't (model) often, but Russell asked and I said, 'Yes',''
Lewis said. ``His stuff just looks so cool and it's so comfortable
to wear.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides pumping the gymnasium with music by such acts as
Run-D-MC, Lauryn Hill and Jay Z, Simmons made the show a minimalist
production.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just an honest presentation of what we sell,''
Simmons said. ``We could have shown all kinds of crazy outfits that
we'd never really try to sell, like some designers do in their
shows. But instead, we decided to give a show that catered to the
people who really matter: the customers.''

 &HT;    Danson's latest may not be ready for prime time
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ First, let's characterize Becker the man.
</P>
<P>
   In CBS' new sitcom, Ted Danson stars as John Becker, a
curmudgeonly M.D. with chips the size of Buicks on both shoulders.
He's a rantin' fool, spouting off opinions and alienating almost
everyone he rubs up against. But get him alone with a 7-year-old
boy who's HIV-positive, and he's about as hardened as the Sta-Puf
marshmallow man.
</P>
<P>
   Then let's categorize ``Becker'' the show, which premieres
tonight on CBS. It's only been six weeks since the TV season's big
``premiere week,'' so it's awfully early to consider this a
midseason replacement. But ``The Brian Benben Show'' was losing so
much of ``Everybody Loves Raymond's'' audience that CBS had to make
a fast change, and ``Becker'' was about all that was ready. So like
some of Atlanta Braves coach Bobby Cox's questionable decisions for
ninth-inning pinch-hitting, here it comes off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Becker'' had the courage to go all the way with its
premise, it might be a better show. He's supposed to be an Archie
Bunker for the '90s, but he really gets off only one riff that will
raise some hackles _ a put-down of God for allowing suffering in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   His other tirades are against such easy punching bags as TV talk
shows like ``Jerry Springer'' and used car salesmen _ not exactly
cutting-edge stuff that will clog CBS' switchboard with outraged
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Danson, who tanked badly in CBS' sitcom ``Ink'' but still
retains much good will for his years on ``Cheers,'' gives the part
his all, and there are moments when the writing really snaps.
</P>
<P>
   But this is yet another of those sitcoms that you can watch,
cross it off your list and never miss if you don't see again.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Romano, whose ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' does yeoman's duty
for CBS on Mondays, deserves a better partner.
</P>

 &HT;    Ray Romano's sitcom a whole lot like his life
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ray Romano is taking the path worn out by comedians in
the '90s: stand-up, sitcom, book.
</P>
<P>
   CBS' ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' has emerged as one of the few
sitcom hits on any network the last few years, holding its own in a
new time slot this season (9 p.m. Mondays) against Fox's ``Ally
McBeal.'' And like Roseanne, Paul Reiser and Tim Allen, the quirky,
homespun Romano is unloosing his own thoughts in a book,
``Everything and a Kite'' (Bantam Books, $22.95), his take on
family and marriage, based on his stand-up routine.
</P>
<P>
   He's cashing in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had our fourth child and initially I didn't want to do
it,'' Romano says. ``The offer came in for X amount of money and I
said it's not about the money. Then they came in with an offer for
X plus Y amount of money and my wife said, 'I think you should
write a book.'''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what else Romano had to say about the show, the book and
his life:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you surprised by the show's success?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm surprised we're doing this well against the competition
this year, ``Monday Night Football'' and ``Ally McBeal.'' It's
always been a word-of-mouth show. It doesn't just pop out at you _
there's no miniskirt, sex or young good-looking people. But it has
a quirkiness and people identify with it. Thank God for
dysfunctional families.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has the show changed since moving to 9 p.m.?
</P>
<P>
   A: We haven't consciously changed anything. We had a script the
first year, one that was just on (last Monday), the Halloween
episode (that involved jokes with condoms). It was written in the
first year, but the network wouldn't allow it on. But I don't know
(if they allowed it now) because it's our third year or because
it's 9 o'clock, but it was no problem this year. Otherwise, we're
just writing the show to be funny. My brother is going to start
dating now, move out of the house. But I wanted that all along
anyway. We're not trying to be controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How different was writing a book than writing stand-up?
</P>
<P>
   A: Much more difficult. I can sell a joke with my attitude and
delivery and body language. I have all that going for me onstage.
In print, I just had the word. In some cases it did look funnier in
print than it did in my stand-up, and in some cases there were
things in my stand-up I couldn't even do in print.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There enough material for another book?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's you son's reaction to seeing something he said as the
title?
</P>
<P>
   A: The twins are 5, and I can't remember which one said it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Anyone on the show read it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Patty Headon (who plays Ray's wife) read it. She's very
worldly and intelligent, and I warned her when I gave her the book
that it's not Kafka. She said she had a great time with it. ...
Peter Boyle (Ray's sitcom dad), I'm scared to talk to off-camera.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You really live at home until you were 29?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, isn't that sad? I goofed around in college, got a job,
tried again. I wasn't the most responsible. I was not even thinking
about tomorrow, so I never made money, wasn't driven to get my own
place. Then I met my wife when I was 26. We started dating, so
there was no point in moving out then. She accepted me living in my
parent's house. I got married at 29 and her mother for a wedding
gift put a down payment on our first house. We moved into the house
the day after the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So the show really is based on your life?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's the saddest part. We change and exaggerate a little,
throw in a punch line here and there, but it writes itself.
</P>
<P>
   Q: That ever lead to an identity crisis?
</P>
<P>
   A: I didn't know who I was to begin with. It's just me. I'm just
playing myself on TV. It's not like I'm a different character. It's
not that big a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   SEEN AND HEARD
</P>
<P>
   Hall rushes into `Law'
</P>
<P>
   He's signed, sealed and delivered. As expected, Arsenio Hall has
joined CBS' ``Martial Law'' with martial arts wiz Sammo Hung and
will first appear in the Nov. 21 episode. Hall will portray Terrell
Parker, a spokesman for the LAPD who uses ``street smarts and fast
talk to catch the bad guys.'' Can you say ``Rush Hour''?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing new but titles?
</P>
<P>
   Here's more evidence that TV never changes. You like PBS'
``Antiques Roadshow''? Well, ``Trash or Treasure?'' aired from Oct.
1, 1952, to Sept. 27, 1953, and featured two different sets of
hosts. Every week, people brought in antiques for an expert to
appraise. The show's title was eventually changed to ``Treasure
Hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC extends 6 shows
</P>
<P>
   ABC has ordered more episodes of ``Sports Night,'' ``Cupid,''
``Two of a Kind,'' ``The Hughleys,'' ``Brother's Keeper'' and ``Two
Guys, a Gal and a Pizza Place.'' But the network made no mention of
the future of ``The Secret Lives of Men.''
</P>
<P>
   `King' OK'd for '99-00
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of ordering up episodes, Fox has renewed its
animated wonder ``King of the Hill'' for the 1999-2000 season.

 &HT;    Atlanta expected to wolf down `Full'
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This is the week 1.2 million copies of Tom Wolfe's
Atlanta-based novel land in stores, and booksellers are bracing for
a stampede.
</P>
<P>
   On http://www.Amazon.com, Wolfe's book is already No. 2 among
the Hot 100 sellers, based on advance orders. (It's behind the
latest Oprah's Book Club pick, ``Midwives'' by Chris Bohjalian.)
</P>
<P>
   Pre-publication reviews of ``A Man in Full'' have been mostly
raves, but Atlanta Journal-Constitution reviewer John Huey is less
impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Tom Wolfe just picked the wrong city to write about at
the wrong time,'' said Huey, a native Atlantan who is managing
editor of Fortune magazine. Huey's assessment flies in the face of
most national critics who are busily proclaiming Wolfe the
modern-day Dickens based on this big new novel.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling through 742 pages of Wolfian sweep, Huey found
himself bored and a little annoyed. ``What the book lacks is
soul,'' he said. ``It's chock-full of terrific descriptive writing
drawn from obviously extensive reportage, but when you add up all
the trees, there's no forest there.''
</P>
<P>
   Huey's recommendation to Atlantans: ``Save yourself $28.95 and
reread `Gone With the Wind.' ''

   The New York Times' computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a small difference
Ohio State (No. 1) and Florida State (2), with an even smaller
difference between Kansas State (3) and UCLA (4).

THERE ARE MORE PART-TIMERS, AND THEY'RE WORKING LONGER HOURS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By REED ABELSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Working part time used to mean afternoons at home or two or
three days off a week. But as many Americans find themselves
working weeks that stretch to 60 or more hours, ``part time'' can
mean something very different: the ability to leave the office most
nights at 5 or schedule a half-day off every other week.
</P>
<P>
   A new class of part-timers, mostly women, is emerging and
working what used to be considered full-time hours _ 35 to 40 hours
a week. Lawyers, consultants, managers and other professionals,
they want to cut back their official hours so they can spend more
time with their children or deal with other responsibilities. They
want the freedom to miss a meeting occasionally to drop in on a
Tumbling Tots class or visit an ailing parent.
</P>
<P>
   When Sharon Katz Pearlman joined KPMG Peat Marwick five years
ago as a tax lawyer, for example, she wanted to avoid the typical
14-hour days put in by consultants and lawyers and leave the office
when she wished. As a mother of young children, ``it's very
important to me to make potato latkes at Hanukkah for nursery
school,'' she explained. So she accepted a lower salary in exchange
for a schedule of three and, later, four days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Between the time she spent in the office and the late-night
hours at her computer at home, she sometimes worked 40 hours a week
anyway. By becoming more efficient, skipping lunch as well as
chitchat at the office, and working at home after her four children
had gone to bed, Ms. Pearlman discovered that she could ``cram it
all in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be very productive in whatever time I have,'' she
said. Partly because of the freedom to do the work wherever and
whenever she can, she has in recent months been logging more like
60 hours a week, although she still does not feel obliged to make
an appearance at the firm every day. In July, at her supervisor's
insistence, her status was changed to full time _ and she made
partner.
</P>
<P>
   No one, including the government, which automatically classifies
anyone who works 35 or more hours as full time, knows exactly how
many full-time part-timers there are. And companies, which can
report to the minute how long hourly workers put in because they
punch clocks or fill out time sheets, tend to be reluctant to
acknowledge or measure just how much their salaried employees work.
</P>
<P>
   But one study suggests that these workers are a sizable
presence.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 National Study of the Changing Work Force _ conducted
by the Families and Work Institute, a nonprofit research group in
New York _ found that roughly a third of the salaried part-time
employees surveyed said they spent at least 35 hours on the job,
though the sample was small and statisticians say the actual number
could be anywhere from a quarter to almost a half of the millions
of part-timers.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that as the number of women who are
professionals and managers has increased and the number of
dual-career couples has grown, so has this new kind of part-timer.
``The group that needs flexibility and lower work hours is so much
larger than it was,'' said Robert Drago, who teaches economics and
studies workplace issues at the University of Wisconsin at
Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the need stems from the fact that many Americans are
working more: The average workweek for a professional or manager
has stretched in the last 20 years to almost 48 hours from 45,
according to the 1997 work force study.
</P>
<P>
   Whether employees are turning their careers into some sort of
modern religion or corporations are demanding more from them, these
long hours have changed expectations on both sides. ``The
complicated issue is: If a full week is 60 to 80 hours, what is
part time?'' said Ellen Galinsky, president of the institute.
</P>
<P>
   Part time often used to mean a casual commitment to the job on
the part of both the employer and employee. Part-timers came and
went, frequently holding positions with low visibility, and
certainly could not expect much in the way of benefits, status or
job security.
</P>
<P>
   But now, employees who want to keep their careers are
experimenting with different arrangements. Some are trying to
manage nearly the same workload as the full-timers by working more
at home and working more efficiently at the office. Others are
cutting their workloads. Though they typically collect benefits,
many take a cut in pay.
</P>
<P>
   Some employees are thrilled with these more flexible workweeks.
But many are frustrated by the perception among supervisors and
colleagues that they are somehow shirking work unless they are in
the office as long as everyone else is. And they can invite
resentment from colleagues who feel that their own workloads will
only increase to compensate for the part-timer's absence. ``This is
a culture change in process,'' said Ted Childs, vice president for
global work force diversity at IBM Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies, however, still hew to old definitions and reward
their employees based strictly on the amount of time they put in at
the office. ``It's very clear that, culturally, we still have work
organized as if it were back in 1952,'' said Paula Rayman, director
of the Radcliffe Public Policy Institute in Cambridge, Mass., which
studies work issues. Companies, she said, ``still create a sense,
the longer you work, the better, and face time counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rayman recalls talking to one chief executive who was
considering layoffs and was convinced that the least valuable
employees were those who were out the company door the first chance
they got. Though some of those people were not committed, he later
realized that others were among the company's most efficient.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues may also resent a fellow worker who has the luxury of
taking a day off or leaving early while they remain chained to
their desks. One woman who works a short week recalls a male
co-worker telling her that he could not believe that she escaped
without a pay cut. ``Men could never do that,'' he complained.
</P>
<P>
   At IBM, roughly 1,000 people are considered ``regular part
time,'' meaning they have either adjusted or reduced their hours
yet enjoy privileges of full-timers like pension contributions and
health insurance. One of Childs' challenges is to make sure the
employees who do put in traditional hours are not resentful because
they ``don't see a full glass,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But as working husbands and wives, who now make up about 44
percent of the employed population, try to juggle their duties,
they are forcing a change in thinking. They do not necessarily want
less responsibility, according to Sheila W. Wellington, president
of Catalyst, a nonprofit research group in New York that is devoted
to women's work issues. ``They just want to have control over their
schedules at the margins,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are aiming to accommodate. Some are motivated by
sympathetic managers or a desire to have a diverse work force. The
threat or reality of high attrition, which costs an employer money
by forcing it to hire and retrain workers, also pushes companies to
experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Not always with equal success. Maggie Oberst, director of
corporate communications for the Mastech Corp., a Pittsburgh
information technology company, took a 20 percent pay cut when she
decided she wanted to work four days, not five. So when she finds
herself putting in extra hours one week, she said, she pares back
her hours the following week. As a result, her experience has been
satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Melia Strittmatter, on the other hand, soon came to feel that
she had shortchanged herself by agreeing to take a pay cut for
essentially learning how to work smarter. When she decided to cut
back to part time at IBM in 1994, for example, her responsibilities
in software marketing remained virtually unchanged. By becoming
more efficient _ and skipping some late afternoon meetings _ she
was able to shrink her 60-hour workweek by a third and accomplish
about the same amount of work.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Strittmatter, who left IBM in 1997 to join her husband's
interior-room design business for even greater flexibility, said
that she came to resent the colleagues who were paid more simply
for spending more time in the office because they socialized more
or they tended to real estate businesses on the side. ``Many times,
I felt, `Why am I taking less pay for this?''' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Often shouldering more of the burden of minding the children or
caring for elderly relatives, women already make up more of the
traditional part-time work force _ 68 percent, compared with 41
percent of the full-time work force _ and may be quicker to accept
a deal that pays them less for essentially the same job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are total suckers for doing that,'' said Kelly Zuckerman,
who works for a California entertainment company. She said that she
was adamant about collecting a full salary for her four-day week
because her duties did not change.
</P>
<P>
   And much of the problem lies not with company policies but
inconsistent application of the rules by supervisors. Some
employees are able to keep their full salaries, but tailor their
hours to their needs, an arrangement typically known as flex-time.
David and Kara Plonczynski, senior credit analysts at Motorola's
two-way radio business, for instance, each get at least two days a
week to work from home. Any time they give to their two small
children, they make up by working in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   At the accounting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche, where at least 500
employees take advantage of a reduced workweek, professionals who
stop working at 40 hours take a pay cut _ but also have less work
to do. Deloitte, for example, allows Chris Foster, a senior
manager, to bill only three-quarters of what his peers bill so he
can spend more time with his two small children, especially since
his wife travels for her job, and his pay is docked
proportionately. ``I wouldn't have it any other way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But others are not so lucky. How companies treat these
part-timers ``is not equitable,'' said Carol Sladek, the head of
work-life consulting at Hewitt Associates, a human resources
consulting firm in Lincolnshire, Ill. ``It is truly manager
driven.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Merck, IBM and Ralston Purina acknowledge an
ongoing struggle to make sure managers follow through on corporate
policies aimed at encouraging flexibility. ``This is not something
that is going to change overnight,'' said Michele Peterson, senior
director of work/life flexibility at Merck, which has changed how
it compensates its managers to reflect how responsive subordinates
and peers say the managers are to different arrangements. Deloitte,
for instance, checks up quarterly on employees in their first year
of reduced workweeks to make sure the arrangement is fair all
around.
</P>
<P>
   But employees also have to take responsibility for what they
agree to do. ``We need to be honest about how much we are willing
to work,'' said Melanie Berry, who edits a newsletter for working
mothers, Executive Baby, from Mount Airy, Md.
</P>
<P>
   If someone takes a pay cut to gain some control over her hours
and then decides that she is being underpaid _ comparing her deal
with someone who gets a full salary and takes long lunches or to a
flex-timer who collects full salary _ she has little recourse.
Legal experts say the employee would be hard pressed to bring a
discrimination suit as the person who initiated the change. The
colleague whom she resents has ``in a sense negotiated a better
deal,'' said Carol Sanger, a family law professor at Columbia
University who has looked into gender issues.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the way people think about work will never be easy.
Companies may be reluctant to acknowledge that they consider a
full-time job to be 60 hours, and employees may not realize how
inefficient they are at home. ``There is no perfect solution,''
admits Ms. Strittmatter, the former IBM employee.

MONTGOMERIE LOSES TOURNEY BUT WINS EUROPEAN TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: United Kingdom)  (mk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEREZ, Spain _ If the Scotsman Colin Montgomerie looked and
sounded triumphant Sunday, it was not because he had won the Volvo
Masters.
</P>
<P>
   He finished third on the Montecastillo course, three strokes
behind Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland, who shot a sparkling 63
in the final round to equal the course record.
</P>
<P>
   But Montgomerie would end up with the more prestigious trophy:
the one named for Harry Vardon that is awarded to the winner of the
European order of merit.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is time to retire the trophy and cast a new one.
Montgomerie has finished on top six times in a row, which is both a
compliment to his straight driving, steady play and combative
temperament, and a backhanded slap at the competitiveness of the
European Tour on which he makes the bulk of his excellent living.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standard is improving, and I've had to improve every year
along with it,'' Montgomerie, who has yet to improve enough to win
a major, said.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans hold the Ryder Cup, which they won a short drive
south from here at Valderrama last year. But the Europeans do not,
for the moment, hold the face cards in a sport whose main
attractions are based on the other side of the Atlantic. The South
African Ernie Els played at Montecastillo this past week, as did
Nick Faldo of England _ both big names _ but that was only because
they did not qualify for the PGA Tour Championship that was being
held in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   First prize there was worth more than double what it was worth
here, and though money is often an unreliable measure of a man, it
speaks volumes to sportsmen these days.
</P>
<P>
   Faldo, who has won six majors, is in one of the worst slumps of
his career, and he finished one over par on the undulating Jack
Nicklaus-designed course.
</P>
<P>
   Montecastillo is no longer controversially easy, as it was a
year ago, but it is not yet a genuine gauntlet through the stark
hills and olive trees. Clarke's gaudy score _ a 17-under-par 271 _
was testimony to that, and to his undeniable talent.
</P>
<P>
   Like Nicklaus, Clarke's bearish build belies his fine touch on
the greens. He earned a share of the lead Thursday with a 67,
faltered on Friday with a 73 and then recovered completely on the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, he started play three shots behind the leaders, Lee
Westwood and Peter O'Malley, and changed that in a hurry. He was
four under after five holes and sank a 10-foot eagle putt on No. 9
to make the turn in 30. He would make three more birdies on the
back nine, including one on No. 18 that would widen the final gap
to two strokes between him and the runner-up Andrew Coltart of
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke attributed some of his fine play to a putting tip
Westwood gave him Tuesday morning: His elbows were out of alignment
when he addressed the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Clarke should have returned the favor Sunday morning.
Westwood started the day with a good chance of defending his title
and ending Montgomerie's record string, but missed out on both with
a three-over-par 75. He failed to hole several short putts but was
still in contention until the par-3 14th, where he hit a
mind-bending four tee shots.
</P>
<P>
   He hit his first into some bushes, and then hit a provisional
tee shot that landed 10 feet from the pin. His first ball was
located and was unplayable. He returned to the tee and this time
hit out of bounds. When the suffering finally ended, he had a
quadruple-bogey 7 and no chance of challenging Montgomerie, who
only needed a top-eight finish to clinch the year-end No. 1 spot
ahead of Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Montgomerie became the first golfer to win five
European money titles in a row. Now, he has one-upped himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll have to wait one more year, but it's getting closer,
unfortunately,'' Montgomerie said. ``It's been tough to stay ahead
of these two guys who are ambitious. Maybe as ambitious as I am.''

   NEW YORK _ After 26 miles of distance running accelerated into a
grimacing sprint to the finish Sunday, John Kagwe of Kenya repeated
as champion of the New York City Marathon. And for that, he can
thank the British Royal Family.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, the distance of the
marathon was randomly extended to 26 miles 385 yards, so that the
race would finish in front of the Royal Box of Queen Alexandra.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety years later, Kagwe of Kenya needed every one of those
extra yards to drop his countryman Joseph Chebet by just three
seconds, winning in 2 hours 8 minutes 45 seconds. It was the
second-closest finish in the 29 years of the New York City
Marathon, which does not produce fast times because of its bridges
and hills but which continues to provide races of spectacular
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   In the 23rd mile, the lead pack was whittled from nine runners
to three _ Kagwe, Chebet and Zebedayo Bayo of Tanzania. As the race
moved along Central Park South in the 25th mile, Chebet made a move
and Bayo could not hold on. Bayo's personal best in the marathon is
a full three minutes' slower than Kagwe's, and he would have to
settle for third in 2:08:51.
</P>
<P>
   That left the two Kenyans to decide the race, just as they had
done a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kagwe easily covered Chebet's move with about a half mile
remaining, his stride smooth, his arms carried loose and high, his
face unworried. He had been running 800-meter repeats in recent
weeks and had confidence in his kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was strong,'' Kagwe said. ``When he passed, I didn't
get distressed. I knew I could keep up with his speed.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Kagwe dropped Chebet in the hills of Central Park, more
than two miles from the finish. Sunday, they were still running
shoulder to shoulder with 600 yards remaining, when Kagwe surged
and built a small lead as the race turned back into the park at
Columbus Circle.
</P>
<P>
   Arms chopping furiously, as if slapping the air, his teeth bared
in grinding exertion, Kagwe endured to hold on. But on and on they
sprinted, and Chebet would not concede more than a couple of
strides. Still, he knew he was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to kick, but I knew I wasn't going to win,'' Chebet
said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, with about 200 yards remaining, as the course makes one
final, draining rise toward the finish, Kagwe began to draw away.
Chebet could not catch him and defeat came into his face. He would
finish three seconds behind in 2:08:48.
</P>
<P>
   The only closer New York race occurred in 1994, when German
Silva of Mexico made a wrong turn into Central Park and recovered
to defeat his countryman Benjamin Paredes by two seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Second-place finishes have become an exasperating regularity for
Chebet, who was also outsprinted in the final 200 meters by Moses
Tanui of Kenya last April at the Boston Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, it's hard,'' Chebet said. ``I must sit down with my
coach and plan something better.''
</P>
<P>
   The top American, Alfredo Vigueras of Woodland, Calif., finished
18th in 2:16:14. The top local runner was Tesfaye Bekele, an
Ethiopian who lives in Harlem and finished 16th in 2:15:23.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when Kenyans took six of the top 10 places, Kagwe did
not threaten his personal best of 2:08:12, run last year in New
York when he had to stop twice to tie his shoelaces. But he ran a
tactically brilliant race and demonstrated the resourcefulness of a
great marathoner, running the 25th mile in a searing 4:44 and the
final 1.2 miles in 5:52. His victory was worth $85,000 in prize and
bonus money.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Last year, a few guys were too aggressive and I let them lead
the pace,'' said the 29-year-old Kagwe. ``This year, they were all
depending on me, seeing what I would do. I tried to push the pace,
but they didn't go with me. So I initiated another plan, not to
break in the last four miles, but to break in the last 800
meters.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagwe made his first move in the 13th mile and crossed the
halfway point in first place in 1:04:19. It was about a minute
slower than the searing pace of 1997, and it was clear that Kagwe
was in a comfortable position with the temperature in the 50s,
perfect for marathoning.
</P>
<P>
   He surged again, reeling off the 17th mile in 4:44. During the
18th mile, the world champion Anton Abel of Spain dropped out, and
Kagwe would not have to worry about Abel's ferocious kick at the
finish. At 20 miles, the race also lost Josia Thugwane, the 1996
Olympic champion from South Africa, who left the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get someone, get them hard,'' Kagwe said.
</P>
<P>
   When Kagwe, Chebet and Bayo broke away just before the hills of
Central Park, Silva, the two-time champion, thought he would be
able to catch them. He was wrong, and he settled for fourth in
2:10:24. Kagwe thus became the first repeat winner since Silva in
1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great runner,'' Kagwe said of Chebet. ``He gave me the
hardest challenge I've ever had in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Kikuyu tribe, Kagwe played soccer until he was
18, when he left the team game for the solitude of distance
running. He came to the United States in 1994 to run the Boston
Marathon and remained, moving eventually to the suburbs of
Philadelphia where he could train in the rolling hills of Valley
Forge Park.
</P>
<P>
   His training was interrupted in August by a trip home to Kenya
for personal business, and hot, humid weather left him with
unimpressive preparatory races. Humble and reserved, Kagwe said on
Friday that he was not particularly confident in his chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried not to say I was confident, because the field was
tough and I didn't train with those people,'' Kagwe said. ``You
don't expect to win, you expect to give a race and that's what I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the race, his wife, Beatrice, had called from
Kenya, saying she had by chance pulled from a drawer a t-shirt from
the New York City Marathon. It seemed a good omen, Kagwe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like something was going to go my way,'' Kagwe said.
</P>
<P>
   He nimbly avoided a race official who strayed onto the course in
Central Park (``I was wondering what he was doing''), and he tied
his shoelaces so tight ``that they could not be untied unless
someone tried hard.'' When no one followed his earlier surges, he
changed his strategy and decided to outkick any challenger to the
finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was following and I was using a lot of energy for
them, so I decided to drop back,'' Kagwe said. ``When we made the
last turn into the park, I knew I should give everything and try to
outsprint anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he left everyone in his wake. Anton, the world
champion. Thugwane, the Olympic champion. Chebet, the perennial
nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, there was an article that said John's victory was
fluke,'' said Lisa Buster, who is Kagwe's manager. ``He really
wanted to win again to show that was not a fluke. No one should
think he did it by accident.''

TWO LAWYERS PLAY CENTRAL ROLE IN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Henry Hyde is counting on an insider and an
outsider in the impeachment investigation of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As the House Judiciary Committee weighs its next steps on the
path toward impeachment, Hyde is listening closely to two senior
committee lawyers assigned disparate duties in the Republican-led
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The outsider is David Schippers, a blunt Chicago Democrat hired
by Hyde to be the committee's chief investigator and to present the
legal case against the president. The insider is Thomas Mooney Sr.,
the panel's chief of staff, who earned a reputation as a consensus
builder 24 years ago when he drafted the first two articles of
impeachment against President Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hyde relies on Mooney for his congressional experience and
institutional history and on Schippers for the investigation
itself, from witnesses to documents,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, an
Arkansas Republican on the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers presented 15 possible impeachment counts to the
committee last month (the panel is collapsing them into three broad
charges), but it was Mooney who helped Hyde shepherd the vote for a
formal inquiry through the House. And when Hutchinson discussed
strategy with Hyde over dinner late last month in Washington,
Mooney was the only other person at the table.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, Schippers' role is to get the facts and make his
case. Mooney then has the arguably trickier task of deciding what
to do next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom's in charge of strategy, timing, tactics and the big
picture,'' said Julian Epstein, Mooney's Democratic counterpart,
with whom he has an unusually close professional relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, of course, Hyde and his 36 committee colleagues will
decide the president's fate and pass that judgment to the full
House _ unless higher political powers step in to broker a deal.
</P>
<P>
   But in telephone calls, late-night meetings and strategy
sessions over lunch in the House dining room, Schippers and Mooney
_ each of whom Hyde has known for years but who did not know each
other until this drama unfolded _ and their boss are mapping out an
impeachment endgame.
</P>
<P>
   Republican aides say that there is no rivalry between Schippers
and Mooney and that the two are cooperating well with only a few
minor bumps.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers has balked at a few procedural steps the committee has
taken. So deep is his lack of interest in political scuffling that
he voiced reluctance at having to attend the meeting late last
month between committee counsels and White House lawyers to discuss
ground rules for hearings and depositions. Mooney did most of the
talking for the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schippers is at home in the courtroom; I'm at home in the
committee room,'' Mooney said in an interview. ``I'm here to help
Schippers and Chairman Hyde navigate through the legislative
shoals.''
</P>
<P>
   The two lawyers are different in many other ways.
</P>
<P>
   Mooney, 55, and his deputy, Jon Dudas, a 30-year-old University
of Chicago law-school graduate, run the committee's permanent staff
from the majestic Rayburn House office building.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away on Capitol Hill, Schippers and his
seven-member team of former prosecutors, FBI agents and police
officers, all from Chicago, are ensconced in ground-floor offices
of an obscure federal building. An armed police sentry prevents
unannounced visitors from entering the posted ``restricted area.''
</P>
<P>
   Schippers' opposite number, Abbe Lowell, the prominent
Washington defense lawyer who is the Democrats' top investigator,
works down the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers, who turns 69 on Wednesday, is a career courtroom
lawyer who prosecuted organized-crime figures for Attorney General
Robert F. Kennedy in the 1960s, and later in private practice
defended police officers, federal agents, a pornography star and
even a defendant accused in serial killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schippers does not see himself brought in to achieve a certain
goal of impeaching the president,'' said a Republican aide. ``He
was brought in to provide a seasoned lawyer's guide through it.
Henry Hyde and the committee are his clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are poring over the report from the independent
counsel Kenneth Starr, rather than trying to break new ground,
Republican aides say. ``They're looking at transcripts, the
adequacy of questioning, what areas were not covered,'' one aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Mooney has spent almost his entire career on
Capitol Hill, working for the Judiciary Committee. Until Hyde named
him chief of staff last year, Mooney labored on a relatively quiet
subcommittee on intellectual property, writing landmark copyright
and patent-protection bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, Mooney wants the process to work,''
said Paul McNulty, a Republican committee spokesman. ``He wants to
make sure the committee's stature and integrity is not diminished.
Mooney's given his whole professional life to this committee.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If a censure deal, or some other compromise, is brokered,
Democrats more than likely will hear about it first from Mooney.
Hyde dismissed such speculation last week, telling a suburban
Chicago newspaper: ``Our responsibility is simply to impeach or not
to impeach. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a group of 10 Republicans and Democrats are trying to
scratch out some common ground, a struggle on one of the most
polarized committees in Congress. These lawmakers, including
Hutchinson, look at Mooney's Watergate experience as a possible
bridge to that goal.
</P>
<P>
   But Mooney isn't tipping his hand. If anything, he seems girded
for the worst in the weeks to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't going to be fun, and it isn't going to be
pleasant,'' Mooney said. ``But having been there and done that is
helpful. You don't panic. You don't jump off a cliff. You stay the
course and do the right thing.''

SINK YOUR TEETH INTO THESE CHEWY TREATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk about miracles of modern medicine: The members of the
American Dental Association recently announced the discovery of
toothpicks.
</P>
<P>
   Of course they don't call them toothpicks. They are sold under
brand names like Stim-U-Dent Plaque Removers.
</P>
<P>
   They have to call them something different. Everybody knows John
Wayne invented toothpicks.
</P>
<P>
   He'd whittle a few off a fence post, tuck them in his vest
pocket and pop one in his mouth after finishing a portion of Miss
Molly's barbecued ribs at that little cafe she operated down the
block from the Sour Belly Saloon.
</P>
<P>
   In those day cowboys used toothpicks to clean their fingernails,
start campfires, unlock cell doors, affix wanted posters to the
post office wall and serve as leg splints on injured grasshoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Toothpicks also made a statement. For starters, a toothpick
clenched between the teeth suggests that this cowboy certainly
didn't order tomato aspic for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   John Wayne didn't lose many gun battles or fistfights, but he
was ultimately laid low by Miss Manners, who suggested in print
that toothpicks violated hygiene, the social graces and at least
three of the 10 commandments.
</P>
<P>
   According to Miss Manners, toothpicks can be properly used only
to hold cucumber sandwiches together on a silver serving tray.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Manners didn't convince me. But she convinced my
schoolteacher.
</P>
<P>
   I used to soak toothpicks in peppermint oil for a day or two,
then lay in a supply in my pencil box, to suck through geography
class. It wasn't candy. It wasn't chewing gum. It must be legal,
right?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher confiscated all my peppermint toothpicks, which I am
convinced to this day she sucked at home each night while
correcting papers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, suddenly, I get a ``Good job, John!'' from my dentist when
he learns I am once again heavily into toothpicks.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate I may have BBQ ribs for dinner. Afterward, I'll
suck on some Stim-U-Dents while watching a few John Wayne films
like ``Rooster Cogburn'' and ``Pals of the Saddle.''
</P>
<P>
   Pull up a plaque remover and join me, pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Molly's Ribs
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 pounds boneless short ribs
</P>
<P>
   1 8-ounce can tomato sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons molasses
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon liquid smoke
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chili powder
</P>
<P>
   Cayenne pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 small onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   Salt, pepper
</P>
<P>
   Place the ribs into an oven dish just large enough to hold them.
Salt and pepper the meat.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the tomato sauce with the molasses, liquid smoke, chili
powder, cayenne, vinegar and onion. Simmer over medium heat five
minutes, then pour over the ribs.
</P>
<P>
   Cover the dish and shove it into a preheated, 275-degree oven
for three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Serves four or more, over cooked egg noodles. And for a side
dish try some carrots the way they serve 'em at the Sour Belly
Saloon.
</P>
<P>
   Boozy Carrots
</P>
<P>
   1 pound finger-size carrot sticks
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons water
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons bourbon
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon maple syrup
</P>
<P>
   One-quareter cup minced mint leaves
</P>
<P>
   Salt, pepper
</P>
<P>
   Dump the carrots, water and booze into a large skillet. Cook at
medium heat until carrots are tender, about five minutes. Add the
butter, maple syrup, mint and stir.
</P>
<P>
   Continue to simmer uncovered until liquid has cooked away and
carrots are glazed. Season with salt and pepper and this should
serve four.
</P>
<P>
   And please pass the lumber.

A TASTE OF TRUFFLE NEED NOT COST YOU AN ARM AND LEG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're worried about breaking the budget to get into truffle
tasting, take heart _ there's a less expensive way to get the
truffle flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Some specialty stores sell a variety of truffle products that
allow the home cook to add truffle flavor to a meal.
</P>
<P>
   But Massimo Vidoni of Boscovivo, Tartufi, one of the country's
largest truffle importers, says to buy carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to get the closest flavor to the fresh truffle,
use the oil or cream,'' Vidoni says. ``The preserved white truffle
is often not the true white and can be tasteless. The black truffle
will offer enough flavor to make it a worthwhile purchase.''
</P>
<P>
   Small jars of oil and cream can be purchased for about $10 to
$13. A small amount poured over fresh, hot pasta or vegetables will
offer some idea of the expensive taste.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to risk trying the preserved white truffle, a small
jar costs about $36. The same jar size of black truffles is about
$10.
</P>
<P>
   The preserved truffle, usually about the size of a large
gumball, can be shaved over any food, just like the fresh truffle,
but you need to use a lot more of the preserved truffle to come
close to matching the flavor of fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, too, that even the fresh white truffle should not be
cooked or heated. Instead, the heat of the food onto which it is
shaved will release the flavor. Too much heat _ as in actual
cooking _ will turn it tasteless almost instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, heat releases the flavor in preserved black
truffles. They are often the size of jaw breakers and can be cut
into cubes or sliced into sauces, ragouts, lasagna, even poultry
stuffing.
</P>
<P>
   There is also truffle flour, a paste made from truffles and
porcini mushroom, truffle salsa and truffle and vegetable mixtures.
</P>
<P>
   What may be difficult to find is a truffle shaver, a stainless
steel or wood frame that holds a razor-sharp blade over which the
truffle is drawn to produce the paper-thin slices.

   Fondue With Truffle
</P>
<P>
   (Fonduta con Tartufi)
</P>
<P>
   1 4ounces Fontina cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 cup whole milk
</P>
<P>
   4 eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons sweet butter
</P>
<P>
   1 small piece fresh white truffle
</P>
<P>
   One-eights teaspoon grund nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   Cubes of bread for dipping
</P>
<P>
   Cube the cheese into small pieces in a small bowl. Cover the
cheese with milk and allow to soak for 3 or 4 hours. Drain cheese,
reserving the milk.
</P>
<P>
   Melt butter in double boiler. Add the eggs (well beaten),
cheese, nutmeg and about 4 tablespoons of the milk. Stir with
wooden spoon continuously over a very low heat until eggs and
cheese are blended to the consistency of smooth cream.
</P>
<P>
   Pour into shallow, warmed bowl and shave a liberal sprinkling of
paper-thin white truffle over the top and serve immediately with
bread.
</P>
<P>
   Italian chefs insist the absolute best way to showcase the
flavor of the truffle is to shave slivers over plain soft scrambled
eggs. But if that doesn't sound showy enough, try this adaptation
of a truffled egg recipe adorned with cheese and arugula, from the
Taverna del Lupo in Gubbio.
</P>
<P>
   Truffled Eggs Gubbio
</P>
<P>
   4 fresh eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons sweet butter
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   One-third teaspoon ground nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   One-half ounce fresh white truffle or one preserved black
truffle
</P>
<P>
   10 leaves arugula (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Preheat over to 350 degrees. Butter an oblong ramekin or 4-inch
au gratin dish. Should you chose to add the color and nutty flavor
of arugula, stack leaves and cut in thin slices and sprinkle evenly
over bottom of buttered ramekin. Crack 2 eggs into each dish, being
careful not to break the yokes. Using a whisk, mix the cheese,
cream and nutmeg well and spoon around the eggs, without touching
the yokes.
</P>
<P>
   If you are using the preserved black truffle, shave 8 or 9
slivers into each dish. Bake for 9 or 10 minutes at 350 degrees
until egg whites are firm, but not overcooked. Remove from heat.
</P>
<P>
   If you're lucky enough to have fresh white truffles, this is the
moment to shave them onto the steaming egg and cheese. Serve
immediately. Serves two.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thanks to pleasant weather, Sunday's New York City
Marathon production on Channel 11 went smoothly. Only a few times
did the transmission from the on-course cameras that transmit their
signals to helicopters hovering above break up.
</P>
<P>
   And one of the great delights of the day _ watching Tim McLoone
run the race while asking runners way back in the pack his blunt
and feisty questions _ was rarely impaired by the kind of video
breakup that bedeviled last year's cloud-shrouded production.
</P>
<P>
   The co-hosts, Al Trautwig and Marty Liquori, were informative
and comfortable, while ably treading the line between hype and
being positive about a great local event.
</P>
<P>
   Liquori was especially smart in describing how John Kagwe, the
men's winner, shifted into a miler's gear at the end, but Joseph
Chebet could not.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the on-course reporting raised a few questions:
</P>
<P>
   _ As she followed the lead women's pack, Katherine Switzer
eagerly suggested that the Russian runner Ludmila Petrova's bloody
nose could have been caused by ``blood doping'' or some other
illegal performance-enhancing substances. Her remarks were couched
in phrases like, ``I don't want to cast any stones'' and ``I
wouldn't want to say that.'' But she kept saying ``that,'' and
could have provided balance by suggesting Petrova, who finished
fourth, could also have blown her nose too hard. As Trautwig kept
asking questions, Switzer said she had never known a marathoner to
get a bloody nose. In such a delicate situation, Switzer should
have been more careful about not casting stones, even indirectly,
or say whether Petrova had ever been accused using any illegal
substances.
</P>
<P>
   _ At about 12:30 p.m., Switzer reported that the pre-race
women's favorite, Tegla Loroupe, ``has a very bad case of
diarrhea.'' Yet Loroupe, who finished third, was maintaining her
pace, staying beside Franca Fiacconi, the eventual winner, in the
lead pack on First Avenue. Later on, Loroupe was still a co-leader
on the Willis Avenue Bridge. Not that we needed videotaped evidence
of Loroupe's gastric distress, but Switzer's report made you wonder
if she knew of Loroupe's condition before the race, whether Loroupe
shouted to Switzer that she was not well or whether Loroupe had
detoured to tend to her condition. It would take a question 30
minutes later from Trautwig for Switzer to report that Loroupe took
sick at Mile 18.
</P>
<P>
   _ At various points, elite runners such as Abel Anton, Josia
Thugwane and Madina Biktagirova dropped out. But there was no
videotape. Each of them had been in a lead pack when last seen. If
on-course cameras remain in operation at all times, there should
have been tape to show what happened to the runners.
</P>
<P>
   Channel 11 was better than in recent years at showing runners
coming off the 59th Street Bridge and onto First Avenue, where they
were greeted by a cheering sea of fans. But to viewers, not giving
cross-streets is a bedeviling practice. Runners aren't only on
First Avenue on their way north to Harlem but they're passing East
86th Street or East 110th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the placement of two-minute commercial breaks is odd.
Spots should be shown when they can least affect seeing key
late-race moments. By the 24th or 25th miles, they should be
scotched. During one break, a nine-man lead pack dwindled to three.
During another, Fiacconi expanded her lead, but if Adriana
Fernandez had caught up in those 120 seconds, we would have missed
it. Better to be safe than to see Arthur Frommer pitch Puerto Rican
vacations.

   OIL-FUTURE-$ADV01 _ WASHINGTON _ Enjoy today's low gasoline
prices and worldwide oil glut, because they won't last forever.
When demand jumps at the inevitable end of today's worldwide
economic downswing, gasoline prices will start going up again at
the pump. But adjustments made by our government, other
governments, Wall Street and the oil industry should prevent the
kind of supply shock that led to gasline lines in 1974 and 1979. If
you are forced in the next few years to wait in line at a service
station for gasoline, it is less likely to be caused by a supply
shortage than it is to be caused (No joke!) by Y2K glitches in the
innards of some gasoline pumps. (Mollison, Cox News Service).

SNIFFING OUT THE GLORIOUS TRUFFLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTA d'ALBA, Italy _ Heavily armed men with bags of money
holding clandestine midnight meetings on country roads and dogs
frantically digging through dew-covered dirt seem about as far from
a sizzle skillet as you can get.
</P>
<P>
   But the escapades are all part of the quest for the most
expensive delicacy in the world, the white truffle.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout northern and central Italy this month, hundreds of
men and women and specially trained dogs are hunting the truffle,
as cooks throughout the world wait eagerly for the fruits of their
labor.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance of the underground mushroom belies its beauty and
value to those who know the white truffle.
</P>
<P>
   The pitted, unappealing lumps, which grow from an inch to a foot
underground, border on being ugly. But shaved paper-thin over the
simplest dish of eggs or the most elaborate foie gras or pheasant,
the perfume that is the white truffle becomes intoxicating.
</P>
<P>
   Centuries ago in Italy's Piedmont region, Romans hunted the
truffle for its believed aphrodisiac and therapeutic powers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Paolo Cerutti walks through a wooded valley outside Monta
d'Alba, in the same region. He urges his 10-year-old-dog Kira along
the overgrown terraced path.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mosta bene,'' he gently says, telling the dog to search well.
Unlike the French, Italians don't use pigs to hunt truffles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're too stupid and they eat the truffle before you can get
it, says Cerutti, 38, a third-generation trovatori or truffle
hunter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not as good as my father or grandfather. They could sense
the truffle,'' he says modestly. At age 21, he was Italy's champion
truffle hunter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My old dog, Lucky, found 24 truffles,'' he boasts. ``The next
best found only three.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lucky died, Cerutti paid almost $4,000 for Kira, a mixed
breed with a little hound and little something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The type of dog is not important because none are born to hunt
truffles. They all must be trained,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   However, he cautions not to use a pure-bred. A good mixture is
better, he explains. They stay calmer on the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   His other truffle-sniffing dog is black.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're harder for the other trufflemen to spot at night and
the competition is incredible and sometimes rough,'' Cerutti says.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-four other men in his village also hunt the truffle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to keep our best places secret. I'm not even sure my
father has told me all his sacred spots and I'm his son,'' he
laments with mock seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   Kira dashes to an oak tree, sniffs the roots, moves on to take a
whiff beneath a heavily laden grape vine, but quickly loses
interest. She then darts to a nearby hazel tree, pauses, slowly
examines the nut-covered ground and suddenly sprints to a spindly
poplar 20 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   She touches her snout to the ground, slowly moves it a few
inches to the right, then a few more. She starts digging like mad.
Her paws a blur, dirt flies everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Cerutti drops to his knees, shoves Kira aside, reaches into the
fresh hole, grabs a fistful of dirt and smells it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flower of the truffle. It's here,'' he says of the
distinctive truffle aroma that permeates the light-brown soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mosta,'' he yells and Kira buries her head in the hole and
again the dirt flies, a full frenzy but only for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's there,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Nudging the dog away, he gently brushes the dirt at the bottom
of the foot-deep hole with his open hand and carefully eases out a
pale brown, golf ball-size, gnarled white truffle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too small,'' he says, but some chef will gladly pay between
$90 and $160 for it and use it to anoint the meals of six to eight
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's better than Viagra,'' he says with a mischievous
grin.
</P>
<P>
   The shelves in his small store in the plaza in Monta are filled
with bottles of truffles in olive oil, and jars of truffles with
whole anchovies, with cheese, with salami, creamed with vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``They live for such a short time. We must find ways to keep the
taste,'' Cerutti says.
</P>
<P>
   Truffles have only a 10-week growing season, and this year a
severe lack of rain in the Piedmont has reduced the already scarce
crop. Prices in the truffle market in Alba, eight miles away, have
doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in Alba's market, hunters were paid about $615 a pound
for the beautiful whites. Last week a pound was bringing about
$1,280. And those prices can double again when the truffles are
resold in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep hoping that I'll find the huge truffle, you know, as
large as a soccer ball. I'll be rich, so I keep looking,'' Cerutti
says.
</P>
<P>
   But he's not doing too badly. The refrigerator in his work area
has plates and boxes of carefully wrapped white truffles, some the
size of fists, one as big as a softball.
</P>
<P>
   ``These will go to the chefs,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But not without some difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything about the truffle is a gamble except the taste,''
says Massimo Vidoni, the head of Boscovivo Tartufi in New York,
which imports hundreds of pounds of the subterranean jewels each
week. He is also the leading supplier of fresh truffles to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The selling of truffles is filled with risk, intrigue and
secrecy that would make Colombian drug cartels take note.
</P>
<P>
   There are formal markets for truffle sales in places like Alba
and the other major white truffle range, Acqualagna, near the
Adriatic. But much of the trade is done by recruiters who work for
two or three major truffle exporting firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to recruit the best truffle hunters in each region.
You try to get their loyalty, so when they get the big one, they
call us,'' Vidoni says.
</P>
<P>
   It worked last year, when he got a call at 3 a.m. from one of
his partners who had just bought a 2.2-pound white truffle from a
hunter near Alba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be the biggest ever,'' Vidoni says.
</P>
<P>
   It took him one phone call to sell it to a New York restaurant
for $3,600.
</P>
<P>
   Headhunters for his firm and others sit in their cars all night
or in coffee bars, waiting for the hunters to call their cell
phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carrying scales, $50,000 or $60,000 in cash and guns to
protect themselves, they meet the hunter in some out-of-the-way
place where the other trufflemen won't see them as they do their
business,'' Vidoni says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition for the white truffle is very rough. Last year,
some trufflemen were stealing or poisoning each other's dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Even getting the truffles to the chefs, especially in this
country, is no minor matter. The life of a fresh white truffle is
four to six days, eight at the outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're sold before we even get them,'' Vidoni says.
</P>
<P>
   With the care and speed used to ship transplant organs, the
truffles _ chilled and fastidiously wrapped _ are flown to New
York, where U.S. Customs Service and Food and Drug Administration
inspectors examine the weird-shaped fungi for dirt, mold and other
unauthorized hitchhikers.
</P>
<P>
   Every day this month, representatives of Vidoni and other U.S.
importers cluster around the customs office at John F. Kennedy
International Airport waiting for the precious shipments to arrive
and praying that an overly suspicious inspector won't cut a large
truffle in half to check for contraband.
</P>
<P>
   After they pass customs, Vidoni examines, weighs and carefully
rewraps them, then gets them on the next plane out.
</P>
<P>
   Italy exports truffles almost year-round and the prices and
flavor are as drastically different as the seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The jewel in the flavor crown, the white truffle, is shaved
paper-thin and used at a garnish, never cooked. It can be found
from late September to the first hard frost in central Italy,
usually mid-December. Depending on availability, prices to the
consumer can change explosively, running anywhere from $1,200 to
$2,600 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   The black winter truffle usually grows from January to March. It
has far less flavor and should be cooked in sauces. It brings $300
to $400 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   The black summer truffle has a thin black shell and whitish-tan
meat inside. It is the least flavorful of Italy's trio, but can be
used, in large amounts, to impart the flavor of truffles to a meal.
</P>
<P>
   Black truffles are also exported in small quantities from
France, Spain and China.
</P>
<P>
   There are white truffles that grow in this country. The Oregon
white truffle can be found in the fall from the forests of Northern
California to a little north of Olympia, Wash. They cost a fraction
of their cheapest Italian brother, about $100 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Are they good?
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on whether they were collected properly. If so,
they can be delicious,'' says Jim Trappe, a professor of forest
science at Oregon State University and one of America's leading
truffle experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Oregon truffle is well matured, it is quite comparable
with the Italian white, but therein lies the problem,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   To capture the full flavor of any white truffle, it must be
harvested during the very short window when it reaches maturity.
Trappe and experienced chefs agree that, picked too soon or too
late, the truffle can be tasteless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dogs are trained to find the truffle by its aroma and that
aromatic compound is only emitted when the truffles are mature and
just ready to harvest,'' he says. ``It's like a signal the truffle
sends out saying, `I'm ready. Come eat me.'''
</P>
<P>
   But truffle hunters in the Northwest don't use dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we use rakes to harvest the truffles and they get lots of
immature ones and old ones, which are pretty much worthless,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really care about that intense white truffle flavor and
you can afford it, go with the Italian truffle.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Georgia's Democratic nominee for governor, Roy
Barnes, took his seat early Sunday morning in the historic
sanctuary at Ebenezer Baptist Church, the pulpit once occupied by
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., his father and his grandfather,
the parishioners were already swaying to the pulse of a favorite
hymn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Victory is mine, victory is mine, victory today is mine,''
they sang in booming unison. ``I told Satan to get thee behind,
victory today is mine.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Southern black church, which has served for generations
as both a refuge and a staging ground, little distinction is seen
between spiritual victory and the political kind. And so it has
become one of the most enduring rituals of Southern politics that
white Democratic candidates make a Sunday morning pilgrimage to
black churches on the Sabbath before Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, a 50-year-old Methodist, extended the tradition by
traveling this morning with his wife, Marie, and a caravan of other
Democratic candidates to four Atlanta area churches. As is
sometimes the case for white candidates who suddenly find
themselves in the minority, there were awkward moments, like when
Maynard Jackson, Atlanta's first black mayor, informed the crowd at
Ebenezer that his mother and Mrs. Barnes shared the same maiden
name. ``We have not explored the family connection yet,'' Jackson
said with a wry chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, the morning was devoted to imploring
worshippers to vote. Democratic slate cards were pinned under
windshield wipers in each church parking lot, and influential
pastors and surrogates _ including Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman
_ embraced and endorsed Barnes all along the way.
</P>
<P>
   It happened at Ebenezer, where the ushers wore white gloves and
where Jackson told the packed house that ``all we have to do is
cast our vote and we can walk in Jerusalem like John.'' It happened
at Ray of Hope Christian Church, where visitors were greeted with
hugs and not handshakes, and where the Rev. Cynthia Hale said that
Barnes' attendance demonstrated his concern for the community, just
as God had demonstrated his by sending Jesus Christ to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   At Hillside Chapel and Truth Center, the Rev. Barbara King
introduced the candidate as ``Gov. Barnes'' and led her
congregation in bestowing its traditional blessing: ``We love you,
we bless you, we appreciate you and we thank God for you.'' And at
Gospel Tabernacle Christian Church, where members blow dime store
whistles to express approval, the Rev. Wiley Jackson Jr. urged his
flock to follow him in supporting Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot tell you who to vote for,'' Jackson said. ``I can
tell you who I'm going to vote for and then tell you to follow me
as I follow Christ. All right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Amen,'' the crowd responded.
</P>
<P>
   This year, perhaps more than ever, the black vote is critical
for Southern Democrats like Barnes, who is locked in a tight race
with his Republican opponent, Guy Millner. As the region grows more
Republican, the size of the base Democratic vote _ a significant
portion of which is black _ becomes ever more important.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks now make up 25 percent of Georgia's 3.9 million
registered voters, up from 22 percent in 1994. In the last four
Georgia elections, between 18 and 25 percent of the electorate was
black, according to surveys of voters leaving the polls. Democratic
candidates for governor, senator and president received 83 percent
to 92 percent of that vote.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Barnes, a state legislator for 22 years, said he made the rounds
of black churches Sunday as a show of respect. Considered a
conservative within his party, he has had to repair relations with
some blacks because of his vote 15 years ago against the creation
of a state holiday honoring King. He now says that vote was a
terrible mistake.
</P>
<P>
   When offered the chance to speak at two churches, Barnes tried
to motivate black voters by accusing Millner of employing racially
divisive tactics. Millner, a wealthy entrepreneur who has spent
$11.6 million of his own money on the campaign, has accused Barnes
of supporting racial quotas in state contracts and college
admissions, a charge that Barnes denies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to tell you,'' Barnes told the crowd at Hillside,
``that even if I lose this election I'm not going to divide this
state along racial lines ever again.''

<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ On the third floor of an old house, Boyd
McCamish unfurls a computer sheet listing his fellow members of
Local 204 of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. And he
starts dialing the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just calling some of our union brothers and sisters
about this upcoming election,'' he says by way of introduction.
Then he makes a friendly but efficient pitch on behalf of John
Edwards, the Democrat who is challenging Sen. Lauch Faircloth here
in one of the closest Senate races in the country. ``Get the
friends and family out there November 3,'' he says on the phone.
``Maybe we can turn the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   McCamish, 27, is a foot soldier in the battle to prod voters to
turn out on Election Day. Here and in scores of other tight House
and Senate races across the country, men and women are applying the
personal touch and their powers of persuasion in these final hours
to rally their most ardent supporters.
</P>
<P>
   In a nonpresidential election year like this, with the economy
humming and no national issues stirring passions, only committed
voters _ fewer than four in 10 of those eligible _ are expected to
vote on Tuesday. This means that candidates are in a fierce
struggle to make sure that their core supporters vote, or as
political professionals put it, that they ``energize their base.''
</P>
<P>
   In such a climate, many of the big national interest groups that
normally pump millions of dollars into television commercials have
decided that television is a waste of money. It reaches too many
people who do not care, and it has the potential to incite the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, while the national political parties are still
spending millions on television, many groups with specific
constituencies have adopted a more back-to-basics strategy. They
are going directly to their supporters with repeated personal phone
calls, strolls through neighborhoods, small information sessions
and multiple direct-mail appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO, under whose umbrella McCamish was making his phone
calls, has undergone the most noticeable transformation. In 1996,
big labor spent $35 million on the election, all of it on
television advertisements. This year, it is spending $20 million on
grass-roots organizing, mail and phone banks, and almost nothing on
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found that one-on-one contact, with union members
talking personally to union members, pays huge dividends,'' said
Steve Rosenthal, political director of the AFL-CIO. It is
especially crucial in a state like North Carolina, he said, ``where
the right has proven it can get its vote out.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the intensity of the Senate race here, state
officials are predicting a turnout of about 47 percent of eligible
voters, slightly higher than the average for a nonpresidential year
and much higher than predictions for turnout nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the
American Electorate, estimated that nationwide a relatively low 36
percent to 38 percent of those eligible would go to the polls.
Still, he said, ``Small amounts of votes might make a difference in
a lot of close races.''
</P>
<P>
   The intense get-out-the-vote war is evident here, engaging
groups as diverse as the AFL-CIO and the Christian Coalition,
Planned Parenthood and the National Rifle Association, the Friends
of Tobacco and the black churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we're doing is targeted specifically to our base,
to get them out to the polls,'' said Wayne LaPierre, the executive
vice president of the National Rifle Association, which is
concentrating on direct mail to its members here and a few
strategically placed radio ads. ``This election isn't about
convincing people who's right; it's about getting your supporters
who already believe you're right to the polls. Everyone is after
that 2, 3 or 4 percent that can turn these races.''
</P>
<P>
   Nina Miller, a strategist for the political arm of the Planned
Parenthood Federation of America, said: ``It's all mail and phones.
We're hitting people as many times as they will tolerate being
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that one of the main reasons for campaigning strictly
among Planned Parenthood's core supporters was that the mere
mention of the incendiary issue of abortion in a scatter-shot radio
or television commercial could rouse as many opponents as
supporters to go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we did a radio ad, for every pro-choice voter we'd reach,
we'd reach an anti-choice voter,'' Ms. Miller said. ``We don't want
to get the wrong people out to vote.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition here is augmenting the 35 million voter
guides it puts out nationally with 160,000 postcards to North
Carolina households that it has identified through church lists as
Christian conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to place these cards in the hands of people who want
them,'' said Simm Delapp, the state chairman. ``We don't do the
general marketplace, or churches that don't want us, or stores or
windshields,'' he said. ``That's litter.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is sending mail and
organizing phone banks on behalf of Faircloth. ``Our money is
better spent in specific, targeted, get-out-the-vote efforts for
pro-business candidates'' than on television, said J.T. Taylor, a
lobbyist for the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina has more registered Democrats (53 percent) than
Republicans (34 percent). But many Democrats are conservatives,
known here as Jessecrats, after the state's senior senator, Jesse
Helms, and they cross party lines to vote Republican. They have
harbored an intense dislike for President Clinton for years, long
before the Lewinsky scandal, and Faircloth has been building on the
anti-Clinton sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   As he framed the matter in a visit to North Carolina State
University: ``How long do you think Bill Clinton would last as a
professor at a state college if he acted the way he has in
Washington?''
</P>
<P>
   The importance of the Jessecrats has forced Edwards, a
millionaire trial lawyer, to disavow any liberal label. ``I grew up
in rural North Carolina. I grew up in the Baptist church,'' he
declared during a visit Thursday to Faircloth's hometown. ``I
support the death penalty, a balanced budget, no tax increases, and
some tax cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Republican Party has a huge operation dedicated to
identifying the crossover voters, sending them mail and urging them
to the polls. And for the first time this year, the party has also
sent out hundreds of thousands of applications for absentee ballots
that include a picture of Faircloth.
</P>
<P>
   In a further effort to win over the Jessecrats, the Republican
Party is warning voters that if Edwards is elected, he will cancel
out Helms' vote, effectively leaving North Carolina with no vote in
the U.S. Senate.

REPLACE BRICKS, ONE AT A TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Normally moves Friday in advance for Sunday.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have to redo my front brick steps, several of which have
broken off at the edges; some have cracked, then broke off; others
are cracked, and I am concerned they will go, too. I was told the
entire set of steps has to be replaced. Is that necessary?
</P>
<P>
   LOUIS SPEZZAFERO, Winchester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Not necessarily. If, say, 25 percent of the bricks are
cracked/broken, then replace only those. Bricks on treads like
yours overhang the riser by one-half to three-fourths inch;
pressure for years on this overhang, like feet landing on it, can
crack bricks. A cracked brick is a broken one, sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   To replace a brick, chip out the mortar with a cold chisel and
hammer. Use a heavy mason's mallet; a standard hammer is too light.
Then chip out the brick, breaking it up if necessary to do so. Buy
mortar mix and new bricks, and set each one in its place, lined
with mortar, making sure the mortar is tightly packed. Be sure to
buy hard bricks, not common ones.
</P>
<P>
   If more than 50 percent of the bricks are involved, then
rebuilding the steps is best. If you don't like the bricks
overhanging each step, you can have the steps rebuilt without the
overhang, or a lesser overhang. It won't look as good, but you
might avoid cracked and broken bricks in the future.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm replacing kitchen chair seat covers, or rather, I am
recovering them. The old seats have buttons that are quite deep;
can I remove then so the new cover will not have buttons?
</P>
<P>
   MYRTLE AUCELLA, Wakefield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Sure. You might be able to cut them off, with a knife or
scissors slipped under each button. They may have wires instead of
cords, but cutting is still possible. Or, remove the old cover and
take out the buttons; leave the padding and apply the new cover.

   Lichen. It is driving some people bananas. It is a light
greenish-gray growth that appears on rocks, trees, and, most
important, roofs. It is a combination of algae and fungus, is hard
as nails, and does not respond to bleach, the usual treament for
algae (the green growth seen on roofs, siding, and brick and paved
patios) and fungus (mildew), seen in similar places. Lichen must be
brushed off vigorously, so is impossible to remove from the rather
soft asphalt shingles without destroying the shingles.
</P>
<P>
   That was the problem of H.S. of North Andover, Mass., who asked
the unanswerable question two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Well, H.S., you have your answer, but no one will be happy about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Hill, a preservation architect, called to say the lichen
is encouraged by overhanging and nearby vegetation, and the only
answer is to get rid of any trees around the house and put up new
roof shingles. The trees provide shade and prolong moisture on a
roof, making an ideal environment for the growth of lichen. And
with new shingles and no nearby trees, the lichen is less likely to
grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen lichen growing four or five inches high,'' said
Hill. ``They look a little like model train trees. And moss, on
Cape Cod particularly, can grow so big that it looks like the big
shakos of British soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, Allen Hill; you have scored again.
</P>
<P>
   The solution is radical, so the homeowner might be able to avoid
some cutting of trees by cutting back branches and see what
happens.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Q. I am having an awful time getting soap off the shower walls.
It streams right down the tile and makes a mess. I tried turpentine
and lacquer thinner; the thinner helped a little. Is there any
sure-fire way to get rid of the soap?
</P>
<P>
   JOHN NUGENT, Winthrop, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If the lacquer thinner helped a little, then apply more. This
is a rare example of ``more is better.'' Be extremely careful with
lacquer thinner; it is highly volatile. Use plenty of ventilation
when working with this material. Paint thinner also should work.
But in any case, whatever you use, let it sit on the soap as long
as practicable; the solvent must dissolve the soap before you can
rub it off with a dry cloth.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My window air conditioner makes a terrible racket even when
it is not on; water dripping on it from rain and the roof make a
pinging sound that is really annoying. I tried foam on the top as a
cushion, but it deteriorates quickly. Asphalt roof shingles are
sort of OK, but not good enough. What will be a good cover to quiet
down that pinging?
</P>
<P>
   BARB McCURL, Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Aha! The same happens on my aluminum ladder stored against
the house. I plan some day to put a cushion on it.
</P>
<P>
   For your purposes, the asphalt roof shingle helps dull the
sound, making a thud instead of a ping, and that is about as good
as you can get. However, try a piece of thick, indoor-outdoor
carpeting; it is softer than the shingle and should work a little
better; at least enough to let you sleep at night.

<P>
   SEATTLE _ For Washington state residents who step into the
polling place here on Tuesday, deciding whom to vote for may be the
simple part. Then there are the whethers: whether to ban most forms
of state-sponsored affirmative action; whether to approve the use
of marijuana for medical purposes; whether to make it a felony
crime to terminate ``a fetus' life during the process of birth'';
and whether to raise the state's minimum wage and, for the first
time in any state, require automatic future increases tied to the
inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
   In California, voters have another dizzying array of choices,
including a measure to expand Indian casino gambling that has
sparked the most expensive campaign battle over a ballot initiative
in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   In many other states, there are constitutional questions.
Several states have so-called ``mini Equal Rights Amendment''
measures on their ballot, requiring more gender-neutral language in
their constitutions. South Carolinians will decide whether to
remove a 103-year-old passage in their constitution that forbids
marriage between a white person and a black person, a provision
that the U.S. Supreme Court has already ruled unenforceable.
</P>
<P>
   In South Dakota, voters will decide whether to change a
technical oddity in that state's constitution that allows anyone as
young as 2 years old to be elected governor. No toddler has ever
managed to get elected to the post, but if voters agree, the
official minimum age will be changed to the presumably more
sensible age of 21.
</P>
<P>
   And in Oregon, voters will go to the polls Tuesday to decide,
well, whether they will ever go to the polls again. If Oregonians
approve an initiative on the ballot, and they are widely expected
to do so, all future elections in the state will be conducted
entirely by mail.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly 100 years after South Dakota became the first state in
the union to allow direct citizen lawmaking through a process
generally known as ``initiative and referendum,'' voters around the
nation face many such measures this week, with the battles around
some of them so intense that they have generated at least as much
attention as congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   All told, citizens in 16 states will decide on 61 such
initiatives on Tuesday, while more than 170 other measures will
deal with constitutional amendments and bond issues, according to
the Washington, D.C.-based Initiative &AMP; Referendum Institute, a
non-profit organization that tracks the measures. About half the
states, most west of the Mississippi where strong populist
movements pushed for the right of citizens to make laws, have some
method for getting initiatives on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 100 years, initiatives have been used to advance a
disparate collection of causes, including women's suffrage, the
minimum wage, the taxpayer revolt, freezes on nuclear-weapons
production and term limits for public officeholders.
</P>
<P>
   And while experts disagree on whether liberals or conservatives
are more likely to push their causes through initiatives, there is
ample evidence that both see it as an important strategy tool. In
Alaska, for instance, voters this week will face measures whose
sponsors come from all over the ideological map.
</P>
<P>
   The Alaska initiatives would ban same-sex marriages; make
English the state's official language; establish a term-limits
pledge for political candidates; allow medical use of marijuana;
ban billboards on state highways; and prohibit the trapping of
wolves with snares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking across the board, there's no way you can say whether
the process is used more by the right or the left,'' said M. Dane
Waters, president of the Initiative &AMP; Referendum Institute. ``There
are a lot of issues this year used by causes associated more with
conservatives _ school vouchers, parental notification on abortion,
taxes _ but there's just as much driven from the left:
animal-rights issues, environmental issues, the minimum wage.''
</P>
<P>
   And even as the 1990s are the most prolific decade for
initiatives in the nation's history _ including 1994, when an
all-time record of 102 initiatives appeared on state ballots _
there are growing signs of a backlash. Many lawmakers have
complained that initiatives that sound good on paper can wreak
havoc with state budgets. But proponents of the process argue that
many legislators do not like initiatives because they represent a
direct usurpation of their own power, especially those proposing
term limits, which have been forced into law in several states
through the initiative process.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, in at least four states this year _ Mississippi,
Missouri, Oregon and Wyoming _ there are measures on the ballot
that would themselves, in effect, limit the initiative process.
Some of these measures would require ``super-majorities,'' such as
a two-thirds vote, for initiatives to pass, while in Wyoming,
lawmakers there are asking residents to approve new rules that
critics say may make it impossible to get any future initiatives on
the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Under the measure placed on the ballot by the Wyoming
legislature, supporters of future initiatives would be required to
obtain signatures from 5 percent of all registered voters in at
least two-thirds of the state's counties.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative process is facing a major legal challenge as
well. Just this month, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in a
Colorado case involving new regulations in that state that would
require that all signature gatherers for initiative petitions be
registered state voters and that they wear identification badges.
If upheld, critics say, the regulations could spark restrictions in
other states that would make getting initiatives on the ballot even
more onerous and expensive.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Still, with the proliferation of initiatives _ Oregon,
California and Colorado all have at least seven this year _ there
are concerns that the process could be overused. One measure that
has aroused particular discussion is an Arizona initiative pushed
by a tax-reform group hoping to influence the state's presidential
primary in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would allow candidates for Congress or the
presidency to sign a pledge vowing to work for the abolition of the
Internal Revenue Service and replacement of the income tax with a
national sales tax. Those who sign the pledge would then get a
special designation reading ``Signed the IRS Elimination Pledge''
next to their names on ballots and in voter guides.
</P>
<P>
   While critics in Arizona say the initiative could set a
precedent leading to ballot chaos, with future candidates angling
for special designations indicating their support for a range of
other causes such as term limits or cancer research, a spokeswoman
for the effort describes the tax designation as a valid way of
``holding politicians' feet to the fire'' on the tax issue. The
pledges themselves would not be legally binding.
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, the most controversial and closely fought
initiatives this fall include the gambling measure in California
and another measure, promoted by Rob Reiner, the actor, that would
boost tobacco taxes by 50 cents a pack and designate the proceeds
for children's programs.
</P>
<P>
   Measures to restrict the late-term procedure that abortion
opponents call ``partial-birth abortion'' are also being fiercely
contested in Washington and Colorado. Voters in both states are
being asked whether to criminalize the rarely used procedure, but
abortion-rights advocates say the term ``birth'' is so vaguely
defined that the measure could be used to impose much greater
restrictions on abortion in general.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the question before the voters is: ``Shall the
termination of a fetus' life during the process of birth be a
felony crime except when necessary to prevent the pregnant woman's
death?''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, D.C., and Washington state, Oregon, Nevada and
Alaska, voters will be asked whether to approve the use of
marijuana for medical purposes. Such measures passed in California
and Arizona in 1996, but have been blocked from implementation by
federal lawsuits. And while supporters say the drug is a highly
effective way of alleviating pain for those who are ill, the
Clinton administration has come out against the measures.
</P>
<P>
   Barry McCaffrey, the administration's chief anti-narcotics
official, solicited letters of opposition to the measures from
former Presidents George Bush, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, and
last week McCaffrey denounced proponents of the ballot measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's have none of this malarkey on marijuana smoking by
cunning groups working to legalize drugs,'' McCaffrey, a former
Army general, said. ``American medicine is the best in the world
for pain management.''

MEN'S HEALTH: VERSIONS ONE AND TWO 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sure, sex sells. But it sells better on the newsstand
than it does to subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   For his magazine's November issue, the editor of Men's Health,
Michael Lafavore, wrote two cover lines. The version sold on the
newsstand reads, ``Put more X in your Sex.'' The cover that is sent
to subscribers and to solicit potential advertisers rather meekly
reads, ``Natural sex boosters'' and ``No more backaches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the newsstand buyers tend to be younger and more
impulsive,'' Lafavore said. ``They want big muscles and they want
to be sexy. The subscriber, on the other hand, tends to be older by
five or six or more years and is interested in issues like stress
reduction, nutrition and weight loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Lafavore also noted that the older subscriber might not want a
magazine brandishing a provocative cover line with an inch-high
``X'' arriving at his home or office. (The article titled ``Put
More X in Your Sex,'' which appears in both editions, is about
herbal supplements that may help elevate the sex drive.)
</P>
<P>
   Men's Health, which is published by Rodale Press Inc., has
strong newsstand sales. Through June 30, each issue sold an average
of 385,227 copies on the newsstand out of a total circulation of
1,587,573, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. Lafavore
said the magazine's September issue sold 550,000 copies on the
newsstand. (During the first half of this year, Men's Journal,
published by Wenner Media, sold 76,220 copies on the newsstand out
of a total circulation of 490,723; Esquire, from Hearst Corp., sold
84,066 copies on the newsstand out of a total of 672,073.)
</P>
<P>
   Lafavore and his editorial staff think up the magazine's
eye-catching cover lines before they assign the stories to
accompany them. ``If I come up with a great cover line, I'll talk
to the editors and say, `Is this a story?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The picture will catch your eye, but you're not going to sell
half a million copies on the newsstand with a pretty picture. You
do that by selling really hard,'' he said. ``My father was a used
car salesman, so I admit I have a little bit of that in my blood.''

IN NEW ORLEANS, A DAY FOR VISITING THE DEAD

 By RICK BRAGG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ In a graveyard where rows of crosses lean left and
right, where one-inch-thin marble headstones bow to the dirt or
tilt toward the sky and misspelled missives to the dead are inked
onto rotted plywood markers, Cleveland Cobb spent a long time
making sure he got the flowers just right.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb, 75, first pounded the dirt of the family plot as smooth as
he could with the flat of his shovel, then, with his hands, scooped
a hollow place just big enough to root a small clutch of white
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother,'' he said, in explanation. ``Mary. I like to see
her grave looking good. Nothing else I can do for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Her headstone bears other names. Here, in this obscure cemetery
in a city that lists its graveyards in tourist guidebooks because
of their beauty and history, the dead are housed not in ornate
crypts but buried in the soil, the bones of generations _ six,
eight, more _ mingling in a single hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a daughter in here, too,'' Cobb said. ``She was 12, no,
she was 7. Got hit by a car.'' He poured some water on the flowers,
perfectly straight, and after a little while he looked up,
embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he said, ``why can't I recall that child's name?''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as if in penance, he went back to his knees and fussed
some more with the little rectangle of dirt in Holt Cemetery, where
his family, too many to recall, sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was All Saints' Day, a day to honor the dead, and in New
Orleans this Roman Catholic holiday is embraced by Protestants,
Jews, everyone, it seems. People bring food, sit in the shade and
visit in the long, granite rows of old and new crypts, what people
here call cities of the dead. Because the water table is only a few
feet beneath the surface, it is necessary to inter most people
above ground _ everyone except the poor, who must rest in the muck.
</P>
<P>
   Marble and granite are expensive, but dirt is just dirt. Here in
Holt Cemetery, established as a boneyard for paupers in 1879,
people like Cobb cannot change the fact that, in death as in life,
people with money can sleep easier. But all around this ragged
place on this day for the dead are signs of love, honor and
respect, signs that rival anything the richer people do in their
manicured cities of fresh-cut flowers on polished stone.
</P>
<P>
   If richer, older cemeteries are a record of New Orleans society,
Holt Cemetery is a symbol of its potholed streets, its peeling
shotgun houses, its un-air-conditioned churches, bingo halls,
blue-collar social clubs and beer joints.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few steps from where Cobb, a retired truck driver, knelt
by his mother and daughter, 75-year-old Luella Marshall limped
slowly away from a small but brand-new brass headstone inscribed
with her husband's name. A young man, one of her great-nephews,
held her hand, steadying her.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my husband was the one living, I know he'd be out here
today, seeing about me,'' said Mrs. Marshall, whose husband died
last year from a blood clot.
</P>
<P>
   The gleaming headstone _ ``Edward Marshall, U.S. Army, World War
II, Born Oct. 7, 1927, Died June 27, 1997'' _ tells only a little
about him. In the hot sun of the afternoon _ the only shade here is
from a few oaks, gnarled with age, shrouded in Spanish moss but fed
by soil enriched with an untold bounty of bodies _ she told the
things about him that mattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a beautiful man,'' Mrs. Marshall said. ``He treated me
like a baby. If we was ever in the house, we was in the same room,
always together. If I washed the clothes, he'd put them on the
line. If we cooked, he'd cook one thing and I'd cook another thing,
just so we could be in the kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   Her arthritis is so bad now, she said, it is hard to tend the
graves right, to make this annual trek to pull weeds and smooth the
ground over her husband and other people she loves. But Mrs.
Marshall, who spent her lifetime caring for other people's children
and ailing loved ones as what she calls ``a sitter,'' swears she
will find a way to care a little while longer for the man who made
life sweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I can put one foot down in front of the other, I
will be out here to visit my husband,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband's marker was designed to be laid flat on the ground,
but she has it propped up, so people can see it better.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans, as poets and other intellectuals have often
written, has seen more death than most other American cities,
perhaps because it predates them, because disease, floods, storms
and war have ravaged the city since its beginning, in the early
1700s.
</P>
<P>
   Holt is a relatively new cemetery, having been built in the late
part of the 19th century, but here are thousands of graves and
uncounted bodies buried one atop the other. People tending the
graves said a family has to wait at least two years before burying
someone in the same plot in the city-owned graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can put them in, as their bones decay,'' said Sidney
Scott, as he painstakingly used gold paint and a tiny brush to
trace the names of a faded, weather-worn headstone. ``Some people
call it a potter's field, but that's not what it is.'' That would
mean the people buried here were unwanted, forgotten, and that
would be wrong, said Scott, a maintenance man at a church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Momma and Daddy taught me to love,'' he said, when asked why
he came out each year on All Saints' Day to make these graves look
nice, to make them look remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Scott, his father, died in 1958. Since then, Scott's
father has been joined in that grave by a grandmother, two brothers
and a niece. Because almost every inch of ground is used, only the
people whose families are buried here can bury others here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they like it,'' Scott said, as he finished painting in
the names. He was referring to the dead. ``At least, no one's come
back and told me they didn't.'' He smiled at that.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   People used to do more, on All Saints' Day and the days leading
up to it, said Lillie Lewis, 72, and her sister, Ara Dozier, 74.
They came to tend the grave that holds their mother, two
grandmothers, a brother, another brother's first wife and ``two
babies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord took them,'' Ms. Dozier said.
</P>
<P>
   She promised her mother, before her death, she would tend the
graves on All Saints' Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Momma used to drive us here, and we'd have a picnic and stay
all day,'' Ms. Dozier said. The cemetery would be crowded with
people, eating, talking, enjoying life as they remembered the lives
of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   People still do, but not as much. ``They come but they don't
stay,'' Ms. Dozier said.
</P>
<P>
   She remembered a sweet potato vine that used to grow here. She
wondered if it was still there.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people here, there seemed no sadness in them. Mourning
is not what All Saints' Day is for, people said, certainly not
here, where people leave behind bingo cards and even a loved one's
favorite beer _ emptied, of course _ on the graves.
</P>
<P>
   As the two elderly sisters walked to their cars, they joked like
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``She,'' Mrs. Lewis said of her sister, ``is an old maid
schoolteacher.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She,'' Ms. Dozier said of her sister, ``is not right, and has
been that way all her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the burials here have far outnumbered the changes to the
headstones, because it is impossible to tell where one grave ends
and another begins, there is no telling how many people have been
put here and forgotten. Once, stillborn babies and even body parts
from surgeries were buried here, a less than dignified place, some
people might believe, for a loved one.
</P>
<P>
   But in this place where bones and memories mingle, where people
work so hard to smooth the dirt and get flowers to grow straight
and sometimes just remember a forgotten name, the dignity is in not
letting the weeds and complacency claim the simple plots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing,'' said Cleveland Cobb, ``I look forward to.''

ISRAEL HOLDS FIRST NATIONAL MEMORIAL DAY FOR ASSASSINATED PRIME
MINISTER RABIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Three years after the assassination of Yitzhak
Rabin, Israel held its first nationwide memorial for the former
prime minister on Sunday, signaling a concerted effort to transform
him from a partisan hero into a figure of consensus _ a national
symbol of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Schoolchildren wore white as they do on Holocaust Remembrance
Day. Flags flew at half-staff. Radio stations played mournful
music. On order from the Education Ministry, which is controlled by
the right-wing National Religious Party, all schools taught Rabin's
biography as the history lesson of the day.
</P>
<P>
   And politicians of all stripes gathered by his grave in the
military cemetery at Mount Herzl in Jerusalem, broadening the
mourning that has been the domain only of centrists and leftists _
the advocates of peace with the Palestinians _ until this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Israelis vented their feelings in discussion groups
around the country, it seemed clear that the trauma of the
assassination remains at least partly undigested and unresolved as
is the fate of the peace accord that Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu signed. Even on Sunday, the conflict was expressed not
only in lofty debates about the importance of the act of
remembering in Jewish history but, right at Rabin's graveside, in
partisanship and petty political wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our society has grown neither more tolerant, nor less violent
or more politically mature as a result of the infamous, cataclysmic
murder and everything that took place in its aftermath,'' David
Weinberg, a spokesman for the university where Rabin's assassin
studied, wrote in The Jerusalem Post on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   When Netanyahu laid a wreath on Rabin's grave, he was heckled by
left-wing protesters, who shouted, ``Inciter, inciter of murder!''
until they were dragged away by secret service agents. They were
referring to Netanyahu's anti-government language in the months
preceding the assassination, which some Israelis, particularly
Rabin's widow, blame for fueling the angry climate that inspired
the assassin, a young religious Jew named Yigal Amir.
</P>
<P>
   In one more sign that Israel is still trying to fix precise
legal blame for the assassination, the attorney general indicated
late last week that he is going to move this week to prosecute a
former general security services agent, Avishai Raviv, who may have
known of Amir's intentions, for failing to prevent Rabin's murder.
</P>
<P>
   The Rabin memorial began Saturday night, when about 200,000
Israelis gathered in Tel Aviv at the square where he was killed on
Nov. 4, 1995. Holding candles, they waved banners contending that
Rabin's peace efforts had been vindicated by Netanyahu's signing of
the accord in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was murdered but he was right,'' Shimon Peres, the former
prime minister who served as foreign minister under Rabin, shouted
to cheers.
</P>
<P>
   But Netanyahu walked a fine line between honoring the slain
leader and distancing himself from what many in the nation see as
Rabin's most significant accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Tsahi Hanegbi, the justice minister and a member of the prime
minister's Likud Party, sniped at him for failing to credit _ much
less to mention _ Rabin in the signing ceremony at the White House.
Netanyahu retorted by reiterating that he disdained the interim
peace agreement negotiated by the former prime minister in Oslo.
``We are honoring it due to international obligations, while
reducing its damages,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As he stepped closer to carrying out the peace accord, which is
due to take effect Monday, Netanyahu moved Sunday to assuage his
former right-wing allies, now his critics, by taking what could be
considered unilateral acts in violation of the accord's spirit.
</P>
<P>
   He approved a 200-apartment addition to the West Bank Jewish
settlement of Kiryat Arba, outside Hebron, in response to the
killing of one of its residents last week. And his government
tolerated, at least for the night, a trailer park encampment of
Jewish settlers that took over a hillside north of Ramallah Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, at a special session of Parliament to remember
Rabin, Netanyahu _ who failed to shake the hand of Rabin's widow at
the cemetery Sunday _ sounded a more conciliatory note toward his
fellow Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray and wish that we can reach out to one another and put
out together the flame of hatred,'' he said, ``without bleaching
out the differences of opinion between us because peace is made
first with brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   In a clear rebuke to Netanyahu, Leah Rabin, Rabin's widow, chose
Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, the former army chief of staff, to deliver the
graveside address at Mount Herzl on Sunday. Lipkin-Shahak has yet
to throw his hat into the political ring, but he is considered to
be one of the few potential candidates for prime minister who could
beat Netanyahu.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In what amounted to Lipkin-Shahak's first national political
address, many saw a subtle gibe at Netanyahu. ``We apologize for
not understanding what could happen in the midst of us,'' he said,
as if addressing Rabin. ``We apologize that there are those among
us who will not ask forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Leah Rabin considers herself ``a living memorial for Yitzhak,''
as she said in a newspaper interview in the daily Haaretz over the
weekend. There is a considerable effort, almost an industry, as
well, devoted to keeping alive his memory.
</P>
<P>
   Cars throughout the country are plastered with bumper stickers
reading ``Shalom, chaver,'' or ``Good-bye, friend,'' the words that
President Clinton spoke at Rabin's funeral. Statuettes of Rabin
sell for about $180, minus shipping and handling. The Rabin
Institute has recreated his study, complete with trophies and
ashtray, which opened Sunday for two weeks at the Labor Party
headquarters in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   The Education Ministry gathered hundreds of the country's high
school leaders, from religious scouts to kibbutzniks, at the
Jerusalem Theater Sunday for a televised memorial service and to
vent their feelings about Rabin's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we kids have gotten over it too fast,'' said Dorit
Benzion, 17, of Rishon Letzion. ``There's this one day of the year
to remind us, but nobody learns the lesson. You see it in the
everyday violence, in the relations between kids. I think they need
to give us classes in democracy and tolerance, starting in
kindergarten.''
</P>
<P>
   Many said they heard in the criticism that has been directed at
Netanyahu for signing the peace agreement an echo of the hatred
that had been aimed at Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   At one of the many discussion arenas, a tent near the cemetery,
a moderate Orthodox rabbi who supports the peace effort, Yehuda
Amital, said he did not feel that Israeli society had learned any
lesson from the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, the second assassination is easier than the first,''
he said. ``There is even a higher chance that it will happen again
because from a psychological point of view, it has already been
done.''

ADAMS ASKS IRA NOT TO RETALIATE FOR KILLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the Irish Republican Army, said Sunday that he
would appeal to the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic guerrilla
organization not to retaliate for the killing, apparently by
Protestants, of a Catholic man in Belfast early Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The death heightened tension around the stalled Northern Ireland
peace effort, already bogged down over the issue of IRA disarmament
and the formation of a new provisional government to enact the
peace agreement approved in the spring. Sinn Fein has been excluded
from cabinet positions until the IRA begins to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   A small Protestant paramilitary group, the Red Hand Defenders,
asserted responsibility for Saturday's killing of Brian Service,
35, in a phone call Sunday to a Belfast news reporter. Ulster
police said they were also investigating whether another group, the
Red Hand Commando, had killed Service, who was shot in the head
several times in a Catholic area of North Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, asked on Irish national radio whether the IRA would now
break its 15-month cease-fire, said, ``I don't know and I will use
all of my influence and all the influence Sinn Fein have'' to
prevent a settling of scores. Earlier, the Sinn Fein chairman,
Mitchell McLaughlin, had said the new killing ``could return us to
the horrors of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The slain man's family said it did not want Catholic militants
to retaliate. Irish and British officials echoed the appeal a day
ahead of a trip to Belfast by the Irish prime minister, Bertie
Ahern, the latest attempt to end the disarmament deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   Service's death was the 55th sectarian killing this year, and
the first since Oct. 6, when a police officer was killed as
Protestant demonstrators attacked police with homemade bombs during
a melee in Portadown, west of Belfast. Before that, in August, 29
people were killed in the town of Omagh, by a bomb planted by a
splinter Catholic paramilitary group, the Real IRA.
</P>
<P>
   The killing followed by three days the announcement by a
Protestant group, the Loyalist Volunteer Force, that it had
renounced violence. That had buoyed public and official hopes,
dashed anew by Saturday's death.
</P>
<P>
   Adams urged the British, Irish and American governments to
intervene to break the deadlock over IRA disarmament and said that
David Trimble, the Protestant first minister of the new Northern
Ireland Assembly, was blocking Sinn Fein from cabinet positions in
the new provisional government, which is to assume early next year
authority now exercised by Britain.
</P>
<P>
   In Belfast Monday, Ahern wants to try to arrange a compromise on
the cabinet issue and to work on establishment of a new North-South
Ministerial Council, which would give the Irish Republic more
influence in northern affairs.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two weeks down, two months until the Pac-10 season
begins. A few impressions from Pauley Pavilion:
</P>
<P>
   __ Sophomore guard Earl Watson is UCLA's most improved player _
bigger, stronger, more confident and not afraid to direct traffic.
Through four scrimmages, Watson has 186 points in UCLA's elaborate
Performance Rating Index _ almost double his closest competitor.
</P>
<P>
   __ When Watson isn't correcting and inspiring the freshmen,
sophomore forward Rico Hines is.
</P>
<P>
   __ Freshman forward Jerome Moiso is highly skilled but passive.
</P>
<P>
   __ Freshman center Dan Gadzuric is aggressive but raw. Two
halves of the whole.
</P>
<P>
   __ Sophomore forward Travis Reed is both skilled and aggressive,
but he's only 6-6.
</P>
<P>
   __ Freshman forward JaRon Rush will lead the Bruins in scoring _
when he's ready for action, that is. Rush has practiced sparingly
because of a sprained knee.
</P>
<P>
   __ Guard Baron Davis has not regained his freshman form and
won't be ready for the Nov. 19 season opener against Santa Clara.
He'll have the knee examined this week.
</P>
<P>
   __ Assistant coaches Jim Saia, Michael Holton and Steve Spencer
are more vocal and less tolerant of mistakes than they were with
Jim Harrick's players.
</P>
<P>
   __ Senior guard Brandon Loyd reported for practice in the best
shape of his life, then caught the flu and hasn't done much since.
</P>
<P>
   __ Although he's a walk-on, sophomore guard Ryan Bailey is
competing for a spot in the rotation. Bailey, brother of Toby, is
one of UCLA's most experienced players, having spent his freshman
season as a starter at Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   __ Freshman guard Ray Young is not ready to contribute, but
freshman forward Matt Barnes has been a pleasant surprise.
</P>
<P>
   One guess on the starting lineup against Santa Clara: Watson,
Reed, Rush, Gadzuric and Hines.
</P>
<P>
   __ Walking wounded: Despite a 14-man roster, the Bruins have so
many sprains and strains, Holton and Spencer were forced to
participate in a five-on-five scrimmage Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The wounded include Davis, Rush, Young (ankle), Hines (knee) and
sophomore guard Billy Knight (groin). None of the injuries is
considered serious, save Davis' surgically repaired knee.
</P>
<P>
   __ Men in black: Coach Steve Lavin confirmed the Bruins will
wear black uniforms for selected road games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding? I'd get crucified if we did that at home,''
Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Women in blue: The UCLA women's team begins exhibition play
Tuesday at 7 p.m. at Pauley Pavilion against Riverdale, an
Australian club team. The Bruins are ranked as high as fourth in
preseason polls.
</P>
<P>
   __ On the schedule: Bruin Basketball Preview Day is Sunday at
Pauley, with doors opening at 1:15 p.m. and activities beginning at
1:50. The men's and women's teams will scrimmage, followed by a
3-point shooting contest and autograph sessions.

TEXANS WANT TO USE BUDGET SURPLUS FOR EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE AND
ANTI-CRIME EFFORTS, POLL FINDS
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN W. GONZALEZ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1998 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle Austin Bureau
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
AUSTIN _ If Texans had their druthers, they'd use the state's
projected budget surplus to improve education and health care,
fight crime and lower taxes in coming years, according to the Texas
Poll.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, a budget-writing legislator last week cautioned the public
not to expect radically improved programs or windfall tax breaks.
Most of the surplus will be needed to keep pace with population
growth and the ensuing demand for basic services, the lawmaker
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the state's latest revenue projection, legislators
who convene in January could have an extra $3.7 billion at their
disposal at the end of fiscal 1999 and perhaps an equal amount in
fiscal 2000. However, the June estimate did not take into account
the financial losses caused by this year's drought, nor the Asian
financial turbulence that continues to adversely affect the state's
multibillion-dollar investment funds.
</P>
<P>
   A more definitive assessment will be rendered, as required by
the Texas Constitution, before the Legislature convenes.
</P>
<P>
   The state budget for the current two-year spending cycle, which
ends Aug. 31, 1999, is about $85 billion, so a $3 billion surplus
represents a relatively small increase in income when spread over
two years. Yet, lobbying is well under way by special-interest
groups that want to devote more money to historically under-funded
services, such as child protective services, as well as new
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Texans polled last month indicated that they want any spare
money applied to the most basic concepts and services _ improving
education, helping the poor, fixing roads, lowering state taxes and
even enhancing federal Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   When offered four possible options for spending the extra
income, the most popular choice was to boost education, with 92
percent of those queried stating they agreed with that notion. Next
came improving health care and fighting crime, both registering 79
percent support. Then came cutting taxes, backed by 64 percent of
those polled.
</P>
<P>
   Education also surfaced as the biggest concern when people were
asked to volunteer the topic they thought deserved the most
attention from the Legislature. Education also topped the list when
those polled were asked, without prompting, to suggest their top
priority for applying the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The Scripps Howard Texas Poll of 1,009 adults was conducted Oct.
5-18, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters said the across-the-board support for using the
surplus to improve education was found in all regions of the state,
income brackets and age groups.
</P>
<P>
   Other suggested uses for the surplus had different followings,
the pollsters said. For example, those advocating using the surplus
to improve health care tended to be under 40 years of age, blacks
and Hispanics, Democrats, women and those living in West Texas and
South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Those who support applying any surplus to crime prevention were
mainly under age 40, Hispanics, Republicans and South Texans,
pollsters said.
</P>
<P>
   The June surplus estimate was based on projections that Texans'
personal income would grow by 7.5 percent this year. With more
income, Texans are presumed to be spending more, producing more
sales-tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The rosy outlook contrasts with the era of budget shortfalls in
the early part of this decade. As recently as 1991, when the state
was mired in litigation over school-funding disparities and prison
overcrowding, lawmakers were confronted with a $4.5-billion
shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, even a modest surplus projection causes the public
_ and their lawmakers _ to dream of myriad ways to spend it. But
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Bill Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant,
provided a reality check last week.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association,
Ratliffe cautioned Texans to beware of exaggerated surplus
projections and he indicated that the bottom line won't provide for
any pork-barrel projects.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff told the Houston Chronicle that the preliminary revenue
estimate by Comptroller John Sharp should not be confused with the
budget surplus that will be calculated at the end of the year. And
whatever that amount is, much of it is spoken for, Ratliff said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My point is, now people have begun to talk about $6 billion
and $7 billion surpluses, as if all of that can be spent for
discretionary increases. At least half of that will have to be
spent just staying up with the growth of the state's population,
whether its public school children or higher-education students or
nursing home residents or children in need of protection,'' Ratliff
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when we truly talk about surplus, we're talking about
probably $2.7 billion to $3.6 billion. I'm just trying to get
refocused and get some sobriety in this conversation,'' he said,
adding, ``but there are as many (spending) plans out there as there
are legislators.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff predicted there will be efforts in the Legislature to
provide tax breaks, ``but the bulk of any tax relief will be in the
form of putting state money into public education, which will allow
local school districts to lower their property taxes.''

<P>
   Almost out of thin air and certainly right out of the American
marathoners' glory days, Joan Benoit Samuelson appeared at the
finish line early Sunday afternoon in Central Park, a cramping
inspiration to the aging athlete, and graying soccer moms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first I heard of her running is now,'' said Allan
Steinfeld, the New York Marathon director, smiling as if, by
chance, he'd run into an old friend on a mobbed Manhattan street.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Samuelson run, but she finished, and not only did
she finish, but she ran 12th, ahead of Anne Marie Lauck, the
29-year-old New Jerseyan who was 10th in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
That cut to the heart of why Samuelson left her husband and two
children back in Freeport, Me., even missing Saturday's soccer
tournament for a marathon she once ``swore up and down'' she would
never run again.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted the mandatory sub-2-hour-50-minute Olympic trials
qualifying time. In the year 2000, when she will be 43 years old
and 16 years removed from her 1984 gold medal in Los Angeles, she
wishes to chase another 26.2-mile dream. At the finish in 2:41.06,
where not even Steinfeld expected her, Samuelson calmly slowed to a
walk, hands on hips. She did not have to check her watch to know
she had the time she'd come for.
</P>
<P>
   She headed straight for a massage table in the elite runners'
area, the rehabilitative reward she had proved to herself she still
deserved. The Olympic trials for Sydney are a long way off, but the
tribulations of running New York's grueling course demanded
immediate care. On her stomach, fumbling with the wrapper of a
miniature candy bar, Samuelson asked the volunteer trainer, ``Do
you feel it?''
</P>
<P>
   The trainer, working on her right calf muscle, located the
throbbing spot. ``It feels like a piano string,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another runner named Gillian Horovitz walked slowly up to the
table in one of those shiny post-marathon wraps and greeted
Samuelson with a warm smile. Horovitz, 43, had managed a pretty
fair performance herself, 19th place. She said even she had had no
idea her friend of 20 years was running until the elite runners
gathered on the Staten Island side of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Samuelson looked up at Horovitz and said: ``I made it without
stopping. How about that?''
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, she made it without being knocked over by a clumsy
if well-intentioned volunteer. These things happen in marathons,
especially in crowded, chaotic streets like New York's. On a park
road Sunday, a man with his back turned came dangerously close to
wiping out all three men's leaders late in the race. Samuelson said
she, too, narrowly avoided a collision with another young volunteer
at about the 10-kilometer mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``His back was turned,'' she said. ``I said, `Not this time.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He zigged. She zagged, unlike 10 years ago, when a zealous man
dispensing water took Samuelson down in a frightening spill. She
got up to finish third but three years later, in her last marathon
here, there came another unfortunate development, extreme shortness
of breath past the finish line. Whether it was exhaustion or panic
or both, flashes of a tragically shortened motherhood scared her
out of New York, until recent plans to run a couple of other
less-daunting marathons fizzled. Suddenly, hesitatingly, Samuelson
was making unannounced plans to try New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never dropped out of a race but I didn't know if I could
go the distance,'' she said. ``I wanted to get the qualifying out
the way but I knew I was having trouble with cramping from my hip
down. It was haunting me. I was damned if I did and damned if I
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   You do not have to be 41, well past your athletic prime, to
finish a marathon in distress, as evidenced Sunday by the women's
world record holder, Tegla Loroupe. In a year when almost every
sport seems to have been dominated by superbly conditioned athletes
on the far side of the hill, Joan Benoit Samuelson ran pain-free
and proud Sunday for 22 miles, and a few miles from the park, found
herself 10th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting greedy there,'' she told Horovitz. ``Then I was
humbled.''
</P>
<P>
   She was talking about the cramps more than the competition. She
still managed to beat every American woman except Libbie Hickman,
who was sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids are barely 30,'' she said, suggesting that
seasoning is all they may need. The unavoidable reality is that no
American woman has since come close to what Samuelson did in Los
Angeles, when she was Joan Benoit, when she took on the great
Norwegians, Grete Waitz and Ingrid Kristiansen, and defeated both.
That was a long time ago, not likely to happen again. But Sunday
was a new day, time to prove you not have to be under 30 to make a
splash, to make enough news to phone home with.
</P>
<P>
   Samuelson's daughter, 11-year-old Abby, was first to hear that
her mother had accomplished her goal, then Andrew, who is 8. She
told them her place and time, the way they had reported their
soccer scores to her on Saturday night. She pressed the cellular
phone to her ear, and told her children she would catch an evening
plane to Boston, and would be home later that night.

HURRICANE DEATH TOLL: 800 AND RISING IN CENTRAL AMERICA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla.)   (jw) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The intense and widespread flooding that has followed in
the wake of Hurricane Mitch pushed the death toll in Central
America to more than 800 Sunday, and relief officials say that more
than a thousand people are still missing, their villages buried
under huge mud slides.
</P>
<P>
   In northwestern Nicaragua, more than 330 bodies entombed
overnight by one such avalanche were recovered during the day from
settlements at the foot of the Casita Volcano, near Posoltega,
about 45 miles northwest of Nicaragua, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing rainfall and extensive damage to roads and bridges
hampered relief efforts all over Nicaragua and Honduras, the
countries most severely affected by the powerful late-season storm.
Some residents were evacuated from the area around Posoltega when
rivers began rising late last week, but officials said they
expected the death toll in the area to rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some communities were completely destroyed,'' said Leonora
Rivera, a spokeswoman for the Nicaraguan Red Cross. ``The number of
dead will increase considerably once it stops raining and we can
get into isolated areas,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, areas east of Managua have been inundated by
rampaging flood waters, driving thousands from their homes. Lake
Managua and Lake Nicaragua, normally separated by a narrow strip of
land, have risen so much and so rapidly that they have merged,
leaving the town of Tipitapa and sections of the Pan-American
Highway under several feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not just this country, but all of Central America is cut
off,'' President Arnoldo Aleman of Nicaragua said in a televised
address in which he urged vulnerable people to seek shelter on high
ground. His Honduran counterpart, Carlos Flores, found himself
trapped in San Pedro Sula, an industrial city of 500,000 people,
cut off from the capital by flooding.
</P>
<P>
   With sustained winds of up to 180 mph at its peak, Mitch was by
far the strongest storm of the 1998 hurricane season, which
officially ended Sunday. But the bulk of the damage has occurred as
it diminished in recent days from a rare Category 5 storm, the most
severe on the Saffir-Simpson scale, to a tropical depression
stalled over the Gulf of Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   For several days, a strong front over the Gulf of Mexico
prevented the storm from pushing northward, thereby sparing Cancun
and the Yucatan Peninsula, which had been directly in the storm's
original path. As a result, heavy rains have fallen ceaselessly for
nearly a week not just in Honduras and Nicaragua, but throughout
Guatemala and El Salvador, both of which have also declared states
of national emergency, and in Belize.
</P>
<P>
   In some parts of Central America, rainfall exceeding two feet
was recorded in a single 24-hour period. With rivers already
overflowing in several nations, the National Hurricane Center here
on Sunday was predicting up to 10 more inches of rain for the
northern half of Central America, which was sure to make the
flooding and mud slides even worse.
</P>
<P>
   In Tegucigalpa, capital of Honduras and home to nearly a million
people, the raging waters of the Choluteca River swept away entire
neighborhoods over the weekend, as well as cars, trucks, trees,
power lines and livestock. More than 130 people were reported to
have drowned, and as residents fled or sought safety on roofs,
police reported that looters were raiding stores and homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The capital has been leveled,'' Mayor Cesar Castellanos said.
``Blocks and blocks of middle-class and poor neighborhoods, shops _
they have all been completely demolished.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The lightly populated Bay Islands, a favorite haunt of divers
about 30 miles off the northern coast of Honduras, appear to have
been especially hard hit. Over the weekend, a television crew flew
over the islands of Guanuja and Roatan, isolated from the mainland
for nearly a week, and filmed scenes of devastation: houses, hotels
and palm trees flattened and boats strewn about like toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forces of nature are hammering us in every inch of
national territory,'' said Gen. Mario Hung Pacheco, Honduran Armed
Forces commander.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Rodolfo Pacheco, chief of the Honduran Air Force, said:
``This is a catastrophe beyond measure. It's incredible. The entire
nation is in danger.''

<P>
   Spurred by fierce competition for students, colleges and
universities from Florida State to New York University are plunging
headlong into the rapidly evolving world of online education, a
world that barely existed five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, technologically adventurous professors worked
the Internet into their courses, posting the syllabus or readings,
sometimes responding to student queries. Some of the more
proficient put courses online. But only recently have universities
begun to offer whole programs and degrees on line, where a student
can sign up for a bachelor's, a master's or even a law degree _ the
1990s version of a correspondence course.
</P>
<P>
   No college can be certain whether the programs will attract
enough students to justify the considerable expense _ $50,000 or
more to create and support each class. But school officials say
that if they do not stake out territory in cyberspace now, someone
else will.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the hottest and most sweeping development I've ever
seen,'' said James H. Ryan, a vice president at Pennsylvania State
University, who has been in higher education for 35 years. ``It's
like being in a roller coaster; it's a thrill a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as universities stampede onto the Internet, significant
questions have yet to be answered. How good is the education? Who
owns the courses _ the university or the professors who create
them? How should faculty members be paid? What works best in online
teaching? And will a degree from a virtual university be worth the
actual paper it is printed on?
</P>
<P>
   Frank Mayadas, a program officer at the Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation in New York, which has financed programs to improve
online teaching, said the picture was mixed. Some online degrees,
like Stanford University's master's degree in electrical
engineering or Drexel University's masters in information systems,
are sound, Mayadas said. But he is skeptical that other offerings
will endure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The predictability we associate with higher education
institutions isn't there yet,'' he said, ``and it needs to be there
for this to become a credible source of education.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, online classes are a considerable step up from
correspondence schools. Internet bulletin boards function as
virtual classrooms for students and teachers who can participate at
any time, from anywhere, using a computer and a modem. Instructors
post lectures and assignments; students turn in papers and tests
and discuss their studies with classmates and professors in online
conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Acuna of Saugus, Calif., a 34-year-old mother with two
teen-agers who is working on a bachelor's degree from the
University of Phoenix, signs on almost every day to the Hewlett
Packard computer in her bedroom for a communications course. Her
professor is in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do a lot at night when my children are in bed,'' she said.
``That's the beauty of this stuff _ you can do it at 3 a.m.''
</P>

<P>
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how many colleges operate on the Internet.
But what is clear is that the trend is picking up speed nationwide:
</P>
<P>
   _ New York University announced this month an audacious plan to
create a profit-seeking subsidiary to market Internet courses. The
venture would allow NYU to raise millions of dollars through a
stock offering or private partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   _ The University of Phoenix, a for-profit behemoth that has
officials at many traditional universities scared because of its
rapid spread online, has nearly 5,000 students in its online
program, more than double the number two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   _ Western Governors University, an online college sponsored by
17 states and Guam, was started this fall to improve access to
college education for adults and to help accommodate an expected
crush of students without building classrooms. The university
offers associate's degrees in liberal arts and applied science.
</P>
<P>
   _ The California Virtual University, a consortium of nearly 100
California universities and colleges, opened this fall with more
than 1,600 online courses.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Open University _ Britain's 29-year-old pioneer in
distance education for college students _ has applied for American
accreditation and is striking cooperative agreements with
universities like Florida State University.
</P>
<P>
   _ Penn State established its online ``World Campus'' in February
with just four courses and expects to have 30 courses by next
February.
</P>
<P>
   _ Florida State will begin offering courses next fall for a
bachelor's degree, but will concentrate on course work for juniors
and seniors.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of online programs has many traditional
educators scratching their heads. A committee of the American
Association of University Professors concluded last year that
online learning could be ``a valuable pedagogical tool to increase
access to higher education.'' But it warned that developments could
compromise traditional notions of academic quality, academic
freedom, intellectual property rights and instructors' workloads
and compensation. In some cases, long-standing safeguards of
faculty members' rights may suffice, it said, but in others, those
protections may need reworking.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a traditional classroom course, for which a professor
creates and delivers each course, the professor becomes more
dispensable online after putting the course together in a form that
can be sent out again and again. Another instructor can be assigned
to answer questions and grade papers.
</P>
<P>
   Universities are creating different arrangements to determine
who owns what. Penn State, for example, is splitting revenues with
the faculty members who develop the courses and their departments,
while New York University says its new subsidiary will hold
ownership rights for the online courses.
</P>
<P>
   The student body for most online courses is part-time adults in
continuing education programs or full-time degree-seekers who take
most of their work in traditional classrooms. But the trend is to
make it possible to earn a degree online rather than just take a
few individual classes.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Carlo, a sophomore majoring in applied math and physics
at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, took a computer science
course online in the spring when he could not fit the regular
course into his schedule. He found the flexibility a mixed
blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice that you didn't have to be somewhere from 4 to
5:30 twice a week,'' Carlo said. ``The negative is that you really
have to keep on top of the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Acuna is using her computer for all of her courses. She said
she had always wanted a college degree. But as a single mother with
a full-time job as an operations manager for a retail chain with
night and weekend shifts, she could not commit to regular-class
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   She looked into several online programs before enrolling as a
business major at the University of Phoenix. At $370 a credit ($465
for graduate work), Phoenix charges more than the local community
college. Phoenix students typically take one course at a time for
five weeks, and then have a week off before starting the next.
</P>
<P>
   The only requirement Ms. Acuna was not able to fulfill at home
was the university's entrance examination, which she took at a
local school.
</P>
<P>
   In her current communications course she and her five classmates
write essays, read them and discuss them in teams _ but talk about
little else. There is no sense of a campus community, but she does
not mind.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Internet education is taking clearer shape, some
university officials are taking a closer look at the business
aspects.
</P>
<P>
   Active marketing is a major component of the NYU plan. Rather
than aiming to put all the courses it can on the Web, the
university is hoping to start with a dozen or so niche courses _
like computer and management courses that will be attractive to
people in industry. As these courses bring in revenues, others will
be added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online is a big, important field in higher education, but it
does not have a business model that works,'' said Gerald A. Heeger,
dean of Continuing and Professional Studies at NYU, who is
directing the university's new online enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dirty, little secret is that nobody's making any money,''
Heeger said. But someday they will, he added.

DISUNITED REBELS SHARE ONE GOAL: OUSTING KABILA

   GOMA, Congo _ There is not much in their resumes to unite the
leaders of the three-month-old rebellion in this huge, and hugely
combustible, nation at Africa's heart.
</P>
<P>
   Some are academics, exiles or idealists with ties to the United
States. Some are disaffected army commanders with their own ties to
neighboring countries. Some, like Kin-Kiey Mulumba, a dapper rebel
in a charcoal suit, served the enduring dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko,
then fled the capital last year when a new leader, Laurent Kabila,
rolled into power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I crossed the river in a canoe,'' Mulumba, 48, said, sounding
pleased with himself. ``Since that day, I've been fighting Kabila.
I think I was the first.''
</P>
<P>
   Their only clear bond is a common goal: that Kabila, whom they
accuse of becoming yet another dictator, must go.
</P>
<P>
   The question many Congolese _ as well as other nations watching
nervously _ ask is whether this hodgepodge of men, with divergent
histories and alliances, can make good on a promise that has rarely
been delivered in post-colonial Africa: to establish the kind of
representative democracy they claim to support. The question
becomes especially sharp given that many of the rebels this time
fought alongside Kabila last year.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the answer, the rebels have set into motion a struggle
that many experts say is widening into a major regional conflict as
Congo's neighbors have taken sides and sent in troops since the
rebellion ignited in August.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, a delegation of U.S. officials _ led by Susan E. Rice,
Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs _ left the capital
of Kinshasa after two days of talks aimed at heading off what Ms.
Rice recently warned could become ``Africa's first world war.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear if the visit produced any results.
But her trip came after several weeks of intensifying action, most
of it favoring the rebels, who now claim to control vast swaths of
territory housing about 20 million of Congo's roughly 50 million
people. Two weeks ago, they captured Kindu, a key garrison town for
Kabila that helped firm their grip on eastern Congo. Then one of
Kabila's closest allies, President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, sent
in several thousand more of his own combat troops to fight the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going east,'' Mugabe announced grandly as the rebels _
known as the Congolese Rally for Democracy _ appeared poised to
move toward the diamond mines near Mbuji-Mayi.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad have
officially sided with Kabila, with varying degrees of involvement.
On the rebels' side, Rwanda and Uganda _ which directed the
rebellion in 1996 and 1997 and helped propel Kabila to power _ are
widely assumed to be playing a major role in the fighting, though
each country has denied it.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has called for the withdrawal of all foreign
troops in Congo, and Ms. Rice is trying to find terms for a
cease-fire, even though Kabila has refused so far to speak with the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very worried about Congo,'' said a U.S. official who
spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``She's concerned that the
conflict appears to be widening, that more and more people are
getting involved.''
</P>
<P>
   A nation that is potentially one of Africa's richest _ its soil
runs deep with diamonds, gold, copper and cobalt _ Congo was ruled
and wrecked for 32 years under Mobutu's dictatorship. Its politics
are spectacularly complicated, in part because its borders are a
gathering ground for rebels fighting to overthrow other
governments, including those of Uganda, Rwanda, Angola and Sudan.
So each of those countries has a strategic interest in Congo's
rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   When skeptics both inside and outside of Congo talk about the
rebels _ based in this former resort town beside Lake Kivu on the
Rwandan border _ many argue that who they are is largely
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Critics claim the insurrection is actually being directed by
Uganda and Rwanda, as it was last time, when the armies of those
two countries moved into Congo, then known as Zaire, to secure
their own borders. Kabila, in fact, has shored up some public
support _ even here in the rebels' base _ by casting the uprising
as an ``invasion'' by the Tutsi-led government of Rwanda, hated by
many Congolese.
</P>
<P>
   But the rebels claim they are by no means puppets of their
neighbors and say they are working slowly to build the people's
trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to win because our cause is just,'' said the
rebels' military commander, Jean-Pierre Ondekane, 36, who was a top
military aide to Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Rwandans and the Ugandans were only interested in
their own borders. This struggle, he said, is about overthrowing
Kabila, who he said never delivered on his own promises of making
Congo a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the decision to start a war was a grave one,''
said Ondekane, who shed his fatigues on a recent morning for a
black Nike running suit and high-top sneakers. ``But when people
have been imprisoned in a dictatorship, they can decide to make the
supreme sacrifice with their lives.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   So far the rebels have painted their vision largely in general
terms, saying they want free elections, educational reform and a
government that rules Congo's diverse regional and ethnic groups
with fairer representation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something everybody wanted to have happened'' after
Kabila first came to power, said Jacques Depelchin, 56, one of the
top rebel leaders and a professor of African history who has taught
at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   But most rebellions promise much the same thing, and the
Congolese, as well as outside observers including American
officials, are looking for clues to what these rebels stand for and
who, precisely, they are. But that is proving difficult: It is
unclear exactly who is in charge of what they call their
``collective'' leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The official head is Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, a 56-year-old
academic who went to college in Michigan and whose wife still has
relatives in Detroit. Wamba, who taught for many years in Tanzania,
had been imprisoned twice by Mobutu.
</P>
<P>
   A question mark hovers over Wamba's influence: Some observers,
both in and outside of the rebellion, say that his role as
president is largely ceremonial. But last week he visited Zambia
and South Africa for talks with potential mediators in the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Other prominent members include: Arthur Z'Ahidi Ngoma, a former
UNESCO official who had been an outspoken Mobutu opponent; Bizima
Karaha, Kabila's former foreign minister who was trained as a
doctor in South Africa; and Lunda Bululu, a former prime minister
under Mobutu who later joined the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview here at Mobutu's former summer villa, Bululu
laid down two ways people could judge the rebellion: how the rebels
act in the territory they control and the record of their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people who have a reputation for keeping their
promises,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bululu's pledge of good behavior, aid agencies and local
people report kidnappings by rebel troops around Goma, and the
issue of their behavior seems to expose at least a small fissure in
what has been a united public front in the rebel leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Depelchin acknowledged that there had been cases of soldiers
taking ``justice into their own hands.'' He asserted that the
instances were few, but stemmed from a larger issue: a gap between
the military and the political wings.
</P>
<P>
   The military largely does what the politicians say, he said,
``but it's one thing to say, and it's another thing to do. There is
no need to hide it is an uphill battle.''

CHINA CLAMPS DOWN ON FOUNDER OF BANNED RESEARCH GROUP
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The founder of an independent research group that was
closed down by the government last week has been refused permission
to leave China, and his passport has been confiscated.
</P>
<P>
   Peng Ming, the leader of the China Development Union, was
stopped in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen on Saturday
evening as he tried to cross into Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   He had planned to travel on to the United States, where he had
been invited to speak at a luncheon seminar at Harvard University
and to a group of Chinese students at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese government has signed an international covenant on
human rights, and the ink has not yet dried,'' Peng said Sunday.
``And yet it continues with no reason whatsoever to hinder the
freedom of movement of its citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Peng, 42, a former government official and businessman, started
his unusual research organization earlier this year, exploring what
he calls ``green politics'' for ``sustainable development.'' The
group sponsored frequent seminars that discussed sensitive topics,
though, like the meaning of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the group has begun to enlist members in its
drive to become a force for change, and it says it has signed up
10,000 people in China and abroad. It is officially registered in
Hong Kong and does not have the normally required sponsorship of
the Communist Party or a government ministry.
</P>
<P>
   While Chinese have become much freer in their private and
economic lives in recent years, the Communist Party's restrictions
on political debate have loosened only modestly. Peng's treatment
is part of a recent pattern in which government agents harass or
temporarily detain those who try to organize political activities
outside the control of the party.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the group has had rocky going. Last summer
Peng tried to schedule a public debate with Fang Jue, a former
government official who had circulated a treatise on democracy in
China. But before the debate could be held, Fang was detained. He
remains in jail, although he has apparently not been tried or
sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, agents of the Beijing city government raided Peng's
organization, questioning him and others for hours and confiscating
the group's computers, software and documents. Peng called the
action illegal and vowed to continue, under the name of a related
organization, with research and seminars _ though not with the
effort to build a membership.
</P>
<P>
   Peng planned to travel for 25 days. After visiting Hong Kong, he
planned to go to the United States, Canada and Taiwan, where he
also had an invitation to speak, he said Sunday in a telephone
interview from Shenzhen. But when he tried to get to Hong Kong,
which is now officially part of China but has a separate
administration, his passport was declared invalid.
</P>
<P>
   Peng said he was held for four hours and told to return to
Beijing to discuss the passport problem. Officials told him it was
related to a civil lawsuit involving a government agency that first
sponsored, then disowned, his organization.

MEXICO CITY JOURNAL: LET'S DO LUNCH THE MODERN WAY: FAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ It's 3:30 p.m. and the Mexico City state's
attorney, Samuel del Villar, is seated at a conference table in a
meeting with a dozen subordinates. Nobody has eaten since
breakfast, if then. Stomachs are growling.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to go out to a restaurant for lunch. Instead, del
Villar says, ``Let's just eat here.'' Aides ferry in a tray of BLT
sandwiches, and the city's top prosecutors lick bacon drippings
from their fingers through a meeting that continues past 5.
</P>
<P>
   Del Villar's improvised meal one recent afternoon might seem
routine to Americans, but here it was a sign of a dramatic cultural
shift. Mexico City's leisurely lunch, which may wander for three
hours or more, from an opening tequila through several courses and
plenty of conversation, has been as characteristic of this capital
and its way of life as evening tapas are of Madrid and the
late-night churrasco dinner of Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   But many Mexico City residents are giving up the once-sacrosanct
tradition because, like del Villar, they have grown too busy, or
because they now follow an international corporate schedule, or
because they consider fast-food dining more efficient. Many
working-class Mexicans simply can no longer afford the slightest
culinary extravagance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been an enormous change,'' said Guillaume Martin, who
for 15 years has managed the Estoril restaurant, an elegant eatery
in the Polanco neighborhood frequented by executives and government
officials. ``When I started in this business, people would fill our
tables at 3, and many would still be seated at 7 or 8 p.m. drinking
cognac. Now by 5, practically everyone's left. Lunches are getting
earlier and shorter.''
</P>
<P>
   The meal is called la comida in Spanish, which is usually
translated as ``lunch.'' But don't confuse la comida with el
almuerzo, which also translates as lunch but is something quite
different, a mere late-morning snack, often a tamale purchased on
the street and gobbled on the run.
</P>
<P>
   La comida is the main culinary event of the day in a capital
city whose biorhythms have adapted to the singular schedule of the
vast government bureaucracy. Most middle or senior government
officials work from 9 or 10 a.m. until 3 p.m., break for lunch
until 6 p.m., and return to work until late evening, often until 10
or 11 p.m., even midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Within this peculiar schedule, officials or business people with
a generous expense account have over the years made the afternoon
meal a long feast. In its classic expression a few decades back,
senior functionaries would regularly begin with a plate of tacos,
graze their way through a rich soup, a steak, and a rice dish or
baked potato, and wash it all down with a few whiskys. Many would
only wobble back to work after sipping a cognac with espresso.
</P>
<P>
   Some social historians trace the meal's origin to Spain, where
public offices also shut down in late afternoon. But it has been
classically Mexican in its languorous pace and voluptuous
quantities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This long meal has been a form of compensation, a special
retribution for the suffering that you go through as a public
servant, ready to serve at any moment of day or night if the boss
calls,'' said Javier Gonzalez Rubio, who transferred to the private
sector recently after working for several years in the Mexican
White House, known as Los Pinos, as an aide to President Ernesto
Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has passed through years of economic crisis, and only the
most senior officials can today afford the long lunch in its
classic form. Lower and mid-level officials still keep the same
hours but eat simple food.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Becerra Marquez, the press coordinator to the borough
president of Mexico City's downtown Cuauhtemoc section, keeps a
typical schedule and eats like thousands of other government
employees. Breakfast is minimal, and he is at his desk before 9
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   One hectic recent afternoon he could not break away for lunch
until 4:30, when at an open-air corner eatery he ordered a peppery
tripe soup with tortillas, followed by a dessert of fried bananas.
He was back on the job by 6, worked until 10, and once at home, ate
a few tacos before bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many days, we're poorly fed,'' Becerra said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The corollary to the lavish lunch has been the abbreviated
breakfast. A 1997 study commissioned by McDonald's, which now has
52 restaurants in the Mexican capital, found that ``many people
here didn't eat breakfast at all,'' said Manuel Juarez Torres, a
company spokesman here. Seeing an opportunity, McDonald's has been
marketing a Mexicanized form of its McMuffin breakfasts with a
slogan that attacks Mexico City's long-lunch habit head on:
``Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   But traditions die hard, Juarez said. Most Mexico City residents
still plan their day around lunch, albeit one that is considerably
shorter than it was in its classic period, which most food experts
trace to the 1950s. The president then was Adolfo Ruiz Cortines, an
enthusiastic gourmand who made it his pattern to loiter at table
following the afternoon meal, calling for a set of dominoes and
playing a few rounds with his friends.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, aides to Zedillo count on one hand the times he has
spent the afternoon at a restaurant. A frugal man, Zedillo instead
almost always lunches in private at the presidential residence. He
has explained this as a preference for spending time with his
family. But his pattern seems to fit the national mood, in which
many Mexicans who live outside the capital view Mexico City's long
lunches as a sign of profligacy they associate with government
waste. People in Monterrey, Mexico's northern business capital, are
particularly critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``This long lunch originated with Mexico City's government
bureaucracy,'' said a business executive who is a Monterrey native
but now spends part of each week in Mexico City. ``Monterrey has a
business culture. Time is money. When you go to lunch, you arrive,
you order food and you talk business. Once that's over, you can
chat about other things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mexico City, the point is to build relationships with
influential people who can do favors for you, so you spend time
telling jokes and gossiping,'' he continued. ``You start lunch by
chatting about many topics other than the business at hand, then
you eat, and only at the end will anybody tell you what they really
wanted to talk to you about.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Three years after the assassination of Yitzhak
Rabin, Israel held its first nationwide memorial for the former
prime minister on Sunday, signaling a concerted effort to transform
him from a partisan hero into a figure of consensus _ a national
symbol of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Schoolchildren wore white as they do on Holocaust Remembrance
Day. Flags flew at half-staff. Radio stations played mournful
music. On order from the Education Ministry, which is controlled by
the right-wing National Religious Party, all schools taught Rabin's
biography as the history lesson of the day.
</P>
<P>
   And politicians of all stripes gathered by his grave in the
military cemetery at Mount Herzl in Jerusalem, broadening the
mourning that has been the domain only of centrists and leftists _
the advocates of peace with the Palestinians _ until this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Israelis vented their feelings in discussion groups
around the country, it seemed clear that the trauma of the
assassination remains at least partly undigested and unresolved as
is the fate of the peace accord that Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu signed. Even on Sunday, the conflict was expressed not
only in lofty debates about the importance of the act of
remembering in Jewish history but, right at Rabin's graveside, in
partisanship and petty political wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our society has grown neither more tolerant, nor less violent
or more politically mature as a result of the infamous, cataclysmic
murder and everything that took place in its aftermath,'' David
Weinberg, a spokesman for the university where Rabin's assassin
studied, wrote in The Jerusalem Post on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   When Netanyahu laid a wreath on Rabin's grave, he was heckled by
left-wing protesters, who shouted, ``Inciter, inciter of murder!''
until they were dragged away by secret service agents. They were
referring to Netanyahu's anti-government language in the months
preceding the assassination, which some Israelis, particularly
Rabin's widow, blame for fueling the angry climate that inspired
the assassin, a young religious Jew named Yigal Amir.
</P>
<P>
   In one more sign that Israel is still trying to fix precise
legal blame for the assassination, the attorney general indicated
late last week that he is going to move this week to prosecute a
former general security services agent, Avishai Raviv, who may have
known of Amir's intentions, for failing to prevent Rabin's murder.
</P>
<P>
   The Rabin memorial began Saturday night, when about 200,000
Israelis gathered in Tel Aviv at the square where he was killed on
Nov. 4, 1995. Holding candles, they waved banners contending that
Rabin's peace efforts had been vindicated by Netanyahu's signing of
the accord in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was murdered but he was right,'' Shimon Peres, the former
prime minister who served as foreign minister under Rabin, shouted
to cheers.
</P>
<P>
   But Netanyahu walked a fine line between honoring the slain
leader and distancing himself from what many in the nation see as
Rabin's most significant accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Tsahi Hanegbi, the justice minister and a member of the prime
minister's Likud Party, sniped at him for failing to credit _ much
less to mention _ Rabin in the signing ceremony at the White House.
Netanyahu retorted by reiterating that he disdained the interim
peace agreement negotiated by the former prime minister in Oslo.
``We are honoring it due to international obligations, while
reducing its damages,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As he stepped closer to carrying out the peace accord, which is
due to take effect Monday, Netanyahu moved Sunday to assuage his
former right-wing allies, now his critics, by taking what could be
considered unilateral acts in violation of the accord's spirit.
</P>
<P>
   He approved a 200-apartment addition to the West Bank Jewish
settlement of Kiryat Arba, outside Hebron, in response to the
killing of one of its residents last week. And his government
tolerated, at least for the night, a trailer park encampment of
Jewish settlers that took over a hillside north of Ramallah Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, at a special session of Parliament to remember
Rabin, Netanyahu _ who failed to shake the hand of Rabin's widow at
the cemetery Sunday _ sounded a more conciliatory note toward his
fellow Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray and wish that we can reach out to one another and put
out together the flame of hatred,'' he said, ``without bleaching
out the differences of opinion between us because peace is made
first with brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   In a clear rebuke to Netanyahu, Leah Rabin, Rabin's widow, chose
Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, the former army chief of staff, to deliver the
graveside address at Mount Herzl on Sunday. Lipkin-Shahak has yet
to throw his hat into the political ring, but he is considered to
be one of the few potential candidates for prime minister who could
beat Netanyahu.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In what amounted to Lipkin-Shahak's first national political
address, many saw a subtle gibe at Netanyahu. ``We apologize for
not understanding what could happen in the midst of us,'' he said,
as if addressing Rabin. ``We apologize that there are those among
us who will not ask forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Leah Rabin considers herself ``a living memorial for Yitzhak,''
as she said in a newspaper interview in the daily Haaretz over the
weekend. There is a considerable effort, almost an industry, as
well, devoted to keeping alive his memory.
</P>
<P>
   Cars throughout the country are plastered with bumper stickers
reading ``Shalom, chaver,'' or ``Good-bye, friend,'' the words that
President Clinton spoke at Rabin's funeral. Statuettes of Rabin
sell for about $180, minus shipping and handling. The Rabin
Institute has recreated his study, complete with trophies and
ashtray, which opened Sunday for two weeks at the Labor Party
headquarters in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   The Education Ministry gathered hundreds of the country's high
school leaders, from religious scouts to kibbutzniks, at the
Jerusalem Theater Sunday for a televised memorial service and to
vent their feelings about Rabin's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we kids have gotten over it too fast,'' said Dorit
Benzion, 17, of Rishon Letzion. ``There's this one day of the year
to remind us, but nobody learns the lesson. You see it in the
everyday violence, in the relations between kids. I think they need
to give us classes in democracy and tolerance, starting in
kindergarten.''
</P>
<P>
   Many said they heard in the criticism that has been directed at
Netanyahu for signing the peace agreement an echo of the hatred
that had been aimed at Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   At one of the many discussion arenas, a tent near the cemetery,
a moderate Orthodox rabbi who supports the peace effort, Yehuda
Amital, said he did not feel that Israeli society had learned any
lesson from the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, the second assassination is easier than the first,''
he said. ``There is even a higher chance that it will happen again
because from a psychological point of view, it has already been
done.''

CENSURE OF CLINTON MAY BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL, SCHOLARS WARN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla., Mass.)  (See related: CLINTON-HYDE) 
(js) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - As Congress ponders how to deal with the charges
against President Clinton, several prominent legal scholars are
warning that some of the proposals to censure the president in a
compromise to avoid impeachment may be unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School has been the most
vocal of those who have been saying that the Constitution appears
to prohibit Congress from pursuing some of the most talked-about
proposals, including enacting a bill that would censure Clinton and
impose a fine.
</P>
<P>
   Article One of the Constitution, which defines the powers of
Congress, forbids Congress from enacting any ``bill of attainder,''
a term historically taken to mean a legislative punishment of an
individual who is not a member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Congress decides that impeachment is the wrong path, people
might be inclined to gravitate to some sort of censure, but that
creates real problems with the Constitution,'' Tribe said in a
recent interview. He said legislation that would censure Clinton
and impose a fine to cover the cost of the independent counsel's
investigation of Clinton's misleading testimony in the Paula Jones
case would be flatly unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   He said censure alone would become even less certain because
that would raise the question of whether censure alone was a
punishment. Historically, punishment has been defined as the loss
of life, liberty or property.
</P>
<P>
   And to further complicate the issue, Tribe and others debating
the issue among themselves have wondered whether offering Clinton
something in return for his accepting censure, for example a
guarantee he would not be impeached or immunity from criminal
prosecution, would make the censure constitutional. In such a case,
they said, a bill could be viewed not as punishment, but rather
something that is, on balance, a benefit to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Vikram Amar of the University of California Law School
at Hastings said he agreed that a censure with a fine would be
prohibited as a bill of attainder. But Amar said that would only be
the case if the president objected. If Clinton agreed to accept a
vote of censure and even agreed to pay a fine, he said, that could
be the equivalent of a plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of censuring Clinton as an alternative to impeachment
has not gone much beyond the discussion stage. But White House
officials have indicated their eagerness to explore such proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The White House position was supported by former President
Gerald Ford in a New York Times op-ed article on Oct. 4, in which
he suggested that Clinton stand in the well of the House and be
publicly rebuked by members of both parties in place of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution provides for Congress to discipline its own
members and it used that provision in January 1997 when it
reprimanded and fined Speaker Newt Gingrich for ethical violations.
</P>
<P>
   Several law professors who study constitutional law said they
thought that with Clinton's consent, there would probably not be
any constitutional problems in any proposal of censure by Congress,
including Ford's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Professor John Hart Ely of the University of Miami Law School,
who has written extensively on the origins and uses of the bill of
attainder clause, said he thought ``the Constitution would go
unoffended'' if Congress struck a deal with Clinton. More
importantly, though, if Clinton agreed to accept some form of
punishment, Ely said, no one would have the authority to challenge
the deal in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Several scholars agreed that the only person who could challenge
a congressional action as a bill of attainder would be the person
named in the bill. ``The only obstacle to enacting an
unconstitutional measure in that case would be Congress itself,
whose members have taken an oath to uphold the Constitution,'' said
Amar.
</P>
<P>
   Tribe said, however, that even if no one had the right to
challenge a censure proposal it remains unclear whether a person
would be allowed to waive his right to be free of a bill of
attainder. The prohibition against bills of attainder, he said, is
a limit on Congress' powers. It comes from the reluctance of the
nation's founder to allow the legislative branch to punish people,
leaving that function to the executive branch. In that case, he
said, the person who is the subject of a bill of attainder might
decide not to allow Congress to expand its powers. ``The person
can't just say, `OK, hit me,' if Congress doesn't have that
authority,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tribe said there may be ways to overcome the constitutional
problems. In addition to giving Clinton some benefit to which he
would agree, Congress could couch its censure in the form of
separate resolutions in the House and the Senate. In that way, he
said, it might not be considered a bill.

   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ Building on his background as a popular
Democratic mayor of this Sunbelt city, Martin Chavez would like to
picture himself as New Mexico's future governor. But with his
wire-rimmed glasses and the beleaguered status of Democrats in the
region, political cartoonists might sketch him as a New Mexican
spotted owl.
</P>
<P>
   With Tuesday's election, Democratic governors in the interior
West risk falling in status from endangered to nearly extinct.
</P>
<P>
   In the 14-state area bounded by the Sierra Nevadas on the West
and the Missouri and Arkansas Rivers on the East, 11 of the
governors are Republicans. In two states with Democratic governors,
Colorado and Nevada, Republican candidates approach the elections
with thin leads in opinion polls. Only Nebraska, without a race for
governor this fall, is certain to have a Democratic governor next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Rocky Mountain area, it's tough, we just don't have the
kind of representation we used to,'' Roy Romer, Colorado's governor
and chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said last week,
while campaigning in Colorado for Gail Schoettler, the Democratic
candidate in the race to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, when Romer was first elected governor in 1986, the
Western Governors' Association was a Democratic club. Fifteen years
ago, only two states in the 14-state region, North Dakota and South
Dakota, had Republican governors.
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts attribute the change to ``the Valhalla
syndrome'' _ conservatives migrating here, fleeing social strife,
crime and congestion in California, Texas and other coastal states.
In Colorado, for every Democrat who moved to the state in the last
decade, two Republicans did. Evenly balanced only a decade ago,
voter registration in Colorado now favors the Republicans by
130,000 voters.
</P>
<P>
   Here in New Mexico, there are 60 percent more registered
Democrats than Republicans. But the governor, Gary Johnson, is a
Republican, and four members of the five-member congressional
delegation are Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a real change in New Mexico, we are becoming
more Republican in voting,'' said Chris Garcia, who has taught
political science at the University of New Mexico for the last 29
years. ``The people coming in from California and Texas are a lot
more conservative, more affluent, more likely to support the
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was speaking at the end of a campus forum, featuring the
two contenders, Chavez and Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the clearest philosophical choice between two
competing visions of government,'' the political scientist
continued. ``Martin Chavez is in the classical mold of New Deal
government and programs. Gary Johnson, in contrast, hews not only
to the traditional Republican view of low taxes, but extends into
libertarianism.''
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, Ms. Schoettler, who is the state's lieutenant
governor, often plays down her party affiliation and offers a
centrist, pragmatic approach. Her Republican opponent, Bill Owens,
is the state treasurer, and he offers white-collar, Christian
conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   In a measure of shifts in Colorado, The Denver Post, once the
state's liberal voice, endorsed Owens and almost all Republicans
running for Congress, including Bob Greenlee, the candidate to
represent the 2nd District, which includes Boulder. In the Senate
race, The Post editorial board endorsed Ben Nighthorse Campbell,
the Republican, spurning Democratic candidate Dottie Lamm, its
former columnist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a massive movement of people into Colorado and
New Mexico from California, and that has changed the political
complexion of those states,'' said Federico Pena, a Democrat and
former member of the Clinton Cabinet. Mayor of Denver in the
mid-1980s, Pena returned to Denver this fall to be an investment
banker, deflecting appeals from some Colorado Democrats that he run
for statewide office.
</P>
<P>
   In Nevada, the other interior Western state with a Democratic
governor, polls indicate that Kenny Guinn, the Republican
candidate, has a small edge over the Democrat, Jan Jones. In a
state where party registration is evenly split, Ms. Jones was mayor
of Las Vegas, Nevada's largest city. Guinn has been a banker, the
president of a gas corporation and a superintendent of schools.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, Dick Wadhams, campaign manager for Owens, said of the
shifts he has seen in recent decades: ``The generation of Democrats
that dominated the Rockies in the '70s and '80s has basically come
and gone. The West is becoming more conservative in its outlook.''

HAMAS GROUP THREATENS ARAFAT'S FORCES
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA, West Bank _ Lashing back at a crackdown by the Palestinian
Authority, the armed wing of the militant Islamic group Hamas
warned Sunday for the first time that it may turn its guns on
Yasser Arafat's police force.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian chief of police, Maj. Gen. Ghazi Jabali, said in
an interview that his men would respond, and he issued orders from
his Gaza headquarters to shoot at suspected assailants.
</P>
<P>
   The threat by the armed wing, known as the Qassam Brigades,
contradicted Hamas' longstanding position that it would avoid civil
war. And it signaled a deepening crisis with the Palestinian
Authority following the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian accord
in Washington last month.
</P>
<P>
   Under the accord, which takes effect on Monday, Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, made commitments to break up militant groups
planning anti-Israeli violence in return for an Israeli withdrawal
from a further 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Since a thwarted suicide car-bombing on an Israeli school bus in
the Gaza Strip on Thursday, in which an Israeli soldier was killed,
Palestinian police have rounded up an estimated 300 Hamas followers
and put the group's leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Phone links to Yassin's home have been cut, along with the
phones of several other political leaders of Hamas who were
detained but later released. Masked police officers searched the
sheik's home early Friday, seizing documents and confiscating
weapons from his bodyguards. Approaches to the house were blocked
Sunday by plainclothes officers armed with AK-47 rifles.
</P>
<P>
   Jabali said arrests were continuing in the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip and that 30 to 40 members of Hamas' armed wing were
being held. Police were searching for Muhammad Deif, a top Hamas
fugitive believed to have masterminded Thursday's bombing and a
series of other anti-Israeli attacks, Jabali said. The restrictions
on Yassin were imposed to prevent his ``incitement'' against the
Israeli-Palestinian accord in television interviews, the chief
added.
</P>
<P>
   A leaflet signed by the Qassam Brigades and sent to the Reuters
news agency in Jerusalem warned Sunday that continued
``repression'' by the Palestinian Authority ``may push many of the
sons of Hamas and its military wing, because of savage pressures,
to refuse the orders and instructions of their leadership and to
direct their war and guns, out of necessity, against the
authority's security apparatus.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaflet warned that the Palestinian security forces would
``not be safe from the anger of the revolutionaries rising up in
the face of merciless repression.''
</P>
<P>
   A prominent political leader of Hamas, Ismail Abu Shanab,
questioned the leaflet's authenticity and said that it contradicted
Hamas' policy. In an interview from Gaza with Qatari television,
Abu Shanab said that Hamas strategy ``seeks to spare the
Palestinian society the evil of fighting, regardless of
circumstances or causes.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interview last week, Abu Shanab maintained that a
Palestinian police crackdown on Hamas would lead to increased
attacks on Israel, but not to civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Vowing that ``we will not stop our martyrdom operations anywhere
on occupied land,'' the Qassam Brigades warned in the leaflet that
attacks would continue until ``the withdrawal of the last settler
from our holy land.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Our coming military strikes will show them true bitterness,''
the leaflet added.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at his Gaza headquarters, Jabali promised a
swift response to the threat of armed resistance. ``If they direct
their weapons against any police, we are always strugglers, and we
are not afraid of their guns,'' he said. ``We can react to them.''
</P>
<P>
   To prove his point, Jabali called his operations room to give an
order: ``If anyone from the Qassam Brigades gets near a police
officer, shoot him in the legs!''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing statements by Arafat, Jabali called Thursday's attack an
an act of ``treason'' that harmed Palestinian interests. By
jeopardizing gains from agreements with Israel and by provoking
Israeli border closures, such attacks ``destroy our national
enterprise and hurt our economy,'' Jabali said.
</P>
<P>
   Jabali identified the suicide attacker on Thursday as Suhayb
Abdel Rahman Timraz, 19, a high school student from the Jabalya
refugee camp near Gaza. His relatives, waiting final results of DNA
tests to confirm his identity, said Sunday that he had disappeared
from his poverty-stricken home a few days ago, saying nothing about
his destination.
</P>
<P>
   Jabali read a hand-written message he said had been found during
a search of Timraz's papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgive me, brothers, that I did not tell you that I will go
to heaven,'' the message said. ``I will meet God and his prophet.''

U.S. SIGNS SECURITY ACCORD WITH ISRAEL
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyhau signed an agreement during the weekend that officials in
both countries described as a significant strengthening of the
American commitment to safeguard Israel's security from the threats
of a post-Soviet world.
</P>
<P>
   Those threats _ from nuclear, chemical and biological weapons _
stem mostly from regional rivals like Iraq and Iran, which are also
rapidly developing intermediate and even strategic-range missiles
that can deliver such weapons to Israeli cities.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis fired primitive missiles against Israeli cities
during the Persian Gulf War in 1991. The Syrians, too, possess a
large arsenal of enhanced Scud missiles that can hit Israel, and
have an advanced chemical weapons program that may exceed that of
Iran or Iraq, Israeli officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The ``memorandum of agreement'' binds the United States to
enhance Israel's ``defensive and deterrent capabilities'' and to
upgrade the already extensive strategic, military and technical
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   And it commits Washington to prompt consultations about what
support or assistance, ``diplomatic or otherwise,'' it can lend
Israel in the face of ``direct threats to Israel's security arising
from the regional deployment of ballistic missiles of intermediate
range or greater'' _ from 500 kilometers (311 miles) or above.
Washington will view such threats ``with particular gravity,'' the
agreement says.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also pointed out that the United States, concerned
about the threat Iran and Iraq pose to its own interests, including
the security of moderate Arab states such as Saudi Arabia and the
gulf emirates, would also benefit from the enhanced security
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   While legally binding, the agreement does not require Senate
ratification, and it falls short of a defense treaty. Such a treaty
would be controversial in Israel, which maintains a doctrine of
self-reliance, has acted militarily in the past to pre-empt attack
and wants to maintain its freedom of action.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the deliberately vague language lies an important new
commitment, the officials say. ``Diplomatic or otherwise'' is a
clear reference to military assistance, and enhancing Israel's
``defensive and deterrent capabilities'' goes beyond cooperative
defensive programs, officials point out.
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum of agreement, which had been under discussion for
some time, was agreed on at the Wye River summit meeting last
month, and helped to persuade Israel to sign an interim agreement
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That agreement, after nine days of talks, provides a phased
Israeli withdrawal from 13 percent more of the West Bank in return
for specific Palestinian steps against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   While the Wye agreement was important for Israeli-Palestinian
peace, ``this memorandum shows once again that there may be more
serious concerns facing Israel and the United States in this part
of the world,'' said Zalman Shoval, Israel's ambassador in
Washington. ``The close cooperation between our countries goes
beyond the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Israel is one of America's closest allies, and
Washington is committed to preserving Israel's ``qualitative
military edge'' in the region. While it is assumed that Washington
would fight for Israel's survival, it is Israel's own ability to
deter and defeat those new threats that this pact will promote.
</P>
<P>
   Dore Gold, Israel's representative to the United Nations, said
the agreement pushes the strategic relations of the two countries
beyond ``the baseline'' established during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the peace process began in 1991, Iraq was a defeated
power, Iran was still recovering from its war with Iraq, and the
Soviet Union was falling apart,'' Gold said, adding that ``these
strategic conditions are changing now,'' especially with Iran's
development of ballistic missiles with the help of Russian
companies looking for profit.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Iran successfully tested its Shahab-3 missile, which
could reach Israel with its 800-mile range. It is developing a
Shahab-4 missile with a 1,200-mile range.
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, spokesman for the National Security Council, said
that the agreement was partly aimed at Iran. ``The urgency was
increased by Iran's test of the Shahab-3 last July,'' he said.
``This new effort will bring both sides together in a systematic
way.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement establishes a joint planning committee to
recommend new areas of cooperation and to study new technology
transfers to Israel, as well as ways to coordinate strategy to
respond to specific new threats.

 &HT;    Suspect formally charged in Atlanta hotel slayings
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa and David Pendered
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Harry Lee Johnson was stopped by police in Memphis for
driving 12 mph over the speed limit and soon found himself charged
with four Atlanta-area murders.
</P>
<P>
   Although police said Sunday they are still comparing the
fingerprints of the man who identified himself as Johnson and a
Stone Mountain man named Johnson, the man Shelby County sheriffs
arrested was formally charged Sunday with the murders of three men
in the Atlanta Hilton &AMP; Towers and another man at a College Park
Days Inn.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Police Maj. Mickey Lloyd said murder warrants were drawn
up Saturday afternoon and served on Harry Lee Johnson early Sunday
morning as Johnson sat in a jail cell at the Shelby County Justice
Center in downtown Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was stopped by two Shelby County sheriffs deputies
sometime after midnight this past Saturday. According to a police
report, deputies trailed Johnson for a quarter of a mile on I-40
east of Memphis until they finally pulled him over. They clocked
him driving 67 mph in a 55 mph zone, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   When he was stopped, deputies asked Johnson whether he had
anything illegal in his 1988 Chevy Celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The subject was extremely nervous and evasive during the
stop,'' wrote Shelby County Deputy Kelly Nichols. ``The officer
asked whether there was anything illegal in the vehicle and the
defendant stated he had a pistol in the glove box. A search
(consented) was conducted and the pistol was recovered and
defendant was arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   The weapon recovered was a .45-caliber handgun, Atlanta police
said this weekend. The gun has been sent to the GBI Crime Lab to
determine whether it is the same weapon used to kill Gerrold
Shropshire, 50, Ronald Gutkowski, 51, and Phillip Dover, 31, in the
Hilton; and Laderis Hawkins, 19, in College Park.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies found a lot more in Johnson's 10-year-old vehicle
bearing Georgia license plate number 522NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Besides small amounts of marijuana found in the trunk and a
trace of cocaine found in Johnson's wallet, Nichols and Shelby
County Sheriffs Sgt. Dave Edmonson also found various pieces of
identification belonging to Gutkowski, Dover, Hawkins and Linda
Forest Reid.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, of Greenville, S.C., is perhaps the only person alive who
can identify Johnson and help police tie the loose ends left in the
Atlanta and College Park slayings. Police think Johnson also
attacked Reid in her Cobb County Hilton hotel room on Oct. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby deputies Edmonson and Nichols contacted Reid early
Saturday morning after Johnson's arrest. They told her they had
found her credit card in Johnson's car. Reid then told the deputies
about the Atlanta and College Park killings.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd, College Park Police and Shelby County Sheriff's officials
said Sunday they were still not sure whether Johnson, 31, of Stone
Mountain, would be extradited to Atlanta sometime Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The same investigators said Georgia officers were questioning
Johnson and comparing fingerprint samples to determine whether the
man in custody was telling the truth about his identity. Atlanta
Police Chief Beverly Harvard said Johnson fits the ``general
description'' of a man captured on surveillance tape at the Hilton
the day of the downtown killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working on the extradition process right now,'' said
College Park Police Lt. Richard Chromi. We flew up some
fingerprints samples on Saturday afternoon and we hope to hear
something on Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   According to officials at the Shelby County jail, Johnson was
scheduled to appear at a hearing at 9 a.m. Monday in the Court of
General Sessions in Memphis. He was expected to answer to charges
lodged against him by Shelby County deputies for speeding, unlawful
possession of a weapon and unlawful possession of controlled
substances.
</P>
<P>
   College Park and Atlanta officials also requested that Shelby
County officials hold on to Johnson until he can be extradited.
Although detectives have declined to discuss Johnson's arrest
record, a Fulton County Jail supervisor said a Harry L. Johnson
with the same date of birth as the man arrested Saturday April 29,
1967 spent time in the Fulton jail on drug charges in 1993 and
again in September 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have not released a picture of Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Shropshire, of Altamonte Springs, Fla., Gutkowski, of Leesburg,
Fla., and Dover, of Gainesville, were found shot to death in a room
on the 24th floor of the Hilton on Oct. 18. Three days earlier,
Hawkins was found shot in the face in a room at a Days Inn on Old
National Highway in College Park. All four men had been shot more
than once with the same .45-caliber weapon. All were found in their
underwear. There was no forced entry into either of the hotel
rooms, police have said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Atlanta police have not pinpointed a motive in their
case, College Park investigators believe the motive for Hawkins'
death was drug-related, Chromi said. Police also think Hawkins, who
had been living at the motel since August, knew his killer and
allowed him into his room at 10:30 p.m. on Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Reid was at the North Atlanta Hilton in Marietta, when a man
dressed in black burst into her room, brandishing a gun. According
to a police report, the robber forced Reid onto the floor, pointed
the weapon to her head and demanded money. Reid was able to escape
her assailant's grasp and lock herself in the bathroom. After
yelling at Reid for several minutes, the robber left the room with
some of Reid's possessions.

 &HT;    Clinton interview tonight a coup for BET
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris

<P>
   ATLANTA _ When President Clinton is interviewed on cable's ``BET
Tonight with Tavis Smiley,'' viewers will have plenty on their
minds on the eve of Election Day: Will the Democrats lose seats in
the House? How will the Senate races turn out for Republicans? What
happens when impeachment hearings begin?
</P>
<P>
   The interview is clearly a coup for Smiley, who beat out other
big-name TV journalists also clamoring to have a pre-election talk
with Clinton, the first the president has granted since the release
of the Starr report and Congress' vote to open impeachment
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   And it's also a slam-dunk for BET, which has been roundly
criticized by viewers in the past for programming that consists
mostly of music videos, gospel shows and infomercials.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the otherwise-ignored cable network got noticed
was when O.J. Simpson appeared with another BET host after his
acquittal on double murder charges. Which begs the question: Is BET
the network for public figures in need of image makeovers?
</P>
<P>
   Smiley _ who was to tape the interview with Clinton this morning
in the White House _ said he is fully aware the administration is
cozying up to black voters who pollsters say are generally more
supportive of Clinton than whites, and are more willing to forgive
his sexual indiscretions with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We requested the interview like everybody else did, we begged
like everybody else did,'' Smiley said. ``But I'm no fool, and I
don't feel exploited, because I know what they are trying to do.
They see this show as a conduit to speak to a loyal part of their
base prior to Election Day.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most pressing questions many of those tuning in to
the Smiley show for the first time will be asking is: Tavis who?
</P>
<P>
   Smiley is well known by black audiences as the articulate,
opinionated commentator on Black Entertainment Television.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old Indiana native has also written a book of
political essays entitled ``Hard Left: Straight Talk About the
Wrongs of the Right'' and been a frequent guest on ABC's
``Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher'' and ``Geraldo Rivera
Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Smiley publicly challenged TV executives for
canceling shows he liked (Fox's ``Living Single'') and for putting
on shows he hated (UPN's ``The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer'').
</P>
<P>
   But Smiley readily admits many whites have never heard of him,
although he has interviewed the president on his show several times
before, most recently after Clinton's trip through Africa earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody asking who I am and how I got the interview
underscores for me that I happen to be on a black-owned television
network,'' said Smiley, 33, during a recent layover at Atlanta's
Hartsfield International Airport. ``This is no different than the
other three (interviews) I've done, it's just that the other times
I've sat down with him have not generated as much interest.''
</P>
<P>
   After tonight, that could change life for Smiley, a bachelor who
lives in Los Angeles but tapes his Monday-Thursday talk show in
BET's Washington studio.
</P>
<P>
   Smiley shrugs off critics who have hinted Clinton agreed to the
interview because he is expecting cream puff questions from the
show's host, an unapologetic liberal and frequent defender of the
president's policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people turned down interviews just because someone had an
agenda, then nobody would do interviews,'' Smiley said. ``I have
not been told by the White House what questions I should ask, or to
submit a list of questions. If they did, I would have refused to do
so. My job is not to put him on the hot seat but to get him to open
up and be reflective and say something he's never said before.''
</P>
<P>
   The scheduled half-hour interview from the White House probably
will focus on voter turnout, political power shifts in Congress,
the fate of affirmative action and whether this election is a
referendum on Clinton's presidency. Viewers shouldn't expect Smiley
to spend much, if any, time on the Lewinsky issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no interest in delving into lurid details of the Starr
report,'' Smiley said. ``I hope we will discuss the impact of the
investigation and the impact of the scandal with regard to what it
means to the administration. I think our viewers are more
interested in their future than the president's past.''
</P>
<P>
   Smiley said the Clinton interview probably won't make him a
household name, and that's just fine. ``My show is good enough for
all Americans, and I hope they watch. But every talk show wants its
numbers to grow and get bigger. I don't care if he gets some votes
out of this, as long as I get some ratings.''

<P>
   BUDVA, Yugoslavia _ As the white launch cut around the
breakwater and made for the deep waters of the Adriatic Sea, the
wind tangled a Yugoslav flag flying from the rigging. Krsta
Niklacevic, who said he was on his way to help his elderly father
bring in fish for their restaurant, leapt to clear the tangle and
set the flag flying proudly again.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Serb, I love Yugoslavia,'' he said. ``But I am the
biggest Montenegrin patriot I know, and Montenegro is through with
being dominated by an evil government.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement captured the complexity and danger of the newest
flash point in the Balkans, Montenegro. Here, the Yugoslav
president, Slobodan Milosevic, is being challenged by people who
are familiar with his cunning and for the most part have no ethnic
or religious quarrel to pick with Serbia, by far the larger of the
two republics that, with Montenegro, make up Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Defying Milosevic, many Montenegrins, including government
officials, say they hope to create an open and democratic society
as an example of how all Yugoslavs should be able to live.
</P>
<P>
   But to achieve that, they are falling back on a tradition of
smuggling. Officials who support Montenegro's president, Milo
Djukanovic _ a former ally of Milosevic who turned against him and
won election in this small republic of 630,000 people last fall _
argue that this is the only way to subsidize a government cut off
financially by Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials say about a third of the government's budget
comes from fees charged to smugglers who operate from here.
</P>
<P>
   The smuggling poses a problem for Western countries that praise
Montenegrins for challenging Milosevic. ``We don't have much
information on that,'' one Western diplomat said when asked about
smuggling, and then quickly changed the subject.
</P>
<P>
   At the helm of his boat, with the centuries-old walled port of
Budva slipping out of view, Niklacevic said, ``Why do I oppose
Milosevic? Our tourist season used to be six or seven months long,
now nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is his fault,'' he said, referring to the international
contempt and isolation that Milosevic's policies have reaped. ``Do
I need another reason?''
</P>
<P>
   He looked toward the horizon. One-hundred-twenty miles beyond
lies Italy, the destination of the speedboats that smuggle
cigarettes from warehouses in Montenegro to the European market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic sent the navy out there to stop the boats,''
Niklacevic said with a broad grin, ``but the smugglers are too
clever. The Italian police can't stop them, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a proud kingdom, though smaller than many U.S. counties,
Montenegro runs down rough mountains to the Adriatic. Its people
have their own history, and many want to reverse the decision made
in 1918 to join Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, it will be the end of what is left of the
Yugoslav Federation. Since Milosevic came to dominate Serbia in
1987, it has lost Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Macedonia as
federal partners. Now Yugoslavia could lose Montenegro, and even
the province of Kosovo, the cradle of Serbia's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in Montenegro no longer want to live in an autocratic
society,'' Djukanovic said in an interview. ``Milosevic wants
absolute and uncontrolled power.''
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic, 36, and other Montenegrins say they would like to
remain part of Yugoslavia, but not if Milosevic is in charge.
</P>
<P>
   After Djukanovic's narrow election victory over a Milosevic ally
last year, Montenegro began to ignore federal laws and became
independent in practice. ``The only influence the federation has is
the army and the currency,'' Djukanovic said, ``and many army
officers are very helpful to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The other republics that left Yugoslavia were places where
non-Serbs were a majority. But Montenegro is mostly populated by
people who share Serbian traditions. Indeed, Milosevic himself
hails from a Montenegrin family, although he was born and reared in
Serbia.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Not all Montenegrins back a fight with Milosevic. Some think
their republic is too small to survive alone. Many consider
themselves Serbs first and Montenegrins second and are inclined to
keep the current union with Serbia. Many do not want to abandon the
idea that Yugoslavia, though troubled, can be saved.
</P>
<P>
   But even those Montenegrins who doubt that conflict with
Milosevic is wise say they are paying the price for his mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   About 12 percent of the people in Montenegro are refugees from
the wars that accompanied Yugoslavia's breakup, most recently from
the conflict in Kosovo. In addition, between retirees, the
unemployed, those working for antiquated state-owned companies and
those working directly for the government, more than half of the
people in Montenegro depend on the virtually bankrupt government
for their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   Western countries say international institutions cannot lend
Montenegro money, because it is legally still part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   At a sidewalk cafe in Podgorica, Montenegro's capital, Nena
Vukalovic, 43, and her young daughter sat in the sun with friends.
``This is a kind of experimental zone where we are trying to see
how we can step back into Europe, but with a democracy and a modern
economy,'' Mrs. Vukalovic said.
</P>
<P>
   ``See the people at this cafe?'' she said. ``They are Muslim and
Serbs and even Albanians, and they are sitting together at the same
tables. Montenegro is an example of what all Yugoslavia could
become, and that means it is a threat to Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   While in Serbia the government is clamping down on independent
media and foreign broadcasts, the Montenegrin government's own
stations broadcast reports by the Voice of America and the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 100 percent better than in Serbia,'' said Dusan Masic, a
field supervisor for the Association of Independent Electronic
Media, an organization promoting press freedom in Yugoslavia. ``But
you won't find many stories criticizing Djukanovic. You won't find
any stories about crime or corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   The reluctance to report on crime stems in part from the
republic's unorthodox source of revenue: smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cigarettes for the most part,'' said a senior official,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Private companies ship the
goods here, to government warehouses on the coast. Then the
shippers' boats get the goods to Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   While still a Milosevic ally, Djukanovic oversaw much of the
smuggling that kept Yugoslavia going when it was under
international sanctions from 1992 to 1995, foreign diplomats say.
But he rejected the idea that his government was knowingly aiding
smugglers today.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is that merchandise comes into Montenegro and
continues on to other destinations,'' he said. ``We charge a tax
for that. You could consider it a normal tax on commercial
transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   The minister of social welfare, Predrag Drecun, said Montenegro
would collapse without ``transit taxes'' from smugglers. ``What
else can we do?'' he said. ``The government must have money to
avoid anarchy.''

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ In his final barnstorming trip of the campaign year,
President Clinton on Sunday invoked Speaker Newt Gingrich, Martin
Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks in an impassioned plea that was part
of a full-scale drive by Democrats to spur turnout by black voters
in the election on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton's appearance at the predominantly black New
Psalmist Baptist Church was the most high-profile, Republicans and
Democrats alike fanned out at churches, picnics, party clubhouses
and rallies around the United States, struggling in the final 48
hours to galvanize, if not electrify, an electorate lulled by a
campaign season that still seems to be searching for a national
theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your vote counts just as much as mine, just as much as Speaker
Gingrich's,'' said Clinton in the latest move by his party to turn
the speaker into an incentive for Democrats to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway across the country in Green Bay, Wis., Gingrich sought
to stir his party's faithful as well. At a rally outside the
49ers-Packers football game on Sunday afternoon, the speaker
extolled the virtues of Rep. Mark Neumann, who has mounted a highly
competitive challenge to oust Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Tuesday's election is a choice between two teams,''
Gingrich declared. ``One that believes in higher taxes, bigger
government and more power in Washington. The other believes in
lower taxes, smaller government and more power in Wisconsin. You
have a chance on Tuesday to dramatically change the direction of
Wisconsin by sending Mark Neumann to the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   The highly charged advances to break though to voters come not
only because the stakes are high in Tuesday's elections _ 34 Senate
seats, 36 governorships and all 435 House seats are up for grabs _
but also because the latest polls show that many critical elections
are too close to call. At least five Senate races and 10 contests
for governor could easily come out either way, according to
strategists in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most hard-hitting, and often unsavory, appeals came
not on the stump or from the interminable onslaught of television
commercials but in massive telephone calling, leaflet drops and
election-eve radio advertisements. These messages were below the
political radar screen and, in many cases, were designed to sway
voters while depriving a candidates' opponents of ammunition, or
time, to fire back in the closing hours of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, where Brian Baird, a Democrat, is locked in a tight
race against Don Benton, a Republican, for an open seat, the
National Republican Congressional Committee sent out a leaflet at
the weekend with this warning in big bold letters: ``Oh My! Did you
know that Brian Baird supports requiring our churches to perform
same sex marriages?''
</P>
<P>
   Baird campaign officials said Baird opposes same-sex marriage.
But he does not support the Defense of Marriage Act, which
withholds benefits in federal taxes, pensions and other areas to
partners of homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have not been timid either. In Missouri, the state
Democratic Party has begun running a radio commercial with a bald
appeal for blacks to vote: ``When you don't vote, you let another
church explode,'' the narrator says. ``When you don't vote, you
allow another cross to burn. When you don't vote, you let another
assault wound a brother or a sister. When you don't vote, you let
the Republicans continue to cut school lunches and Head Start.''
</P>
<P>
   The furious efforts to gain partisan advantage are coming not
only from the candidates and the political parties but from outside
groups that are pumping millions of dollars into get-out-the-vote
drives.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition distributed an estimated 35 million
voter guides at churches on Sunday that are aimed at prodding
religious conservatives to go to the polls. In a counter-offensive,
the AFL-CIO was running massive phone banks around the country, in
most cases imploring Democrats to vote.
</P>
<P>
   But even as campaigns went so far as to offer free rides to
voters to get them to the polls, some also accused their opponents
of trying to discourage people from voting. In a technique known as
push polling, campaigns hire telemarketing firms to spread dirt
about their opponents in the guise of a poll. These calls are
usually very difficult to trace and often are detected too late to
be rebutted.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's trip here on Sunday was noteworthy because while his
efforts on the fund-raising circuit never seemed to diminish, his
campaign on the hustings has been limited this year, largely
because he was distracted by the White House sex scandal. At the
height of the embarrassing publicity about his affair with Monica
Lewinsky, many Democrats, including Gov. Parris Glendening of
Maryland, did not want the president to campaign with them.
</P>
<P>
   But one reason Clinton traveled to Baltimore is that Glendening
is virtually tied in the polls with Ellen Sauerbrey, his Republican
challenger, in what has shaped up as one of the most competitive
races anywhere. Clinton, who was greeted by frenzied applause from
thousands of parishioners, laced his message with Biblical
references.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only two places, only two, where we have fulfilled
both the admonition of the Scripture and the promise of the
founders that all of us are created equal,'' said Clinton, who was
accompanied by Glendening and a host of other Maryland Democrats.
``One is when you come into your house of worship on Sunday and the
other is when you show up at the ballot box.''
</P>
<P>
   In a jibe at Ms. Sauerbrey at a rally on Halloween, Sen. Barbara
Mikulski of Maryland also invoked Gingrich. But her message, saying
the Republican was ``masquerading'' as a moderate, was even blunter
than the president's: ``When she takes off the mask, takes off the
makeup, she's nothing but Newt Gingrich in high heels and an
earring.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sauerbrey campaign, hardly sitting still, unleashed a harsh
commercial attacking Glendening's credibility. It closes with these
words filling the screen (in red ink): ``People don't trust Parris
Glendening.''
</P>
<P>
   For those voters in Maryland who somehow missed the pitches on
either side, there is another opportunity: Republicans and
Democrats are calling people across the state with taped appeals
from figures including Clinton and, on the other side, Bob Dole,
the Republican presidential nominee in 1996.

</P>
<P>
   The often ferocious _ and sometimes creative _ efforts to spark
the electorate come in part because so many races are so close.
While most Republicans said they did not expert their party to
capture the five additional seats in the Senate that would be
needed for a 60-vote majority (the magic number to cut off
Democratic filibusters), the contests in at least five states were
viewed as totally up for grabs: New York, North Carolina, Kentucky,
Nevada and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Maryland, at least nine races for governor were also
considered too close to call: Nevada, Hawaii, Georgia, South
Carolina, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Iowa, Ohio and Rhode Island.
Republicans now control 32 of the governors' offices.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the most intense campaigning is in the competition
for the House of Representatives, where Republicans hold only an
11-seat majority in the 435-member chamber. Most Republicans and
Democrats are now forecasting a Republican pickup of fewer than a
dozen seats.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after an election year that has been marked by the
unpredictable, no strategist in either party could, with full
confidence, forecast what might happen on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows the effect of a last minute, multimillion-dollar
infusion of commercials by the Republican Party reminding voters of
the Clinton scandal _ and counter-advertisements by the Democrats
assailing their opponents as scandalmongers. It is also unclear how
much Republican candidates will benefit from their party's lopsided
financial advantage in the last days of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Political strategists were also watching this weekend for
unexpected turns in the dynamics. In Illinois, for instance,
analysts were debating a new poll suggesting that Sen. Carol
Moseley-Braun, a Democrat who had for weeks been badly lagging in
the polls, had actually pulled ahead of Peter Fitzgerald, a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   And even its author, Andrew Kohut, said he was baffled by a poll
released Sunday by the Pew Research Center for the People and the
Press which shows that likely voters were divided equally between
Democrats and Republicans. In three previous surveys since August,
Kohut's survey found that general support for Republican candidates
was consistently greater than for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little rattled,'' Kohut said. ``I was pretty confident
of small Republican gains. But these results would suggest a
Democrat seat gain which a couple of weeks ago was certainly
inconceivable.''

 &HT;    Victory reaffirms Chandler's recovery
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After a week of healing -- and watching Steve DeBerg
painfully attempt to direct the Falcons' offense last week against
the blitzing New York Jets -- Sunday was about reaffirmation for
Atlanta quarterback Chris Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Mission accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler was not as sharp passing as he has been, but the
results were comforting to him and his team. To wit: The Falcons
won, and Chandler's biggest post-game health concern was a cold.
</P>
<P>
   The ribs and shoulder injuries that thrust the 44-year-old
DeBerg into the starting job and Chandler to spectator in New York
bothered him none the least at the Georgia Dome, before or after
the Falcons' victory against the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler completed 12 of 26 passes for 236 yards and two
touchdowns and spent the final moments on the sideline, out of
harm's way. Actually, Chandler was not threatened by the Rams' pass
rush on the field, either -- he was sacked once and seldom hit
after throwing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A beautiful thing,'' he said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, just having Chandler in the fold was a source of
positive vibes for the Falcons, whose mental approach was more
``hang on'' than win last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody is better with the starter in there,'' coach
Dan Reeves said. ``You're a lot more confident. . . Chris was
exceptionally sharp. They did come with a lot of blitzes. But it
says a lot about the work we put it against it.''
</P>
<P>
   It also says a lot about Chandler's recovery prowess. ``A week
is not a long time to get rusty,'' he said, ``but people have made
a big deal about me not being in there. I know me playing
definitely helps. But it felt good to be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler did not waste time establishing himself. On the game's
second play, he connected with receiver Tony Martin on a perfectly
timed slant route that produced a 62-yard gain. Two plays later, he
tossed to running back Jamal Anderson for a 9-yard touchdown. It
was four plays, 77 yards and zero doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get going like that at the start, and it can carry over
all game,'' offensive tackle Bob Whitfield said. ``Chris had great
confidence and great leadership. He's in control.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler's only blemish came late in the first quarter when he
threw behind Martin and into the arms of the Rams' Ryan McNeil.
McNeil returned the interception 37 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony was open, but I just threw it behind him,'' Chandler
said. ``Overall, I think my timing was good. Other than throwing
that one to the wrong guy, it was a good day.''
</P>

TOWN STILL HONORS ITS VETERANS, THOUGH HOLIDAY HAS FALLEN ON HARD
TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (GLASCO, Kan.) _ Come Veterans Day, Nov. 11, students from
Rebecca Loe's sixth-grade class here will make their way to the old
St. Mary's-Glasco cemetery to leave mementos.
</P>
<P>
   On veterans' graves _ there are more than 100 in the cemetery _
the children will place notes or lapel pins, souvenirs or other
personal items. It's up to them.
</P>
<P>
   Flags? No. They were dropped a few years ago when ``Taiwan'' was
found on their labels.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, what Glasco children do the second week of November has
become the exception rather than the rule. Now seen by many as a
day off with no mail delivery and closed banks, Veterans Day has
fallen on hard times.
</P>
<P>
   Parades are now a rarity. Even a place as big as Kansas City
hasn't had a Veterans Day parade for the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitiful,'' was how Sam Cerniglia, an official with the U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs in Kansas City, described one of the
last such events there. ``Horses in the American Royal parade did
better than veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What it's come down to is that people honoring veterans, for
the most part, are the veterans themselves,'' said Sandy Kinser,
the school librarian in Glasco. She grew up in the Vietnam era.
</P>
<P>
   Kinser's epiphany about veterans came in 1990-91. She was the
sixth-grade teacher then. That winter her daughter, an enlisted
Marine, was helping to launch Harrier jump jets just behind the
front lines in Operation Desert Storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked one student what a veteran was, and he said that it
was an animal doctor. Well, we went to work. Once they got into it,
the children were fascinated.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinser explained that World War I had ended at the 11th hour of
the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918, that President Woodrow
Wilson had declared Armistice Day a national holiday in 1919, that
there were big parades in almost every city and town in the 1920s
and '30s, that the name was changed by Congress to Veterans Day in
1954, and that in 1971 Congress had made the event into a movable
federal holiday, to be celebrated on the fourth weekend in October.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, under pressure from veterans and others, federal
legislators restored Veterans Day to Nov. 11.
</P>
<P>
   But the youngsters here didn't get just facts. They got veterans
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``One year a man who survived Pearl Harbor talked to them,''
Kinser said. ``He'd lived, but his buddy standing next to him was
killed. He told us he'd never talked about it before, that he had
hated the Japanese but learned to forgive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids were absolutely riveted.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the leaving of mementos on the graves wasn't part of what
Kinser and subsequent sixth-grade teachers taught about Veterans
Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did that all on their own,'' said Kinser. ``It's not
organized. They just go. It's kind of a tradition now, one the
children have started.''
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, the cemetery here has a World War I monument.
</P>
<P>
   On the north side of the cemetery are two white limestone
columns, each about 10 feet high, each with a large brass plate.
The one on the east says:
</P>
<P>
   1917 1918 In Memory of OUR BOYS Who Served Their Country in the
WORLD WAR In Camp On The Battlefield On The Seas
</P>
<P>
   The plate on the west column lists five names: Arthur C.
Pilcher, Oron B. Crook, Phillip Sparwasser, Hayes P. Krenkle and
Clarence R. Edmondson.
</P>
<P>
   Sparwasser died of pneumonia in France on Oct. 18, 1918. The
four others died of battle wounds in the French mud of that autumn
now 80 years past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seems like a awful lot of men for just a little town like
this, doesn't it?'' mused Squeak Wolf, a former Marine who takes
care of city maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got about 30 graves here from the Civil War. Even one
killed by Indians before this was a town. Then there are these five
who died in World War I and others like Red Stratton who died just
a couple of years ago. He was our last World War I vet.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said ``a whole bunch'' of World War II veterans were buried
here. Plus two from Korea and two from Vietnam. He said Glasco,
just from what he's seen on the grave markers, had done its part.
In spades.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Thies, an archaeologist with the State Historical Society
in Topeka and who, as a sideline, keeps track of various monuments
throughout the state, said that while interest in Veterans Day
might have declined precipitously, monuments and memorial
structures to World War I and its participants dotted the state,
hardly noticed but there all the same.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto in Missouri, said Lee Gilleard of Missouri's historic
preservation program.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're everywhere,'' said Gilleard. ``Halls, swimming pools,
chapels, towers, picnic areas _ all sorts of things.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s, he added, there was a fever in Missouri to build
memorials. While the Liberty Memorial in Kansas City, Mo., was
probably the biggest and most widely known, scores of others went
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing people don't realize is that after World War I the
Missouri legislature would pass out $10,000 in state money for a
memorial to any town that could come up with $8,000 of their own.
Now $18,000 in the 1920s could build an awful lot. That's why just
about every county has something relating to the war, even though
hardly anybody realizes it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thies said the statuary of World War I was markedly different
from the Civil War's, with its heroic statues of combatants, many
on horseback, leading their troops to glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no glory in World War I,'' said Thies. ``The machine
gun, artillery and the trenches weren't glorious by any stretch of
the imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Thies said the emphasis on World War I memorials was utilitarian
_ including the biggest World War I monument of them all, U.S. 40
from Baltimore to San Francisco. It was called the Victory Highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``At every county line they were going to put up these huge
things called Victory Eagles, cast bronze, all the way across the
country,'' he said. MORE

BUSINESSES DO LITTLE TO DEAL WITH IMMINENT RETIREMENT OF LEGIONS OF
BOOMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ About 10 years after the business world falls apart
_ or not _ because Year 2000 computer problems weren't anticipated
and weren't fixed, another crisis looms: The mass of Baby Boomers
begins retiring.
</P>
<P>
   What are most companies doing to prepare? Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   More than 8 out of 10 respondents told pollsters for the Society
for Human Resource Management and the American Association of
Retired Persons that their organizations have made no preparations
for this demographic shift.
</P>
<P>
   Among the few organizations that have started worrying about how
to fill retired Boomer spots, most merely have started developing
succession plans for their top positions.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the underlying career message for Boomers: You may not be
retiring as soon as you think.
</P>
<P>
   Your employer _ or some other employer _ may be desperate to
keep you on the job. You'll be wanted, of course, only if you have
the up-to-date skills needed. But you may want the job as much as
they want you.
</P>
<P>
   The Society for Human Resource Management notes in its Workplace
Visions newsletter that ``inadequate retirement savings,
uncertainty about the long-term viability of the present Social
Security system and medical advances allowing people to live
longer, healthier lives are each reinforcing the trend toward
greater numbers of older employees in the workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than one-third of the organizations in the ``Older Workers
Survey'' said they are recruiting older workers for current
positions. Similarly, the most common complaint I hear at job fairs
is from older workers who believe they are victims of age
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Attitudes and employment practices must change if the labor
shortage of 2010 is to be minimized. John Glenn's certainly doing
his part.

<P>
   (WASHINGTON) _ For all the turmoil in Washington this year,
you'd think somebody would predict big trouble for one political
party or the other at the polls Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the twists and turns that Monica Lewinsky put into the
election road are not expected to be as important as other factors
in determining whether Republicans or Democrats have the better
day.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, most observers don't expect major changes in either
direction as Republicans try to keep control of the Senate, the
House and governorships.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, this has been a hard year to chart voters' moods,
said Michael Mezey, a professor of political science at DePaul
University in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really been one of the oddest election years I've seen,''
Mezey said. ``I've not gotten any sense of what's happening out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the bad news for Democrats coming out of President
Clinton's affair with Lewinsky has been offset by good feelings
about the economy and Clinton's overall job performance.
</P>
<P>
   That has to be weighed, however, against hurdles facing
Democrats, including a money disadvantage and projected light
turnouts that usually favor Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The results could boil down to an ``air war vs. a ground war'' _
whether the effect of television advertising by Republicans can be
overcome if Democratic efforts to increase turnout are successful,
said Thomas Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are trying to boost their 11-seat advantage in the
435-member House and improve their 55-45 edge in the Senate. They
have 32 governorships, and if they reach 34, it would be the most
for them since 1922.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, when Clinton sheepishly admitted an affair
with Lewinsky, all things looked possible for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Now Republicans appear unlikely to get even half the 30-seat
gain that Speaker Newt Gingrich had hoped for in the House, and
they could pick up as few as one or two seats in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Democrats it will be a minor defeat, not a disaster,''
said Robert Salisbury, professor emeritus of political science at
Washington University in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster Neil Newhouse of Washington is projecting a
single-digit gain for Republicans in the House instead of the 10 to
15 seats the party predicts.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 435 House seats, about 50 to 60 have competitive races,
the pollsters and others say.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Democrats have closed ground in several key
states and have all but erased any Republican hopes of picking up
at least five seats, enough to all but guarantee an end to
Democratic filibusters. The Republican gain could be only one or
two seats, Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   The results this year will be especially important to Clinton. A
good night for Democrats may help him survive possible impeachment
in the House and trial in the Senate regarding the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impeachment process is not likely to affect the election,
but the election is likely to have a major impact on the
impeachment process,'' Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky scandal has alternately worked for and against
Republicans and Democrats, depending on developments, since it
broke in January, Newhouse said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign has gone back and forth,'' Newhouse said, ``and
now more than at any other time of the year it is being played on a
level field.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll published Friday by The New York Times and CBS News found
that almost 70 percent of respondents said the scandal would not
affect their vote in congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people are looking at candidates on the ballot, and the
president is not one of them,'' Democratic pollster Mark Mellman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although they talk of a voter backlash over the Clinton
investigation, even most Democrats are not predicting that their
party will win control of the House or the Senate. But they are
less nervous than they were last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a period when it was like being in a earthquake,''
said Olivia Morgan, spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee. ``You think there is one, and then all of a
sudden the ground is solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Mellman said that since the end of World War II, it has not been
unusual for the party of the sitting president to lose 25 to 30
seats in the House in nonpresidential election years. Although he
would not give a number, he said he expected Democrats to lose far
fewer this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``History and money are our biggest problems,'' Mellman said.
</P>
<P>
   Mezey said the party of the sitting president usually suffered
in an off-year election because marginal voters who turned out to
vote for the president weren't as enthusiastic about congressional
races and stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the fact that Republicans generally vote at higher
rates than Democrats do, and the problem for Democrats compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have poured more money _ tens of millions of dollars
more _ into the campaign than Democrats have. In the 1997-98 cycle,
the GOP and its House and Senate organizations have gathered $278.3
million, compared with $185.7 million raised by their Democratic
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Salisbury said another problem facing Democrats was their field
of candidates. Good potential candidates probably expected a bad
year for Democrats and didn't enter the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were seats where Republicans should have been vigorously
challenged and weren't, even in open seats,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another hurdle for Democrats could be the prominence of
Republican governors at the top of ballots in many states. Eighteen
Republican governors are seeking re-election, compared with six
Democratic incumbents. MORE

   NEW YORK _ Everything hurts.
</P>
<P>
   My head is throbbing, my stomach is unsettled. My knees are
swollen. I'm a little dizzy. And my thigh muscles? I don't know
when I'll be climbing stairs again.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, I feel terrific. The euphoria of completing my
first marathon, and doing it in New York, is helping to push the
pain aside. After having told myself ``Next year'' again and again,
next year finally arrived Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Friends who have run marathons had been telling me for weeks
what to expect. I have read about the spectators, the
neighborhoods, the wall of people when the runners come off the
Queensboro Bridge, the wall of pain after the Madison Avenue
Bridge. But nothing truly prepared me for the emotions of the day,
the triumphant highs and the demoralizing lows. I had seen the race
before on TV and in person, but not until Sunday did I fully
appreciate the sense of fun and celebration, the spectacle that is
uniquely New York.
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of the day seems like ages ago. I woke up a little
before 6 a.m. and took the subway to the New York Public Library's
main branch, where buses were shuttling runners to Staten Island.
At the library, a line of thousands stretched along 42nd Street
from Fifth Avenue to Avenue of the Americas and then down to 41st
Street. The bus ride was smooth and quick _ that is, until we
approached the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. There we crept along for
at least half an hour (with no restroom on the bus!) until we
reached the athletes' village at Fort Wadsworth.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect weather made the wait for the race tolerable _ so
did competitors dressed as the Blues Brothers, Superman and a
clown. The nervous energy and the smell of Ben-Gay ointment brought
back memories of giant high school track meets.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, competitors lined up, threw their sweats into the trees
and every which way, and the race began. The opening miles were
both frustrating and fun. They were frustrating because, having
received a number that began with an X, I started near the back of
the pack. I had plans of running eight-minute miles or faster, but
I didn't reach Mile 1 for 17 minutes, and Mile 3 for 33 minutes. I
felt like a running back, darting around other runners,
accelerating and slowing, trying to find daylight.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm also glad I started back there. The atmosphere was light
and fun rather than competitive. Runners hooted and hollered right
along with the spectators. I wore a permanent grin the first half
of the race, high-fiving children along the course and enjoying the
live music.
</P>
<P>
   I especially enjoyed Lafayette Avenue in Brooklyn, where an
entire block of people was moving to the song ``Funky Town'' while
screaming in support. On the next block, the Bishop Loughlin High
School band had runners _ competitors _ dancing during a marathon.
</P>
<P>
   I was entranced by the character of the neighborhoods we raced
through: Bay Ridge, Sunset Park, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Williamsburg,
Greenpoint. The look of the crowds changed every few blocks, but
the good will never ended.
</P>
<P>
   I had ``Bri'' marked on my shirt, and I drew a little energy
each time someone yelled, ``Come on, Bri!'' Actually, most shouted
``Let's go, Brie,'' as in cheese, but that was nice, too.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, I found room to pick up the pace, reaching the
halfway point on the Pulaski Bridge in 1 hour 57 minutes. But it
wasn't until I exited the Queensboro Bridge and stepped onto First
Avenue, after Mile 16, that there was enough room to reach a full,
consistent stride. The crowd on First Avenue was thick and loud,
but I stopped paying attention to the surroundings and instead
worried about my running. No more grinning, no more high-fives.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to do the math. Could I run 3:30, my goal, after
reaching the halfway point at a 3:54 pace? Not likely, but I was
going to try. Up First Avenue, into the Bronx, back into Manhattan
and down into Central Park, I ran at a quick, steady clip. Maybe I
could do it, after all.
</P>
<P>
   But then came Mile 25. My home turf, Central Park, where I run
several times a week, didn't seem so familiar. My quadriceps
muscles wanted to quit, and my joints were aching. Ah, so this is
the wall.
</P>
<P>
   The last mile, where most runners seem to have recovered a bit,
was unpleasant. I struggled through in 3:34:55, a few minutes
slower than my goal. The walk through the finish chute was
agonizing. The volunteers were perfect, though, as they had been
all day, steering us wobbly runners straight. But at this point,
merely walking was a challenge. I was hurting and I wanted to lay
down.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, though, as I began to assess the entire
experience, I forgot about the pain, and that grin I had back in
Brooklyn returned to my face.
</P>
<P>
   I finished the marathon, I thought. Now I'm hooked.

CREDIT CARD LAWSUIT IGNORES TRUTHS OF MARKETPLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ The federal antitrust suit against Visa and
MasterCard is this year's best example of how far divorced
Washington has become from marketplace reality.
</P>
<P>
   The assumption behind all antitrust initiatives is that
consumers are being hurt by unfair marketplace domination and
manipulation. In this case, Uncle Sam apparently deems the cost of
plastic credit higher than would be the case without the market
dominance exerted by Visa and MasterCard.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the Justice Department has revealed plans to pursue
the notion that the combined market power of Visa and MasterCard
also translates into an industry reluctance to create and provide
more innovative products.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of the government's case challenges duality, which
is the practice of allowing the same banks to administer both
cards, and the policy that bars member banks from offering
competing cards such as American Express and Discover.
</P>
<P>
   So the question on which this litigation turns is whether the
two pre-eminent plastic purveyors are abusing market power to
deprive Americans of cheaper credit and better deals. If the jurors
have reasonably good credit records, though, it's difficult to see
how government lawyers could make a convincing case.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that if you carry an outstanding balance and
don't miss payments, hardly a week will pass without your getting a
pitch or two from some Visa or MasterCard issuer offering a teaser
rate of 5 percent or better to switch accounts. Those inclined to
play this game can sustain extremely low carrying costs for their
credit card balances indefinitely. All they must do is shift their
balances anytime it's advantageous to do so. Meantime, this
competition keeps rates down for those preferring to keep their
account with the same issuer.
</P>
<P>
   Those perceived as greater credit risks pay a higher rate, but
this reflects the cost of maintaining these accounts and paying for
the high default rate among less creditworthy customers.
</P>
<P>
   As for lack of innovative products, what about those frequently
offered deals of free air travel miles, free telephone minutes and
other such product discounts from companies linking promotions to
Visa and MasterCard use?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever's happening in the marketing department must be
working, because credit card volume has exploded during the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Has all this marketplace reality been lost on the Justice
Department's trustbusters? Or is there something else going on here
that doesn't meet the eye? Is this election year grandstanding? Or
is it a quid pro quo for competitors who have been more lavish with
campaign cash than Visa and MasterCard interests? Or are government
lawyers merely looking for headline-creating scalps?
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the frivolous nature of this antitrust action is the
curious nature of its timing, which is wretched. The economy is
slowing dramatically and the biggest concern on the horizon is the
possibility of a credit crunch, which would virtually ensure a
severe recession within a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Given the situation, why would Washington want to do anything
that spooks those responsible for making credit available to
consumers, whose collective activity spurs two-thirds of economic
growth?
</P>
<P>
   If Visa and MasterCard issuers feel compelled to appease
Washington by taking actions that hurt their profit margins, the
practical effect will be less credit availability for card users at
the margin. As delicate as the economy's condition is now, this is
not only foolish, but also hazardous to America's economic health.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles ballot measures that somehow didn't make it in time
for Tuesday's popularity contest:
</P>
<P>
   __ Proposition C-The-Brick, Eat-It-Yourself: Strictly forbids
professional athletes employed by organizations outside the city
limits from appearing as co-hosts, guest hosts or quasi-permanent
hosts on sports-talk radio shows broadcast within the city limits _
a clear violation of the Interstate Commerce Act. Additionally,
forbids an athlete from tarnishing the reputation of our city's
postal workers by adopting an inappropriate nickname.
</P>
<P>
   __ Proposition Y-Does-This-Have-To-Happen: Provides financial
assistance to family-owned-and-operated sports teams. Economic
impact: Put it this way _ you want Fox to own the Dodgers !ital!and
the Lakers and erase the only mystique left in L.A. sports? If
Rupert Murdoch could buy USC and UCLA. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Proposition R-You-Gonna-Shut-Up-And-Listen: Allows Judge Judy
to arbitrate the NBA labor dispute during a 30-minute TV show from
an L.A. television studio of her choice.
</P>
<P>
   (For our money, Punchin' Judy would need just a minute and a
half to hear the arguments, tell both sides to shut up, force David
Stern to shave and make 'em split the difference before she sics
the antitrust dogs on their sorry behinds.)
</P>
<P>
   __ Proposition B-Afraid, Be-Very-Afraid: Prevents shady
profiteers from representing Los Angeles citizens in the
acquisition of a professional sports team or stadium. Especially
those trying to dress up a toxic waste dump and pass it off as a
slice of heaven.
</P>
<P>
   __ Proposition U-Gotta-Be-Kidding: Prevents persons perceived to
be working media from representing shady profiteers in the
acquisition of a professional sports team or stadium. Especially
those from the toxic waste dump of television and radio.
</P>
<P>
   __ Michael Ovitz insists he's the one guy who can fix anything.
So you gotta believe the fix is in. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ The difference between 32 teams and 34 is so minute that it's
astounding the NFL's greed-mongers don't just give Houston a
franchise and !ital!both Los Angeles groups a team, draw up two
17-team conferences, scrap interconference play and watch the TV
cash roll in despite the cries of total oversaturation. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ FYI: 40 years ago today, the Rams beat the Chicago Bears
41-35 at the Coliseum before an NFL single-game attendance-record
crowd of 90,833. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ The American judges' cards on Katarina Witt's 10-page spread
in the December issue of Playboy that makes her look in some photos
like a young Bo Derek : Off the scale, for artistic interpretation
and for sheer beauty. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __Fledgling movie star Howie Long also made the new Playboy,
fully clothed, as one of the 10 best-dressed men of the year. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Incidentally, Mike Piazza made Playgirl's
10-sexiest-men-of-'98 list (and Howie didn't) _ !ital!before
signing the $92.7 million deal. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Hugh Hefner is almost a full year older than Vin Scully . . .
.
</P>
<P>
   __As Peter O'Malley grabs his coat and heads for the parking
lot, it won't be long before Vinny is left to turn out the lights
when he leaves. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __The new Nike ads featuring Samuel L. Jackson and Dyan Cannon
are simply FAN-tastic. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __Last word on Karl Malone , the self-proclaimed ``progress in
training'' on radio: Malone got his mailbag all tangled up on the
air last week when questioned about why he's spending his time in
L.A. ``If my wife is OK with what Karl Malone is doing, then to
hell what people think about Karl Malone.'' Once again, that was
Karl Malone talking about Karl Malone. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Dennis Rodman claims ``oppression, fraud and/or malice'' in a
suit against the WCW for the amount of dough he received after
kicking sand on Malone in that ``Bash at the Beach'' pay-per-view
fiasco in San Diego last June. Rodman left out a reimbursement for
having to have his tights Martinized at the dry cleaners. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __A poll in the St. Paul Pioneer Press shows that Reform Party
candidate and former  &UR; !ital! &LR; pro rassler Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura
(23 percent) isn't that far behind Democrat
</P>
<P>
   Hubert Humphrey III (34 percent) and Republican St. Paul mayor
Norm Coleman (33 percent) in the state governor's race. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __Neither Humphrey nor Coleman should worry, since both were
probably riveted to NBC's ``Exposed: Pro Wrestling's Greatest
Secrets'' Sunday night. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __In the latest poll released by BRUIN (Bitter Resentment for
Undermining Intent across the Nation), UCLA actually REPLACED Ohio
State at No. 1 after its thrilling win over Stanford because, uh,
we showed we don't have to blow everyone out just to make the
conventional pollsters happy. Let's see the Buckeyes come from
behind. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Montreal Expos outfield prospect Milton Bradley was fined and
suspended last week for the final four games in the Maryland Fall
League for repeatedly striking an umpire in the face with a finger
during an argument. Bradley could have faced harsher discipline,
but he reportedly presented his ``Get Out Of Jail Free'' card,
rolled the dice and moved ahead to the B&AMP;O Railroad depot.

SCARCITY OF QUAIL WON'T RUIN OPENING DAY OF HUNTING SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ The opening of the quail season on Bernard's farm
has become largely ceremonial.
</P>
<P>
   The best of the hunting ground is owned now by other people. And
even on the home place, something has changed.
</P>
<P>
   There used to be one dependable covey in a brushy ravine below
the house; another around the shallow pond at the end of the far
south field. Often, especially early on a frosty day, there'd be a
third in the switchgrass field, and once in a great while a fourth
along the wooded east fence line.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, and the year before, not one bird was found,
though the dogs worked every piece of cover carefully and well.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the stubble of harvested crops being plowed under a
bit sooner than in some past times, farming practices on the place
have not greatly changed. The quail have simply disappeared, that's
all, and there's no explaining it.
</P>
<P>
   And yet that's where I'll greet this morning with a hunting
friend.
</P>
<P>
   As you read this _ depending on your hour of Sunday rising _
we're either still driving there in the dark, the dogs rattling
around impatiently in their crates and smelling of their
excitement. Or else we're afoot already and crossing the first
field in the early light.
</P>
<P>
   It's a piece of ground we have walked so often together we know
its every fold. We know where the coveys should be, and will hunt
each of those spots in an order governed by where the wind is
quartering from.
</P>
<P>
   And in each we can be sure of finding, if not birds, plentiful
memories of other years _ years when the dogs were stylish, and the
quail held tight to the point, and the explosion of wing beats as
the they burst up through a screen of colored leaves almost stopped
the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the geese will be flying today. The farm lies astride a
hilltop, and the V's of Canadas and the vast skeins of snows and
blues often pass over low, flinging down their wild, discordant
song that strikes a strange and powerful resonance in the hearer of
it.
</P>
<P>
   We will not be long afield. The farm can be covered thoroughly
in a couple of hours. Though with lazy going, and stopping from
time to time to speak of remembered days, I expect we'll take
nearer three.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly more than a taste, this little outing will have been.
Somehow, in a careless moment months ago, I let myself get
committed for something later on in the afternoon. So it was
impossible to make a more expansive plan for the opening day.
</P>
<P>
   When we come back birdless and load the dogs, we'll probably
knock at the house to see whether Bernard and Charlotte have left
for church. If not, we might visit a bit, and possibly sit for a
cup of coffee at Charlotte's table.
</P>
<P>
   Then we'll turn the car toward home, stopping for a bite of
lunch on the way, speaking those sad words hunters always utter in
such circumstances:
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least we won't have to clean the guns.
</P>
<P>
   But if one includes the dates in the neighboring state, the
season runs from now until the end of January. That's a full three
months, of which, after today, I'll have spent only a
one-ninety-second part.
</P>
<P>
   Which means that 91 more opportunities remain, still plenty of
time afield to see a lot of grand country, and get fully acquainted
with the new shotgun, and satisfy the dogs _ and also enough to
cost a man his job or his happy home, or both.

 &HT;    Victory leaves Falcons getting familiar with winning
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Imagine how strange it must be to be a member of the
NFC West and wake up this morning with a red-and-black clad
vagabond camping on the front lawn, poised to capture the castle.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Falcons, after all, have had just seven winning
seasons in 32 previous years, but after ripping the Rams, 37-15,
Sunday at the Georgia Dome, they're 6-2 for the first time ever.
</P>
<P>
   That's mighty different than the last two seasons, when the
Falcons arrived at midseason with 1-7 and 0-8 records.
</P>
<P>
   If it seems strange to see Atlanta tied with the 49ers for first
place in the division -- in November, no less -- then consider
this:
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have a right to begin thinking about the possibility
of a home playoff game for the first time since Jimmy Carter was
president (a 30-27 loss to Dallas on Jan. 4, 1981).
</P>
<P>
   With a soft schedule in the second half -- excluding next
Sunday's game at 5-3 New England, a home game a week later with 6-2
San Francisco and a season-finale at home against 5-3 Miami-- the
table is set with home games against Chicago (3-5) and Indianapolis
(1-7), and road games against St. Louis (2-6), New Orleans (4-4),
and Detroit (2-6).
</P>
<P>
   But if the Falcons are dreaming such dreams, they're not talking
about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a good position at the halfway point . . . but it
doesn't mean a thing if we don't finish it off,'' said coach Dan
Reeves, who improved his record against NFC West teams other than
the 49ers to 8-2. Reeves is 0-3 against the Niners.
</P>
<P>
   With quarterback Chris Chandler back in the lineup after a week
off with an injured shoulder and ribs, the Falcons moved to 12-4
when he starts and finishes, 1-7 otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   But the stars Sunday were the offensive linemen and running back
Jamal Anderson. Anderson ran through large openings for a
career-high 172 yards and two touchdowns on 22 carries. For good
measure, he added two receptions for 31 yards, including a 9-yard
touchdown catch.
</P>
<P>
   This game was never close. Details became superfluous early for
the tiny crowd of 37,996 -- one of the five worst Falcons crowds
since moving to the Georgia Dome -- as Atlanta led 17-0 after one
quarter, 27-7 at halftime. The Rams' only first-half points came on
a 37-yard interception return for a touchdown by cornerback Ryan
McNeil.
</P>
<P>
   It was a far cry from a week earlier, when the Jets whipped
Atlanta 28-3, and Atlanta had just 55 rushing yards. Sunday, the
Falcons had 199 rushing yards and a season-high 434 total yards.
They gave up just one sack after entering the game with the NFL's
worst ratio -- one sack every 7.7 passing plays.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson even split out wide a few times as the Falcons worked
with with a five-wide set and moved the pocket around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to give full credit to the offensive line,'' Anderson
said. ``We were disgusted last week, and we knew we had to come out
and attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler completed 12-of-26 passes for 236 yards and three
touchdowns. Even if he wasn't super sharp (the McNeil interception
was an especially bad throw), his presence made the Falcons offense
stronger and more confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the line blocking like that, Jamal running so hard, and
Chris playing, we win,'' said wide receiver Terance Mathis, who
caught a team-high five passes for 64 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta went 77 yards on four plays to start the game, and
Anderson scored on a 9-yard pass out of the backfield. The big play
was a 62-yard pass from Chandler to wide receiver Tony Martin, who
ran the final 54 yards after catching a short slant to the left.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the points in the first half came on a 23-yard field
goal by Morten Andersen, a 12-yard run by Anderson when he broke
three tackles, a 22-yard field goal by Andersen, and an 18-yard
pass from Chandler to Martin.
</P>
<P>
   After that, things were academic, including the reasons for the
Falcons success: They lead the NFL in average time of possession
(edge of 36:04 to 23:56 Sunday); they are plus-five in turnovers
(they were even Sunday); they're good on third downs (converting
5-of-11 Sunday), and they stop the run (the Rams had 46 rushing
yards, marking the fifth time in eight games the Falcons have held
an opponent to less than 70 yards rushing.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Atlanta has scored 21 times in 23 red zone
possessions, including 12 touchdowns. Sunday, they were 6-of-7
scoring in the red zone, with four touchdowns and two field goals.
The only misfire was a blocked field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out with something to prove to ourselves, not to
everybody else, but ourselves,'' said defensive end Lester
Archambeau, who moved inside to play tackle for the injured Travis
Hall. ``You look at 6-2 versus what we've done in the past, and
it's a great feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to (defensive tackle) Shane Dronett before the
game, and he said, 'Man, it feels like we haven't won in forever.'
It was just last week we lost (after a three-game winning streak).
That's what winning does. You get used to it.''

   (WASHINGTON) _ six Democratic incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only are these governors doing well, you see them reaching
out to impact House and Senate races in their states,'' said
Clinton Key, executive director of the Republican Governors
Association. ``I've never seen this level of coordination before.''
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse, however, said popular governors would not necessarily
bring votes to others on the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to have competitive races _ not landslides _ at the
top to pull voters to the polls,'' Newhouse said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Republican Governors Association rated 20 races
strongly in the GOP column and seven leaning their way. But
Democrats were making gains, polls showed, and were especially
looking at California for a comeback win.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of races that Republicans were expected to
win in a walk that are now extremely competitive,'' said Rich
McGrath, spokesman for the Democratic Governors Association.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of elections for governor could have a big effect on
the makeup of Congress in the long run because most governors have
veto power over how new congressional district boundaries are drawn
after the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you go out and draw lines that benefit campaigns?
Absolutely,'' Key said. ``As much impact as it has on Congress, it
has even more impact on state legislative races.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the governor races may affect the votes for Congress, so
may various issues with which the candidates are identified.
Pollsters have found no significant national issues, such as a bad
economy, stirring voters.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of talk this year about health-care reform,
tobacco legislation and education, but they are not expected to
increase voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of them are resonating in a dramatic way,'' Mann said.

 &HT;    Duval cool while winning scoring, money honors
 &HT;    By Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ By draining an 8-foot downhill birdie putt on the last
hole at East Lake Golf Club Sunday, David Duval calmly and coolly
iced the money and scoring titles for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty stoked,'' he said just before driving away in a silver
Mercedes S600, the Vardon Trophy for best scoring average stuck in
a plastic drawstring bag in his trunk.
</P>
<P>
   That's about as much emotion as you'll get out of Duval, who
most fans recognize by his dark wraparound sunglasses. He figured
the putt would be pretty important, and when he made it, there was
no club tossed in the air, no vertical leap. He pumped his right
fist so quickly it was almost unnoticeable and waved just a little
bit to the cheering crowd.
</P>
<P>
   While the leaderboards kept up with the Tour Championship, the
two other races figured foremost in his mind this week. A group of
his friends from his hometown of Jacksonville walked every hole
with him, tracking how he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't talk to him about it,'' said Michael Lanahan, a
Florida lumber executive. ``It's like a pitcher being told in the
bottom of the eighth that he's got a no-hitter going.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval, who turns 27 in eight days, felt some pressure coming
here, to a course he played only a few times while at Georgia Tech.
He arrived in what he called an ``enviable yet awkward position''
as the PGA's leading moneywinner and .04 behind Tiger Woods in
average scoring.
</P>
<P>
   He started out struggling to get his approach shots on the right
side of the hole and his birdie putts to drop. After a first-round
75 left him tied for next-to-last place among the 30 players and
his closest challenger in the money race, Jim Furyk, was tied for
third, Duval was in a little bit of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The scoring race fizzled when Woods started 75-76 and Duval
rebounded with 69s on Friday and Saturday. His performance on
Sunday's back nine sealed it for him. Along with 18, he also
birdied 13, 14 and 15 for a 31 to beat every other player by at
least two shots.
</P>
<P>
   He finished the season with an average 69.13 strokes per round,
ahead of Woods by .07. He finished seventh at the Tour
Championship, and the $120,533 payday boosted his 1998 winnings to
$2,591,031.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's probable that his peers will vote this month to
give the Player of the Year award to Mark O'Meara, who won two
major championships, Duval said winning the scoring and money
honors meant just as much to him. ``Those are the two you can
control as a player, and I'm going to get them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He is proud of making the most of his opportunities, playing in
23 events, his fewest in his four seasons on Tour, and winning four
times. ``Winning the Vardon Trophy equates to having played the
best golf, each week, each round over the course of the year,'' he
added. ``I didn't think I would be able to win it so early in my
career.''
</P>
<P>
   His plans for celebrating were up in the air, but he knew one
thing: ``I'm sure I'll be buying.''

U.S. SAYS IT WOULD CONSIDER ATTACK IF IRAQ DOESN'T BACK DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration said Sunday that it
would consider military strikes against Iraq if President Saddam
Hussein does not back down from his decision to halt all
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said that the Iraqi move, announced over the
weekend, was a ``clear violation'' of U.N. Security Council
resolutions and that ``from my point of view, we should keep all
our options open.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat of military strikes was made more directly by
Secretary of Defense William Cohen, who said unilateral U.S.
military action against Iraq ``has always been an option that we
could pursue.''
</P>
<P>
   As he arrived home after cutting short a trip to Asia because of
the latest in a series of crises involving arms inspections in
Iraq, Cohen told reporters at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland
that ``everybody is getting weary of dealing with Saddam Hussein.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said that no military action was imminent, and that none was being
actively considered for now.
</P>
<P>
   But they said that if Iraq does not reverse its decision and
allow inspections to resume, a military response would be
considered far more seriously than it was in August, when Iraq
imposed a more limited ban on spot inspections of its weapons
sites.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the administration was notably cautious in discussing
even the possibility of military action.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Iraq's actions on Saturday suggested that it had
decided to provoke a far more serious crisis with the United
Nations and the United States, and that Baghdad might intend to
force teams of arms inspectors out of the country and bar virtually
all international surveillance of its weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Saddam means what he says this time, a military strike
would be prominent among our list of options,'' a senior
administration official said. ``This is a different, more serious
situation than we faced last summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Butler, the chief U.N. weapons inspector, said in an
interview on CNN Sunday that Iraq's decision to end all cooperation
was ``truly serious.'' Iraq, he said, is ``in full-scale
confrontation with the Security Council now.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on CNN from Baghdad, Iraq's deputy prime minister,
Tariq Aziz, said Baghdad had decided to halt its cooperation out of
frustration over the failure of the United Nations to lift
crippling economic sanctions imposed on Iraq at the end of the 1991
gulf war. The lifting of the sanctions has been tied to Iraq's
cooperation in the weapons inspection program.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the sanctions are not lifted, why should we go on working
with Unscom?'' he said, using the acronym for the U.N. Special
Commission, which is charged with disarming Iraq. ``We are not
gambling, and we are not seeking confrontation. We are just
protecting our rights. We have a full right to lifting the
sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the United States has been eager to portray
Iraq's efforts to hinder weapons inspections as a struggle between
Iraq and the United Nations, not Iraq and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And on Sunday, Cohen suggested that the pressure was on the
United Nations and Secretary-General Kofi Annan to resolve the
latest crisis. Annan brokered a deal in February that ended a
threat of U.S. air strikes after Iraq agreed to provide inspectors
with unlimited access to suspected weapons sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kofi Annan should be concerned because his credibility and
that of the Security Council is on the line,'' Cohen said Sunday.
``Everyone in the Security Council should be concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged, however, that this showdown, like so many in
the past with Iraq, might have to be resolved in the end through
the threat of U.S. military force.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if a unilateral U.S. strike would be considered, Cohen
said, ``We prefer to act through allies, and hopefully that will be
the case if we have to take action at all.'' But he said unilateral
action was a possibility. ``We always have that capability,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States maintains a large military presence near Iraq,
including a fleet of more than 200 Air Force and Navy warplanes, an
aircraft carrier and other warships capable of firing long-range
Tomahawk cruise missiles.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Cohen attended a White House meeting late Sunday with Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright; Sandy Berger, the national security
adviser; George Tenet, the director of central intelligence; and
other senior officials to discuss the latest Iraqi moves.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, aides said the administration was closely
monitoring the situation in Iraq but expected no decision on a U.S.
response immediately, and certainly not before congressional
elections on Tuesday. ``The president's advisers reiterated that
all options remain on the table,'' said David Leavy, a spokesman
for the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials said they were heartened by the
tough language contained in a Security Council statement adopted
Saturday that described the Iraqi action as a ``flagrant
violation'' of U.N. resolutions, and by the quick condemnation of
Iraq by France and Russia, two nations that had pushed for more
lenient treatment of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the confrontation approach Iraq has taken has left
even its erstwhile supporters with little to say in their defense,
and we are finding increasing unity in the council,'' said James
Rubin, the State Department spokesman. ``This grave error that
Saddam Hussein has committed has unified the international
community in opposition to his policies and practices, which is
very important.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Ms. Albright was expected to speak by telephone Sunday
with Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine of France and Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov of Russia about the situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials said that the administration's decision earlier
this year to resist threats of U.S. military action against Iraq in
all but the most serious confrontations with the Iraqi government
was now paying dividends and could make it easier ultimately to
gather international support for air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a lot of heat earlier this year for what was perceived
to be a tactical adjustment in our policy,'' a senior
administration official said. ``But we knew that the more
reasonable we were over the last few months, the greater the chance
that countries like France and others would support tougher and
tougher measures against Iraq if it took a step like the one it
just took.''
</P>
<P>
   In his interview Sunday with the American Urban Radio network,
Clinton said Saddam's latest moves were ``a clear violation of the
U.N. Security Council resolutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who was interviewed in Baltimore, where he was out
campaigning for Tuesday's midterm elections, said he was ``very
pleased that the U.N. Security Council, including some people that
I think have been a little tolerant with him in the past, strongly
condemned what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From my point of view,'' he said, ``we should keep all our
options open, examine the nature of the action and where we are,
and then do what's best for the integrity of the United Nations and
the interest, the security interests, of the people of the United
States.''

FIBER-OPTIC DATA TRANSMISSION TECHNOLOGY AROUSES SKEPTICISM IN THE
INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The telecommunications industry is expressing curiosity and
skepticism about a little-known San Diego start-up company that
says it is ready to market a technology that significantly
increases the amount of data that can be sent over fiber optic
cables.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Silk Road Inc., plans a demonstration of the
technology in New York on Tuesday in which it will transmit 144
uncompressed television signals over 100 kilometers, or 62 miles,
of cable using a single laser beam.
</P>
<P>
   In publicizing the demonstration, Silk Road said that such
``bandwidth,'' the term used to express a system's data-carrying
capacity, far surpassed the capability of today's commercial fiber
optic networks.
</P>
<P>
   While that is true, a number of telecommunications-industry
experts expressed doubt about the company's ability to quickly
transform a controlled demonstration into a viable commercial
product. Cable capacity under laboratory conditions, they noted, is
not the same as bandwidth in real-world networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a large number of contacts from ambitious companies
with supposedly fantastic solutions,'' said Ted Darcie, head of
AT&AMP;T Laboratories' optical network research group. ``The real
questions are not demonstrating a high-performance link in the lab,
but getting it commercialized to the extent it's reliable and
compatible.''
</P>
<P>
   Silk Road said it planned to introduce commercial products in
the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The bandwidth to be demonstrated on Tuesday will be about 93
billion bits of information _ the equivalent of 77,500 copies of
``Moby Dick'' _ in one second, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Several experts said that even if the technology works as
promised, it would not significantly outstrip development progress
reported by current industry leaders of fiber optic network
equipment like Lucent Technologies and Ciena.
</P>
<P>
   But Silk Road executives said their engineers had achieved even
better results in the company's laboratory, transmitting up to 200
gigabits a second over a range of 200 miles. A gigabit is a billion
bits of data.
</P>
<P>
   A key feature that differentiates Silk Road's technology from
that of competitors, the company said, is its ability to send that
volume of data over long distances without having to either repeat
or amplify the signal along the way. Silk Road executives also said
it was possible to gain even more impressive bandwidth improvements
using a new technology for carrying information by laser light,
which they refer to as ``refractive synchronization''
communication. The company received a patent on the technology last
month and has applied for other patents.
</P>
<P>
   If true, the enormous bandwidth it is promising would represent
a significant advance in the ability of fiber optic networks to
carry data like digital voice and video signals and the packets of
information that make up the Internet. The technology is also well
suited to increasing the channel capacity of cable television
systems, as well as to delivering the extra bandwidth needed for
digital television, Silk Road executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications-industry researchers and executives expressed
skepticism that a company and technology they had never heard of
could deliver such remarkable performance to a world where the
appetite for bandwidth keeps growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wait with anticipation and excitement for such a technology
to prove itself in the commercial market,'' Darcie of AT&AMP;T
Laboratories said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that although the performance Silk Road plans to
demonstrate is impressive, it is about on par with the most
advanced results in top research laboratories.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Earlier this year, an NTT researcher in Japan demonstrated the
ability to transmit 640 gigabits a second over a distance of 60
kilometers, or 37.2 miles, using a single beam of laser light.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent executives said they were now working to deploy a fiber
optic networking technology for AT&AMP;T known as dense wave division
multiplexing, which they said would carry 400 gigabits a second
over fiber optic cables. That approach, which has been pioneered by
companies like Ciena and Northern Telecom in addition to Lucent,
uses a number of separate laser beams tuned to different
frequencies _ colors in this case _ to expand bandwidth.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of industry skepticism, Silk Road executives
defended their technology on Friday as ``hard-core optical
physics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Einstein would have put his stamp of approval on everything
we've done,'' said Robert Freeman, Silk Road's vice president for
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The company's technology, Freeman said, embeds information on a
single laser beam by using a device known as an electro-optical
modulator. He expressed doubt that claims on behalf of dense-wave
technology would be matched by installed performance.
</P>
<P>
   Silk Road has discussed its technology with a number of
telecommunications carriers, he said, but was not ready to announce
products or identify customers.
</P>
<P>
   The company was founded by James Palmer, a chemist the company
identifies as the former chief optical scientist for the Strategic
Defense Initiative, or ``Star Wars.''

 &HT;    Gordon wraps up championship at `The Rock'
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKINGHAM, N.C. _ Whoever said you can't have it all will have
to take it back. Jeff Gordon proved him wrong in high style Sunday
at North Carolina Motor Speedway by wrapping up the Winston Cup
championship on lap 120 and taking the ACDelco 400 victory with a
dramatic run to the checkered flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I've ever had a day this spectacular,'' said a
thrilled Gordon, who will compete in next Sunday's NAPA 500 at
Atlanta Motor Speedway. ``I've never won one like this before. It's
been an amazing year. It will make Atlanta more relaxing.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was Gordon's career 41st, 12th this year and fourth
at Rockingham. He's also the only driver the modern era to win 10
or more races in three consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's margin of victory was .520 seconds, and his average
speed 128.423 miles per hour. He leaves Rockingham with 5,143
points, enough for the title. Mark Martin, who finished fourth here
and is second in the points race, has 4,799.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon took the edge off early with a torrid run during the
first 100 laps, moving from ninth to sixth. When he led lap 120, it
gave him the five bonus points he needed to clinch his third
championship.
</P>
<P>
   But the championship celebration would have to wait. There was
enough car left to complete his Sunday double. All he needed was a
break, and he got it.
</P>
<P>
   After grinding away for 200 laps, the race fell into the hands
of Dale Jarrett, who would lead 195 laps, Rusty Wallace (153) and
Gordon (28). The turning point came following a pit stop under
green on lap 288, where a member of Gordon's crew let a tire roll
across pit road.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Gordon rejoined the race, he was seventh and being
pushed by Jeff Burton with 94 laps remaining. But it turned back in
his favor when Kenny Irwin scraped the wall, bringing out the day's
third caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the lead, then had that little problem on pit road,''
Gordon said. ``I didn't say a thing. We just stuck together and
worked on getting that thing back. Had it stayed green, it would
have been tough to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got a pretty good jump on us, but as soon as the caution
came out, I knew we were back in it. It was a great day.''
</P>
<P>
   From that point, lap 353, only Gordon and Wallace had the lead.
Wallace took it for 35 laps, but never attempted to block Gordon's
charge in the high grooves.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew I was up there,'' Gordon said. ``He had just been
passed by Dale Jarrett up there. I was really waiting for him to
come up and move up in front of me down in (turns) three and four.
I think he could have made it much more difficult for me to pass
him if he had that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's failure to do so was a tough pill for him to swallow.
He led 153 laps, but none of the final nine.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ With her high-fashion build (5 feet 8 inches and 117
pounds), long blonde hair and golden smile, Franca Fiacconi looks
as if she had just stepped off the cover of an Italian fashion
magazine. But she runs with the fierceness of Orlando Pizzolato,
Gianni Poli and Giacomo Leone, countrymen who have won the New York
City Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, on a chilly day ideal for road running, the 33-year-old
Fiacconi became the first Italian woman to win the New York race.
On a day when everything went right for her and everything went
wrong for Tegla Loroupe, the 25-year-old Kenyan and the strong
favorite, Fiacconi won convincingly (by 400 yards) and swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   Loroupe won New York in 1994 and 1995 and finished third in 1996
and 1997. In April in Rotterdam, she ran the fastest women's
marathon to date, in 2 hours, 20 minutes, 47 seconds. But Sunday
the 4-foot-11-inch, 83-pound Kenyan suffered stomach cramps and
struggled home a disconsolate third. In the final miles, just
lifting her legs became a major effort.
</P>
<P>
   With Loroupe out of contention, Fiacconi drew away comfortably,
won by more than a minute in 2:25:17 and knelt and kissed the
finish line. Her time was the fastest ever by an Italian woman, the
second-fastest ever in New York to Lisa Ondieki's 2:24:40 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Adriana Fernandez finished second in 2:26:33, the fastest ever
by a Mexican woman. Loroupe was third in 2:30:28, almost a mile
behind the winner. Franziska Rochat-Moser of Switzerland, last
year's winner, has been injured much of this year and finished
fifth in 2:32:37.
</P>
<P>
   Fiacconi became a surprise winner largely because of Loroupe's
travails. The Italian ran her first marathon in 1991. This was her
20th and her eighth victory. In her three previous New York
marathons, she finished 12th in 1992, second in 1996 and third last
year.
</P>
<P>
   She did not really expect to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if I could win,'' she said through a translator.
``But the course is very difficult, and there are a lot of
situations in a race, especially in New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation of the day was provided by Loroupe. She and
Fiacconi ran in the lead pack from the start, but halfway through
the race Loroupe seemed to be struggling. She dropped back more
than 200 yards, then fought back. But at 21 miles she started
fading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did run a good race,'' Loroupe said. ``I had cramps. It
started at 5 kilometers. I started to feel it in my stomach. I
slowed a bit and I recovered.''
</P>
<P>
   With four miles remaining in the 26-mile-385-yard race, Fiacconi
turned up her pace and the race was all but over.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Tegla started falling behind,'' Fernandez said, ``I said
now I have to go and get the Italian. But I didn't have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiacconi never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 30 kilometers,'' she said, ``I understood Tegla was not in
the race because the course was going up and she was not following.
I understood I could win. I was fit and feeling good, and I was
trying to push it. I knew I would have no problem in Central Park
because the last 5 kilometers in the park are my favorite part of
the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiacconi received the winner's rewards _ first-place money of
$50,000, a $25,000 bonus for breaking 2:26, a Dodge Intrepid and a
Chopard watch. That was in addition to her appearance money, said
to be $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Fiacconi is living testimony that hard work pays off. Most elite
marathoners run only two marathons a year, earning most of their
money in shorter road races. Fiacconi likes to run marathons. In
1996, she ran New York three weeks after running another marathon.
Last year, her marathon here was her third in 55 days. Sunday's
marathon was her fourth of 1998. The last one was 10 weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   How does she do it?
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I like to run the marathon,'' she said. ``If it
was up to me, I would run 12 marathons a year. And I was prepared
to run fast. I was not afraid of anybody here. It's important to be
fit, important in your mind. If I want to run fast, I can do it
with my mind as well as my body.''
</P>
<P>
   She prepares with almost inhumane workouts. In one training
session, she will run three 5,000-meter repeats in 16:40, with only
two minutes of rest between repeats. On other days, she might run
two 10-kilometer repeats in the morning and two more in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Fiacconi's life involves more than running. She earned a
university degree this year in physical education, and she skis and
plays tennis. She lives in Rome with her husband, Luciano Milani, a
banker.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, she said it was important in Italy that an attractive
woman could be a successful athlete, that she could be intelligent
and still run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this will help,'' she said. ``
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   What helps the most is putting everything together on one day.
As Rochat-Moser, last year's winner, said: ``To win this race, I
think you need to have your day. Last year, I didn't see anything.
I didn't see the hills because I was concentrating so much. This
year, I felt every hill, every bridge. You must be in the shape of
your life to win the New York City Marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   When that message was relayed to Fiacconi, she nodded in
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first,'' she said, ``I didn't know it was my day, but my
legs were very well prepared to run fast. I knew it was my day
after 30 kilometers when I tried to move and my legs were active.''
</P>
<P>
   FINISHING KICKS
</P>
<P>
   Libbie Hickman of Fort Collins, Colo., the United States'
10-kilometer road champion, was the leading American finisher,
sixth in 2:33:06. ``This was only my second serious marathon,''
said Hickman, 33, ``and I'm still a little tentative, a little too
conservative.'' ... Joan Benoit Samuelson, 41, of Freeport, Me.,
who in Los Angeles in 1984 won the first Olympic women's marathon,
was the second American finisher, 12th over all among women in
2:41:06. The next Americans were Anne Marie Lauck of Hampton, N.J.,
13th in 2:42:52 and Dr. Kim Griffin of New York, 17th in 2:46:17.
Lauck's husband, Jim, said she hurt her back during the race, and
Hickman said Lauck's face seemed flushed after 10 miles. Griffin
was taking a day off from her emergency-room duties at Mount Sinai
Hospital, a mile from the finish line.

<P>
   ANYANG, South Korea _ Crouching by the door in his brown pants
and pink hand-me-down shirt, Han Seung-ghil might have been
preparing for his first day of kindergarten as he stared around the
brightly painted room at the tangle of other boys jumping around
him.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Seung-ghil, who is 5, saw almost nothing through his
mask of tears on the first day of what will probably become his
life as an orphan.
</P>
<P>
   Seung-ghil's father, an architect whose wife left him, lost his
job and could no longer care for the boy and his two sisters,
particularly after relatives stopped pitching in. So the father
took his children to Anyang Baby's Home, a shelter that places
children in orphanages, and then he walked away without leaving an
address.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever the economy is doing badly, we always have an
abundance of children here,'' said Sim Yang-keum, the home's
director. ``But now, the children come from very normal families,
from parents who tried their best to give their children a good
life _ highly educated parents. That's what really breaks my
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   These growing numbers of ``economic orphans,'' though still
rare, are just one symptom of the psychological distress tearing at
families as South Korea's economy descends in a tailspin. Asia's
financial collapse has whipsawed throughout the country, and the
stricken have turned to suicide or swindle, or they are living in
limbo _ at the homes of relatives, in shelters or on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear there is lots of unusual _ a high level of _
psychological distress,'' said Choi In-sub, a sociologist at the
Korean Institute of Criminology. ``People sometimes may look a
little hysterical.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not surprising, since a staggering number of companies
have collapsed over the past year, leaving entrepreneurs with empty
pockets and huge debts. And with companies ailing and collapsing,
hundreds of thousands of workers are out of work across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Such hardship has led some people to take radical steps that
would probably be unthinkable in better times. The incidence of
insurance fraud, for instance, has jumped, sometimes with grim
results, and the more horrifying cases have seized national
attention as they underscore how the economic crisis has sent some
people over the edge.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to have been the case with Kang Jeung-ryul, a
42-year-old fortune teller. He had lost almost all his customers,
and was in debt and destitute.
</P>
<P>
   One day last month, Kang told the police that three masked men
had robbed his home, and he had what seemed to be grisly evidence
that the crime had occurred and that he was entitled to insurance
money: His 10-year-old son's little finger had been cut off,
supposedly by the robbers in an act of viciousness.
</P>
<P>
   The only part of the story that was true was the severed pinkie,
which the father had cut off with scissors in the family's one-room
home. Kang had reportedly persuaded his son to sacrifice his finger
by saying that he was dying and, ``If you let your finger be cut
off, I will be able to live.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy complied, and remained silent even during the police
investigation. Only after his father confessed to the police did
the boy admit to the scheme. By then, it was too late to reattach
the finger. The father was put in prison and the boy went to live
at his grandmother's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has had a difficult time, and we want him to readjust back
to school life,'' said his aunt, who declined to give her name in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of desperation, the number of suicides is up by
one-fourth in the first quarter of this year, compared with the
corresponding period in 1997. Some of these are family
suicide-murders, often with the father killing his family before
taking his own life, or with the entire family taking poison
together, according to Choi at the Institute of Criminology.
</P>
<P>
   It is not all bleak, though. As one walks the sidewalks of
Seoul, it does not feel overwhelmingly depressed nor even so
obviously different from a year ago. Shoppers still prowl the
department stores, and cars still clog the streets.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, crime rates fell in the first months after South Korea
turned to the International Monetary Fund for $58 billion in
assistance. One explanation, according to Choi, is that economic
hard times may actually be bringing some families closer together.
Fewer people go out at night and fewer people are shopping, which
narrows the opportunities for pickpockets and purse-snatchers.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the more visible signs of the recession is that many
people are being kicked out of their homes into the streets when
they can no longer afford the rent. While the government has tried
to place some of the stranded in shelters, others have slipped
through the cracks in a society where homelessness has been rare.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So Lee Ki-young, a 42-year-old construction worker, has taken
his wife and two young children to the streets to live. When floods
chased them from a river bank, they moved to a bare spot on a path
in Seosomoon Park, where they set up their new home in a tent about
five months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pleaded with the landlord to give us three more months to
pay the rent, and I cried and begged, but we were forced out onto
the streets,'' said Han Hyun-sook, Lee's 40-year-old wife. ``I've
spent all the money we had saved up.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobs became scarce for Lee in the summer of last year, as
Korea's economy began unraveling. Then their 4-year-old son, Lee
Jae-jin, fell sick and the hospital bills consumed their savings
because Lee, as an itinerant construction worker, had no health
coverage. Like many other jobless people, Lee finds it difficult to
pay for food, let alone medical insurance.
</P>
<P>
   To get work these days, Lee, a junior high school dropout,
awakes at 4 a.m. to line up at a job-assignment office an hour
away. He turned down a chance to move into a temporary government
shelter, because his wife would not have been allowed to cook for
the children there and they would have had to move out three months
later.
</P>
<P>
   His wife has been working temporarily, cooking meals at a
kindergarten, where she can take her children during the day, but
that job will end soon, and then she will have to look for another.
But she refuses to put her children in an orphanage, perhaps
because she herself became a foster child when her mother said one
day that she was going to the market _ and never returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as their father has hope and I have hope,'' she said,
she would not leave her children. ``I have to live for my
children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The real victims of the crisis, though, are usually the silent
ones, and among them are the nearly 300 new orphans who have lost
their homes in Korea over the last year. That is only a small
fraction of the 17,000 orphans and foster children, but the rise
reverses a trend that for years saw the number of orphans dwindle
throughout the country. So now, orphanages and foster homes are
seeing their rooms fill up once again.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the crisis, the government has created and
expanded the shelters for children of unemployed workers in the
hope that by taking away the burden of child raising, they will
enable parents to reorganize their lives, get back on their feet
and then take their children back.
</P>
<P>
   Though some parents ultimately retrieve their children, social
workers say they expect that most will not and that the children
will move from orphanage to orphanage. In the past, documents have
often been lost, so even if their parents tried to recover the
children, they would not be able to find them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen only three to four, out of an average group of 45,
in which parents have come back for their kids,'' said Koh
Jae-kwon, the manager at Angels' Haven Social Welfare Society.
``The rest are abandoned.''
</P>
<P>
   So Koh is not hopeful for Choi Jin-young, a 7-year-old boy who
has been at this orphanage for four months. Jin-young's mother
died, and his father turned him over to Angels' Haven because he
ran out of money and his relatives no longer could afford to take
care of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   But there is still a chance: Jin-young's 36-year-old father,
Choi Seok-koo, calls from a pay phone once a week to talk to his
son and he visits twice a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like there were no options,'' said Choi, on the phone
one evening after he talked with his son. ``I hope to get remarried
as fast as possible. I plan to pick up my son when I can start
fresh again.''

   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ Building on his background as a popular
Democratic mayor of this Sunbelt city, Martin Chavez would like to
picture himself as New Mexico's future governor. But with his
wire-rimmed glasses and the beleaguered status of Democrats in the
region, political cartoonists might sketch him as a New Mexican
spotted owl.
</P>
<P>
   With Tuesday's election, Democratic governors in the interior
West risk falling in status from endangered to nearly extinct.
</P>
<P>
   In the 14-state area bounded by the Sierra Nevadas on the West
and the Missouri and Arkansas Rivers on the East, 11 of the
governors are Republicans. In the Republican-led states that have
races, Democrats are not expected to make inroads. In the three
states with Democratic governors, Colorado, Nebraska and Nevada,
Republican candidates approach the elections with leads in opinion
polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Rocky Mountain area, it's tough, we just don't have the
kind of representation we used to,'' Roy Romer, Colorado's governor
and chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said last week,
while campaigning in Colorado for Gail Schoettler, the Democratic
candidate in the race to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, when Romer was first elected governor in 1986, the
Western Governors' Association was a Democratic club. Fifteen years
ago, only two states in the 14-state region, North Dakota and South
Dakota, had Republican governors.
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts attribute the change to ``the Valhalla
syndrome'' _ white conservatives fleeing social strife in
California and Texas for a low-crime, mountain paradise. In
Colorado, for every Democrat who moved to the state in the last
decade, two Republicans did. Evenly balanced only a decade ago,
voter registration in Colorado now favors the Republicans by
130,000 voters.
</P>
<P>
   Here in New Mexico, there are 60 percent more registered
Democrats than Republicans. But the governor, Gary Johnson, is a
Republican, and four members of the five-member congressional
delegation are Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a real change in New Mexico, we are becoming
more Republican in voting,'' said Chris Garcia, who has taught
political science at the University of New Mexico for the last 29
years. ``The people coming in from California and Texas are a lot
more conservative, more affluent, more likely to support the
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was speaking at the end of a campus forum, featuring the
two contenders, Chavez and Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the clearest philosophical choice between two
competing visions of government,'' the political scientist
continued. ``Martin Chavez is in the classical mold of New Deal
government and programs. Gary Johnson, in contrast, hews not only
to the traditional Republican view of low taxes, but extends into
libertarianism.''
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, Ms. Schoettler, who is the state's lieutenant
governor, often plays down her party affiliation and offers a
centrist, pragmatic approach. Her Republican opponent, Bill Owens,
is the state treasurer, and he offers white-collar, Christian
conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   In a measure of shifts in Colorado, The Denver Post, once the
state's liberal voice, endorsed Owens and almost all Republicans
running for Congress, including Bob Greenlee, the candidate to
represent the 2nd District, which includes Boulder. In the Senate
race, The Post editorial board endorsed Ben Nighthorse Campbell,
the Republican, spurning Democratic candidate Dottie Lamm, its
former columnist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a massive movement of people into Colorado and
New Mexico from California, and that has changed the political
complexion of those states,'' said Federico Pena, a Democrat and
former member of the Clinton Cabinet. Mayor of Denver in the
mid-1980s, Pena returned to Denver this fall to be an investment
banker, deflecting appeals from some Colorado Democrats that he run
for statewide office.
</P>
<P>
   In Nevada, the other interior Western state with a Democratic
governor, polls indicate that Kenny Guinn, the Republican
candidate, has a small edge over the Democrat, Jan Jones. In a
state where party registration is evenly split, Ms. Jones was mayor
of Las Vegas, Nevada's largest city. Guinn has been a banker, the
president of a gas corporation and a superintendent of schools.
</P>
<P>
   In Nebraska, Mike Johannes, the former mayor of Lincoln and a
Republican, is leading strongly in polls against Bill Hoppner, a
Democratic lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, Dick Wadhams, campaign manager for Owens, said of the
shifts he has seen in recent decades: ``The generation of Democrats
that dominated the Rockies in the '70s and '80s has basically come
and gone. The West is becoming more conservative in its outlook.''

more Republican in voting,'' said Chris Garcia, who has taught
political science at the University of New Mexico for the last 29
years. ``The people coming in from California and Texas are a lot
more conservative, more affluent, more likely to support the
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was speaking at the end of a campus forum, featuring the
two contenders, Chavez and Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the clearest philosophical choice between two
competing visions of government,'' the political scientist
continued. ``Martin Chavez is in the classical mold of New Deal
government and programs. Gary Johnson, in contrast, hews not only
to the traditional Republican view of low taxes, but extends into
libertarianism.''
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, Ms. Schoettler, who is the state's lieutenant
governor, often plays down her party affiliation and offers a
centrist, pragmatic approach. Her Republican opponent, Bill Owens,
is the state treasurer, and he offers white-collar, Christian
conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   In a measure of shifts in Colorado, The Denver Post, once the
state's liberal voice, endorsed Owens and almost all Republicans
running for Congress, including Bob Greenlee, the candidate to
represent the 2nd District, which includes Boulder. In the Senate
race, The Post editorial board endorsed Ben Nighthorse Campbell,
the Republican, spurning Democratic candidate Dottie Lamm, its
former columnist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a massive movement of people into Colorado and
New Mexico from California, and that has changed the political
complexion of those states,'' said Federico Pena, a Democrat and
former member of the Clinton Cabinet. Mayor of Denver in the
mid-1980s, Pena returned to Denver this fall to be an investment
banker, deflecting appeals from some Colorado Democrats that he run
for statewide office.
</P>
<P>
   In Nevada, the other interior Western state with a Democratic
governor, polls indicate that Kenny Guinn, the Republican
candidate, has a small edge over the Democrat, Jan Jones. In a
state where party registration is evenly split, Ms. Jones was mayor
of Las Vegas, Nevada's largest city. Guinn has been a banker, the
president of a gas corporation and a superintendent of schools.
</P>
<P>
   In Nebraska, Mike Johannes, the former mayor of Lincoln and a
Republican, is leading strongly in polls against Bill Hoppner, a
Democratic lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, Dick Wadhams, campaign manager for Owens, said of the
shifts he has seen in recent decades: ``The generation of Democrats
that dominated the Rockies in the '70s and '80s has basically come
and gone. The West is becoming more conservative in its outlook.''

 &HT;    Satellite deployment takes spotlight off Glenn
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, Texas _ John Glenn upstaged mission
commander Curt Brown again Sunday when the two astronauts held
their first in-orbit press conference with earthbound reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He showed high spirits, even when CNN's Walter Cronkite, the
elder TV newsman who covered Glenn's first flight for CBS, asked
Brown if ``the old man is giving you any trouble up there. Is his
walker getting in your way?''
</P>
<P>
   Both spacemen laughed, and Brown reported Glenn is doing ``a
fantastic job. Probably the biggest problem I have with him is
every once in a while he wants to grab my food. Other than that,
he's doing okay.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Glenn appeared to be relishing his time in space, far
more of it than he had during his historic but brief Mercury flight
in 1962, and the lifelong Presbyterian said seeing earth from the
heavens ``just strengthens my faith.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he has been getting ``solid'' sleep and hasn't been
bothered by the space sickness that temporarily afflicts many
astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   A boxy satellite stole the media spotlight from Glenn briefly
earlier in the day when Discovery's crew released it from the
shuttle to fly free for two days.
</P>
<P>
   Using the orbiter's 50-foot-long robot arm, mission specialist
Scott Parazynski lifted the 2,978-pound Spartan 201 solar
observation satellite out of the payload bay. The orbiter was
drifting over Baja, Calif., at an altitude of 341 miles when
Parazynski gently released it at 2 p.m. Eastern Time.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite swiveled back and forth in what Spartan mission
scientist Don Carson called a ``pirouette maneuver'' to show its
systems were working. After that, Brown fired Discovery's
maneuvering jets to begin moving the orbiter away from the
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a real smooth deploy. Great job to the crew of
Discovery,'' spacecraft communicator Mike Gernhardt radioed from
the mission control center here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you very much, Mike. We agree. It was a beautiful sight
up here,'' Parazynski said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Glenn told reporters he took a break from his own work to
watch the crew release the gold-colored satellite.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a really beautiful sight. To be up here and see a
satellite launched from a satellite is quite an experience,'' Glenn
said.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment highlighted another busy day for the crew.
Despite losing a door to the dragchute compartment at liftoff,
foul-tasting water in a new water supply system, and a few glitches
with experiments, the flight has been going ``smooth as silk,''
flight director Paul Dye said. Video beamed down during the day
showed Glenn and other crew members busy with their experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment was the fifth for this particular satellite. An
attempt last November went awry when an astronaut skipped a
critical step in the complicated deployment sequence and failed to
turn on the satellite before releasing it.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem, the astronaut tried to regrab the
satellite without first reopening the grapple hooks on the robot
arm. The arm only bumped Spartan, giving it a slow spin and making
it impossible to grab with the arm.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, two astronauts spacewalked into the payload bay and
grabbed the satellite by hand.
</P>
<P>
   NASA changed the deployment procedures so a computer would
confirm each step along the way. It also changed a timing sequence
which had put the astronauts under pressure to recover the
satellite quickly if it wasn't working.
</P>
<P>
   After the deployment, Parazynski bounced a laser beam off the
satellite with a hand-held rangefinding device as Discovery moved
away. Carson said the device is designed to aid spacecraft docking
with the International Space Station.

   NEW YORK _ A controversy broke out involving top wheelchair
athletes at the New York City Marathon Sunday when all but the
first two of the wheelchair racers, who started 10 minutes in front
of everyone else, were stopped by police at the 15-mile mark for up
to 35 minutes to allow the lead packs of men and women _ and the 30
trucks, motorcycles and police vehicles accompanying them _ to
cross the Queensboro Bridge first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a slap in the face, an insult,'' said Tom Gorman of
Littlestown, Pa., who finished fourth among the wheelchair racers.
``The last thing I want to do is complain, but we were so far ahead
of the runners there was no need to stop us.'' Gorman, 42, was
competing in his third New York marathon ``and probably my last.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen Steinfeld, president of the New York Road Runners Club,
said the halt was a safety measure because this year there is no
longer an outer roadway on the bridge for the wheelchairs and
others to use. In the past, he said, both the outer roadway and the
lower roadway were used.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a Road Runners statement noted that New York City
Marathon's policy was to stop wheelchairs ``to let elite runners
through, because this race does not have an official wheelchair
division.'' But Steinfeld emphasized that vehicles, not people,
were the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The runners can run single-file,'' he said, but the news media
and police vehicles take up a lot of room.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Traum, president of the Achilles Track Club, the
international organization devoted to marathoners with
disabilities, said he was aware of the plan to halt the
wheelchairs. But apparently word never reached the racers.
</P>
<P>
   Traum, who is a board member of both clubs, said he thought the
Achilles and Road Runners clubs needed to talk about the matter.
``Elite wheelchair racers running with runners on foot is
dangerous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On sharp turns such as the one at the Manhattan end of the
Queensboro Bridge, wheelchairs could conceivably knock down elite
runners. On the other hand, elite wheelchair racers have criticized
the Road Runners Club in the past for treating them as second-class
entrants. Traum acknowledged that the two clubs have had a
contentious relationship.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   During the 1995 marathon, high winds blew away plywood that had
been laid on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to make the bridge
surface smoother for the wheelchairs, forcing the race organizers
to bus the wheelchair racers to the Brooklyn side of the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 wheelchair athletes entered Sunday's event. Because
the fastest wheelchair racers can barrel downhill on the course at
speeds of up to 60 miles per hour, some usually finish the race
with times better than the official winner of the foot race.
Gorman, for example, said that after subtracting his 35-minute,
police-enforced wait, his finishing time was 2 hours 2 minutes.
John Kagwe, the men's winner, finished the race in 2:08:45.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Jackson of Washington, D.C., another wheelchair racer
forced to halt as he approached the Queensboro Bridge, said the
elite foot runners were not yet in sight when the wheelchairs were
ordered to stop. Jackson, 41 years old, who works for the
Department of Justice, called it ``one of the worst cases of
discrimination I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinfeld responded to the wheelchair racers' complaints by
saying, ``Communications is always a problem.''

RUELAS STEPS OUT OF THE RING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the bell rang to signal the beginning of his bout with John
Brown on Oct. 24 in Atlantic City, N.J., Gabriel Ruelas said the
first thought that popped into his head was this:
</P>
<P>
   ``What the hell am I doing here?''
</P>
<P>
   He fought like it, as if he didn't want to be in the ring with
the sturdy little banger from Atlantic City, as if his dramatic
up-and-down career was over before the first punches were exchanged
and he knew it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Ruelas lost. In fact, he was thrashed in much the
same way !ital!he!off! had thrashed Jimmy Garcia on the horrible
night in 1995 that resulted in Garcia's death. In a way that makes
you want to turn your head.
</P>
<P>
   The one-sided bout was stopped by the referee in the eighth
round, which apparently marks the end of Ruelas' career: He said
his intention is never to fight again.
</P>
<P>
   Not so much because he lost or how. He's lost before. No, he's
walking away because the joy he once derived from a sport he loves
was left in the ring that night he fought Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas, like so many in his unenviable position, never got over
the tragedy. He thought he did, but it's clear now he didn't. His
passion for the sport is gone. He evolved from a fine boxer into a
simple slugger, as if to prove to everyone _ including himself _
that he wasn't afraid to hurt his opponent when in fact he was.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who followed his rise from a poor Arleta kid to world
champion could see he wasn't the same fighter. Finally, he admitted
what now seems obvious: Garcia's death ruined his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``You said it, I didn't,'' he said. ``That's how I feel
sometimes when I'm alone. . . . I cuss or something and ask myself,
`Why did this happen to me?'
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to explain the feeling. You have to kill
someone to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas had faced adversity before and emerged triumphant.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, his right elbow was broken in a bout with Jeff Franklin
and doctors wondered whether he'd ever fight again. A year later,
with screws in an arm he can't completely straighten, he was back
in the ring, ultimately winning the WBC super featherweight title
when he easily outpointed one of the hottest fighters around, James
Leija, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   However, a broken elbow cannot compare to Garcia's death.
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas swore that he had accepted it, that it had simply become
a part of him and he was ready to move on. Countless interviews
with the media and a few with professional therapists had done the
trick, he insisted. Only he didn't show it in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   In his first fight after the Garcia tragedy, the stress
apparently made him physically ill: He said afterward that he had
severe flu symptoms. He went on with the bout but fought like an
amateur and was knocked out by Azumah Nelson to lose his precious
title.
</P>
<P>
   In subsequent fights, he seemed to go through the motions, an
approach to boxing that can get a fighter hurt. The only possible
exception was a thrilling, give-and-take war against Arturo Gatti
last year, which Gatti won by knockout.
</P>
<P>
   What was going on in Ruelas' head? Too much, which was the
problem. In every fight _ and every sparring session, for that
matter _ he fought two opponents: Himself and the other guy in the
ring, an impossible task. He fought himself in a tortuous,
never-ending effort to push aside something that wouldn't go away _
the Garcia tragedy _ while competing against opponents trained to
destroy him. He was relieved simply to get through fights.
</P>
<P>
   He described his every step in boxing after Garcia's death as
two sides of a coin, ``one great, one real bad, but only because of
the Garcia thing. That's the only thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to take anything away from Brown, but Ruelas appeared to be
in this state of mind on Oct. 24. It's no wonder he lost his
passion for boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've almost forgotten who I used to be,'' Ruelas said, with
sadness in his voice. ``I used to care only about winning, forget
the money. Now, I try to prove to people and myself that I'm still
the person I was. I really felt like it was double the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when I won fights, I felt all this pressure. There was a
lot of stress. I haven't been myself in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas' wife, Leslie, cried when she talked about her husband's
constant battle with the past.
</P>
<P>
   She was one of those who believed Ruelas. She was convinced he
had dealt with Garcia's death as well as can be expected because he
said so and he doesn't openly express his emotions. When she
finally realized that he had merely pushed it aside rather than
truly face it _ which precluded any chance of healing _ she
understood the pain he was experiencing.
</P>
<P>
   And it kills her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just know he thinks about Garcia (a lot), he's with him a
lot,'' said Leslie Ruelas, trying but failing to hold back tears.
``He tried to go on and make a living the only way he knew how. I
just feel so bad that I'm the one who's supposed to see (his pain)
and I didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always told him, `You have to go back to boxing (rather than
slugging). You have to be who you used to be.' It just kills me
he's been carrying this around with him.''
</P>
<P>
   It kills Ruelas to speak negatively about boxing, a sport that
gave him an identity, not to mention a measure of fame and fortune.
He repeated over and over how indebted he felt and he could barely
admit his passion had died.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't have to. It's obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ruelas has the rest of his life to live. He and Leslie have
two young boys, which should keep him busy. He has worked as a
television commentator a number of times for Univision and talks
about becoming a trainer or manager, which should provide him an
income.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the matter of dealing with the Garcia
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas doesn't know how to go about it. He said life will
provide a solution, while friends are pushing him to seek regular
counseling until he sorts it out, which he said he'll consider.
</P>
<P>
   One thing will help: He no longer will be throwing punches,
which led him into this hell in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things happened in my career, the elbow, Garcia,
things that not everyone goes through'' he said, trying to be
philosophical. ``Yet I should be thankful. It could be worse.
Others go through worse things than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I tell myself, `Stop bitching about it. Just deal
with it, deal with the rest of your life. Don't make it go away.
Just deal with it. Just go on with life. That's all.' ''
</P>
<P>
   __ Rabbit punches: Naseem Hamed's buffoonery is understandable:
It earns him millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   However, he should try mixing in a little boxing. His run-first,
punch-second performance against Wayne McCullough on Saturday was a
waste of 36 minutes. He's going to lose fans with too many more
nights like that.
</P>
<P>
   It was no wonder he was booed....
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Quiles, who knocked out Margarito Navarro in three rounds
last month at the Country Club, will headline the Nov. 19 card at
the Reseda venue. The junior middleweight's opponent has yet to be
determined.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the card, against to-be-named opponents: lightweight
Juan Lazcano, light heavyweight Chris Johnson and Victor Ortiz and
Eddie Gutierrez....
</P>
<P>
   Peter Broudy, who oversaw the Oct. 22 card, said roughly 900
fans attended. Not bad for a Los Angeles venue these days.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the recognizable names of Orlando Canizales and
Alonzo Highsmith played a role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminded me of the '80s when this place was really up and
running. It looks like the Country Club is back as a viable spot,''
Broudy said....
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Ramirez and Jose Badillo will meet next Monday at the
Forum for the right to face Javier Jauregui in January for the
Forum's junior lightweight tournament championship.
</P>
<P>
   In the co-feature, Edgar Ruiz will take on Jose Luis Benitez in
a 12-round fight for the vacant NABO welterweight title. Ruiz won
the 1998 Mitsubishi welterweight tournament by beating Ricky Hesia,
tournament-favorite Larry Dixon and Cuban Giorbis Barthelemy.

U.S. SAYS IT WOULD CONSIDER ATTACK IF IRAQ DOESN'T BACK DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration said Sunday that it
would consider military strikes against Iraq if President Saddam
Hussein does not back down from his decision to halt all
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said that the Iraqi move, announced over the
weekend, was a ``clear violation'' of U.N. Security Council
resolutions and that ``from my point of view, we should keep all
our options open.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat of military strikes was made more directly by
Secretary of Defense William Cohen, who said unilateral U.S.
military action against Iraq ``has always been an option that we
could pursue.''
</P>
<P>
   As he arrived home after cutting short a trip to Asia because of
the latest in a series of crises involving arms inspections in
Iraq, Cohen told reporters at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland
that ``everybody is getting weary of dealing with Saddam Hussein.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said that no military action was imminent, and that none was being
actively considered for now.
</P>
<P>
   But they said that if Iraq does not reverse its decision and
allow inspections to resume, a military response would be
considered far more seriously than it was in August, when Iraq
imposed a more limited ban on spot inspections of its weapons
sites.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the administration was notably cautious in discussing
even the possibility of military action.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Iraq's actions on Saturday suggested that it had
decided to provoke a far more serious crisis with the United
Nations and the United States, and that Baghdad might intend to
force teams of arms inspectors out of the country and bar virtually
all international surveillance of its weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Saddam means what he says this time, a military strike
would be prominent among our list of options,'' a senior
administration official said. ``This is a different, more serious
situation than we faced last summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Butler, the chief U.N. weapons inspector, said in an
interview on CNN Sunday that Iraq's decision to end all cooperation
was ``truly serious.'' Iraq, he said, is ``in full-scale
confrontation with the Security Council now.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on CNN from Baghdad, Iraq's deputy prime minister,
Tariq Aziz, said Baghdad had decided to halt its cooperation out of
frustration over the failure of the United Nations to lift
crippling economic sanctions imposed on Iraq at the end of the 1991
gulf war. The lifting of the sanctions has been tied to Iraq's
cooperation in the weapons inspection program.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the sanctions are not lifted, why should we go on working
with Unscom?'' he said, using the acronym for the U.N. Special
Commission, which is charged with disarming Iraq. ``We are not
gambling, and we are not seeking confrontation. We are just
protecting our rights. We have a full right to lifting the
sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the United States has been eager to portray
Iraq's efforts to hinder weapons inspections as a struggle between
Iraq and the United Nations, not Iraq and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And on Sunday, Cohen suggested that the pressure was on the
United Nations and Secretary-General Kofi Annan to resolve the
latest crisis. Annan brokered a deal in February that ended a
threat of U.S. air strikes after Iraq agreed to provide inspectors
with unlimited access to suspected weapons sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kofi Annan should be concerned because his credibility and
that of the Security Council is on the line,'' Cohen said Sunday.
``Everyone in the Security Council should be concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged, however, that this showdown, like so many in
the past with Iraq, might have to be resolved in the end through
the threat of U.S. military force.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if a unilateral U.S. strike would be considered, Cohen
said, ``We prefer to act through allies, and hopefully that will be
the case if we have to take action at all.'' But he said unilateral
action was a possibility. ``We always have that capability,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States maintains a large military presence near Iraq,
including a fleet of more than 200 Air Force and Navy warplanes, an
aircraft carrier and other warships capable of firing long-range
Tomahawk cruise missiles.
</P>

<P>
</P>
<P>
   Cohen attended a White House meeting late Sunday with Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright; Sandy Berger, the national security
adviser; George Tenet, the director of central intelligence; and
other senior officials to discuss the latest Iraqi moves.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, aides said the administration was closely
monitoring the situation in Iraq but expected no decision on a U.S.
response immediately, and certainly not before congressional
elections on Tuesday. ``The president's advisers reiterated that
all options remain on the table,'' said David Leavy, a spokesman
for the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials said they were heartened by the
tough language contained in a Security Council statement adopted
Saturday that described the Iraqi action as a ``flagrant
violation'' of U.N. resolutions, and by the quick condemnation of
Iraq by France and Russia, two nations that had pushed for more
lenient treatment of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the confrontation approach Iraq has taken has left
even its erstwhile supporters with little to say in their defense,
and we are finding increasing unity in the council,'' said James
Rubin, the State Department spokesman. ``This grave error that
Saddam Hussein has committed has unified the international
community in opposition to his policies and practices, which is
very important.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Ms. Albright was expected to speak by telephone Sunday
with Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine of France and Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov of Russia about the situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials said that the administration's decision earlier
this year to resist threats of U.S. military action against Iraq in
all but the most serious confrontations with the Iraqi government
was now paying dividends and could make it easier ultimately to
gather international support for air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a lot of heat earlier this year for what was perceived
to be a tactical adjustment in our policy,'' a senior
administration official said. ``But we knew that the more
reasonable we were over the last few months, the greater the chance
that countries like France and others would support tougher and
tougher measures against Iraq if it took a step like the one it
just took.''
</P>
<P>
   In his interview Sunday with the American Urban Radio network,
Clinton said Saddam's latest moves were ``a clear violation of the
U.N. Security Council resolutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who was interviewed in Baltimore, where he was out
campaigning for Tuesday's midterm elections, said he was ``very
pleased that the U.N. Security Council, including some people that
I think have been a little tolerant with him in the past, strongly
condemned what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From my point of view,'' he said, ``we should keep all our
options open, examine the nature of the action and where we are,
and then do what's best for the integrity of the United Nations and
the interest, the security interests, of the people of the United
States.''

   QUINCY, Mass. _ The ``victory tour'' buses glided into the
Quincy town center on a nippy, yellow-leaved afternoon on Sunday,
parked right near the 17th-century burial ground whose iron gate
reads ``Dust thou art &AMP; unto dust thou shalt return,'' and
disgorged dozens of very much alive Republican stalwarts.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens more local Quincy political cheerleaders, already in
place and holding up signs with hands turning numb in the November
air, chanted ``Four more years!''
</P>
<P>
   And then, looking as if he were sincerely having a good time,
Argeo Paul Cellucci, the Republican acting governor of
Massachusetts, who is running to remove the ``acting'' from his
title, took to the open-air podium at his fourth rally of the day
to pound on the points meant to cement his slim lead:
</P>
<P>
   Did the state need a governor who would continue cutting taxes?
(``Yes!'' shouted the crowd.) And did it want a governor who stood
for higher standards in the classrooms? (``Yes!'') And who would
protect the state by signing the death penalty into law? (``Yes!'')
</P>
<P>
   And how about his running mate, Jane Swift, whose newborn
daughter and solid working relationship with him meant that ``for
the first time in history, we will have in the executive office a
working mother making decisions for the families of
Massachusetts''? (They liked her a lot, judging by the cheers.)
</P>
<P>
   So it went on this penultimate campaign day on the Republican
side of the gubernatorial race _ a mix of energizing the ground
troops who must get out the vote on Tuesday and repeating familiar
themes, with a particular emphasis on pocketbook talk.
</P>
<P>
   Things were little different on the Democratic side. Scott
Harshbarger, the state attorney general and Cellucci's Democratic
challenger, took his messages from Sunday morning church services
in urban Boston to rallies in the towns of New Bedford and
Barnstable, unrelenting in his travels _ and in his salvos against
Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger has emphasized financial and ethical issues in his
attacks on the acting governor, accusing him of selling out to
special interests and allowing his personal debt to get out of
hand. Harshbarger's positive arguments have centered on his plans
to foster education, health care and child care as governor. They
have been backed by help from Hillary Rodham Clinton, Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy and other Democratic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, Harshbarger took advantage of a front-page article
in The Boston Herald reporting on an Army investigation into
whether the chief of the state National Guard had illegally helped
raise funds for Cellucci's campaign. He issued a statement
declaring, ``It's time to clean house in the executive branch of
government.''
</P>
<P>
   The attacks and counterattacks have prompted local commentators
to call this the nastiest state campaign since 1990, when
Republican William Weld fought off Democrat John Silber, then the
president of Boston University.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   So aggressive was a recent debate at Boston's Faneuil Hall
Marketplace that a new phrase has entered the lexicon of
Massachusetts political history: ``The brawl at Faneuil Hall.''
Voters have been complaining that the level of discourse has sunk
beyond all bearing.
</P>
<P>
   The verbal fisticuffs could be partly the fault of political
consultants, said Michael Goldman, himself a Democratic consultant,
with some chagrin. After Harshbarger seemed too passive in his
first debate with Cellucci, Goldman said, he had been told that he
had to do a better job of fighting back and not allow himself to
get beaten up.
</P>
<P>
   So, he explained, in later debates ``the perception is it was
loud, it was noisy, it was undisciplined, but Harshbarger held his
own.''
</P>
<P>
   The toughness of the race, however, seems to stem not so much
from the arguments as from the natural advantage each candidate
has. Harshbarger is a Democrat in a state that seems almost as
Democratic as the Soviet Union was communist. But Cellucci is an
incumbent during a time of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   His final messages, Cellucci says, focus on the pocketbook. And
pocketbook issues seemed to inspire his supporters at Sunday's
rallies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cellucci's got the economy going for him,'' said Bob Ostiguy,
who maintains an ice rink in South Boston. ``There's money in the
coffers and everybody's working.''
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger, meanwhile, seemed to be focusing most on bringing
voters to the polls who would support him _ including those whose
pocketbooks have never bulged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the key for me is who votes,'' he said, emphasizing
his search for support among ``the people who've been left behind
in the best economy of our lifetime.''

GIANTS HIT NEW LOW WITH LOSS TO REDSKINS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Md.)  (mk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ When it was over, when this wayward Giants
season had sagged to a new low with the 21-14 loss to the
heretofore victoryless Washington Redskins, Giants coach Jim
Fassel's face was blank of expression.
</P>
<P>
   His Giants, long criticized for not being able to throw the
football deep, discovered Sunday that they couldn't run the
football in small increments either _ twice failing to advance the
football on pivotal, fourth-quarter, third-down plays.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' medium-sized plays were generally fruitless, too.
</P>
<P>
   The once proud Giants defense fared no better. Known for a
ferocity that forced turnovers, the Giants created no such havoc
Sunday. There were no turnovers in the game and the Redskins
battered the disjointed Giants' defense for 124 yards on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   And worst of all, the Giants and their coaches acknowledged
afterward that what the team lacked most Sunday was the desire to
win _ or in the parlance of the moment, they lacked focus. Which
moved Giants defensive tackle Keith Hamilton to say: ``We were 3-4
coming into this game. How do we lose focus at 3-4? That's hard to
believe.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a game that left Fassel, who thought his team had turned
a corner with its commanding 34-7 victory over the Arizona
Cardinals two weeks ago, at a loss for words. He found he had no
one on his team to praise beyond the punter Brad Maynard.
</P>
<P>
   And a football coach lauding the punter after a game is like a
ship captain congratulating the oceanographer who discovered the
wreck of his vessel on the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in trouble,'' Fassel said after watching his team drop
to 3-5.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Are we out of it? In terms of the division race, no.
But we're going to need some help.''
</P>
<P>
   In the stumbling, bumbling National Football Conference East,
the Giants remain one and a half games behind the Dallas Cowboys,
who play the Philadelphia Eagles on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   But considering the strength of the remainder of the Giants'
schedule, the Giants are one division loss from losing nearly all
hope. And next week's game is at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Giants' locker room Sunday, the sentiment was
expressed that a Giants rebound may be in order since this team
plays best when facing adversity. But it sounded empty, and it
could not erase the comments of last week, when players and coaches
conceded that there was a huge difference between a 4-4 record and
a 3-5 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep making it harder,'' safety Percy Ellsworth said. ``We
were on the bottom and climbed up last year. I guess we're back
down on the bottom now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants lost Sunday to a team that not only entered the game
0-7, but was also without two key players _ defensive tackle Dana
Stubblefield, who has a knee injury, and wide receiver Michael
Westbrook, who was benched because he missed a team workout and
meeting on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel said he noticed early in the game that the Redskins were
playing with more fire than his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see we were getting off on the wrong foot,'' he
said. ``They were getting off the ball quicker. And that was very
disappointing. We didn't have that sense of urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as the Giants' more dramatic lapses came late in the
game when they were trying to rally, they lost the game in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the first half that Washington quarterback Trent Green
repeatedly found his tight end Jamie Asher, who riddled a sloppy
Giants secondary. Asher had four of his five catches in the first
half, setting up two Redskins touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Also, when the Giants' Pro Bowl defensive end Michael Strahan
left the game after the first series because of back spasms, the
Redskins ran often at his replacement, Cedric Jones. Washington
also seemed eager, as other teams have, to push its running game in
the direction of the Giants' strongside linebacker Marcus Buckley,
who has replaced the injured Corey Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Washington scored its first touchdown on a 1-yard bootleg by
Green _ Green slipping past Ellsworth, who appeared to overpursue
the play. Green later connected with running back Stephen Davis for
a 12-yard touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   In between, David Patten momentarily rescued the Giants' offense
with a 90-yard kickoff return, the Giants' first kickoff return for
a touchdown in nearly three years.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by 14-7 at intermission, the Giants were not far off
the course of a normal game for them. But when the Redskins scored
on their first possession of the second half _ a 10-play, 79-yard
touchdown drive that took nearly five minutes _ the Giants' offense
knew that the defense wasn't going to win the game for it as the
defense has so often in the past.
</P>
<P>
   This realization almost seemed to benefit the Giants. Down by
two touchdowns, the Giants started throwing the football deep late
in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Danny Kanell, who again had an uneven game with
several poor throws at important junctures, had not looked decisive
up to that point. But in one series, Kanell completed three passes
in quick succession _ one for 46 yards to Ike Hilliard.
</P>
<P>
   In 1 minute 48 seconds, the Giants moved 70 yards, scoring on an
11-yard touchdown pass from Kanell to Hilliard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows what we can do,'' said Kanell, who completed 17 of 32
passes for 151 yards and no interceptions. ``I wish I could say why
we can't do that more often.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanell said he was not hampered by the stomach flu he had last
week, nor hindered by the chest surgery he had to remove a benign
growth nearly two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants did get the football four more times in the game, but
never made it into Redskins territory in the fourth quarter, in
part because of the spectacular punting of Washington's Pro Bowler
Matt Turk.
</P>
<P>
   It was also because the Giants' play calling seemed to lack the
abandon evident when the Washington lead was 14 points and the
Giants appeared more desperate. Trying to tie the score, Kanell's
passing options once again tended toward the short pass. And hence,
the short gain.
</P>
<P>
   With a little more than six minutes to play, Giants running back
Gary Brown, who had just 43 yards on 12 carries, was stopped on a
third-and-inches, forcing the Giants to give up the football at
their own 16-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Almost three minutes later, the Giants again faced a
third-and-short. Fassel called a fullback sneak to Charles Way, but
Kanell and Way fumbled the exchange. Again, no gain.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel elected to give up the football again, forgoing the
fourth down attempt at his own 10-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants got the football back with 1:52 to play, but never
advanced past their own 44-yard line as Kanell continued to throw
erratically.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Fassel uncharacteristically refused to praise
Kanell, who threw a number of passes behind his receivers.
</P>
<P>
   The coach, in fact, didn't seem to know what to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a trap game,'' he said. ``They hadn't won, they had
guys out, and they were the better team today, no doubt.''

SCHUMER AND D'AMATO MAKE A FINAL, OLD-FASHIONED CAMPAIGN PUSH  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JAMES DAO and ADAM NAGOURNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a day of old-style politicking, Rep. Charles
Schumer campaigned in black, Jewish and Hispanic neighborhoods
across New York City on Sunday, bringing in Vice President Al Gore
in an attempt to rally support for Tuesday's election. Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato went to Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn, portraying
himself as an underdog in the final weekend of the bruising race.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato gave brief speeches Sunday at two rallies in Brooklyn
before groups of voters _ conservative Jews in Borough Park and
Williamsburg _ who have been a reliable and enthusiastic part of
his political base. Both rallies drew fairly large crowds, but both
were notable for their lack of obvious enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, D'Amato, a Republican running for a fourth
term, suggested that he was running behind Schumer, telling his
supporters not to be discouraged by polls or pundits saying his
campaign was in trouble. In truth, all public polls are showing
that the race is effectively a tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what you can say about those polls?,'' D'Amato said
in Borough Park. ``We're going to win in spite of all the
predictions. And we're going to win this. And I'll tell you this:
I'm going to fight harder, the people have a right to know that
when they send someone to the United States Senate or the Congress,
they're going to be there fighting for them every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, looking confident and bit ajitter with nervous energy,
gave speeches at two black churches in Brooklyn that brought
parishioners to their feet, held a news conference with prominent
Jewish politicians outside a Manhattan delicatessen _ Ratner's _
that is a standard campaign stop for politicians, and addressed
more 1,000 mostly Hispanic residents of the Bronx in events
intended to energize the Democrats' most loyal constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   At each of his events, Schumer, a nine-term Democrat from
Brooklyn, steered away from the attacks on D'Amato's integrity that
have been at the heart of his campaign. Instead, he sought to
deliver his most upbeat message in weeks, pledging to unify the
state's diverse regions and communities and focusing on core
Democratic themes: rebuilding schools, improving health insurance
and protecting Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that education is the key to the future and that is
the same in Buffalo and in Brownsville, that is the same from one
end of the state to the other,'' Schumer said in a raspy but
forceful voice before 600 congregants during a rollicking early
morning service at the St. Paul Community Baptist Church in
Brooklyn. ``We are one state. We share the same concerns. We have
the same hopes.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as his final Sunday of campaigning was largely
positive, Schumer continued to broadcast sharply negative
commercials across the state that attack D'Amato's trustworthiness
and ethics. Schumer's advisers said they are also running more
positive spots recounting the congressman's record on cable
stations around the state.
</P>
<P>
   With the race too close to call, both sides are deeply concerned
about turning out their supporters on Election Day, and Sunday's
events were intended to ignite some enthusiasm among their most
loyal supporters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, exit polls showed that 86 percent of black voters, 70
percent of Hispanic voters and 59 percent of Jewish voters
supported the Democratic candidate, Robert Abrams. Those groups
represented between a quarter and a third of the entire electorate
that year.
</P>
<P>
   But a key to D'Amato's ability to defeat Democratic candidates
in a state where Democrats hold a 3 to 2 edge over Republicans has
been his ability to win consistently a large chunk of the Jewish
vote _ particularly in Orthodox communities.
</P>
<P>
   As he has done on many Sundays this year, Schumer spent Sunday
visiting two of Brooklyn's largest and best-known black churches,
where he sounded a theme Democrats have used across the country:
that Democrats try to unify the nation's diverse communities, while
Republicans thrive on dividing them.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before nearly 1,000 people at the New York Christian
Life Center in Brownsville, Schumer accused D'Amato, though not by
name, of pitting different communities against each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some candidates, I won't mention any names, try to get ahead
by dividing people,'' Schumer said, evoking laughter from the
congregation. ``It's them-us, them-us, them-us. I have always tried
to unify people.''
</P>
<P>
   From Brooklyn, Schumer crossed the Williamsburg Bridge to lower
Manhattan, where he shared blintzes and a microphone at Ratner's
Delicatessen with prominent Jewish politicians and described
himself as a ``strong fighter'' for Jewish issues.
</P>
<P>
   At the event, Sen.Joseph Lieberman, a Democrat from Connecticut,
described Schumer as a ``moderate Democrat'' who is pro-business
and anti-crime. ``He is a Democrat who is in touch with, believes
and expresses through his work mainstream American values,''
Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, Schumer addressed more than 1,000
placard-waving residents, most of them Hispanics, at a Democratic
rally at the Edger Allen Poe Park in the Bronx. The event was
headlined by the vice president, who, in throaty, preacher-like
cadences sprinkled with Spanish phrases, accused D'Amato of
``walking with'' Republican conservatives like House Speaker Newt
Gingrich in trying to decimate programs important to New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Though Schumer's advisers contend that most New Yorkers are
angry with congressional Republican leaders for bringing
impeachment proceedings against President Clinton, they have
stopped short of raising the issue in the campaign out of fears
that it would energize D'Amato's core Republican supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, Gore raised the issue in a chant he has used
before when stumping for Democratic candidates around the country.
``We say legislate, they say investigate,'' Gore said, causing the
audience to break into loud applause. ``We say educate, they say
interrogate.''

COMMENTARY: SALLYGATE

   (Eds: Double parentheses should be set as brackets.)

 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Of all the journalists in history, the one most
heatedly maligned by historians is James Thomson Callender.
</P>
<P>
   They excoriated him as ``a traitorous and truculent scoundrel''
and ``the most outrageous and wretched scandalmonger of a
scurrilous age.'' Dumas Malone, the Jefferson biographer, denounced
``the vengeful pen of an unscrupulous man.'' The best ever said of
Callender was that he was ``drunken, vicious and depraved, albeit
talented.''
</P>
<P>
   What did he do to provoke the wrath of historians? He broke the
story in The Richmond Recorder on Sept. 1, 1802, that the president
``has kept, as his concubine, one of his own slaves'' and that ``by
this wench Sally, our president has had several children.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, two centuries later, thanks to the same DNA testing that
forced William Jefferson Clinton to admit misleading his
compatriots about an improper liaison, we learn that a strong
likelihood exists that one of Sally Hemings' children was fathered
by our third president.
</P>
<P>
   Why was this stunning new evidence released on the weekend
before Impeachment Election Day?
</P>
<P>
   The answer comes from Joseph J. Ellis, the historian who worked
with the scientists to give the genetic story its current political
spin: ``Our heroes _ and especially presidents _ are not gods or
saints, but flesh-and-blood humans, with all of the frailties and
imperfections that this entails.''
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? That's the White House party line: Everybody did
it. If Jefferson impregnated a young slave and refused to comment
on Callender's story, what's the big deal about Clinton dallying
with young women and lying under oath about it? The historian's
spin: We are all Federalists; we are all sinners; so forget this
impeachment stuff.
</P>
<P>
   That was not all this prize-winning historian did for Clinton on
election weekend. He was one of the signers of a full-page ad by
``Historians in defense of the Constitution'' who brazenly
associated their colleges with a plea to drop impeachment
proceedings ``mangling the system'' lest it ``permanently
disfigure'' the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The activist behind Lefty Historians to Save Clinton is my
longtime pal Arthur Schlesinger Jr., a Kennedyite who loyally kept
his eyes clenched shut during a thousand days of fiddle-faddling.
He periodically gathers liberal historians for a ``survey'' to show
Franklin Roosevelt on a par with Washington and Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Give these partisans credit for throwing their mortarboards and
objectivity in the air in political support of Clinton. Their
timing was exquisite. But assuming what the gene-counters say is
true, how should this affect our judgment of Jefferson?
</P>
<P>
   Professor Annette Gordon-Reed, who did the most scholarly study
of the Jefferson-Hemings relationship (and is now helping Vernon
Jordan on his autobiography), says, ``If people had accepted
((Callender's)) story, ((Jefferson)) never would have become an
icon ... I don't think he would have been on Mount Rushmore or on
the nickel.''
</P>
<P>
   But Americans were fully aware of Callender's charges when they
re-elected Jefferson overwhelmingly in 1804. Despite the misgivings
of Washington and Madison, Jefferson introduced partisanship to the
U.S. in its formative decade. That was as historic as his
authorship of the Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Was he hypocritical to espouse the Rights of Man while embracing
slavery? Yes; others at the time were more principled. But there
was this amelioration: The young Jefferson promised his dying wife
he would not marry again. His wife's father was also the father of
the slave Sally. Thus the 38-year affair was with his wife's
half-sister, who may have shared many of her characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Was it lifelong love or heartless domination? No examination of
the Y chromosome can tell us. But many Americans can take pride in
sharing this Founder's genes as well as those of the attractive
helpmeet Callender derogated as ``this wench.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the liberal historians use their ``twistifications,'' in
Jefferson's term, to equate his silence with Clinton's sustained
undermining of the oath. Others of us prefer to focus on the
verification, after two centuries, of the reviled Callender's
exclusive story.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the new evidence suggests Callender was partly
mistaken in 1802. It was not until six years later that Jefferson
fathered one of Sally's children. Well, our scurrilous exemplar
almost had it right.

 &HT;    Vijay Singh's putter failed at the end of tourney
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On the tee box high above them, Vijay Singh swung
sweetly. His 3-iron launched the ball over the waters of East Lake
and toward the flag on the 18th hole, 232 yards off in the sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Down below, Ardena Singh sat beside the white tees with her
husband's long-time friends, Charlie and Nan Niyomkul. When the
ball bounced onto the green, Nan screamed, ``Oh yes!'' And the
three of them applauded. Surely, Singh was a two-putt away from a
one-stroke victory and $720,000. Just in case, Charlie Niyomkul
started kissing.
</P>
<P>
   With his right hand, Niyomkul clasped a tiny Buddha dangling
from his gold necklace. He pressed it to his lips and held it there
for luck while walking across the bridge toward the 18th green. The
Niyomkuls, who own an Atlanta Thai restaurant called Tamarind, are
old friends of Vijay's. They're Buddhists. Nan, too, wears a little
Buddha around her neck. It seemed their god, as well as the golf
gods, was smiling on Singh.
</P>
<P>
   But as they climbed to the green, it was evident that Buddha was
as reliable as Singh's putter Sunday. His tee shot had rolled just
off the back of the green into East Lake's lethal rough. An
impossible pitch led to a two-putt bogey and a playoff. Back on the
18th tee, Singh was undone this time by Hal Sutton's tee shot that
landed 6 feet from the pin. When Sutton made birdie, Charlie
Niyomkul, who'd been kneeling with his hands clasped in prayer,
fell face first into the Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   ``My putter really let me down today,'' said Singh, who led the
Tour Championship for three days, only to shoot 71 Sunday and lose
it all on the 72nd hole. And then the 73rd. ``I made some nice
putts, but missing two birdie chances from inside 4 feet is not
acceptable on the last day. Two three-putts as well, that's in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   For the third straight day, East Lake's front side was an
affront to Singh. On Thursday, he turned in 30 en route to a record
63. But over the last three days, Singh played the front in 5-over,
shooting 37 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first six or seven holes really got me,'' Singh said, then
laughed. ``I don't know what those holes have against me.'' He
bogeyed both par 3s on the front, Nos. 2 and 6, and also No. 7.
Singh missed 4-foot birdie chances at Nos. 4 and 12. He looked more
like Vijay Sangh, all that good work over the first 54 holes now
strictly in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that, and briefly losing the lead when Jim Furyk
eagled No. 9 and birdied 10 to go to 7-under, Singh kept himself
together. ``I played really good down the stretch from about 8
inwards,'' he said. He got up and down to save par at No. 8, up and
down for birdie at 9. After making birdie at 10, Singh regained the
lead at 13 with a 3-foot birdie. Four pars later, Singh came to 18
with a one-stroke lead over Sutton and, in the twosome ahead,
Furyk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to hit it to the middle of the green,'' said
Singh. ``I hit probably one of the best shots of the day right
there. I thought it was pretty unlucky what it did, especially as
high as I hit that 3-iron.''
</P>
<P>
   After Singh sank a 6-footer for bogey to force a playoff, he
felt confident having never lost a playoff before. ``I felt pretty
comfortable but Hal hit a hell of a shot there,'' said Singh, who
wound up 30 feet below the hole and then, after leading nearly the
entire tournament, one stroke back. ``Hal won the playoff. Making 2
in a playoff, I think he hit in there. But yeah, I'm a little
disappointed.''

 &HT;    Sutton wins in playoff after Singh bogeys 18
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was about all that could properly follow a week of
perfect weather for the Tour Championship, unanimous praise of East
Lake Golf Club by the world's best players and a return engagement
earned in two years.
</P>
<P>
   A Sutton Death playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Hal about that?
</P>
<P>
   The week started out with a PGA Tour Player of the Year to be
decided. It ended with the crowning of a Comeback Player of the
Year.
</P>
<P>
   Once embarrassed to hit balls next to his colleagues on the
practice range, 40-year-old Hal Sutton scored his most important
PGA Tour win in 15 years Sunday, defeating Vijay Singh on the first
playoff hole at East Lake Golf Club and securing a $720,000 first
prize.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton fired a glorious 4-wood shot to 6 feet from the flagstick
at the scary, 240-yard, par 3 18th, then stroked in the putt for
birdie, pumping his right fist for emphasis. A dejected Singh, who
led the tournament for 71 holes before a bogey at the 18th in
regulation, hit a 3-iron to 30 feet and two-putted for par.
</P>
<P>
   After reworking his game and his life since falling to 109th on
the money list two years ago, Sutton had not experienced such
feelings since winning the PGA Championship and Tournament Players
Championship in 1983. He has endured a career of trying to live up
to others' expectations, but spent this gorgeous Sunday totally
focused on the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``From where I'm coming from and where I'm sitting right now is
so far apart,'' Sutton said. ``I went from really feeling
embarrassed to hit balls on the range with some of the better
players in the world to sitting here right now talking about
winning this tournament. It's been a long, hard battle.''
</P>
<P>
   So was Sunday's final round. Sutton battled to get into the
playoff, parring the 18th hole in regulation after blasting from
the right bunker to 3 feet and holing the putt for par. Singh
bogeyed there after his 3-iron came in too hot, rolling through the
green to the thick rough. On his second shot, Singh popped up the
ball, rolling it down to the lower tier, 25 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough shot,'' said Singh, who earned $432,000 as
consolation. ``I mean, the ball sat down a little bit. I was
expecting it to do what it did. You had to almost miss it to get it
close to the pin from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Both players ended regulation at 6-under 274 _ precisely where
most of the top 30 players were predicting a winner days before,
despite Singh's opening 63. Jim Furyk tied for third with Sweden's
Jesper Parnevik, one shot out of the playoff, sharing $234,000.
</P>
<P>
   Furyk also bogeyed the 18th running his 5-wood shot through the
green and fluffing a pitch from the high fringe. He missed a
25-footer and a chance to join the playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely mad at myself,'' said Furyk, who ended up
bogeying all four par 3s Sunday. ``I'm just not happy with my
finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Georgia Tech player David Duval (68) tied for eighth at
even par 280, earning $120,533 and capturing both the PGA Tour
money title (a record $2,591,031) and Vardon Trophy for scoring
average. Duval overtook Tiger Woods for the scoring honors, 69.13
to 69.21. Woods shot another 69 Sunday after his horrendous start
and finished 20th, 15 shots behind Sutton and Singh.
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara, who is expected to win the PGA Tour Player of the
Year voting later this month, tied for 13th, nine shots off the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, who earlier in the week had branded East Lake as a
high-ball hitter's course and didn't like his chances, sensed new
life when he strode up the hill toward the 18th green in
regulation. Until then, he was unaware Singh's ball had rolled into
the rough. He said to his caddie, ``Vijay's over the green. We're
in the ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   Also qualifying for the President's Cup matches in Australia
next month through the victory, Sutton clearly has been reborn. The
road back started in 1995 with a win at the B.C. Open, ending a
nine-year famine. In September he won the Westin Texas Open,
securing a spot in the top 30. By late Sunday afternoon he had the
Tour Championship crystal and pushed his season total to $1,838,740
_ No. 5 on the money list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the golf course won this week,'' he said. ``I don't
know if we could have had a better setting for the Tour
Championship.''

 &HT;    Election day could be Lonestar Landslide
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving on (w) Washington and (a) General categories.)
 &HT;    By Ken Herman and Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Millions of dollars and more than a million door
knocks later, the closing days of the 1998 gubernatorial race look
a lot like the opening days.
</P>
<P>
   Late polls show what early polls showed: A win on Tuesday by
Democrat Garry Mauro would be one of the great upsets in American
political history.
</P>
<P>
   A Houston Chronicle-Dallas Morning News poll released today
shows Republican Gov. George W. Bush with an astounding 70 percent
to 23 percent lead. The poll showed much tighter races in the other
statewide contests as Texas Republicans aim for a historic sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to be on the Bush team,'' Carole Keeton Rylander,
the GOP candidate for comptroller, said in a Saturday
understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, she predicted, is headed for a ``Lone Star landslide.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mauro, whose underfunded campaign has knocked on more than a
million doors, continued to predict an upset is in the making.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing as much as I can and I think it will be enough,'' he
said Saturday in El Paso. ``I'm going to win this election Tuesday
and then you'll see I was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro said he was unfazed by the new poll showing him way
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your poll is inconsistent with my poll,'' he told a Houston
Chronicle reporter. ``It's not devastating to me because I'm going
to win the election. It's going to be the biggest upset in Texas
history.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mauro has battled against money woes and a drumbeat of
polls that said he was out of the running, Bush's biggest foe has
been complacency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's voter turnout time now,'' he said Saturday at a
Renaissance Hotel rally in Austin, urging supporters to bring
friends to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was joined at the rally by Rylander, land commissioner
candidate David Dewhurst and attorney general candidate John
Cornyn.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate down-to-the-wire finishes in Cornyn's nasty
battle with Democrat Jim Mattox, Rylander's race against Democrat
Paul Hobby and Republican Rick Perry's contest against Democrat
John Sharp for lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the statewide ballot are the races between Republican
Susan Combs and Democrat Pete Patterson for agriculture
commissioner, and Republican Tony Garza's contest with Democrat Joe
B. Henderson for a seat on the Texas Railroad Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Al Gonzales predicted Saturday that only 30
percent of the state's 11.5 million registered voters will cast
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, the statewide races haven't caught the
imagination of the voters yet,'' he said. ``We've got a lopsided
governor's race, but many of the others are hotly contested.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when Bush ousted Democrat Ann Richards, 50 percent of
the state's 8.6 million registered voters cast ballots. Gonzales is
predicting between 3.3 million and 3.6 million votes will be cast
this year. There were 4.4 million votes cast in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The closing days on the campaign trail offered a snapshot of
what campaign life has been like for Mauro and Bush. The governor,
targeting mid-sized cities in recent days, drew solid, if not
spectacular crowds. More than 700 showed up in El Paso on Thursday,
his biggest audience in the final days.
</P>
<P>
   Television viewers statewide continued to see Bush ads in heavy
rotation. Mauro's low-budget ad campaign, which began about 10 days
ago, was running in a few markets.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Mauro is working on base Democratic votes, campaigning at
black churches in Houston and at rallies in Corpus Christi and
Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has no campaign events scheduled for today. He is running
in the Race for the Cure fund-raising event in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   At a Saturday rally in El Paso, Mauro drew about 50 enthusiastic
supporters at the Tigua Indians' Speaking Rock Casino. The tribe,
pitching in $89,000, has been one of Mauro's top supporters. Bush
has said the casino's slot machines violate state gambling laws.
</P>
<P>
   An El Paso Times/KVIA-7 poll released today shows Bush supported
by 51 percent of likely voters in heavily Hispanic, traditionally
Democratic El Paso County, compared to 37 percent for Mauro.
</P>
<P>
   At a Mauro event Friday in Houston there were no signs of an
upset in the making. He campaigned for an hour at a supermarket
early-voting place. But because three van loads of senior citizens
never showed up as planned, the rally never happened and Mauro
handed fliers to surprised shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who was that?'' asked Mirabella Flores. ``He's running against
George Bush?''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro's final days on the trail were marred by scheduling
glitches and smaller-than-expected crowds.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, his plane was diverted to Shreveport, La., after a
runway problem left him unable to land in Texarkana. That cost him
a 90-minute drive, with Mauro at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   While he has criss-crossed Texas in recent days in chartered
planes, Mauro chose Saturday to fly on commercial airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saves money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the waning days, even one of Mauro's biggest supporters
didn't come through. His request to have Hillary Rodham Clinton
attend Saturday events in El Paso was turned down.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Bush campaign continued to spend money and garner
attention. At stop after stop, it was obvious that supporters and
reporters had more than the gubernatorial race in mind. Journalists
from Sweden, Spain and Norway added their names to the list of
foreign reporters suddenly interested in the Texas gubernatorial
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have heard of my mother,'' Bush joked Saturday
when asked why foreigners are so interested in him. ``They are here
to see Barbara Bush's son.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, who also campaigned in Beaumont and Corpus Christi on
Saturday, knows they are here to see a man who could be president.
If re-elected, Bush will decide early next year whether to enter
the 2000 White House race.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro said Saturday the presidential chatter has cost him money.
Bush raised over $17 million for the campaign. The challenger
struggled to top $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have done better,'' Mauro said of his fund-raising
efforts. ``But these big-money people know he may run for
president, and they don't want to give to me even if they're not
giving to him right now.''

percent of the state's 11.5 million registered voters will cast
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, the statewide races haven't caught the
imagination of the voters yet,'' he said. ``We've got a lopsided
governor's race, but many of the others are hotly contested.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when Bush ousted Democrat Ann Richards, 50 percent of
the state's 8.6 million registered voters cast ballots. Gonzales is
predicting between 3.3 million and 3.6 million votes will be cast
this year. There were 4.4 million votes cast in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The closing days on the campaign trail offered a snapshot of
what campaign life has been like for Mauro and Bush. The governor,
targeting mid-sized cities in recent days, drew solid, if not
spectacular crowds. More than 700 showed up in El Paso on Thursday,
his biggest audience in the final days.
</P>
<P>
   Television viewers statewide continued to see Bush ads in heavy
rotation. Mauro's low-budget ad campaign, which began about 10 days
ago, was running in a few markets.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Mauro is working on base Democratic votes, campaigning at
black churches in Houston and at rallies in Corpus Christi and
Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has no campaign events scheduled for today. He is running
in the Race for the Cure fund-raising event in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   At a Saturday rally in El Paso, Mauro drew about 50 enthusiastic
supporters at the Tigua Indians' Speaking Rock Casino. The tribe,
pitching in $89,000, has been one of Mauro's top supporters. Bush
has said the casino's slot machines violate state gambling laws.
</P>
<P>
   An El Paso Times/KVIA-7 poll released today shows Bush supported
by 51 percent of likely voters in heavily Hispanic, traditionally
Democratic El Paso County, compared to 37 percent for Mauro.
</P>
<P>
   At a Mauro event Friday in Houston there were no signs of an
upset in the making. He campaigned for an hour at a supermarket
early-voting place. But because three van loads of senior citizens
never showed up as planned, the rally never happened and Mauro
handed fliers to surprised shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who was that?'' asked Mirabella Flores. ``He's running against
George Bush?''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro's final days on the trail were marred by scheduling
glitches and smaller-than-expected crowds.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, his plane was diverted to Shreveport, La., after a
runway problem left him unable to land in Texarkana. That cost him
a 90-minute drive, with Mauro at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   While he has criss-crossed Texas in recent days in chartered
planes, Mauro chose Saturday to fly on commercial airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saves money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the waning days, even one of Mauro's biggest supporters
didn't come through. His request to have Hillary Rodham Clinton
attend Saturday events in El Paso was turned down.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Bush campaign continued to spend money and garner
attention. At stop after stop, it was obvious that supporters and
reporters had more than the gubernatorial race in mind. Journalists
from Sweden, Spain and Norway added their names to the list of
foreign reporters suddenly interested in the Texas gubernatorial
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have heard of my mother,'' Bush joked Saturday
when asked why foreigners are so interested in him. ``They are here
to see Barbara Bush's son.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, who also campaigned in Beaumont and Corpus Christi on
Saturday, knows they are here to see a man who could be president.
If re-elected, Bush will decide early next year whether to enter
the 2000 White House race.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro said Saturday the presidential chatter has cost him money.
Bush raised over $17 million for the campaign. The challenger
struggled to top $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have done better,'' Mauro said of his fund-raising
efforts. ``But these big-money people know he may run for
president, and they don't want to give to me even if they're not
giving to him right now.''

SPACE MAKES HIS FAITH STRONGER, GLENN SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Sen. John Glenn said Sunday that his return to space
has strengthened his religious faith and illustrated the benefits
of cooperating with other nations in space instead of competing
with them, as was the case in his first flight.
</P>
<P>
   In his first news conference since Glenn and six crew mates went
into orbit aboard the shuttle Discovery on Thursday, the
77-year-old astronaut-politician said he was healthy, sleeping well
and keeping busy as both the subject of research and part-time
scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said he paused briefly from his work schedule Sunday to
watch as his colleagues launched the Spartan solar observatory
satellite from the shuttle, a major objective of the mission.
``It's something to see a satellite being launched from another
satellite,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the news conference, which featured only Glenn and Curt
Brown, the shuttle commander, against the backdrop of a large
American flag, the senator fielded questions from reporters here at
the Johnson Space Center for about 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said he had not experienced space sickness, which for at
least a short period of time has afflicted more than half the
astronauts who have gone into space, and was feeling fine after
getting only about 6{ hours of sleep a night. ``I haven't got a
full eight hours yet,'' he said. ``You tend to wake up several
times during the night, thinking about where you are and things.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said he expected results from research being conducted on
him to be released to the public. The research involves problems
common to aging and space flight, such as bone loss and lack of
sleep. But he also repeated his concern that not all of his medical
records be made public ``for everyone to pore over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I'm up here is not to keep anything secret,'' he
said. ``Scientific material that benefits people will be let out.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question about his religious faith and his
experiences of seeing the Earth from 340 miles up, Glenn said: ``I
pray every day and think everybody should.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To see the Earth from this vantage point only strengthens my
beliefs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn reminded listeners that in 1962 during his first flight,
when he became the first American to orbit the Earth, the United
States was in a space race with the former Soviet Union and
international cooperation was unheard of.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, the Soviets were using space as a selling
point for communism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the senator noted, the United States and Russia are
partners with 14 other nations in building the future international
space station, and his own crew includes astronauts from Japan and
Spain. Work in space should benefit the Earth, he said, ``making
life here a little more gentle.''
</P>
<P>
   As a former test pilot who still flies his own airplane, Glenn
said he couldn't resist leaving his normally assigned places in the
shuttle for some visits to the cockpit to experience the craft from
the pilot's seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I snuck up there and sat down a couple of times to see how it
feels,'' he said.

<P>
   Scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
said they were pleased with Discovery's successful deployment of
the Spartan solar satellite, which it will retrieve Tuesday,
completing an assignment botched on a flight two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartan, lifted from Discovery's cargo bay by the shuttle's
robot arm, was released into space at 1:59 p.m. EST, while the
shuttle was 341 miles above the coast of Baja California, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The 3,000-pound satellite floated from the shuttle and did a
programmed maneuver that indicated it was working properly and
ready for two days of observing the sun's hot, outer layer, the
corona.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident we have a healthy spacecraft,'' Don Carson,
Spartan project manager, told a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1987, Spartan failed on its fourth flight and
recorded no data when crew members failed to send a critical
command before releasing the satellite. A board of inquiry said the
satellite's control system did not activate without the command,
and when an astronaut tried to grab the disabled craft with the
robot arm, it accidentally struck Spartan and sent it spinning off.
Two astronauts had to make an emergency spacewalk to retrieve the
craft.

HEIR APPARENT TO TOP JOB AT CITIGROUP QUITS ABRUPTLY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Dimon, the president of Citigroup, the world's largest
financial services company, said Sunday that he would leave the
company, a surprising move that raises questions about who will
ultimately be tapped to manage the sprawling giant created by the
recent merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford Weill and John Reed, Citigroup's co-chief executives,
had been expected to groom Dimon, known as Jamie, as their
successor. But Dimon had difficulties integrating the brokerage
firm Salomon Smith Barney _ which Travelers created almost a year
ago by acquiring the investment bank Salomon Brothers and merging
it with its Smith Barney Unit _ into Travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Combining the disparate corporate businesses of Citicorp and
Travelers is an even more daunting task, and at a retreat at the
Greenbrier resort in West Virginia last weekend, employees voiced
concerns about how well that process was proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, according to a Citigroup spokesman, Weill and
Reed decided it was time to institute a clearer chain of command
for managing key businesses like investment banking and lending to
big corporations _ a new hierarchy that would have offered Dimon
less authority at Citigroup than he wanted and that ultimately led
to his departure on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that will most likely lead to layoffs, Citigroup said
it planned to combine all corporate banking activities into one
unit jointly overseen by Michael Carpenter, former chairman of
Travelers Life and Annuity, and Victor Menezes, former president of
Citicorp.
</P>
<P>
   Deryck Maughan, who once ran Salomon Brothers before Travelers
bought it, will become a vice chairman of Citigroup in a less
crucial role that the company described as devising and
implementing corporate strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This represents a very surprising move in the management of a
key component of Citigroup, because I think most people assumed
Jamie would be one of the two people running the corporate
business, if not running it alone,'' said Diane Glossman, a banking
analyst with Lehman Brothers Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the executive turmoil at Citigroup is evidence of the
hurdles that must be overcome to make big mergers work despite
abundant claims by corporations that size alone justifies these
deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along that successful mergers hinge on the
quality of the execution,'' Ms. Glossman said. ``If it were easy,
everyone would do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews on Sunday, Reed, Weill and Dimon all spoke amiably
of one another and were optimistic about the financial prospects of
a global investment banking business. Reed described Citigroup's
corporate business as ``in a class of our own,'' compared with such
robust competitors as Merrill Lynch and Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Citigroup recently posted a 65 percent drop in
third-quarter earnings, largely because of big losses incurred in
increasingly risky and volatile global financial markets. Of
course, many companies have been battered by global economic
turmoil, but such uncertainty only added to the need for Citigroup
to put its corporate businesses in order.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The departure of Dimon, 42, ends a long and financially fruitful
relationship with Weill in which the two men worked closely for
more than a decade building Travelers from the ground up.
</P>
<P>
   Each man spoke affectionately of the other on Sunday. But some
analysts and Travelers employees suspect that a certain distance
has come between the two executives ever since Weill's daughter,
Jessica Bibliowicz, left her post last year as head of the
Travelers mutual-fund business after a series of run-ins with Dimon
over the management of that business.
</P>
<P>
   Weill said Sunday that his daughter's departure was ``absolutely
not'' a factor in Dimon's resignation. ``That happened a long time
ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever discomfort existed because of that incident, neither
Weill or Dimon was prepared for some of the trouble they
encountered after Travelers bought Salomon Brothers last year.
Weill recently closed Salomon's bond-arbitrage business after the
unit incurred $15 million in trading losses.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, some analysts suggested that Dimon, widely
regarded as an extremely capable executive, might be a scapegoat
for Salomon's problems. Dimon, who lost his board seat in the
merger, offered no indication of what he planned to do next.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup did not name a new president to replace Dimon, and
Weill said there would not be a horse race between Menezes and
Carpenter to fill that position.
</P>
<P>
   Menezes is regarded by analysts as skilled in corporate politics
and a capable, though not stellar, manager. Carpenter has won
praise for his management of Travelers' life insurance and
annuities business although he also ran Kidder Peabody &AMP; Co. during
the financial scandals involving Joseph Jett, the one-time
bond-trading star.

<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ Halfway through the season with a 3-5 record,
there's no way the Giants will qualify for the Super Bowl XXXIII
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Not the way they played so impotently with their season at stake
in the fourth quarter of Sunday's embarrassing 21-14 loss to a
Redskin team that hadn't won a game. Not with their imposing
second-half schedule, starting with the Cowboys next Sunday and
including the Packers, 49ers, Broncos and Chiefs _ five likely
losses.
</P>
<P>
   Only three of their eight remaining games, the Eagles twice and
the Cardinals in Arizona, could be considered likely victories. But
with the Giants, likely victories are dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the way the Giants performed Sunday, they considered
the Redskins a likely victory even though coach Jim Fassel had
warned them not to be overconfident.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say it 100 times, pound at 'em, pound at 'em,'' Fassel
would say later, ``but we didn't play with a sense of urgency,
didn't play as if our backs were against the wall. We must've
thought the Redskins weren't going to play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, for the first time, Fassel, last season's Coach of the
Year, will be under the microscope as never before.
</P>
<P>
   When the Giants coasted to a 9-6-1 record last year, Fassel
never had a real crisis as a rookie head coach. But now he must
lift the Giants out of their lethargy. He can't afford another
sleepwalk next Sunday against the Cowboys, who would go to 5-3 with
a triumph Monday night in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in trouble, no doubt about it,'' Fassel acknowledged.
``Are we out of it? No.''
</P>
<P>
   But unless the Giants suddenly emerge as a much better team than
they've been so far, they are out of the playoffs. It's also time
to reassess last year's first-place Giants as mostly a mirage
created by a soft schedule and an Eastern Division that collapsed
around them.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants didn't lose a divisional game last year, going 7-0-1,
the tie a 7-7 overtime snooze here in their first visit to Jack
Kent Cooke Stadium. So far this season, they're 2-2, losing to the
Cowboys and now to the Redskins, who had been an 0-7 joke.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't as if the Redskins suddenly were bolstered by
returning players. If anything, they were weakened by the absence
of both defensive tackle Dana Stubblefield with a twisted knee and
wide receiver Michael Westbrook, fined and benched for having
missed Saturday's practice.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that made the Redskins even more desperate for a
victory, especially with their defensive coordinator, Mike Nolan
(the Giants' defensive coordinator under Dan Reeves for four
seasons), able to focus on stopping the Giants' already sputtering
running game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Giants don't quite present the type of problems that
Denver or San Francisco do,'' said Norv Turner, the Redskin coach,
``so you can zero in on some things. Our linebackers certainly
zeroed in on their run.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by 14-7 at halftime, the Giants had scored only on
David Patten's 90-yard kickoff return. Other than that, they had
accumulated only 92 yards of total offense, only 28 on 6-of-14
passing by quarterback Danny Kanell, who insisted that he was 100
percent healthy after a flu siege.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the game, Kanell had completed 17 of 32 for 151
yards, including an 11-yard arrow to wide receiver Ike Hilliard
that pulled the Giants to 21-14 going into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' defense, even without pass-rusher Michael Strahan
(out with spinal spasms after the game's second play), kept the
Redskins out of field-goal range, but in four possessions, Kanell
couldn't get the Giants' disorganized offense past its own 34, 16,
10 and 44-yard lines.
</P>
<P>
   On those series, Kanell completed 7 of 13 passes, but he fumbled
a botched handoff to Charles Way on a third-and-1. He misfired on a
pass to Hilliard on a third-and-10 and again on a fourth-and-3. On
a third-and-1 at their 16, Gary Brown ran for no gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about going for it there on fourth down,'' Fassel
said, ``but with the amount of timeouts we had left, I think I did
the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But as a team, the Giants couldn't and didn't do the right
thing. Had they rallied to win in the fourth quarter, they would be
going to Dallas on a high with a credible 4-4 record. Instead,
they've never been lower in Fassel's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a sense of urgency last year, we had something to
prove,'' defensive tackle Keith Hamilton said. ``Somewhere along
the way, we lost it.''
</P>
<P>
   With it the Giants have already lost their chance of making the
playoffs again. But in all the adversity sure to occur for the rest
of the season, Jim Fassel, reputedly an offensive guru, will have
his chance to prove just how good a head coach he really is.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Frederick and Tina Blanchard had driven some 250
miles from Fairfax, Va., to watch their oldest daughter, Kimberly,
run in her eighth New York City Marathon on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Blanchards had been there for Kimberly's first seven, so
they knew the drill: a quick brunch at any restaurant near Central
Park, then off to Park Drive to find Kimberly amidst the throngs of
32,000 marathoners and loft their voices high enough above the
crowd so that she might hear and recognize their cheers of
encouragement. Afterward, they would make their way to the family
reunion area _ the site designated for marathoners to meet
relatives, friends and loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, families met their runners inside the park on the
Great Lawn near the 81st Street entrance. This year, marathon
organizers designated a half-mile stretch of Central Park West,
from 73rd Street to 84th Street, as the reunion area because city
officials were worried that if there were inclement weather, that
mixed with 32,000 pair of feet could wreak havoc on the newly
sodded lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Surnames ending in A started at 84th Street; surnames ending in
Z were at 73rd Street. Although there are 26 letters in the
alphabet, 35 reunion stations had been set up to make it easier for
loved ones to be reunited, said organizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have volunteers at each station,'' said Joe Smith, a
volunteer supervisor whose normal day job is director of operations
for Basketball City at the Chelsea Piers. ``If somebody drops out,
that information is radioed to us, we record the information, then
one of our volunteer runners takes the information to the lettered
area where the family or friend is waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does the volunteer runner know who's waiting for whom?
They hold up a placard with the runner's name. If that doesn't
work, the person is paged over loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   But even the best laid plans can go astray.
</P>
<P>
   The Blanchard family can attest to that.
</P>
<P>
   They thought they could enter the park at 85th Street to catch a
glimpse of Kimberly running by, but the police had closed off the
entrance. The family tried the 81st Street traverse.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's only going to get you to Fifth Avenue and if she's as
good as you say, she'll be long gone by then,'' said a police
officer whose name tag read Vargas.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, the family headed south to the 65th Street entrance,
only to get there and find police barricades and crowds of
onlookers blocking their sight-lines. By now it was 2:30 p.m. and
Kimberly, whose personal best was just over three hours, had
probably passed the 24-mile mark, so the family decided to head
north toward 83rd Street where they stood beneath the placards
lettered: Bl-Bo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seems like we've walked half the distance of the marathon,''
said Mrs. Blanchard, who chose black suede pumps, which she swore
were better for her high arches than athletic shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Every few minutes, Fred and Tina would lean over the police
barricades and peer north, looking for a petite woman with smooth
nutmeg skin and easy smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``She started running several years ago and she got hooked,''
said Fred, who showed no outward signs of worry except to wonder
aloud whether Kimberly had brought enough clothing along.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never thinks to bring a jacket, so we brought a blanket,
just in case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away, Yolanda Boles had found her husband, John, who
had just completed his sixth city marathon for which he was
presented a congratulatory kiss and a bouquet of roses. Then, the
Boles were off for a nice quiet dinner. Diagonally across from the
Boles, Jim and Leah Boyd had found their son, Timothy, a
second-year student at Downstate Medical College, who had just
completed his first marathon in 3 hours, 51 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   His mom had but one question: ``How do you feel?''
</P>
<P>
   Assured by the future doctor that he was none the worse for the
wear, dad took a picture of mom and son, then mom took a picture of
father and son and the Boyds were gone: Timothy to his Park Slope
apartment and Mr. and Mrs. Boyd to Millwood.
</P>
<P>
   It was 3:15 p.m. and the Blanchards were still waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Tina saw her first. Draped in the silver heat-sheet with royal
blue tights and a red fleece top peeking through, their daughter
walked with a purposeful stride as though headed to her job as a
marketing director at ``In Style'' magazine.
</P>
<P>
   At the sight of her, Fred's arms flew open and Kimberly accepted
his bear-hug embrace. Tina was taking photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's my nephew?'' asked Kimberly, who had finished in 3
hours, 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you, that's the first thing she'd ask,'' said Tina.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, having completed her 26.2 miles, Kimberly was ready
to walk to her apartment on West 11th Street where neighbors and
friends toasted her feat with beer and pizza.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we take the subway,'' Mrs. Blanchard asked. She got no
argument from Kimberly. When last seen, the Blanchards were heading
south, only this time they were taking the A-Train.

 &HT;    ISLAMIC WORLD'S SEX-AND-POLITICS SCANDAL UNFOLDS IN COURT MONDAY
 &HT;    EDS: Changes time reference in lede to reflect trial has started
Monday; adds color in 5th graf.

<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ The Islamic world's biggest
sex-and-politics scandal began unfolding in the Malaysian High
Court on Monday as six prosecutors sought to convict the nation's
most charismatic politician of covering up homosexual sex acts with
former office subordinates and others.
</P>
<P>
   The jailed defendant is Anwar Ibrahim, 51, who was sacked as
deputy prime minister in September and faces up to 34 years in
prison and a public whipping if convicted. He has pleaded not
guilty to the five charges of sodomy and five charges of
``corruption'' growing out of his alleged attempts to cover up
``unnatural'' sexual conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I have to expect the best and be prepared for the
worst,'' Anwar's 45-year-old wife and most vocal defender, Wan
Azizah Wan Ismail, said in an interview on the eve of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Like Washington's Monica Lewinsky scandal, the Anwar case
promises to drag on for months, producing a stream of kinky sexual
details and politically charged innuendoes that will roil this
country well into next year. Dozens of Malaysian police, armed with
tear gas guns and riot shields, patrolled Freedom Square outside
the courthouse, under orders to prevent street demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   After an opening 12-day barrage of testimony, the trial is set
to recess in mid-November while Malaysia hosts President Clinton
and more than a dozen other foreign heads of state. They are
converging on this capital for two days of talks on the world
economic crisis at the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
summit.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony is set to resume in December and there will be further
trial sessions in February, March, April and June, according to a
trial calendar released a few days ago by Attorney General Mohtar
Abdullah. Under non-jury trial procedures growing out of Malaysia's
history as a British colony, the verdict will be rendered by a
trial judge after Anwar has had a chance to offer either statements
from the dock or submit himself to cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed Sunday inside the Anwar family's spacious house in
the Plaza Damansara neighborhood three miles west of the
courthouse, Anwar's wife said ``I find it strange'' that the court
has adopted such a protracted trial calendar. She said her husband
has lost 18 pounds since being jailed on Sept. 20 but appeared to
be ``in good spirits'' when she was allowed to see him in jail on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our justice is on trial here,'' she said. ``This is a golden
opportunity for our courts to prove that our judiciary really is
independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Homosexual sex is considered a dangerously deviant form of sin
by the 58-percent Muslim majority that controls the politics of
this relatively prosperous Asian nation. Even so, a good many of
the 22 million Malaysians are inclined to accept Anwar's
explanation that his sudden arrest in September resulted from
``fabrication and political conspiracy'' inspired by his rivals for
future national leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar is due to be tried for having consensual sex on four
instances over the past five years with four different men,
including his driver Azizan Abu Bakar, his Pakistani speechwriter
Munawar Ahmad Anees and his Indonesian adopted brother Sukma
Darmawan Sasmitaat Madja. The prosecution has also hinted that
Anwar may later be hit with new accusations under a 1973 criminal
statute barring sex with underage girls.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than open its case with sordid details of sexual
gratification, the prosecution has chosen to devote the first 12
days of testimony to Anwar's alleged attempts to salvage his career
last summer after a ``poison pen letter'' from an unknown accuser
circulated details of Anwar's alleged homosexual escapades to
members of the Malaysian dominant Muslim party UMNO.
</P>
<P>
   The ``poison pen letter'' surfaced at a time when Anwar was seen
by many in UMNO as mounting a challenge to the continued leadership
of his longtime political patron, Malaysia's iron-fisted prime
minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has ruled the country for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the ``poison pen letter,'' the 73-year-old
Mahathir turned against Anwar, who had been his official heir
apparent, and used his power as home minister to direct the police
investigation that led to Anwar's downfall.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Anwar's chief accuser is likely to be police Special
Branch chief Mohamad Said Awang, who has charged that last August,
Anwar tried to defend himself against the ``poison pen letter'' by
ordering the Special Branch to secure false statements from two
potential witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Special Branch version is that under Anwar's prodding, the
police agents obtained two false statements _ one from the driver
who was alleged to have been Anwar's former sex partner, the other
from the sister of Anwar's former confidential secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Anwar has seized the nation's attention,
stirring weekly demonstrations outside several downtown mosques by
small bands of Anwar's young banner-waving supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Mahathir has lashed out at the pro-Anwar
demonstrators, saying they are trying to drive him from power to
prevent Anwar from facing justice. ``They are hoping the government
will fall, and if the government falls, then there will be no
trial,'' Mahathir said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Interest has spread throughout Asia and beyond, fueled in part
by news clips showing rough police tactics in suppressing the
demonstrations, and by a photo of Anwar being led into his first
court appearance with a black eye allegedly inflicted by the
police.
</P>
<P>
   At least one Asian leader, Philippine president Joseph Estrada,
has vowed to call attention to the Anwar case during the
forthcoming APEC summit, saying he might try to visit his friend
Anwar in jail. Clinton has said he will not hold bilateral meetings
with Mahathir, though he brushed aside calls by several key members
of Congress to get the venue for the APEC meeting changed.
</P>
<P>
   There are now more than 30 Internet sites devoted to all sides
of the Anwar controversy. And Amnesty International has come to
Anwar's defense, describing the former minister and his alleged
sexual accomplices as ``prisoners of conscience detained for their
non-violent political activity, association and expression.''

VIEW FROM SPACE STRENGTHENS GLENN'S RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HOPES FOR
PEACE
<TEXT>
<P>

   c. 1998 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The majesty of Earth as experienced from space has
strengthened his already deep faith in God and made him wonder why
the planet's inhabitants cannot resolve their differences, John
Glenn said from the shuttle Discovery on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn,77, is in the midst of a nine-day research mission that
began Thursday. In 1962, the devout Presbyterian became the first
American to orbit the Earth as one of America's original Mercury
astronauts. Glenn left NASA for successful careers in business and
the U.S. Senate, though he never lost a yearning to fly in space
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``To look out at this kind of creation out here and not believe
in God to me is impossible,'' Glenn told reporters from throughout
the world who gathered at the Johnson Space Center to quiz him
about his second voyage. ``It just strengthens my faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The elderly astronaut has been struck each day by the view from
350 miles up, most recently by the panorama of the southeastern
United States, the sweep of the East Coast from Discovery's Cape
Canaveral, Fla., launching site to Boston and the Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see that laid out like that from this vantage point has
only strengthened my beliefs,'' said Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran legislator also displayed a hint of statesmanship as
he marveled aloud at the beauty of the Middle East from orbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a beautiful area of the world,'' said Glenn. ``You look
around and wonder why we can't solve some of the man-made problems
we have in that tortured area of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, a participant in a range of medical experiments aboard
the shuttle, told reporters he's thoroughly enjoyed his experience
and managed to avoid the first few days of nausea that bother more
than half of all astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Discovery astronauts successfully deployed a
satellite solar observatory called Spartan on Sunday, one of the
major objectives of their nine-day mission.
</P>
<P>
   Astronaut Steve Robinson accomplished the task just before 1
p.m., CST, using the shuttle's 50-foot long robot arm to pluck the
3,000 pound satellite from Discovery's cargo bay and release it
into orbit around the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a real smooth deploy. Great job,'' said Mike
Gernhardt, the shuttle crew's liaison in mission control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a beautiful sight up here,'' said shuttle astronaut
Scott Parazynski, who participated in the operation as Discovery
sailed high over California's Baja Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery commander Curt Brown then maneuvered the shuttle
toward a position about 40 miles in front of Spartan, a formation
the astronauts will maintain until they rendezvous with the
spacecraft on Tuesday afternoon for a robot arm retrieval.
</P>
<P>
   The $9-million observatory is equipped with a pair of telescopes
and recorders for a series of pre-programmed observations of the
sun's outer atmosphere and the solar wind. Signals transmitted to
the ground by Spartan after its release revealed the spacecraft was
working properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident we have a healthy spacecraft, that it is on
the way to a successful mission,'' said NASA's Don Carson, the
Spartan project manager.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's activities proceeded with none of the difficulties that
marred the same operation during a shuttle flight last November.
</P>
<P>
   On that shuttle flight, according to a NASA accident
investigation, the crew failed to properly activate the Spartan
before its release. When those astronauts attempted a fast-paced
retrieval, the robot arm struck the satellite sending it into a
slow tumble. Several days later, a pair of spacewalking astronauts
managed to hand catch the Spartan and secure it in the shuttle
payload bay so that it could be re-flown aboard Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   For the the current mission, NASA made software revisions so
that mission control as well as the shuttle crew would receive
confirmations on their computer displays that Spartan had been
properly activated before its release.
</P>
<P>
   The current mission is the fourth and final in a series of
shuttle Spartan flights dating back to 1993. Each was intended to
characterize high energy activities under way at different points
in the 11-year solar cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe changes during that cycle influence the
Earth's climate and on occasion disrupt satellite communications
and electrical power distribution networks on the ground. The most
dramatic change is in the rate of coronal mass ejections, or solar
eruptions. Among the most powerful natural disturbances in the
solar system, these eruptions emit high velocity atomic particles
called solar protons.
</P>
<P>
   These electrically charged particles would be harmful to
astronauts on interplanetary missions. The Earth's powerful
magnetic field, however, acts as a shield to protect them while in
orbit around the planet.
</P>
<P>
   The delay in Spartan's flight caused by last November's bad
deploy may have one advantage for scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The number of coronal mass ejections has increased from one
every day or two then to three to five times daily now. &QL;

   MUST NFC TV
</P>
<P>
   Our tale of two NFL cities will not be presented today in order
for us to bring you the following tale of a town and a city.
</P>
<P>
   In this corner, weighing in from the nation of Northern
Wisconsin is Green Bay, where some of the leading aesthetes
actually believe pinot noir is a kicker for the Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite side (this city has no real ``corners''),
weighing in from Northern California, the place where Tony Bennett
(and the Niners' defense) left its heart, is San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers vs. the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   Golden Gate vs. tailgate.
</P>
<P>
   Two communities boasting teams that own 25 percent of history's
Super Bowl hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Two disparate parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   In Green Bay, for example, a brat is cause for celebration. And
a bun. In San Francisco, a brat is cause for a babysitter.
</P>
<P>
   The Niners' quarterback (Steve Young) has passed the bar. The
Packers' quarterback (Brett Favre) has been known to stop.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, in an NFL game so eagerly anticipated that most of us
actually sat up on our sofas, the Packers won 36-22.
</P>
<P>
   The game in a nutshell:
</P>
<P>
   Favre connected with Antonio Freeman (pictured) for an 80-yard
touchdown on the game's first play. Niners fans turned off their
TVs and went out for coffee.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers continued to pour it on, taking a 16-0 lead. Young,
who has never played for a team that has defeated the Packers,
conducted a 49ers comeback. Along the way, he was sacked three
times by Reggie White, who rushes the passer even better than he
rushes to judgment. Young, the only lawyer attacked more than Ally
McBeal, was sacked nine times.
</P>
<P>
   The score was 22-22 in the fourth quarter when Favre hooked up
with Freeman for a 62-yard score. Freeman attempted to dunk the
football over the crossbar, but even the Lambeau Leap observes the
laws of gravity.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers added another touchdown ... just in case.
</P>
<P>
   In Green Bay, several fans prayed to a statue of Lombardi.
</P>
<P>
   In Frisco, several fans still believed Lombardi was a curvy
street. &QL; 
DOG DAY AFTERNOON
</P>
<P>
   With every dog feeling obligated to have its day, the ranking
fleabags in the NFL kennel must have circled Week 9 on their
calendars.
</P>
<P>
   It was an uprising, a distemper tantrum, a union rally for those
who wail when the fire engines roll.
</P>
<P>
   Porches were vacant. Super Bowl bandwagons were chased. Reality
was bitten.
</P>
<P>
   The 'Skins broke into the win column. An unbeaten team felt the
desperate choppers of a 6{-point home underdog. Bookies went deep
into their Maalox stock.
</P>
<P>
   But today's focus is not on point spreads, pay phones and lost
rent money. Sunday's psychological underdogs included a previously
winless team that was favored by the sharpies in Vegas, and Doug
Flutie the Peter Pan of third-and-long whose Buffalo guys were
``giving'' two points before knocking off a first-place team.
</P>
<P>
   This gridiron Iditarod almost claimed the NFL's ranking
juggernaut, the Denver Broncos, who were required to rally in order
to defeat a team of self-actualized mushers called the Cincinnati
Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   Time to call the roll:
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa Bay Buccaneers finally decided to cover ground instead
of having it cover them. They rushed for 246 yards in beating the
previously unbeaten Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Redskins, whose climb out of a winless hole was
mocked earlier last week when wealthy defensive tackle Dana
Stubblefield was injured while negotiating a staircase, whipped the
New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers won for the first time in 1998, spoiling their
former quarterback's return to Kerry-lina. Kerry Collins didn't
play but was heckled to within an inch of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Today's caveat: Don't confuse any of the above canines as
candidates for the Super Bowl. Oh, these teams are bowl-bound, but
if the lid is closed, everything should be fine.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Wall is the point in a marathon when the energy
reserves empty and the body breaks down. Sunday, in the New York
City Marathon, the Wall had some give to it.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by cool and dry conditions, runners were able to work
through their fatigue, some with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather is perfect,'' Rachel Armant of Grosse Pointe,
Mich., said as she reached the 24-mile mark.
</P>
<P>
   First-aid stations from Miles 20 to 26, where runners often hit
the Wall, reported just two competitors who dropped out. Rows of
cots were unoccupied. One station folded its tent early.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Schaffrath, a course supervisor at Fifth Avenue and 117th
Street, 23 miles into the race, said the biggest problem he had was
running out of pain-killers and liniment. Seeing the 11 unoccupied
cots and several bags of unused ice, he said, ``This is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mile 20, at the Willis Avenue Bridge leading into the Bronx, is
often the start of trouble. The steady incline of Alexander Avenue
as the runners veer left off the span reminds quadriceps and
hamstrings that they've pumped hard for 20 miles. In past years,
the first-aid station there has had the look of a M.A.S.H. unit.
Sunday it looked like a massage clinic at a fitness expo. Runners
checked in for a brief rubdown and jogged off. Some grabbed a
couple of aspirins on the run and got a dose of encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, business hasn't been too good,'' Dr. Edward
Chapnick, the physician in charge, said Sunday. ``I've been doing
this now for eight years and the number of runners coming in today
is pretty low, mostly because of the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Ryan of London, wearing a kilt and the blue face of the
Scotsman William Wallace portrayed by Mel Gibson in ``Braveheart,''
had his thigh cramps kneaded out. ``It's not really a bridge too
far,'' he said. ``It's only a 10K from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair and breezy. It was that kind of day for the rank-and-file
runners. But the Wall still obstructed goals. Armant had vowed to
run the entire 26.2 miles for the first time, but by Mile 24 on
East Drive in Central Park, she was going no faster than an
executive late for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed,'' she said. ``Maybe I hit the wall they
talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Hwee's thighs began to cramp at the Queensboro Bridge.
Lying on a cot at Mile 24, he was hoping a final massage would
carry him through. Hwee, 31, of Chinatown in Manhattan, had hoped
to better 5 hours and 22 minutes. The clock was at 5 hours and
counting. ``I don't think I'll break it,'' he said. ``After I got
the cramp I said, `Forget it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The indignation creeping into Hwee's voice was understandable.
He had just been passed by men in bulky animal costumes. ``I can't
believe a rhino beat me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even in ideal conditions, the Wall can claim serious aspirants,
too. Scott Catone was the only runner near the Willis Avenue Bridge
inside the tent, where the more severe cases are treated. Catone, a
25-year-old teacher from Staten Island with the lean build and
hollow cheeks of a devoted runner, had a difficult goal of 2:30.
``The worst I thought I would do is 2:37, which is a 6-minute
pace,'' said Catone, who had been seized by hamstring spasms upon
crossing the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Pearson and Lisa Tamburrino, physical therapy students at
Long Island University, furiously massaged Catone all over as he
shivered under foil blankets. Catone got up to shuffle in place and
said his legs were still tight. After 90 minutes, the color was
back in Catone's face, and he said he would walk the rest of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always tell my kids, because I'm a coach, you can always
find a way to finish,'' he said. ``The marathon is such a slippery
race. Your goals change as it develops.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the goal was far less ambitious than Catone expected.
``It was the Wall,'' he said, ``and then some.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   When University of Iowa grad Royce Webb and his buddies decided
they were tired of the mainstream sports journalism and wanted to
start their own on-line site called SportsJones
(http://www.sportsjones.com), they wrote and posted a mission
statement that included the following:
</P>
<P>
   ``We want you to join us as we take sports back from the
loudmouthed, cynical, corporate sports media. We're tired of
letting the media tell the same stories they've told 6,000 times
before, give meaningless stats and offer flash over substance.
We're sick of letting the media giants hound and tear down athletes
and sports in general. We deserve better.''
</P>
<P>
   So has the 33-year-old from Nashville backed it up?
</P>
<P>
   Updated several times daily since its June launch, SportsJones
has kept alive its fresh, alternative slant on sports issues
without sounding too high-falootin' to the common schlub who
probably doesn't get it anyway.

<P>
   Webb's Web labor of love isn't just an outlet to rant like some
drooling cybergeek sports fan who just needs to see his opinions in
print; it's a site with substance, with depth and, as he described
in an interview with Online Journalism Review, a leader in the
``shift toward a more sensitive, progressive, humane perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, a currently posted SportsJones ``exclusive''
detailing how Kenneth Starr's investigation of President Clinton
has spread to activities of New York Yankees coach Don ``The
Gerbil'' Zimmer and his questionable relationship with former
Yankees pitcher Kenny Rodgers is more of the kind of stuff you'd
read in the on-again, off-again Spy magazine if it were all about
sports.
</P>
<P>
   So is the weekly NFL-picks section by Diane Chambers (the
barkeep from ``Cheers,'') whose system of mascot-vs.-mascot makes
as much sense as any.
</P>
<P>
   Some readers will see through it as sharp-witted parody. Others
will simply be baffled. This isn't meant for the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the more hard-edged stuff, the commentaries on why the
Mets backed down and signed Mike Piazza. This is what newspapers
should have.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of SportsJones (for now) is it doesn't have
advertising, making it the HBO of its kind in a world of CBS, NBC,
ABC and Fox. Publications without advertising support, obviously,
rarely survive. So take SportsJones and savor it for as long as
Webb and his pals can go without eating for another week.

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ Mark O'Meara played so well this year, his peers probably
will vote him PGA Tour Player of the Year. David Duval won the
money title and the scoring title to prove himself golf's dominant
young player.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But no single golfer made up more ground on his own destiny than
Hal Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   With a dagger-like 4-wood that Sutton called the most memorable
shot of his life, he beat Vijay Singh on the first playoff hole and
won the Tour Championship on Sunday at East Lake Golf Club. It's
the last official event on the PGA Tour schedule this year, with
Sutton's victory share worth a cool $720,000.
</P>
<P>
   And so much more, really.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same Hal Sutton who established himself as a
frequent winner in the mid-1980s and would-be heir to people such
as Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson. He was Tiger Woods 15 years before
Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   And then he fell into golf's nether world. Sutton played 225 PGA
Tour events between 1987 and 1994 and won once. He was so bad, he
had a hard time believing he was collecting the winner's check
Sunday, a sign one of golf's deepest, most prolonged slumps is
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I came from and where I am now are so far apart,''
Sutton said. ``I went from really feeling embarrassed to hit balls
on the range with some of the best players in the world to sitting
here right now, talking about winning this tournament. All the
things that had to fall into place to get here it's been a long,
hard battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Not unlike the week the PGA Tour's 30 biggest winners spent at
East Lake. It was topped Sunday with a scintillating round as
Sutton, Singh, Jim Furyk and Jesper Parnevik battled for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   But it came down to No. 18. Singh bogeyed the finishing hole
when his 3-iron rolled over the back of the green and into deep
rough. His downhill chip skidded past the cup and over a ridge,
about 30 feet from the hole, and he two-putted.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, meanwhile, made a sensational sand save for his par, and
both players went back to the 18th tee after finishing 72 holes in
6-under-par 274.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Sutton didn't flinch. The same 4-wood that he knocked
into the bunker to the right of the green at the end of regulation,
he smacked to within five feet of the hole. Singh's 3-iron _ the
same club he had smoked over the green moments earlier _ landed
short and rolled back down to the bottom tier of the green, leaving
him a 30-foot putt, which he missed.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton calmly rattled his birdie for the win and put a formal
end to more than a decade of suffering with his game. He was an
emotional and physical basket case during his worst. He was having
trouble with his personal life. But not nearly as much trouble as
he was having with his golf game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of flaws in my game,'' he said. ``There
usually are when you're shooting the kind of scores I was shooting.
Certainly, I had hopes of getting back here again. But when I was
at rock bottom, it seemed like an awful long ways away.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially for a person for whom greatness had been predicted
early in his life. As a 25-year-old, he had become the PGA Tour's
golden child.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world and the media are starved for Tiger Woods,'' Sutton
said. ``I just use Tiger's name because he's in that role now.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's been guys prior to Tiger Woods in that role.
According to everybody else, we haven't lived up to their
expectations. If you get caught up reading the papers or magazines
about what you ought to be doing, it can make you make some wrong
moves.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's win and his 1998 season are in no way flukes. The
victory pushed him up to No. 5 on the final money list at more than
$1.8 million. He has two victories in the past six weeks, having
scored at the Westin Texas Open in San Antonio in September.
</P>
<P>
   It seems like a lifetime compared to the meltdown of his talents
Sutton endured during what should have been the most productive
years of his career. It was hard to believe he was the same player
during his drought as the young stud who won the PGA Championship
and the then-Tournament Players Championship in '83.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Singh didn't think he did anything particularly wrong
to lose the tournament. He shot 1-over-par 71 to Sutton's 70. Furyk
had tossed away his chance to get into the playoff when he bogeyed
No. 18, and Parnevik suffered the same fate on No. 16 as both
finished at 5-under to share third place.
</P>
<P>
   But Singh played well from the ninth hole on, scoring three
birdies in five holes, culminating with a three-foot putt on the
par-4 13th. All he had to do was make pars down the stretch, which
was no easy feat at East Lake.
</P>
<P>
   He managed to do so until No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, on the other hand, thought he had saved his round much
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one (at No. 18) might not have been the 4-wood that won
the tournament for me,'' he said. ``The 4-wood that won it might
have been the one I hit on No. 9 after I drove it in the rough and
had to chip out. I had 249 yards to the green and hit that 4-wood
into the center of the green and two-putted for par.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I made bogey there on a hole you're hoping to birdie,
things might have turned out a lot different.''
</P>
<P>
   But on this day, everything turned out great for Sutton. It was
like yesteryear all over again. &QL;

PREDICTIONS OF LOW TURNOUT UNLIKELY TO COME TRUE IN CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVID R. BAKER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Little more than a month ago, Republican Party
strategists predicted that the erupting presidential sex scandal
would so disgust or depress Democratic voters that they would stay
home in droves come Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Republican stalwarts, typically more disciplined about voting in
nonpresidential elections, would turn out en masse, handing the
party victories in state houses and congressional districts
nationwide, they said.
</P>
<P>
   No one's banking on that prediction anymore. With one day to go
before the election, even some Republicans are predicting normal or
above-average voter turnout in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been saying all along that this Republican idea that only
Republicans would turn out and the Democrats would stay home was a
pipe dream,'' said Allan Hoffenblum, a GOP consultant and publisher
of California Target Book, a bipartisan subscription service
analyzing key races.
</P>
<P>
   California Secretary of State Bill Jones last week predicted
that turnout would hit 62 percent, the highest in any California
gubernatorial race in 16 years. Although the state's GOP has its
own, lower estimate _ somewhere in the mid-50s _ Democrats are
happily siding with Jones and pointing out his historic accuracy in
forecasting turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with the Republican _ Bill Jones,'' said Democratic
spokesman Bob Mulholland.
</P>
<P>
   A lot rides on how many show up at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in eight years, California voters have an
open governor's chair to fill. A Democratic U.S. senator is locked
in a virtual dead heat with a strong Republican challenger. Ballot
propositions will help determine future utility rates, taxes on
cigarettes and how many classrooms will be built in the state.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects a huge turnout, since off-year elections
typically generate less voter interest than do presidential
contests. Since 1986, California's gubernatorial elections have
remained fairly consistent, pulling between 58 percent and 60
percent of registered voters. Factor out Jones' success in removing
duplicate names and other deadwood from the state's voter rolls
during the last year, and his prediction for Tuesday's election
would probably fall within the same range.
</P>
<P>
   But this contest was supposed to be different. From the moment
Clinton made his somber confession on Aug. 17 of an
``inappropriate'' relationship with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky, pundits began forecasting a disastrous November
election for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The release three weeks later of Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr's report on the affair, packed with almost pornographic
details, clinched the perception that the upcoming election would
become a referendum on an embattled president.
</P>
<P>
   Some still think it will be _ just not in the way predicted.
Some local Democratic campaigners argue that, in California at
least, the scandal has actually done their work for them,
energizing Democratic voters who have had enough of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time Kenneth Starr opens his mouth, it (angers)
Democrats, and it's mobilizing the party,'' said Peter Loge,
campaign manager for Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Woodland Hills, who is
locked in a heated race with Republican businessman Randy Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans argue that the scandal's negative impact on
Democratic candidates is no myth. It may already exist, they say,
sealed inside thousands of absentee ballots in GOP hands.
</P>
<P>
   The party has done so well with absentee ballots in the past
that it shipped out 2 million ballot applications for this
election, said Mike Madrid, political director for the state GOP.
Those applications landed in Republican households right as the sex
scandal burst into full flower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tens of thousands of ballots were in voters' hands at the
height of the hoopla,'' Madrid said.
</P>
<P>
   Those ballots could prove crucial. Jones predicts that absentee
ballots will account for one-fourth of all votes cast. And even
Democratic strategists concede that Republicans typically get more
of the absentee vote.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be other forces at work Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Latino participation could top 1 million voters for the first
time in a California gubernatorial election, said Antonio Gonzalez,
president of the William C. Velasquez Institute, formerly known as
the Southwest Voter Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Republican Party has been pushing to make inroads,
many Latinos remain strong supporters of the president, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, Clinton has very high approval ratings _ we're
talking 80 percent,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Some campaign consultants say the tight Senate race between
incumbent Democrat Barbara Boxer and Republican Matt Fong seems to
be generating voter interest. On the other hand, many of the ballot
propositions for which partisans have recently saturated the
airwaves lack the emotional appeal of earlier initiatives on
immigration and bilingual education, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Tally the pluses and minuses, and the election could end up with
perfectly typical turnout, said political scientist Elisabeth
Gerber at the University of California, San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   After all the predictions, Clinton's travails probably won't
matter much to California voters, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know they'd rather not think about it,'' Gerber said. ``I
don't see any reason why this would keep them at home.''

   KENOSHA, Wis. _ After spending much of the fall campaigning for
Democrats locked into close House races, Vice President Al Gore
widened his reach Sunday to help two Democrats who are fighting to
secure seats in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a crowded auto workers union hall here this
afternoon at a rally for Lydia Spottswood, a nurse and former
Kenosha City Council president who is running to fill an open House
seat, Gore urged the crowd of about 1,500 people to support Sen.
Russell Feingold, the Democratic incumbent who has fallen behind
his Republican challenger, Rep. Mark Neumann.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day at Poe Park in the Bronx, N.Y., Gore joined
Rep. Charles Schumer of Brooklyn at a rally to turn on support for
New York Democratic candidates, most of all, for Schumer himself,
who has moved into a slight lead over the three-term Republican
incumbent, Alfonse D'Amato, according to several new polls.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's efforts on behalf of Feingold and Schumer underscored the
concerns Democrats have with turnout on Tuesday and with holding
down the Republican majority in the Senate. The Republicans have 55
seats, and they are widely expected to add to their advantage by
several more seats, notwithstanding Schumer's last surge.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold, who was in Green Bay, 150 miles away from the
Spottswood event, campaigning at the football game between the
Packers and the San Francisco 49ers, holds one seat the Democrats
had not foreseen losing.
</P>
<P>
   But Feingold's decision to restrict the use of campaign
donations as a symbol of the need to overhaul campaign finance laws
has eroded his once comfortable lead of 15 to 20 points in polls,
leaving him trailing Neumann, whose seat Ms. Spottswood is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Counting on the likelihood that a strong turnout for Ms.
Spottswood would help Feingold, Gore reminded the crowd that the
senator ``is being outspent by 3-to-1 with more out-of-state
special-interest money than Wisconsin has ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a plaid shirt and Docksiders and timing his remarks for
halftime at the game, Gore asked the crowd wearing Packers' green
and yellow, ``And you know who's paying for all those false and
misleading ads? Those special interests, the big tobacco companies,
the out-of-state banks, the special out-of-state interests that
would love to take away your voice in the United States Senate.
Don't let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   At Poe Park, Gore, Schumer and several leading city and state
Democrats shared the podium for a rousing hour-long rally that drew
a diverse crowd of about 3,000 people, many of them waving Schumer
campaign signs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore delivered his standard stump speech, but tailored it to the
audience with doses of Spanish that translated to: ``Al D'Amato
walks in the past with Newt Gingrich; Chuck Schumer walks with us
toward the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also delivered one of the best versions of the rap section
of his speech, a series of changing lines to contrast Democrats and
Republicans in Washington that are intended to rhyme but do not
always:
</P>
<P>
   ``We say legislate. They say investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say educate. They say interrogate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say illuminate. They say instigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say unify. They say vilify.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make the tough decisions. They take depositions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find real solutions. They launch prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know our future's nearing. They want to hold more hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to heal our nation. They want more investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly Puff Daddy, but the people cheered loudly,
suggesting they enjoyed it anyway.

IOWA: RUNAWAY RACE TURNS INTO DEAD HEAT  
 MICHIGAN: A SUICIDE MEASURE? NOT FOR KEVORKIAN  
 GEORGIA: PUSHING THE RACE FOR CROSSOVER VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Iowa has not had a Democratic governor in 30 years. And when the
current governor, Terry Branstad, announced that he would retire
this year, and Jim Ross Lightfoot, a former Republican congressman,
said he would seek to succeed him, state Republican leaders figured
they had a strong candidate who could keep the job under the
party's control.
</P>
<P>
   Lightfoot, a conservative, won the nomination easily, while the
eventual Democratic nominee, state Sen. Tom Vilsack, a liberal, had
to struggle. From then on, polls for the fall race gave Lightfoot a
solid 20-point lead and the contest pretty well slipped off the
nation's political radar.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly it is back.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last week, polls have begun to show Vilsack closing
with a rush, and the talk now is that should his momentum continue
to build through the final hours of the race, this could be one of
the shockers of the season. A Mason-Dixon Poll released on Friday
showed that Vilsack had closed to within five points of Lightfoot
and a poll published Sunday by The Des Moines Register cut that
lead to four.
</P>
<P>
   Political pros say that in the initial stages of the race
Vilsack, running on a time-for-change platform, had a
name-recognition problem, whereas Lightfoot, promising welfare
reform and tax cuts, was well known because of a strong run he made
in the 1996 Iowa Senate race, almost knocking off the Democratic
incumbent, Sen. Tom Harkin. Vilsack also had some difficulty
raising campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   But long hours out on the campaign trail helped Vilsack overcome
the name-recognition problem, especially the hours he put in
keeping a promise to walk the main streets of 98 Iowa cities and
towns. And the money problem was overcome in part by infusions from
Harkin's political action committee, Iowa Future Fund, also known
as ``Revenge PAC'' because Harkin set it up after Lightfoot almost
turned him out of office.
</P>
<P>
   There is also another reason the Vilsack-Lightfoot race is worth
keeping an eye on. In one for the gubernatorial history books, both
candidates chose women as running mates.
</P>
<P>
   A Suicide Measure? Not for Kevorkian
</P>
<P>
   It is Dr. Jack Kevorkian's home state, but in Michigan a ballot
measure that would legalize physician-assisted suicide seems headed
for defeat on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that one of its opponents is Kevorkian, the
nation's leading advocate of assisted suicide. He says the measure
would impose too many bureaucratic strictures on doctors and
patients.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was leading in the polls. But it began to founder
after Kevorkian came out against it, as did the Michigan Republican
Party and a coalition of religious, medical and right-to-life
groups.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the opposition forces have poured $5 million _ half of
it from the Roman Catholic Church _ into a television ad campaign
that focuses mainly on the details of the measure rather than
general opposition to assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll, conducted for The Detroit Free Press, found the
measure failing 54 percent to 40 percent. ``People have begun to
buy into the campaign message that it's too complicated, too
secret,'' the poll taker, Ed Sarpolus, told the paper.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the measure would require that as a first step two
doctors would have to agree that a patient has less than six months
to live. Then a psychiatrist would have to find that the patient is
mentally sound. After that, a lethal dose of medication could be
prescribed, though it could not be taken or administered for a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the measure, who have raised $1 million to push
its passage, argue that its strictures are reasonable. They contend
that Kevorkian, who says he has taken part in more than 120
suicides in eight years, some of them resulting in his arrest, does
not practice under proper strictures.
</P>
<P>
   Kevorkian's fiery and contentious lawyer, Geoffrey Fieger, the
Democratic candidate in the governor's race in Michigan, says he
plans to vote for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican incumbent, Gov. John Engler, who leads Fieger
2-to-1 in most polls, says he will vote against the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon is the only state to authorize physician-assisted
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing the Race for Crossover Voters
</P>
<P>
   With the governor's race in Georgia too close to call, both the
Republican candidate, Guy Millner, and the Democratic candidate,
state Rep. Roy Barnes, are scouring for every possible vote,
especially crossover votes.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, Millner, the wealthy owner of a temporary-labor
company, called a news conference to announce that he was setting
up a teacher scholarship to honor the immensely popular departing
governor, Zell Miller, for all he had done for education. No matter
that Miller happens to be a Democrat who beat Millner in the 1994
governor's race, and no matter that Miller has endorsed Barnes in
the 1998 race.
</P>
<P>
   To provide a suitable backdrop and a cheering squad for the
announcement and the photo-op it would afford, campaign aides
rounded up a small crowd at the last moment, including some
$8-an-hour temporary workers the Millner campaign had hired to
canvass predominantly black, predominantly Democratic neighborhoods
for Millner votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mill-er! Mill-er!'' some began to chant.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassed campaign aides stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Mill-NER, not Mill-er,'' one shouted. ``Miller's in there
now.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mill-er? What did he think?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not sure what to think,'' Miller said later. ``It's just so
unusual to have nice things said about me in an election year.''

<P>
   SEATTLE _ With a recent poll suggesting that the battle over
whether to end most state affirmative action programs here in
Washington was tightening, forces on both sides of the issue hit
the streets on this final campaign weekend. But to a much greater
degree, it seemed, they hit the telephones.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, voters in Washington will decide the fate of
Initiative 200, a measure that would end most state-sponsored
affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   A few opponents of the initiative gathered at the edge of
downtown Seattle Sunday afternoon to hand out leaflets and hoist
signs declaring ``No! on 200.'' But most of the real action by the
group, No! 200, took place in a small office building nearby, where
dozens of volunteers worked in two-hour shifts, methodically
dialing the homes of registered voters and urging them to vote
against the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I-200 sounds good, it's very deceptive,'' many of
the volunteers said, reading from a script. The message was similar
to that of the organization's final television commercial, which
said in part: ``Sometimes people use good words to do bad things.
You will see these words and be tempted to vote yes. Don't be
fooled.''
</P>
<P>
   Across Lake Washington, at the Bellevue headquarters of
Initiative 200, the group sponsoring the measure, there was no such
buzz of activity, and the group held no public rallies this
weekend. But John Carlson, the leader, said that he had an army of
volunteers making similar get-out-the-vote calls from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference between our campaigns,'' said Carlson,
who is the host of a talk show on the Internet. ``Their campaign
has this aura of activism, but it's all emanating from one place,
Seattle. Ours is statewide.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlson provided the name of a volunteer, Coreen Serencz, a
21-year-old law student at Seattle University, who was making calls
from her home, urging likely supporters of the initiative to go to
the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically say I'm calling to remind you to vote and to go
out and end discrimination on Nov. 3,'' said Ms. Serencz. Most
people, she added, ``are just in a hurry to get off the phone and
so they say OK, and they hang up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Serencz said she was volunteering her time for the effort
because she deeply believed that ``we need to create a world in
which everyone achieves on the basis of their own personal
substance and character.''
</P>
<P>
   At the headquarters of No! 200, volunteer callers were equally
passionate in describing their opposition to the measure. ``I think
it's the most arrant piece of political trickery,'' said Janet
Hews, 69, a retired job services worker for the state. ``It will
destroy all sorts of good programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hews proudly noted that likely ``no'' voters were outrunning
``yes'' voters by 10-2 in her canvas Sunday afternoon, and then
there were the undecideds, with whom she occasionally engaged in a
spirited discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, they did it in California and it turned into a hell of a
mess, with all these lawsuits,'' she said into the telephone,
speaking to a Seattle man who told her he was still making up his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, very similar in wording to an anti-affirmative
action proposition that passed in California two years ago,
suggests that government be banned from ``discriminating or
granting preferential treatment based on race, sex, color,
ethnicity or national origin'' in public employment, education and
contracting.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll by Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research indicated
that opponents of the measure, who have raised about three times as
much money as supporters, were gaining some ground but still faced
an uphill fight. In the statewide poll, 50 percent of those
interviewed said they supported the measure, 41 percent were
against, and 9 percent were undecided. That 9-point lead is down
from a 20-point lead reported earlier in October.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lynne Madison of Portola Valley, Calif., stood past
the finish line of the 29th New York City Marathon Sunday in a
state of blissful fatigue. She'd run 3 hours, 48 minutes, close to
her best time, and had reveled in the good, clear weather while
feeding off the cheers of the spectators.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a day!'' she said. ``I could see the skyline from the
Verrazano Bridge. And all along the course, I sucked up the energy
of the crowd. I'm in heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Madison, who works at a photography agency, rolled up her
sleeve to show five words on her left arm that she'd written before
the race. They read: ``Feel, flow, float, faith, finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Marathoners often write helpful snippets on their arms, hands,
legs or race number, such as split times to keep them on pace. But
Madison was relying on a form of mental imagery to guide her
thinking, a technique used increasingly by marathoners gaining
insight into the power of the mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those words are like a mantra,'' said Madison, 46, who was
running in her eighth marathon. ``They trigger key images. I'm a
heavy-footed runner. When I see `float,' I think of being light and
quick, not pounding the pavement.''
</P>
<P>
   Research by sport psychologists has shown how effectively the
mind can be used to propel marathoners to the finish. Even elite
athletes, who log over 100 miles a week and focus on physical
issues like high-altitude training, recognize how thoughts can be
converted into energy. As the two-time New York winner German Silva
of Mexico put it, ``Sometimes I run more with my mind than with my
body.''
</P>
<P>
   Runners seem particularly adept at using their minds in New
York, where more than 95 percent of the field usually finishes the
race despite a difficult course and a large percentage of
first-time marathoners.
</P>
<P>
   Experts like William Morgan of the University of Wisconsin's
sports psychology laboratory draw a distinction between how top
contenders and middle-of-the-packers use the mind. Morgan has said
elite runners focus on their body signals while lesser competitors
benefit more by letting their minds wander and tuning in to their
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Parrado, 31, of Weehawken, N.J., fits the top-level
prototype. He completed his ninth marathon Sunday in 2:36:53, good
for 129th place, buoyed by a close monitoring of his vital running
signs.
</P>
<P>
   Parrado's mind-body checklist:
</P>
<P>
   _ Breathing? ``Nice and easy.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Form? ``Arms low, slight forward lean.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Stride length? ``No overstriding.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Face, neck, shoulders? ``If you relax the upper body, the
whole body relaxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Parrado, a chain-store executive whose best time is 2:27 on a
fast, flat course in Duluth, Minn., in 1992, added emphatically,
``I want the first half of a marathon to feel like a jog.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, said Parrado, he imagines his training runs.
``I think to myself: `If I have 10 miles to go, I know that every
morning I go out and run 10 miles. No problem. I can do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the slower participants need something more tangible to
store in their psyche for the 26.2-mile challenge. Before the start
at Fort Wadsworth, S.I., the Marathon Psyching Team, composed of
100 or so psychologists and other therapists, gives runners pieces
of tape like the one used for the finish line in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pin the tape to their uniforms,'' said Maryellen Duane, a
Manhattan psychologist who is a runner and director of the
volunteer psyching team. ``It's a kind of talisman. If you wear a
piece of the finish, you visualize yourself finishing, and that
increases the chances that you will.''
</P>
<P>
   Many entrants consider the tape and good wishes like a blessing
and find they can't run without them. ``There are people who call
me the week of the race to make sure we'll have the tape for
them,'' Duane said. ``I feel like a mother sending a child on a
journey. I tell the runners, `I'll be there at the finish to greet
you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At its most convincing, the right imagery can seem to make a
marathoner's pain disappear. In 1983, the two-time winner Nina
Kuscsik ran with a hip injury. During the marathon, she imagined
herself running on the beach on Fire Island, where she'd trained.
``During one stage of the race, I lost all imagery and felt as
though I'd actually taken a nap for a few miles,'' she said. ``It
was great. My hip felt fine and I finished.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sunday, at precisely 3:29:00 on the clock, Suzanne Leone, 29, of
Brookline, Mass., crossed the line propelled by another recipe of
mental spin doctoring. Leone, running her second marathon, played
to the crowd by writing her name (``Suz'') on her jersey. This
effort produced a chorus of ``Go, Suz,'' ``Looking great, Suz'' and
``You can do it, Suz'' for the length of the course.
</P>
<P>
   Leone, a paralegal attending law school at night, also thrived
on the mind-wandering approach by singing a show tune repeatedly
for 26 miles. ``It was from `The Sound of Music,' '' she said.
``The song about confidence. I must have sang it over a hundred
times during the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Clutching a finish rose given to her as a token of communion by
another marathoner, she offered the verse (which she admitted was a
little inexact):
</P>
<P>
   I have confidence in sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   I have confidence in rain.
</P>
<P>
   I have confidence spring will come again!
</P>
<P>
   Because I am what you can see,
</P>
<P>
   I have confidence in me.
</P>
<P>
   Leone felt so good that her run was a song. ``The 26 miles went
just like that,'' she said, snapping her fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Holliday's marathon was much more trying, and he needed an
emergency measure in the last two miles. A 47-year-old college
teacher from Lake Bluff, Ill., outside Chicago, Holliday was
overcome with fatigue in the last few miles and did not know if he
could finish. He then thought about a friend who had died recently,
knowing that the image would embolden him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pulled out the heavy artillery,'' said Holliday, ``I didn't
want to think about anything serious unless I really had to.'' He
finished in 3:11:20.
</P>
<P>
   As Lynne Madison neared the climax of her run, she used the
lighter images suggested by the inscriptions on her arm. She was
asked which one of her mantra's five signals worked best.
</P>
<P>
   Madison took a deep breath and sighed. ``Finish,'' she said.  &QL;

EFFORTS TO GET VOTERS TO POLLS ARE FEVERISH ON BOTH SIDES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By Sunday night, Michael Leone, a bank loan
coordinator who is working on the side as a Democratic Party
organizer, had sent a battalion of more than 500 volunteers
marching across Rochester and its suburbs to pass out 70,000 fliers
urging voters to go to the polls and vote for Rep. Charles Schumer
and other Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, it was ``Saturation Day'' in Nassau County,
where the Republican Party sent out nearly 2,100 volunteers to
distribute sample ballots with the names of Republican candidates,
including Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, to many of the county's 1.3 million
residents.
</P>
<P>
   And along with the customary mailings, fliers and telephone
banks, both parties are using a new technique: calls to potential
voters that feature recorded messages from the candidates and
political celebrities, like the president's voice plugging for
Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   In a Senate race where victory could well be determined by a few
percentage points at most, D'Amato and Schumer and their parties
are working _ and spending _ feverishly to get their voters out.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, the Democratic Party conducted a telephone
conference call in which President Clinton, who has been to New
York City twice to campaign for Schumer, spoke to party officials
in all 62 counties in the state about the need to get Democratic
voters to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   With the closeness of the Senate race, widespread predictions of
low voter turnout and uncertainty over how, or whether, Clinton's
troubles in the Lewinsky matter will affect voters, the effort has
taken on greater significance than usual. Democratic and Republican
officials say they are working with unprecedented zeal and devoting
more resources than ever on turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to get out across the length and breadth of
this county and place these sample ballots in every home,'' said
Joseph Mondello, the Nassau County Republican chairman. ``We have a
lot at stake this year and we are pulling out all the stops.''
</P>
<P>
   While both parties maintain that their goal is to support their
respective slates of candidates for local offices and the statewide
races for governor, attorney general and comptroller, much of the
effort, officials concede, is aimed at shaping the outcome of the
Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Senate race as tight as it is, both sides realize
that the election will be decided by Election Day operations,''
said Judith Hope, the state's Democratic Party chairwoman. ``The
question for each side is whether we can get our people inside the
voting booths. We are putting everything we've got into that
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic officials said that the party would have more
than 2,300 people working on Tuesday throughout the state and that
they intended to contact nearly 2 million Democratic voters by
telephone in the last few days of the campaign to remind them to
vote. And the party's efforts will be complemented by several of
the state's large labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are planning a similarly intense effort. ``We are
doing everything we can to reach out to the voters who we think
will vote Republican,'' said Terry O'Brien, a spokesman for the
state Republican Party. ``We have spent the last few months
identifying our voters, essentially by telemarketing and mailings,
and we're reaching out to them to make sure they will vote.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said he did not know the specific amount the Republican
Party had spent, but said one recent mailing alone, to remind
voters to go to the polls, had cost about $1 million. In addition,
O'Brien pointed out that the Civil Service Employees Association,
which has a membership of about 200,000 state employees, was
working on behalf of Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   While the most noticeable aspect of the campaigns in the last
month has been television and radio advertisements, the parties
have been engaged for months in the more behind-the-scenes effort
of developing strategies to get their voters to the polls. And
while the methods have largely been traditional, party officials
say their efforts this year have been far more intense.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>
   For the Democrats, a big target was the more than 250 black
churches throughout the state. From the Convent Avenue Baptist
Church in Harlem to the Memorial A.M.E. Zion church in Rochester,
thousands of workers greeted congregants for the third successive
week on Sunday with leaflets carrying the slogan, ``When We Vote,
We Win,'' which urged black New Yorkers to vote for the entire
Democratic slate.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic and Republican parties are not the only ones with
intensified get-out-the-vote efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The Working Families Party, founded this year by an alliance of
labor unions, politicians and the Association of Community
Organizations for Reform Now, or Acorn, has been working to secure
50,000 votes for Peter Vallone on its ballot line, which would earn
it an automatic spot on the ballot in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have about 1,500 people on Election Day helping and
urging people to vote,'' said Adam Glickman, a spokesman for the
party.
</P>
<P>
   The party, which is seeking votes from traditionally liberal
voters, held a rally Sunday night at the Evangelical Crusade
Christian Church, a largely Haitian congregation in Flatbush,
Brooklyn, where Vallone and former New York City Mayor David
Dinkins addressed a crowd of 750 people.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Raymond Harding, the Liberal Party's chairman, said
900,000 pieces of mail had been sent to voters considered likely to
vote on the party's line. The Liberal Party, too, needs 50,000
votes for its gubernatorial candidate, Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey
Ross, to retain its ballot line _ and political influence.
</P>
<P>
   With Ms. McCaughey Ross far behind in most polls and the Working
Families Party's challenge, it is unclear whether the Liberals can
reach the threshold. But Harding said, ``I'm confident that we will
get the votes that we need.''

   My friend Julie Morganstern gave me a 6-inch-high chubby ceramic
Chinese ``lucky cat'' for my birthday. It came with printed
instructions to put the cat in my shop window or at the entrance to
my house. Since I work out of my 30th-floor apartment, I decided to
glue the cat outside my door.
</P>
<P>
   It has since been a conversation starter, eliciting such
questions as ``Why do you have a cat outside your entry instead of
a mezuza?'' My answer: ``Because I'm not Jewish.'' (Of course, I'm
not Chinese either, but never mind.)
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I opened the door to get the Sunday paper and found a
2-inch-high miniature clone of my lucky cat sitting alongside the
original. I laughed out loud for at least five minutes. The next
Sunday, another clone appeared. I've asked several people if they
are responsible for my cat having kittens, and none of them seem to
know anything about it. To date, I've received four little kittens
that have added a tremendous amount of delight and charm to my
life.
</P>
<P>
   Looks like my lucky cat really does bring good fortune. I wonder
what will be outside my door today.

   Four-year-old Rebecca was told by her mother, Sharon Edelstein,
that she would get hurt if she continued bouncing on her bed. ``I
won't get hurt,'' Rebecca said, and continued bouncing. Her mother
repeated the warning and added that she might also break the bed.
``No, I won't,'' Rebecca insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother gave up. ``Fine,'' she said. ``Do it. You'll have to
live with the consequences.'' Rebecca immediately stopped bouncing.
``I don't want to go and live with them, Mommy,'' she said. ``I

   After a year or so, beaming with pride, she presented the list
to her parents. She couldn't understand why they looked at each

   I went to the bank last week to deposit a check into my savings
account and noticed that the bank was having a promotion. If you
opened a savings account with $500 or more, the bank would give you
a limited-edition Yankee baseball. My husband and brother are
die-hard fans, so I thought this would be a great gift for one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   I told the teller I did not want to open a new account, but I
would like a baseball. She sent me to customer service, where I
asked to speak to the manager. I was told I'd have to open a new
account to get a baseball.
</P>
<P>
   I was then sent to another customer representative who went into
the office of a vice president to consult. He obviously told her
the same thing the manager told me.
</P>
<P>
   I said, fine, close the account I have now (which I've had for
more than 20 years) and open a new one. I also told her that there
were three customers waiting to open new accounts, and that I could
not believe that she was going to waste 20 or 30 minutes on
paperwork and get no new money. She had to do it that way, she
said. The vice president had instructed her, and that was that.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty minutes later I walked out of the bank with my new
account and Yankee baseball. Maybe next week I'll go back for the
Yankee cap promotion.

HURRICANE DEATH TOLL: 1,000 AND RISING IN CENTRAL AMERICA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla.)  (Eds: SUBS lead, overline to UPDATE death total to more than
1,000)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The intense and widespread flooding that has followed in
the wake of Hurricane Mitch pushed the death toll in Central
America to more than 1,000 Sunday, and relief officials say that
more than a thousand people are still missing, their villages
buried under huge mud slides.
</P>
<P>
   In northwestern Nicaragua, more than 330 bodies entombed
overnight by one such avalanche were recovered during the day from
settlements at the foot of the Casita Volcano, near Posoltega,
about 45 miles northwest of Nicaragua, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing rainfall and extensive damage to roads and bridges
hampered relief efforts all over Nicaragua and Honduras, the
countries most severely affected by the powerful late-season storm.
Some residents were evacuated from the area around Posoltega when
rivers began rising late last week, but officials said they
expected the death toll in the area to rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some communities were completely destroyed,'' said Leonora
Rivera, a spokeswoman for the Nicaraguan Red Cross. ``The number of
dead will increase considerably once it stops raining and we can
get into isolated areas,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, areas east of Managua have been inundated by
rampaging flood waters, driving thousands from their homes. Lake
Managua and Lake Nicaragua, normally separated by a narrow strip of
land, have risen so much and so rapidly that they have merged,
leaving the town of Tipitapa and sections of the Pan-American
Highway under several feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not just this country, but all of Central America is cut
off,'' President Arnoldo Aleman of Nicaragua said in a televised
address in which he urged vulnerable people to seek shelter on high
ground. His Honduran counterpart, Carlos Flores, found himself
trapped in San Pedro Sula, an industrial city of 500,000 people,
cut off from the capital by flooding.
</P>
<P>
   With sustained winds of up to 180 mph at its peak, Mitch was by
far the strongest storm of the 1998 hurricane season, which
officially ended Sunday. But the bulk of the damage has occurred as
it diminished in recent days from a rare Category 5 storm, the most
severe on the Saffir-Simpson scale, to a tropical depression
stalled over the Gulf of Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   For several days, a strong front over the Gulf of Mexico
prevented the storm from pushing northward, thereby sparing Cancun
and the Yucatan Peninsula, which had been directly in the storm's
original path. As a result, heavy rains have fallen ceaselessly for
nearly a week not just in Honduras and Nicaragua, but throughout
Guatemala and El Salvador, both of which have also declared states
of national emergency, and in Belize.
</P>
<P>
   In some parts of Central America, rainfall exceeding two feet
was recorded in a single 24-hour period. With rivers already
overflowing in several nations, the National Hurricane Center here
on Sunday was predicting up to 10 more inches of rain for the
northern half of Central America, which was sure to make the
flooding and mud slides even worse.
</P>
<P>
   In Tegucigalpa, capital of Honduras and home to nearly a million
people, the raging waters of the Choluteca River swept away entire
neighborhoods over the weekend, as well as cars, trucks, trees,
power lines and livestock. More than 130 people were reported to
have drowned, and as residents fled or sought safety on roofs,
police reported that looters were raiding stores and homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The capital has been leveled,'' Mayor Cesar Castellanos said.
``Blocks and blocks of middle-class and poor neighborhoods, shops _
they have all been completely demolished.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The lightly populated Bay Islands, a favorite haunt of divers
about 30 miles off the northern coast of Honduras, appear to have
been especially hard hit. Over the weekend, a television crew flew
over the islands of Guanuja and Roatan, isolated from the mainland
for nearly a week, and filmed scenes of devastation: houses, hotels
and palm trees flattened and boats strewn about like toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forces of nature are hammering us in every inch of
national territory,'' said Gen. Mario Hung Pacheco, Honduran Armed
Forces commander.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Rodolfo Pacheco, chief of the Honduran Air Force, said:
``This is a catastrophe beyond measure. It's incredible. The entire
nation is in danger.''

ABSENT PATAKI FORCES VALLONE TO DEBATE AN EMPTY CHAIR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Vallone, the Democratic candidate for governor, debated
what he called ``an empty chair'' Sunday, participating in a
televised forum without his Republican opponent, Gov. George
Pataki, who skipped the event and stumped upstate.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, who spoke to reporters at a Republican Party rally
in Albany, said he had bypassed Sunday's face-off on WNBC-TV with
Vallone, as well as other proposed debates, because the Democratic
candidate ``just never stopped with the personal attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Vallone has said very little during this campaign that
could be construed as personal, but he has been vigorous in
attacking Pataki's policies. The governor has simply pursued a
traditional front-runner's strategy of refusing to meet his
opponent in head-to-head debate, while insisting that he would like
to.
</P>
<P>
   And Pataki himself was under fire Sunday for a new set of attack
advertisements. The ads are aimed not at Vallone, whom polls show
to be trailing by a 2-1 margin, but at a third-party candidate _ B.
Thomas Golisano of the Independent Party _ whom polls show to be
draining votes from Pataki. The ads accuse Golisano of favoring
legalized drugs and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to negotiate a debate between the two major party
candidates in the governor's race, WNBC-TV's Gabe Pressman instead
interviewed Vallone for 30 minutes, often being as combative in his
questioning as the governor himself might have been. Vallone,
speaker of the City Council, used much of the time to lash out at
Pataki for not appearing, repeatedly gesturing to the unoccupied
seat next to him and asking, ``What is he afraid of?''
</P>
<P>
   The speaker accused the governor of ignoring the issue of
campaign finance reform, cutting funds for education and child
care, vetoing a bill that would have given preferences to New York
state firms competing for state business, and raising tuition at
the State University of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the fact that Pataki has said that he speaks for
honorariums partly because the cost of college for his children
will be so prohibitive, Vallone said, ``If George Pataki can't
afford tuition and he makes $130,000 and has free room and board
and a free mansion to live in, what's happening to the rest of the
middle class? Why did he raise tuition by 30 percent?''
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized the governor for trying to divide the state,
a reference to Pataki's remark on Saturday about the Democratic
statewide ticket that ``They're all from New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican governor, as has been his strategy throughout
this most low-key of campaigns, ignored the opposition and skirted
the media, for the most part, as he spoke at campaign rallies in
Rochester, Elmira and Albany.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally in a cavernous hangar at the Albany International
Airport, 300 cheering, stomping supporters _ a good number of them
political appointees to state jobs, and their families _ gave
Pataki a rock star's welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is New York state not a better place than it was four years
ago?'' he asked, to a thunderous response.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give us the opportunity to lead this state into the 21st
century, and in 1999 and 2000 and 2001 and 2002, New York will lead
the nation in cutting taxes every one of those years,'' he said at
the rally, which included Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, Attorney General
Dennis Vacco and a raft of other Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The governor took credit for the state's economic expansion, the
dropping crime rate and declining welfare rolls, as well as for his
tax cuts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As if the two men were conducting a virtual debate, Vallone
repeatedly accused the governor of taking credit for successes that
were not his. ``He is responsible for all these things that have
happened, including Mark McGwire's 70th home run, whatever has
happened, the rain comes, the sun shines, it's all because George
Pataki's in office,'' Vallone said. ``But it's all orchestrated,
folks, it's all a paid commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone seemed so consumed by his absent opponent that he
sometimes missed opportunities to define himself and his policy
positions. Asked about his Quality First Health Care plan, a
proposal which would provide health care to all New Yorkers,
Vallone began by saying, ``Wouldn't it be wonderful if Pataki were
sitting here, and I could say, governor, do you understand that
there are 3 million New Yorkers who are working right now who can't
afford health insurance?'' He barely explained how the plan would
work.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone was in a car accident on Friday in the Rockaways, and
suffered bruises on his neck and back. Sunday he wore an electrical
device, with nodes attached to his neck and back, by which he can
stimulate areas that feel pain. Pressman asked him how he was
feeling, and Vallone jested, ``Well, if the election was as far
apart as they thought, they never would have tried to kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone noted that the accident occurred when a media van,
driven by a freelance photographer, slammed into his car after it
had stopped at a red light. The Democratic candidate, whose
campaign has sometimes complained about media coverage, commented
wryly, ``You could say that maybe I've been rear-ended a little bit
too often by the media in this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Golisano, the Independence Party candidate who is running a
distant third in the polls, held a press conference in Albany,
shortly before Pataki's rally. He angrily protested the governor's
new television advertisement. The ad, Republican strategists say,
is aimed primarily at depressing the Independence Party line vote
because the party's nominee for senate is Rep. Charles Schumer, the
Democrat trying to unseat D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his four grandchildren, Golisano said: ``Tonight
they're going to be watching television and they're going to see an
ad saying their grandfather wants to legalize drugs and
prostitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Golisano, who is spending up to $20 million of his own money on
his race, has said repeatedly that he does not think the war on
drugs is working, and that he does not believe people should
routinely be jailed for low-level possession charges. ``The
punishment doesn't fit the crime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that one of the ideas he has spoken of as being
worthy of consideration is making drugs available to addicts under
a doctor's supervision. As for prostitution, he insisted that he
had never advocated legalization, but rather has said it should
somehow be more closely controlled to prevent the spread of the
AIDS virus.

<P>
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Charles
Schumer, remain virtually tied in the race for U.S. Senate,
according to the latest polls, while Gov. George Pataki maintains a
substantial lead over his Democratic challenger, Peter Vallone.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby International has been conducting a tracking poll for The
New York Post and Fox 5 News since Oct. 22. The tracking poll uses
new samples each day and reports the results based on a combination
of the two most recent days.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, the Post/Fox 5 poll has shown Schumer ahead by
as much as six points, and D'Amato has led by one point. But
neither candidate's margin has ever been statistically significant.
</P>
<P>
   The latest results, released Sunday, are based on interviews
conducted Thursday and Friday with about 700 likely voters. They
show the senator with 40 percent and Schumer with 39 percent.
Sixteen percent of the voters have not decided.
</P>
<P>
   A Daily News/New York 1 News poll was conducted in the
conventional manner _ using one sample for the length of the survey
_ over much of the same period as the Post/Fox 5 tracking poll. It
found Schumer leading by four points among likely voters, with 46
percent, to 42 percent for D'Amato, a difference that also was
within that poll's margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4
percentage points. Eleven percent remained undecided in that poll,
conducted Oct. 25-30 by Blum and Weprin Associates.
</P>
<P>
   The latest polls from other organizations also found no
statistically significant differences between D'Amato and Schumer.
They included polls by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion and
Quinnipiac College, both of which found Schumer ahead by four
points and showed 8 percent undecided. The Marist poll was
conducted Oct. 26 and 27 with 351 likely voters, and Quinnipiac
College polled 547 likely voters from Oct. 20-25.
</P>
<P>
   Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research conducted a poll Oct. 26-28
with 808 likely voters that found Schumer leading by three points.
Schumer was seven points ahead of D'Amato, also statistically
insignificant, with 11 percent undecided in the latest
Manhattanville College Poll, conducted Oct. 23-26 with 497 likely
voters.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent New York Times/CBS News Poll, conducted Oct.
21-25, Schumer and D'Amato both had 44 percent of 639 likely
voters, with 10 percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The various polls showed Pataki ahead of Vallone by 26 to 37
points. Independent Party candidate B. Thomas Golisano had 10
percent and Liberal Party nominee Betsy McCaughey Ross trailed with
less than 5 percent in most polls.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Comptroller H. Carl McCall leads Republican Bruce
Blakeman by more than 30 points, but on average, more than 20
percent are undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The race for attorney general is much closer. In the
Manhattanville College poll, Republican incumbent Dennis Vacco had
36 percent of likely voters and Democratic challenger Eliot
Spitzer, 31 percent, a difference within the poll's margin of
error. Vacco's lead was small, but statistically significant, in
the other polls.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Differences in polls can be attributed to many things, including
wording and order of the questions. The timing of the surveys can
also cause variations. The Daily News/New York 1 News poll began
interviewing on the final day of the Times/CBS News poll.
</P>
<P>
   The polls all report results among likely voters, a term that
organizations define differently.
</P>
<P>
   Sampling error could also account for differences in the margins
of some of the polls. For example, the margins of sampling error
for these polls range between plus or minus three points and six
points. The margin of sampling error for the Post/Fox 5 poll is
about four points, meaning that D'Amato's 40 percent support could
be as high as 44 percent or as low as 36 percent. Therefore, based
on that poll, D'Amato could be ahead by as much as nine points, or
behind by as much as seven points.

MAN SLAIN IN BRONX AFTER CAR IS HIT BY AN EGG 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It has become a deadly Halloween tradition:
pranksters toss eggs, their targets get mad and angry words are
followed by shootings, stabbings and, sometimes, death.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the victim was a 21-year-old computer programmer from
the Bronx who was driving his girlfriend and her son home from a
Halloween party on Saturday night when a group of young men threw
an egg at his car and then shot him to death after he confronted
them, the police said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Jackson, a computer programmer for Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, was shot in the head at 11:15 p.m. in the Crotona Park
section of the Bronx and was pronounced dead a short time later at
Jacobi Medical Center, said Detective Robert Samuel, a police
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``A young life was snuffed out over nothing,'' said the victim's
father, Karl Jackson Sr. ``But that's what Halloween has gotten
into. He never used to go out on Halloween. He always said it was
too dangerous, even as a teen-ager. But this year he wanted to take
the child out.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Jackson had taken his 29-year-old girlfriend, who
was identified only as Darlene, and her son Clyde, 9, to a
children's party near Gun Hill Road early in the evening, his
father said. They were taking Clyde home to a baby sitter so they
could go to another party when the egg hit the car, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   After a confrontation, Jackson got back into his car and drove
away. But at least one of the egg-throwers got into a car and
pursued him, the police said, catching up with him a few blocks
away and shooting him once in the temple.
</P>
<P>
   It has become an all-too-familiar scenario in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, a 10-year-old boy from Greenpoint, Brooklyn, was
hit by a stray bullet after a nearby egg fight escalated into a gun
fight. In 1995, a 21-year-old man was shot to death in the
Morrisania section of the Bronx after he confronted a group of
youths who had hit him with an egg.
</P>
<P>
   The worst year was 1994, when two people were killed in
separate, egg-related incidents in Brooklyn.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the first one, a 12-year-old boy who had been having an egg
fight with friends in Bushwick was stabbed to death by two passing
men who were struck by eggs. Later that night, a 29-year-old man
carrying a new tricycle home for his son was struck by eggs in
Bedford-Stuyvesant. He tossed a bottle at his young attackers; they
returned with a shotgun and killed him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, two teen-age boys were shot and injured after an egg
fight in the Bronx; witnesses said their trick-or-treat bags
spilled candy onto the sidewalk as they fell to the ground. There
were other egg-related killings in 1989, 1987 and in 1984, when an
18-year-old man was shot to death outside Louis D. Brandeis High
School in Manhattan in what the police called retaliation for an
egg attack.

EDITORIAL: NEW CHILL IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: CHINA-RIGHTS) 
(nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Nov. 2:
</P>
<P>
   A few months back there was reason to hope that Chinese
authorities were modestly expanding the limits of acceptable
political debate. Those expectations have been dashed by a new
burst of arrests, detentions and censorship.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, government agents closed down an independent
think tank that was testing those new limits, confiscated its
founder's passport, and halted circulation of a book of essays
proposing mild political reforms. Word also came that a Chinese
scientist who has lived in the United States since 1989 and written
about Chinese military issues was arrested and charged with
divulging state secrets when he returned home for a visit earlier
this year. The scientist, Hua Di, told friends that he had been
assured he ran no risk of arrest.
</P>
<P>
   These are indications of a disturbing slide back toward
repression. President Clinton, after speaking out repeatedly for
human rights and democracy on his visit to China last summer,
should now make plain his disappointment over the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese intellectuals and activists are not yet being hounded as
ruthlessly as they were in the years after the 1989 Tiananmen
Square democracy movement. But Jiang Zemin's approach to opening up
political debate is less than advertised and not enough to meet the
needs of China's rapidly modernizing society. Market
liberalization, the formula China's leadership has chosen to assure
robust economic growth, requires a loosening of political controls
over private life. People must have the freedom to debate and
challenge government policies and need reliable legal protections
that cannot be overturned on official whim.
</P>
<P>
   Under Deng Xiaoping, and now under Jiang, Beijing's rulers have
insisted on maintaining many of the worst attributes of a Communist
police state. Until Jiang responds more constructively to the
Chinese people's demands for greater political as well as economic
freedom, China's progress will be blighted and its relations with
the United States will be strained.

GOOD IDEA: STARTING PALMER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was difficult to tell which went smoother for
USC last week, the debut of freshman Carson Palmer at starting
quarterback, or the manner in which it was kept secret. Not even
linebacker David Gibson, who is quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst's
roommate, had any idea the Trojans would spring Palmer on
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really had no clue,'' Gibson said. ``Mike didn't talk about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did Palmer. Or Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   When Palmer received increased practice time last week, Hackett
said it was merely to make sure both quarterbacks had been given
enough chances to work on the same plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some clues,'' wide receiver Billy Miller said.
``Carson was taking a whole lot of reps. He was going with the
first team a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   It was almost amazing how Hackett low-keyed the quarterback
situation last week, considering that he lost his temper when
reporters asked him before the Oregon game whether Palmer or Van
Raaphorst would start.
</P>
<P>
   It's debatable how much the secrecy really influenced
Washington's defensive game plan, but if it makes Hackett happy, so
be it. At least it means he's not thinking about field goals and
fourth downs. All that matters is that Hackett finally made the
change that fans and players had been eagerly awaiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't relieved, I was more surprised,'' wide receiver R.
Jay Soward said of the quarterback change.
</P>
<P>
   As in, ``pleasantly surprised'' for those of you reading between
the lines.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Trojans have their first meaningful November in
three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   If they defeat Stanford, they have a realistic shot at finishing
second or third in the conference. That means a trip to the Sun
Bowl in El Paso, or if the Holiday Bowl gets daring and decides to
overlook an Arizona or Oregon, a possible trip to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   At worst, a Christmas vacation in Hawaii would be available,
with two bowls being played on the islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have the possibility of going to a pretty good bowl
game and winning our last three games,'' Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   This is all a byproduct of Palmer's insertion into the lineup.
He brings confidence and emotion to the entire team.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA and Notre Dame games don't seem nearly as hopeless
today, and it has nothing to do with Stanford's embarrassing
near-upset of the Bruins. It's Palmer, who has a way of just making
things happen. Even Hackett pointed it out, noting how tailback
Chad Morton will benefit from having a mobile quarterback in the
backfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Chad will do better because now Chad has the threat of
Carson,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to ignore, but the play of the defense is also just as
important for the Trojans. In the past two weeks, they have held
two of the Pac-10's top four offensive teams to an average of 13.5
points. The Trojans also gained a measure of revenge by defeating a
Washington team that enjoyed a 27-0 victory in last season's
encounter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, they pretty much annihilated us. We got our respect
back, hopefully, from their program,'' Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: USC's game against Stanford next week will begin at

<P>
   Working part time used to mean afternoons at home or two or
three days off a week. But as many Americans find themselves
working weeks that stretch to 60 or more hours, ``part time'' can
mean something very different: the ability to leave the office most
nights at 5 or schedule a half-day off every other week.
</P>
<P>
   A new class of part-timers, mostly women, is emerging and
working what used to be considered full-time hours _ 35 to 40 hours
a week. Lawyers, consultants, managers and other professionals,
they want to cut back their official hours so they can spend more
time with their children or deal with other responsibilities. They
want the freedom to miss a meeting occasionally to drop in on a
Tumbling Tots class or visit an ailing parent.
</P>
<P>
   When Sharon Katz Pearlman joined KPMG Peat Marwick five years
ago as a tax lawyer, for example, she wanted to avoid the typical
14-hour days put in by consultants and lawyers and leave the office
when she wished. As a mother of young children, ``it's very
important to me to make potato latkes at Hanukkah for nursery
school,'' she explained. So she accepted a lower salary in exchange
for a schedule of three and, later, four days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Between the time she spent in the office and the late-night
hours at her computer at home, she sometimes worked 40 hours a week
anyway. By becoming more efficient, skipping lunch as well as
chitchat at the office, and working at home after her four children
had gone to bed, Ms. Pearlman discovered that she could ``cram it
all in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be very productive in whatever time I have,'' she
said. Partly because of the freedom to do the work wherever and
whenever she can, she has in recent months been logging more like
60 hours a week, although she still does not feel obliged to make
an appearance at the firm every day. In July, at her supervisor's
insistence, her status was changed to full time _ and she made
partner.
</P>
<P>
   No one, including the government, which automatically classifies
anyone who works 35 or more hours as full time, knows exactly how
many full-time part-timers there are. And companies, which can
report to the minute how long hourly workers put in because they
punch clocks or fill out time sheets, tend to be reluctant to
acknowledge or measure just how much their salaried employees work.
</P>
<P>
   But one study suggests that these workers are a sizable
presence.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 National Study of the Changing Work Force _ conducted
by the Families and Work Institute, a nonprofit research group in
New York _ found that roughly a third of the salaried part-time
employees surveyed said they spent at least 35 hours on the job,
though the sample was small and statisticians say the actual number
could be anywhere from a quarter to almost a half of the millions
of part-timers.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that as the number of women who are
professionals and managers has increased and the number of
dual-career couples has grown, so has this new kind of part-timer.
``The group that needs flexibility and lower work hours is so much
larger than it was,'' said Robert Drago, who teaches economics and
studies workplace issues at the University of Wisconsin at
Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the need stems from the fact that many Americans are
working more: The average workweek for a professional or manager
has stretched in the last 20 years to almost 48 hours from 45,
according to the 1997 work force study.
</P>
<P>
   Whether employees are turning their careers into some sort of
modern religion or corporations are demanding more from them, these
long hours have changed expectations on both sides. ``The
complicated issue is: If a full week is 60 to 80 hours, what is
part time?'' said Ellen Galinsky, president of the institute.
</P>
<P>
   Part time often used to mean a casual commitment to the job on
the part of both the employer and employee. Part-timers came and
went, frequently holding positions with low visibility, and
certainly could not expect much in the way of benefits, status or
job security.
</P>
<P>
   But now, employees who want to keep their careers are
experimenting with different arrangements. Some are trying to
manage nearly the same workload as the full-timers by working more
at home and working more efficiently at the office. Others are
cutting their workloads. Though they typically collect benefits,
many take a cut in pay.
</P>
<P>
   Some employees are thrilled with these more flexible workweeks.
But many are frustrated by the perception among supervisors and
colleagues that they are somehow shirking work unless they are in
the office as long as everyone else is. And they can invite
resentment from colleagues who feel that their own workloads will
only increase to compensate for the part-timer's absence. ``This is
a culture change in process,'' said Ted Childs, vice president for
global work force diversity at IBM Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies, however, still hew to old definitions and reward
their employees based strictly on the amount of time they put in at
the office. ``It's very clear that, culturally, we still have work
organized as if it were back in 1952,'' said Paula Rayman, director
of the Radcliffe Public Policy Institute in Cambridge, Mass., which
studies work issues. Companies, she said, ``still create a sense,
the longer you work, the better, and face time counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rayman recalls talking to one chief executive who was
considering layoffs and was convinced that the least valuable
employees were those who were out the company door the first chance
they got. Though some of those people were not committed, he later
realized that others were among the company's most efficient.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues may also resent a fellow worker who has the luxury of
taking a day off or leaving early while they remain chained to
their desks. One woman who works a short week recalls a male
co-worker telling her that he could not believe that she escaped
without a pay cut. ``Men could never do that,'' he complained.
</P>
<P>
   At IBM, roughly 1,000 people are considered ``regular part
time,'' meaning they have either adjusted or reduced their hours
yet enjoy privileges of full-timers like pension contributions and
health insurance. One of Childs' challenges is to make sure the
employees who do put in traditional hours are not resentful because
they ``don't see a full glass,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But as working husbands and wives, who now make up about 44
percent of the employed population, try to juggle their duties,
they are forcing a change in thinking. They do not necessarily want
less responsibility, according to Sheila W. Wellington, president
of Catalyst, a nonprofit research group in New York that is devoted
to women's work issues. ``They just want to have control over their
schedules at the margins,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are aiming to accommodate. Some are motivated by
sympathetic managers or a desire to have a diverse work force. The
threat or reality of high attrition, which costs an employer money
by forcing it to hire and retrain workers, also pushes companies to
experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Not always with equal success. Maggie Oberst, director of
corporate communications for the Mastech Corp., a Pittsburgh
information technology company, took a 20 percent pay cut when she
decided she wanted to work four days, not five. So when she finds
herself putting in extra hours one week, she said, she pares back
her hours the following week. As a result, her experience has been
satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Melia Strittmatter, on the other hand, soon came to feel that
she had shortchanged herself by agreeing to take a pay cut for
essentially learning how to work smarter. When she decided to cut
back to part time at IBM in 1994, for example, her responsibilities
in software marketing remained virtually unchanged. By becoming
more efficient _ and skipping some late afternoon meetings _ she
was able to shrink her 60-hour workweek by a third and accomplish
about the same amount of work.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Strittmatter, who left IBM in 1997 to join her husband's
interior-room design business for even greater flexibility, said
that she came to resent the colleagues who were paid more simply
for spending more time in the office because they socialized more
or they tended to real estate businesses on the side. ``Many times,
I felt, `Why am I taking less pay for this?''' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Often shouldering more of the burden of minding the children or
caring for elderly relatives, women already make up more of the
traditional part-time work force _ 68 percent, compared with 41
percent of the full-time work force _ and may be quicker to accept
a deal that pays them less for essentially the same job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are total suckers for doing that,'' said Kelly Zuckerman,
who works for a California entertainment company. She said that she
was adamant about collecting a full salary for her four-day week
because her duties did not change.
</P>
<P>
   And much of the problem lies not with company policies but
inconsistent application of the rules by supervisors. Some
employees are able to keep their full salaries, but tailor their
hours to their needs, an arrangement typically known as flex-time.
David and Kara Plonczynski, senior credit analysts at Motorola's
two-way radio business, for instance, each get at least two days a
week to work from home. Any time they give to their two small
children, they make up by working in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   At the accounting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche, where at least 500
employees take advantage of a reduced workweek, professionals who
stop working at 40 hours take a pay cut _ but also have less work
to do. Deloitte, for example, allows Chris Foster, a senior
manager, to bill only three-quarters of what his peers bill so he
can spend more time with his two small children, especially since
his wife travels for her job, and his pay is docked
proportionately. ``I wouldn't have it any other way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But others are not so lucky. How companies treat these
part-timers ``is not equitable,'' said Carol Sladek, the head of
work-life consulting at Hewitt Associates, a human resources
consulting firm in Lincolnshire, Ill. ``It is truly manager
driven.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Merck, IBM and Ralston Purina acknowledge an
ongoing struggle to make sure managers follow through on corporate
policies aimed at encouraging flexibility. ``This is not something
that is going to change overnight,'' said Michele Peterson, senior
director of work/life flexibility at Merck, which has changed how
it compensates its managers to reflect how responsive subordinates
and peers say the managers are to different arrangements. Deloitte,
for instance, checks up quarterly on employees in their first year
of reduced workweeks to make sure the arrangement is fair all
around.
</P>
<P>
   But employees also have to take responsibility for what they
agree to do. ``We need to be honest about how much we are willing
to work,'' said Melanie Berry, who edits a newsletter for working
mothers, Executive Baby, from Mount Airy, Md.
</P>
<P>
   If someone takes a pay cut to gain some control over her hours
and then decides that she is being underpaid _ comparing her deal
with someone who gets a full salary and takes long lunches or to a
flex-timer who collects full salary _ she has little recourse.
Legal experts say the employee would be hard pressed to bring a
discrimination suit as the person who initiated the change. The
colleague whom she resents has ``in a sense negotiated a better
deal,'' said Carol Sanger, a family law professor at Columbia
University who has looked into gender issues.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the way people think about work will never be easy.
Companies may be reluctant to acknowledge that they consider a
full-time job to be 60 hours, and employees may not realize how
inefficient they are at home. ``There is no perfect solution,''
admits Ms. Strittmatter, the former IBM employee.

EDITORIAL: VOTE NO ON NEW YORK CITY'S `REFORM' 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Nov. 2:
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday's ballot in New York City, there will be only one
referendum proposal _ a hastily contrived campaign reform measure
proposed by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's Charter Revision Commission.
We strongly urge a ``no'' vote on this proposal. The City Council
has recently enacted a far better, more balanced set of reforms
that could be damaged or even ruined if the mayor's charter
proposal is approved.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign finance referendum, concocted hurriedly over the
summer as a political ploy to bounce a referendum on Yankee Stadium
off the ballot, sounds reasonable in the abbreviated form that
appears at the bottom right corner of the ballot. The proposal asks
whether voters favor prohibiting corporate contributions in city
campaigns, as well as other smaller changes to the city's Campaign
Finance Board. Although we favor barring corporate money, simply
outlawing it would not do the job, just as a federal ban on
corporate contributions for most of this century has made little
difference in the money slush in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council has already established a far more
comprehensive package. Recent improvements to this excellent
voluntary system provided lower contribution limits and rewarded
those who refuse corporate money by quadrupling their public
matching funds to $4 for every $1 received in contributions of $250
or less. Some legal experts believe the mayor's ballot proposal
would undermine or conceivably destroy this carefully crafted
Council reform.
</P>
<P>
   The good-government organizations in the city have lined up
against this referendum. Common Cause/NY, the Citizens Union, the
New York Public Interest Research Group, the League of Women Voters
of New York City and even the Association of the Bar of the City of
New York are working to defeat Proposal No. 1. They are alarmed
about what the city bar calls a ``cheapening of the charter
process'' in which the mayor brought together an unrepresentative
group of commissioners who cobbled together the ballot item in two
months. If anything is wrong, it can only be changed by another
charter revision proposal in another election. The item also
appears to give legislative duties to the finance board instead of
the City Council and mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The City Charter, like the nation's Constitution, is not
something to be tampered with by such an unnecessary and disruptive
proposal. We strongly urge a ``no'' vote.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Nov. 2:
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey residents will vote Tuesday on a proposed
constitutional amendment that would allow $1 billion in borrowing
to protect half of the state's remaining two million acres of
undeveloped land over the next 10 years. We urge them to approve
this measure, which represents Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's latest
effort to preserve the state's threatened farmlands and other open
space.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Republican legislative leaders rejected her
first idea, a slight increase in New Jersey's relatively low
gasoline tax. The new proposal requires no new taxes but, instead,
would earmark $98 million a year in existing sales tax revenues for
land preservation and for the repayment of the principal and
interest on bonds issued for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is fully consistent with New Jersey's honorable
record of preserving farmland, creating parks and otherwise
protecting open space. Its passage would mean that almost
two-fifths of the state would be protected for future generations.
The initiative has already won support from New Jersey's
legislators and now deserves approval from its voters.

   LOS ANGELES _ USC received an oral commitment Sunday from center
Luke Minor of Blue Ridge Academy in Dyke, Va.

<P>
   Minor, who is 7-foot-3, is believed to be the tallest player
ever to commit to the Trojans. Minor chose USC over Oregon and
Kansas State.

   ``I guess I would compare him to a current version of Mark

athletic. Not very quick. But he is 7-3 and has tremendous reach,
armspan and excellent hands. In a halfcourt game, he can be a
factor.''

STEP BY STEP, INCH BY INCH, JETS FINDING WAYS TO WIN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mo., N.Y., Fla., Mass., Ga.)   (jw) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Jets learned something else about Vinny
Testaverde Sunday. He can carry them even when Curtis Martin
struggles.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more significant, they found the resources to win
here, where visiting teams routinely get crushed by the noise at
Arrowhead Stadium and the mystique generated by the red and gold
Chiefs uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that was John Hall shouting to himself with two seconds
remaining and the ball about to be snapped at his feet for the
winning field-goal attempt.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped talking at the snap and kicked the ball 32 yards
through goal posts and sheets of rain to produce a 20-17 victory
for the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest game since I've been here,'' Coach Bill
Parcells told the Jets. Every day, they go into their locker room
past a sign that reads: ``Prove you can win on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   They proved it Sunday with their third straight victory as they
improved their record at the midway point of the season to 5-3.
That nudged them into a four-way tie for first in the American
Football Conference East with Buffalo, the team they play next
Sunday, the Dolphins and the Patriots. But the Jets are the only
one of the four that is unbeaten in division play, which could be
the tie breaker at season's end.
</P>
<P>
   The final drive to victory began with 1 minute 50 seconds
remaining and the Jets on the Chiefs' 43 following a
wind-interrupted punt by Kansas City's Louie Aguiar.
</P>
<P>
   To that point, Martin had produced the worst statistical game of
his career with only 32 yards rushing on 27 carries. So Testaverde,
who a few moments earlier had tossed a 20-yard touchdown to Kyle
Brady but who had also tossed his first interception after 141
straight passes, took over.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde said: ``I went into the huddle and told the guys,
`This is what great teams do. They finish off games on the road.'
''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets met Testaverde's definition Sunday, half way through a
six-game stretch that Parcells told them would be pivotal to their
success. First, they won at New England, then they beat the Falcons
at the Meadowlands and now they have added Sunday's game to their
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who had a 7-yard run on the winning drive, finished with
42 on 30 carries. It was the first time that the Testaverde-led
Jets won a game without a 100-yard rushing effort from Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde is now 5-0 as the starter. He completed 20 of 34
passes for 260 yards. And even that interception wasn't
Testaverde's fault, according to Parcells. He said Keyshawn Johnson
ran the wrong route, going behind linebacker Anthony Davis, who
picked it off and ran the ball back 27 yards to the Jets' 8 to
start the final period. Three plays later, Donnell Bennett scored
from the 1 to give the Chiefs a 17-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It took only seconds for the Jets to tie the game, though. Aaron
Glenn returned the kickoff 62 yards to the Chiefs' 28. Testaverde
took over on first down, running for 8 yards. On second down he
connected with Brady on a 20-yard play. The point-after tied the
score.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you win a game like that,'' Martin said later, ``you
realize how important it is. I believe it helped us mature as a
team. You're not going to win every game with 300 yards passing and
150 yards rushing.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The offense had major help from Dwayne Gordon, who was playing
out of position at outside linebacker but still managed to produce
the biggest play of the opening half _ an interception in the flat
that he returned 31 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   All week Gordon had fretted over defending just such a pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm usually an inside linebacker,'' he said, ``I'm not used to
playing in space.''
</P>
<P>
   But there he was, in the prairie part of the field as Chiefs
quarterback Elvis Grbac sought out the redoubtable receiver, Andre
Rison.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon had blown the play in practice, had seen it on practice
video over and over and now here it was in front of him. He had
never before intercepted a pass in his career and certainly had
never scored a defensive touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But he saw what Grbac and Rison were doing, and this time Gordon
plucked the ball out of the air and ran it all the way into the end
zone with 2:34 to go in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That lifted the Jets to a 10-7 lead that they took into
halftime. It also was one more play that frustrated Rison, the
longtime star who did not have a single reception Sunday. Grbac, in
fact, generated only 120 passing yards in completing 13 of 28
attempts with three interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde was in control most of the half, but it wasn't until
late in the second quarter that he was turned loose.
</P>
<P>
   By then, it was apparent it simply wasn't working with Martin.
His eight carries in the opening quarter resulted in a net 2-yard
loss. On one play he was stuffed by Derrick Thomas 8 yards behind
the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   All Martin could generate through the first half was a grand
total of 8 yards with 16 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde continued to display elusiveness from the pass rush
and accuracy at the same time _ he connected on 13 of 17 attempts
for 173 yards. He even ran once on third-and-1, picking up a first
down.
</P>
<P>
   Such plays have been a problem for Martin this season; he has
repeatedly failed to produce on third-and-1.
</P>
<P>
   But this was a game of severe momentum shifts, with the wind
playing a role in field position.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs had opened the scoring in the first quarter on Tony
Richardson's 2-yard run. On the drive, Derrick Alexander caught a
34-yard pass over Glenn. On another pass, Alexander picked up 22
when Jerome Henderson missed him in the open field. On the opening
drive of the second quarter, Hall booted a 20-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, however, missed a 31-yard field goal with 2:48 to go in
the second quarter, prompting Parcells to scream at him and his
holder, Brian Hansen.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets continued to struggle with what had been their
bread-and-butter Martin play _ a pitchout from Testaverde on which
Martin usually has the room to slither to where he finds a crease.
But he wasn't getting any time Sunday to change his mind. The
Chiefs were on him as soon as he cradled the pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there was the fourth-quarter pass to Brady, and then
the winning field-goal drive that led an exhausted Parcells to
wonder later, ``If this is such a great business, you wonder why
there aren't more in it.'' &QL;

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Nov. 2:
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey residents will vote Tuesday on a proposed
constitutional amendment that would allow $1 billion in borrowing
to protect half of the state's remaining two million acres of
undeveloped land over the next 10 years. We urge them to approve
this measure, which represents Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's latest
effort to preserve the state's threatened farmlands and other open
space.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Republican legislative leaders rejected her
first idea, a slight increase in New Jersey's relatively low
gasoline tax. The new proposal requires no new taxes but, instead,
would earmark $98 million a year in existing state tax revenues for
land preservation and for the repayment of the principal and
interest on bonds issued for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is fully consistent with New Jersey's honorable
record of preserving farmland, creating parks and otherwise
protecting open space. Its passage would mean that almost
two-fifths of the state would be protected for future generations.
The initiative has already won support from New Jersey's
legislators and now deserves approval from its voters.

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ In his final barnstorming trip of the campaign year,
President Clinton on Sunday invoked Newt Gingrich, Martin Luther
King Jr. and Rosa Parks in an impassioned plea that was part of a
full-scale drive by Democrats to spur turnout by black voters in
the election on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton's appearance at the predominantly black New
Psalmist Baptist Church was the most high-profile campaign stop,
Republicans and Democrats alike fanned out at churches, picnics,
party clubhouses and rallies around the United States, struggling
in the final 48 hours to galvanize, if not electrify, an electorate
lulled by a campaign season that still seems to be searching for a
national theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your vote counts just as much as mine, just as much as Speaker
Gingrich's,'' said Clinton in the latest move by his party to turn
the speaker into an incentive for Democrats to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway across the country in Green Bay, Wis., Gingrich sought
to stir his party's faithful as well. At a rally outside the
49ers-Packers football game on Sunday afternoon, the speaker
extolled the virtues of Rep. Mark Neumann, who has mounted a fierce
challenge to oust Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Tuesday's election is a choice between two teams,''
Gingrich said. ``One that believes in higher taxes, bigger
government and more power in Washington. The other believes in
lower taxes, smaller government and more power in Wisconsin. You
have a chance on Tuesday to dramatically change the direction of
Wisconsin by sending Mark Neumann to the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   The highly charged advances to break though to voters come not
only because the stakes are high in Tuesday's elections _ 34 Senate
seats, 36 governorships and all 435 House seats are up for grabs _
but also because the latest polls show that many critical elections
are too close to call. At least five Senate races and 10 contests
for governor could easily come out either way, according to
strategists in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most hard-hitting, and often unsavory, appeals came
not on the stump or from the interminable onslaught of television
commercials but in massive telephone calling, leaflet drops and
election-eve radio advertisements. These messages were below the
political radar screen and, in many cases, were intended to sway
voters while depriving a candidates' opponents of ammunition, or
time, to fire back in the closing hours of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, where Brian Baird, a Democrat, is locked in a tight
race against Don Benton, a Republican, for an open House seat, the
National Republican Congressional Committee sent out a leaflet at
the weekend with this warning in big bold letters: ``Oh, my! Did
you know that Brian Baird supports requiring our churches to
perform same sex marriages?''
</P>
<P>
   Baird campaign officials said Baird opposes same-sex marriage.
But he does not support the Defense of Marriage Act, which
withholds benefits in federal taxes, pensions and other areas to
partners of homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have not been timid either. In Missouri, the state
Democratic Party has begun running a radio commercial with a bald
appeal to blacks: ``When you don't vote, you let another church
explode,'' the narrator says. ``When you don't vote, you allow
another cross to burn. When you don't vote, you let another assault
wound a brother or a sister. When you don't vote, you let the
Republicans continue to cut school lunches and Head Start.''
</P>
<P>
   The furious efforts to gain partisan advantage are coming not
only from the candidates and the political parties but from outside
groups that are pumping millions of dollars into get-out-the-vote
drives.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition distributed an estimated 35 million
voter guides at churches on Sunday that are aimed at prodding
religious conservatives to go to the polls. In a counter-offensive,
the AFL-CIO was running large phone banks around the country, in
most cases imploring Democrats to vote.
</P>
<P>
   But even as campaigns offered free rides to voters to get them
to the polls, some also accused their opponents of trying to
discourage people from voting. In a technique known as push
polling, campaigns hired telemarketing firms to spread dirt about
their opponents in the guise of a poll. These calls are usually
very difficult to trace and often are detected too late to be
rebutted.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's trip to Baltimore on Sunday was noteworthy because
while his efforts on the fund-raising circuit never seemed to
diminish, his campaign on the hustings has been limited this year,
largely because he was distracted by the White House scandal. At
the height of the embarrassing publicity over his affair with
Monica Lewinsky, many Democrats, including Gov. Parris Glendening
of Maryland, did not want the president to campaign with them.
</P>
<P>
   But one reason Clinton traveled to Baltimore is that Glendening
is virtually tied in the polls with Ellen Sauerbrey, his Republican
challenger, in what has shaped up as one of the closest races
anywhere. Clinton, who was greeted by frenzied applause from
thousands of parishioners, laced his message with Biblical
references.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only two places, only two, where we have fulfilled
both the admonition of the Scripture and the promise of the
founders that all of us are created equal,'' said Clinton, who was
accompanied by Glendening and a host of other Maryland Democrats.
``One is when you come into your house of worship on Sunday and the
other is when you show up at the ballot box.''
</P>
<P>
   In a gibe at Ms. Sauerbrey at a rally on Halloween, Sen. Barbara
Mikulski also invoked Gingrich. But her message, that Ms. Sauerbrey
was ``masquerading'' as a moderate, was even blunter than the
president's: ``When she takes off the mask, takes off the makeup,
she's nothing but Newt Gingrich in high heels and an earring.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sauerbrey campaign, hardly sitting still, unleashed a harsh
commercial attacking Glendening's credibility. It closes with these
words filling the screen in red: ``People don't trust Parris
Glendening.''
</P>
<P>
   For those voters in Maryland who somehow missed the pitches on
either side, there is another opportunity. Republicans and
Democrats are calling people across the state with taped appeals
from figures including Clinton and, on the other side, Bob Dole,
the Republican presidential nominee in 1996.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The often ferocious _ and sometimes creative _ efforts to spark
the electorate come in part because so many races are so close.
While most Republicans said they did not expert their party to
capture the five additional seats in the Senate that would be
needed for a majority of 60 (the magic number to cut off Democratic
filibusters), the contests in at least five states were viewed as
anyone's for the taking: New York, North Carolina, Kentucky, Nevada
and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Maryland, at least nine races for governor were also
considered too close to call: those in Nevada, Hawaii, Georgia,
South Carolina, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Iowa, Ohio and Rhode
Island. Republicans now control 32 of the governors' offices.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the most intense campaigning is in the competition
for the House, where Republicans hold only an 11-seat majority.
Most Republicans and Democrats are now forecasting a Republican
pickup of fewer than a dozen seats.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after an election year that has been marked by the
unpredictable, no strategist in either party could, with full
confidence, forecast what might happen on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows the effect of a last minute, multimillion-dollar
infusion of commercials by the Republican Party reminding voters of
the Clinton scandal _ and counter-advertisements by the Democrats
assailing their opponents as scandalmongers. It is also unclear how
much Republican candidates will benefit from their party's lopsided
financial advantage in the last days of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Political strategists were also watching for unexpected turns in
the dynamics. In Illinois, for instance, analysts were debating a
new poll suggesting that Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, a Democrat who
had for weeks been badly lagging in the polls, had actually pulled
ahead of Peter Fitzgerald, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Even the poll's author, Andrew Kohut, said he was baffled by a
poll released Sunday by the Pew Research Center for the People and
the Press showing that likely voters were divided equally between
Democrats and Republicans. In three previous surveys since August,
Kohut's survey found that general support for Republican candidates
was consistently greater than for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little rattled,'' Kohut said. ``I was pretty confident
of small Republican gains. But these results would suggest a
Democrat seat gain which a couple of weeks ago was certainly
inconceivable.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many officials in both parties said that at this stage they
were no longer dwelling on polls, instead concentrating on the
single-minded goal of cajoling people to vote.
</P>
<P>
   In Southern California, Democrats sent out this mailing intended
to tarnish Randy Hoffman, a Republican who is taking on Rep. Brad
Sherman. The leaflet features a photograph of Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel, on a television screen. ``If you like Kenneth
Starr,'' the mailing says, ``vote for Republican Randy Hoffman for
Congress. And you'll be seeing a lot more of him.''
</P>
<P>
   In another effort to capitalize on Gingrich's unpopularity, the
mailing includes a copy of an invitation to a Hoffman rally that
featured the speaker. ``Newt Gingrich has raised tens of thousands
of dollars to elect Randy Hoffman to Congress,'' the flier says.
</P>
<P>
   Many candidates, it seems, could not but help but go negative.
Sen. Christopher Bond of Missouri, a Republican, broadcast a
television commercial in which he said, ``I think all of us are
tired of negative campaigning. Missouri deserves a better
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   But by Friday, Bond had reversed course with a new ad. It
featured a small-business owner attacking Bond's Democratic rival,
Jay Nixon, as having ``argued for the largest tax increase ever
forced on Missouri.''
</P>
<P>
   In Athens, Ohio, on Sunday, Hillary Rodham Clinton held forth at
a rally at a school gym and suggested a new approach to encourage
people to vote for Rep. Ted Strickland, who is in a tight race.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton offered this advice: ``You can even change your
telephone answering machine: `Hello. I'm not here right now. Vote
for Ted Strickland.'''

HAMAS GROUP THREATENS ARAFAT'S FORCES
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Fixes dateline; ADDS new 4th graf on authenticity of
threat.) 
 (jw) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   GAZA _ Lashing back at a crackdown by the Palestinian Authority,
the armed wing of the militant Islamic group Hamas warned Sunday
for the first time that it may turn its guns on Yasser Arafat's
police force.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian chief of police, Maj. Gen. Ghazi Jabali, said in
an interview that his men would respond, and he issued orders from
his Gaza headquarters to shoot at suspected assailants.
</P>
<P>
   The threat by the armed wing, known as the Qassam Brigades,
contradicted Hamas' longstanding position that it would avoid civil
war. And it signaled a deepening crisis with the Palestinian
Authority following the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian accord
in Washington last month.
</P>
<P>
   The warning came in a leaflet, and its authenticity was
questioned by a Hamas political leader.
</P>
<P>
   Under the accord, which takes effect on Monday, Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, made commitments to break up militant groups
planning anti-Israeli violence in return for an Israeli withdrawal
from a further 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Since a thwarted suicide car-bombing on an Israeli school bus in
the Gaza Strip on Thursday, in which an Israeli soldier was killed,
Palestinian police have rounded up an estimated 300 Hamas followers
and put the group's leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Phone links to Yassin's home have been cut, along with the
phones of several other political leaders of Hamas who were
detained but later released. Masked police officers searched the
sheik's home early Friday, seizing documents and confiscating
weapons from his bodyguards. Approaches to the house were blocked
Sunday by plainclothes officers armed with AK-47 rifles.
</P>
<P>
   Jabali said arrests were continuing in the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip and that 30 to 40 members of Hamas' armed wing were
being held. Police were searching for Muhammad Deif, a top Hamas
fugitive believed to have masterminded Thursday's bombing and a
series of other anti-Israeli attacks, Jabali said. The restrictions
on Yassin were imposed to prevent his ``incitement'' against the
Israeli-Palestinian accord in television interviews, the chief
added.
</P>
<P>
   A leaflet signed by the Qassam Brigades and sent to the Reuters
news agency in Jerusalem warned Sunday that continued
``repression'' by the Palestinian Authority ``may push many of the
sons of Hamas and its military wing, because of savage pressures,
to refuse the orders and instructions of their leadership and to
direct their war and guns, out of necessity, against the
authority's security apparatus.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaflet warned that the Palestinian security forces would
``not be safe from the anger of the revolutionaries rising up in
the face of merciless repression.''
</P>
<P>
   A prominent political leader of Hamas, Ismail Abu Shanab,
questioned the leaflet's authenticity and said that it contradicted
Hamas' policy. In an interview from Gaza with Qatari television,
Abu Shanab said that Hamas strategy ``seeks to spare the
Palestinian society the evil of fighting, regardless of
circumstances or causes.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interview last week, Abu Shanab maintained that a
Palestinian police crackdown on Hamas would lead to increased
attacks on Israel, but not to civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Vowing that ``we will not stop our martyrdom operations anywhere
on occupied land,'' the Qassam Brigades warned in the leaflet that
attacks would continue until ``the withdrawal of the last settler
from our holy land.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Our coming military strikes will show them true bitterness,''
the leaflet added.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at his Gaza headquarters, Jabali promised a
swift response to the threat of armed resistance. ``If they direct
their weapons against any police, we are always strugglers, and we
are not afraid of their guns,'' he said. ``We can react to them.''
</P>
<P>
   To prove his point, Jabali called his operations room to give an
order: ``If anyone from the Qassam Brigades gets near a police
officer, shoot him in the legs!''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing statements by Arafat, Jabali called Thursday's attack an
an act of ``treason'' that harmed Palestinian interests. By
jeopardizing gains from agreements with Israel and by provoking
Israeli border closures, such attacks ``destroy our national
enterprise and hurt our economy,'' Jabali said.
</P>
<P>
   Jabali identified the suicide attacker on Thursday as Suhayb
Abdel Rahman Timraz, 19, a high school student from the Jabalya
refugee camp near Gaza. His relatives, waiting final results of DNA
tests to confirm his identity, said Sunday that he had disappeared
from his poverty-stricken home a few days ago, saying nothing about
his destination.
</P>
<P>
   Jabali read a hand-written message he said had been found during
a search of Timraz's papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgive me, brothers, that I did not tell you that I will go
to heaven,'' the message said. ``I will meet God and his prophet.''

   (NYT12) NEW YORK -- Nov. 01, 1998 -- ROTHKO-ESTATE, 11-01 -- Dr.
Kate Rothko, 47, says she would have kept ``Homage to Matisse,'' at
left, by her father, Mark Rothko, if it had not been sold by the
trustees of his estate. Over the years, artists, dealers and
museums have seen their share of scandals, but few if any have
approached the level of the Rothko affair. In 1971, the art world
was transfixed by the battle between Rothko's executors, all of
them his good friends, and his two children, who accused the
executors of waste and fraud. (Justin Lane/New York Times Photo)

orphans,'' though still rare, are just one symptom of the
psychological distress tearing at families as South Korea's economy

HILL EMERGES FROM SHADOWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One week it's Mike Ogas. Another week it's Aaron
Arnold. Anthony Ramos and Jimmy Greninger also filter into the mix.
And then there's Drew Hill. Remember him?
</P>
<P>
   Hill was Cal State Northridge's second-leading receiver a year
ago but has yet to make an impact this season. He finally
resurfaced against Weber State on Saturday. He had 10 catches for
92 yards and was open more than an AM/PM store.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to this: There is no way CSUN's offense should
be shut down this season with a stable of such impressive
receivers. Whether it's moving the pocket or using three-step
drops, CSUN must provide quarterback Marcus Brady with enough time
to allow the receivers to get open.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just happened that I was the open guy this week'' Hill said
after CSUN's 26-10 win kept it in the playoff race. ``It's either
Aaron or Jimmy or Ogas or Ramos. It depends on the game. I have no
idea why it was me this time. I ran a little bit outside, but I was
more in the slot, which is where I've been the past few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Greninger and Arnold are deep threats. Ramos adds versatility;
he can line up in the slot or jump in for a play at quarterback.
Ogas is Mr. Possession. Third-and-whatever, he usually gets open.
</P>
<P>
   Until Weber State, we weren't quite sure what Hill's part was in
all this.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were dropping back into a zone and that's where he's the
best,'' CSUN quarterback Marcus Brady said. ``He always finds a way
to get open and that's where I was looking, underneath. And he was
there. But I didn't notice he was the one open all the time. I just
saw a receiver and threw it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to always have all the underneath routes. They seem
to always drop back into the zone, so the way we built our offense
for (Saturday) was to hit the underneath.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, sitting in the zone. That's how Hill got open last year and
how Aaron Flowers and Josh Fiske found him 69 times for a team-high
882 yards.
</P>
<P>
   This year it hasn't been that way. Hill had 20 catches for 197
yards in seven games before Weber State. The guy who was supposed
to be the anchor of CSUN's receiving corps was weighing it down.
</P>
<P>
   He would catch a ball here, another there but nothing
substantial. Twice this season Hill has had only one catch in a
game and four times he has had fewer than four. His high was five
receptions, which is remarkably unproductive considering he
averaged 5.75 catches a game last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't play a lot of (man-to-man coverage) and there's
just a lot of holes in their defense,'' Hill said. ``I can't tell
you why Marcus looked at me because everyone else was open, too.
It's one of those things and you get into a rhythm. I caught some
balls early and the nerves were out, the butterflies were gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill said an early involvement in the offense allowed him to get
a feel for the game. That was a 6-yard catch on CSUN's first
scoring drive, but it wasn't until the second quarter that Hill
became Brady's main target.
</P>
<P>
   So by the time the fourth quarter arrived, it looked as though
Hill had become Brady's only target. Four straight completions went
to Hill as the Matadors started running out the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to blitz in conditions like that,'' Weber State
coach Jerry Graybeal said, referring to Stewart Stadium's muddy
field. ``When you can't get pressure on the quarterback, with those
wide receivers it could be trouble.'' &QL; 
REPORT CARD
</P>
<P>
   Game:!off! 8
</P>
<P>
   Result: CSUN 26, Weber State 10
</P>
<P>
   Record: 5-3, 4-2 Big Sky
</P>
<P>
   This week's GPA: 3.48
</P>
<P>
   Cumulative GPA: 2.75
</P>
<P>
   QUARTERBACK: If the choices are hold the ball and take a sack or
throw an interception, do the first. That's what Marcus Brady
returned to doing, and the result was three touchdowns and went 27
of 39 for 264 yards. A
</P>
<P>
   RUNNING BACKS: CSUN got away from running the ball, but Jaumal
Bradley (13 carries, 51 yards) ran hard. Geoff Snowden and Marcus
Bivines provided adequate backup for a unit lacking the suspended
Melvin Blue. B
</P>
<P>
   RECEIVERS: We have a Drew Hill sighting. He caught 10 passes for
92 yards and receivers were open all day. The five-man corps had 26
catches and three touchdowns. Not too shabby against the best
passing defense in the league. A
</P>
<P>
   OFFENSIVE LINE: It's patchwork every week, but as long as Brady
survives and the running backs get positive yardage, it's got to be
considered a success. Not one holding call is a plus. Beau Cherry
at center and Julio Alcala at left tackle seems to be best
mix.!dlim!B-
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSIVE LINE: A big part of stopping Weber State's leading
rusher, Morgan Welch (61 yards), goes to this often-maligned group.
It silenced the running game, which is all it was asked to do.
Still not getting much pressure on the QB. B+
</P>
<P>
   LINEBACKERS: Shayne Blakey crushed the Wildcats with his 76-yard
interception return for a score in the second half. With Lewis
Blanton home, a few fill-ins did the work on a muddy field.
Tackling was as good as it's been this season. B+
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSIVE BACKS: One of these weeks safety Jeremy Golden won't
lead the team in tackles, but this wasn't it. Mel Miller forced a
fumble, Vito Clemente recovered one and Golden and Donnell Day had
picks. What more can you say? A
</P>
<P>
   SPECIAL TEAMS: Two missed PATs isn't a good sign, but the
special teams also took the ball back twice. Once on a fumbled punt
and another time on a pooch kick that CSUN recovered. But, yikes,
those missed PATs. B
</P>
<P>
   COACHING: Defensive packages allowed yards but not scores and
offense got back to being fun and allowed Brady to throw what he
likes _ crossing patterns. The fifth-best rusher in the nation was
a nonfactor and it was a win on the road in the Big Sky. Grade: A

`VAMPIRES' PACK ENOUGH BITE TO TAKE TOP SLOT IN HALLOWEEN WEEKEND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- ``John Carpenter's Vampires'' soared past rivals
to lead the nation's Halloween weekend box office with an estimated
$9.2 million at 1,793 theaters during the Friday-Sunday period,
studio sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The results set a record for a Halloween weekend opening, easily
topping the 1981 mark of $7.4 million set by ``Halloween II.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sony release starring James Woods as a slayer of the undead,
was the only nationwide debut as other studios chose to avoid
competing with trick-or-treating and a plethora of parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opening was well over our internal estimates, so we are
thrilled because this is generally a soft weekend,'' Sony spokesman
Ed Russell said. The success of ``Vampires,'' also the largest
opening for a film directed by Carpenter, follows a long line of
solid performance recently in the horror genre such as the two
``Scream'' films, ``I Know What You Did Last Summer'' and
``Blade.'' Sony will roll out ``I Still Know What You Did Last
Summer'' on the upcoming Friday the 13th.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Vampires' shows again that you don't need a major star or a
big budget to draw the core audience, which are the 16- to
25-year-olds who hang out at malls with multiplexes,'' said Robert
Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source forecasting service. The
analyst said ``Vampires'' will likely finish its run with $28.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   With the distraction of Halloween and only one new film, the
overall weekend results amounted to about $51 million, off 14
percent from the same weekend last year. That marked the first time
since the Fourth of July weekend that the box office has declined
on a year-to-year basis.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend's winner, ``Pleasantville,'' came in second with a
respectable $6.6 million at 1,761 theaters as the New Line
fantasy-comedy, already supported by critics as an Academy Award
contender, dropped only 25 percent from its debut weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' third weekend of ``Practical Magic'' finished
third with $5.1 million at 2,642 sites to top $33 million after 17
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antz'' saw a sharp drop due to Halloween with $4.1 million at
2,929 sites in its fifth weekend as it took in barely half its
previous Friday-Sunday take. The DreamWorks SKG release has drawn
$67.4 million in 31 days to go past ``Beavis and Butt-head Do
America's'' $63.1 million record as the top non-Disney animated
film domestically.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney record is $312.8 million for ``The Lion King,'' but
Bucksbaum said attaining the non-Disney record represents a major
milestone for 4-year-old DreamWorks, which is making animated
movies a major part of its release schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum projects DreamWorks' next animated entry, ``Prince of
Egypt,'' will easily out-perform ``Antz'' when it comes out next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's third weekend of ``Bride of Chucky'' finished a
close fifth with $4 million at 2,465 theaters as films targeted to
take advantage of the Halloween season took three of the first five
places.
</P>
<P>
   New Line's comedy hit ``Rush Hour'' continued to draw well in
sixth with $3.4 million at 2,402 theaters, giving it $122 million
after 45 days. It is now the 104th highest domestic grosser after
``Rocky III.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner's second weekend of ``Soldier'' continued to disappoint
in seventh with $2.63 million at 2,501 sites to give the Kurt
Russell vehicle, costing a reported $51 million, only $11 million
after 10 days. Disney's third weekend of ``Beloved'' also performed
below expectations in eighth with $2.58 million at 1,571 theaters
as it failed attract customers despite some solid reviews and
extensive promotional efforts by star Oprah Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   PolyGram's fifth weekend of ``What Dreams May Come'' finished
ninth with $2.3 million at 2,080 sites to beat Sony's
near-invisible second weekend of ``Apt Pupil'' with $1.7 million at
1,448 theaters. Sony's sixth weekend of teen-horror-fest ``Urban
Legend'' followed with $1.3 million at 1,395 locations to give the
$14 million project an overall gross of $35 million, underscoring
the genre's profitability.
</P>
<P>
   New Line's two limited openings performed well with ``American
History X,'' a drama about the neo-Nazi movement that has been
disavowed by director Tony Kaye, taking in $140,000 at eight
screens and drama-comedy ``Living Out Loud'' with $142,000 at only
eight theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Year-to-date business is approaching $5.4 billion, 10 percent
ahead of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Studios will issue a trio of high-profile releases next weekend,
including 20th Century Fox's action-drama ``The Siege,'' with
Denzel Washington, Disney's football comedy ``Water Boy,'' with
Adam Sandler and Warner's re-release of ``Wizard of Oz.'' Bucksbaum
said ``Water Boy'' has the strongest prospects due to Sandler's
drawing power.

49ERS FIND A NEMESIS LURKING IN GREEN BAY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Wis., Calif., Texas)   (jw) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. _ It used to be Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco 49ers used to have this obsession with beating
Dallas. At the beginning of this decade, the Cowboys always seemed
to spank the 49ers when it mattered most _ on the road, at home, in
the playoffs _ and then the 49ers set their minds to change, and
they tamed Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is Green Bay. But the 49ers have not found the whip and
chair.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers took another big bite out of San Francisco's psyche
with a 36-22 victory Sunday before 59,794 exuberant fans at Lambeau
Field who arrived early and left late, savoring another triumph
over the 49ers. It is five straight now. And San Francisco is
counting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it with these guys?'' asked 49ers cornerback Marquez
Pope, who on the game's first play from scrimmage watched the
flashy receiver Antonio Freeman sprint 80 yards for a touchdown on
a pass from Brett Favre.
</P>
<P>
   That started a 19-0 spree by the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This streak now is very difficult,'' Pope said. ``There is so
much a grudge between these two teams. We play tight and we fight.
But something always happens at the end. The ends kill us. We can't
get our cigar against this team.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco linebacker Lee Woodall, a fifth-year 49er, said:
``When I first got here, it was always Dallas, Dallas, Dallas. Now
it's Green Bay, Green Bay, Green Bay. They are in our heads. We've
got to figure out a way to get over this. It's a mind game now.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a game full of questions for the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should feel that way,'' said Reggie White, the Packers'
once-again dominant defensive end, who made three sacks and became
the first player in league history to get at least 10 sacks in 12
separate seasons. Of course, White leads the league in career sacks
with 187.5. He has 11 this season in eight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at our team and their team and there is a lot of
talent,'' White said. ``We just had the surge at the end. We went
in at halftime and at the start of the fourth quarter and told
every man, `Look and dig down deep and and make sure you bring all
you have to win this thing.' And we did that. We were stronger than
them. We know how to beat that team. You have to be physical and
aggressive. That's what we were.''
</P>
<P>
   That was what lifted Green Bay to a 6-2 record and dropped San
Francisco to 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   The game started this way for San Francisco: 80-yard touchdown
pass by Green Bay, Steve Young sacked, Garrison Hearst 5-yard run,
Young sacked again, Reggie Roby lost handle on punt snap resulting
in safety for Green Bay. The game was 29 seconds old and the
Packers were ahead, 9-0.
</P>
<P>
   With 9 minutes 44 seconds left in the first quarter, Green Bay
made the score 16-0. Robert Brooks caught a 30-yard pass from Favre
and then tap-danced just inside the right front corner of the end
zone for the touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I thought this was going to be a big game for our
organization,'' 49ers Coach Steve Mariucci said. ``They got us down
early, but I liked the way we fought back.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco did it with a Jerry Rice 12-yard scoring catch
from Young at the end of the first quarter and then with a spirited
second quarter that brought the 49ers close and left them trailing
by 19-13 at halftime. Beginning the fourth quarter, San Francisco
was ahead, 22-19.
</P>
<P>
   But then this series happened: Ryan Longwell booted a 45-yard
field goal for Green Bay, Favre found Freeman again on a 62-yard
scoring pass, Young was sacked by Keith McKenzie, who also
recovered Young's fumble, and then the Packers' Travis Jervey ran
around right end for an 11-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Packers ahead, 36-22, with 9:30 remaining. From that point, the
Packers rushed Young silly.
</P>
<P>
   The pass rush was incredible. Young would be sacked a total of
nine times, the 49ers would be limited to total of 266 yards and
Green Bay would win the fourth quarter by 17-0.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Green Bay overcame three Favre interceptions. He was 15 of 28
for 279 yards with three touchdowns. Young passed for only 186
yards. San Francisco ran 76 plays, Green Bay only 55, but the 49ers
averaged only 3.5 yards a play and Green Bay, 6.8. Rice's longest
catch was for 12 yards, while three Packers made catches of at
least 19 yards.
</P>
<P>
   These are two teams that run the same systems, the same stuff,
the same West Coast offense, who have had coaches go back and forth
from one team to the other. They are so similar. Yet, right now, up
close, they are so distant.
</P>
<P>
   ``People might think we're done, but we're far from done,''
Freeman said. ``I can only imagine what it means to them to lose to
us for the fifth straight time. What it means for us right now is
that we have the confidence to put something together in this
second half of the season and get to where we want to in the
post-season.'' &QL;

PAUL MISRAKI, COMPOSER OF SONGS AND SOUNDTRACKS, DIES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (jw) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Misraki, a prolific French composer of songs and also of
the soundtracks for more than 150 films made by Orson Welles,
Jean-Luc Godard, Roger Vadim and others, died on Thursday in Paris,
where he lived. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   The French honors he received included being made a Chevalier de
la Legion d'Honneur and an Officier des Arts et des Lettres.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, The Daily Telegraph, musing in 1993 about songs that
enjoyed the honor of being sung by Yves Montand, said ``Paul
Misraki's `La Tete a l'Ombre' is a lazy, sunny little song
celebrating the joys of a boy waiting in the shade, glimpsing a
girl through an open window (she's stark naked, of course).''
</P>
<P>
   Misraki wrote the music and the original Spanish words for the
Argentine song ``Maria From Bahia,'' which became a popular
American record, sung by the Starlighters, in the 1940s. In that
decade he and John Hess wrote the music for ``Passing By.'' It was
recorded, with French words by Charles Trenet, by Jean Sablon for
RCA Victor.
</P>
<P>
   Misraki's score for the 1965 film ``Alphaville,'' directed by
Godard, was praised by an American critic last year as contributing
much to its melancholy romanticism.
</P>
<P>
   Other movies Misraki wrote the scores for included Welles' ``Mr.
Arkadin,'' also titled ``Confidential Report'' (1955); Vadim's
``And God Created Woman'' (1956) and Claude Chabrol's ``Cousins''
(1959).
</P>
<P>
   Born in what is now Istanbul, Turkey, Misraki graduated from a
secondary school in Paris and lived most of his life in France. He
joined a band, Les Collegiens, which left war-torn Europe in 1942
for South America. Later he worked in Hollywood for RKO Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife and three children.

NANCY VAN NORMAN BAER, CURATOR OF DANCE AND THEATER, DIES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., N.Y., Texas)   (jw) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nancy Van Norman Baer, the curator of theater and dance at the
Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, died Tuesday at the California
Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco. She was 55 and lived in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said Pamela Forbes, director of media at
the museums.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Baer was known for exhibitions that vividly evoked dance
history. Between 1978 and 1986, she was the curator of exhibitions
at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor and the M.H. de
Young Memorial Museum, both in San Francisco, on Loie Fuller, Anna
Pavlova and Bronislava Nijinska, which combined sculpture, works of
art on paper and costumes. Her widely praised Nijinska exhibition
was also seen at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   At the museums, which she joined in 1988, Ms. Baer was the
curator of three major exhibitions: ``Paris Modern: The Swedish
Ballet, 1920-1925'' in 1995-96, which traveled to the McNay Art
Museum in San Antonio and the Fashion Institute of Technology in
Manhattan; ``Theater in Revolution: Russian Avant-Garde Stage
Design, 1913-1935'' in 1991-92, also at the IBM Gallery of Science
and Art in Manhattan, the Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural
Center in Los Angeles and the McNay, and ``The Art of Enchantment:
Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, 1909-1929'' in 1988-89.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Baer had a special interest in the Russian avant-garde. She
learned Russian and visited Russia many times. She was the curator
of ``The Paris Seasons of the Ballets Russes'' at the Museum of
Revolution in Moscow in 1994. She was also a consultant to the San
Francisco Performing Arts Library and Museum and assisted Irina
Nijinska, the daughter of the dancer and choreographer Bronislava
Nijinska, in restaging Nijinska's ballets.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of her death, Ms. Baer was working with dance
historian Lynn Garafola on ``The Ballets Russes and Its World,'' a
book to be published by Yale University Press. She was also
preparing an exhibition on Vaslav Nijinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Baer is survived by her father, Alan Van Norman of San
Diego, and her husband, Alan Baer of San Francisco.

PETER GRIFFIN, 61, WHO UNLOCKED SECRET OF BLACKJACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.J., Ore.)  (lb) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Griffin, who had such a winning way with numbers that he
unlocked the mathematics of blackjack and became a cult figure to a
generation of casino card counters, died on Oct. 18 at a hospital
near his home in Sacramento, Calif. Griffin, who wrote the
authoritative ``Theory of Blackjack,'' was 61 and had taught
algebra and a good deal else as a professor of mathematics at the
California State University there.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said the cause was prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   To say that Griffin was a consummate mathematician would hardly
do justice to a man who led a life of such meticulous precision
that fellow faculty members could set their watches by the times he
got his mail, arrived at his office or started home on his bicycle,
as he did even when he lived 13 miles from campus. A creature of
calculated habit, he not only jumped rope at the same time every
day but always with the same rope, one he had found on the street
years before.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin, a native of New Jersey, grew up in Williamsport, Pa.,
Chicago and Portland, Ore., graduated from Portland State
University and received a master's from the University of
California at Davis. Since one of his grandfathers had been a
prominent mathematician at Reed College, and his father was an
actuary who ended up running an insurance company, the source of
Griffin's mathematical aptitude was obvious.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tribute to Griffin's standing as a mathematical giant of
blackjack, or 21, as the game is also known, that his book
exploring and explaining the probabilities of every conceivable
situation in the game was not published until 1979, 17 years after
Dr. Edward Thorp's ``Beat the Dealer'' had presumably exhausted the
subject, codifying the basic strategy and establishing that players
could gain an actual statistical edge over the house by keeping
track of cards as they were played and betting big when the
remaining deck was rich in 10s and face cards.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin did not even play blackjack until January 1970, when, to
gain practical experience for a proposed course on gambling
mathematics, he paid a visit to Nevada and promptly got his clock
cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   Like Thorp, who had had a similar experience in 1956, Griffin
vowed revenge on the casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Thorp's book had created a gambling revolution, selling more
than 700,000 copies and transforming blackjack from a sleepy
diversion for dice players' wives into a high-roller's favorite
that now typically accounts for nearly half of casino table-game
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin's book extending and illuminating Thorp's findings had a
more specialized appeal, selling fewer than 50,000 copies, and
transforming mainly himself.
</P>
<P>
   The depth of his mathematical analysis, the clarity with which
he provided step-by-step explanations of complex calculations, and
the book's humor delighted card sharks and mathematicians alike,
making Griffin a highly popular figure among blackjack aficionados
and opening up new vistas for him as a well-traveled visiting
expert at casinos and gambling conferences around the world.
</P>
<P>
   A sequel of sorts, ``Extra Stuff: Gambling Ramblings,'' was
published in 1991 by Huntington Press, which is issuing the sixth
edition of ``The Theory of Blackjack'' next month.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A man of self-deprecating humor, Griffin could deftly steer
virtually any conversation to mathematics but never lorded it over
those who found it difficult to understand why, say, in any random
group of 35 people the odds are overwhelming that at least two will
have the same birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Even accomplished card counters tended to gasp when Griffin
demonstrated his own card-counting skills, keeping six separate
running tallies in his head rather than the single high-low counts
that most card counters can handle.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, he found blackjack too boring to play for long
stretches, as profitable card counting requires, and was resigned
to never making a fortune at it.
</P>
<P>
   But then the man whose idea of an author's photograph was to
pose sitting on an elephant, had little need of a fortune to keep
his spirits up. If all else failed, there would always be another
math problem to keep him chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin is survived by his wife, Lydia; and a brother, Alan, and
a sister, Barbara Dann, both of Salem, Ore.

NORTHRIDGE INVESTIGATES SOCCER COACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cal State Northridge officials are investigating
the conduct of women's soccer coach Brian Wiesner in the wake of a
run-in between him and an assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an incident. It's being reviewed,'' assistant
athletic director Brian Swanson said. ``Since it's between staff,
the Office of Faculty Affairs is reviewing it now.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is an alleged shoving and shouting match involving
Wiesner and assistant coach Allison Lee at halftime of the
Matadors' game at Idaho State on Oct. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Wiesner, reached at home Sunday night, downplayed the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call it an investigation, just a normal
administrative review,'' he said. ``Whenever an employee has a
complaint (this happens).''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to go into specifics. Lee could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Wiesner just completed his fourth season as coach, guiding the
Matadors to a 6-13 record, an improvement over 1997's 2-18 mark.
His contract expires Dec. 31, but Wiesner said he would like to
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of potential with this group,'' he said. ``We've
done a good enough job to merit the chance to continue the program
in the direction we're taking it.''

SPORTS COLUMN: WITH JETS, THE BUBBLE HAS STAYING POWER NOW
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mo., N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN  
  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Everybody has been waiting for the Jets'
bubble to burst; Vinny Testeverde's bubble in particular. Nothing
personal, it's just that the residue of so many years of grimy play
and grimy coaching is so thick that it can't all be scraped away in
one season.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into the game, Testeverde had thrown just one
interception in 132 attempts this fairy-tale season. But when he
finally threw another with 14 minutes left to play Sunday _ when
Keyshawn Johnson ran the wrong route _ and Kansas City scored three
plays later to take a 17-10 lead, the Jets' bubble seemed about
ready to burst.
</P>
<P>
   If you were a Jets fan, your heart sank, you cursed. You said
``too bad'' and took solace _ again _ in a great effort. But deep
down you knew that this was a game the Jets really needed. Not in a
statistical sense; but in the sense of keeping up with the Joneses
in the division.
</P>
<P>
   This was a game the Jets needed to scrape away a large patch of
grime that has clogged the organization's veins and arteries and
blocked a much-needed supply of respect from circulating.
</P>
<P>
   But then something happened on this rain-swept day that made
Jets hearts leap: Aaron Glenn took the ensuing kickoff and ran it
back from the Jets' 10 to the Kansas City 28 yard line. After the
game Bill Parcells would call Glenn's run ``a big momentum
changer.'' Maybe it was a season saver.
</P>
<P>
   A play later, Testeverde, his bubble very much intact, went back
to pass, then ran for 8 yards. On the next play, Testeverde hit
Kyle Brady, his suddenly dependable tight end, with a 20-yard
touchdown pass. Tie game.
</P>
<P>
   But there was much more to come. Everything negative that used
to happen to the Jets flipped over and went the Jets' way. On its
next possession, Kansas City rumbled to the Jets' 30 yard line. On
fourth down and 6 the Chiefs lined up for what appeared to be a
field goal. It was a fake. Instead, Pete Stoyanovich punted the
ball 29 yards to the Jets' 1 yard line. In the tangle of chaos by
the goal line, Corwin Brown of the Jets appeared to touch the ball,
a Kansas City player scooped it up and tumbled into the end zone.
An official signaled a Chiefs touchdown, and one Jet put his hands
over his helmet in an ``Oh, No'' pose, familiar to Jets fans.
</P>
<P>
   When the chaos subsided, the officials ruled that Kansas City's
Ty Parten had already touched the ball and downed it. Two years ago
_ well, you know what would have happened. Jets disaster. But this
time the Jets took the ball on their own 1 yard line, and what
happened then should send a warning throughout the league. It
probably won't, but it should.
</P>
<P>
   On the first play from scrimmage Testeverde dropped back, threw
a swing pass to Keith Byars who turned upfield and, at the point of
contact, stretched out and squeezed the final inches out of an
11-yard gain. Later in the same drive on third down and 9 at the
Jets 26 yard line, Testeverde zipped a sharp pass to Fred Baxter
for a 23-yard gain. The Jets got as far as the Kansas City 45 when
Testeverde was sacked and the Jets were forced to punt.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jets had scored a major victory: They had seized the
momentum. If you were a Jets fan, you could sense that the team
would get the ball back and win in regulation or overtime. That
word _ inevitable _ came to mind for the first time since who knows
when.
</P>
<P>
   This time it was the other team that bungled. The Chiefs' punter
kicked the ball 25 yards off the side of his foot. The Jets took
over with 1 minute 50 seconds left at the Kansas City 43.
</P>
<P>
   Just before they broke the huddle, Testeverde told his team that
this was what great teams do: They finish tough games on the road
and go home with victories.
</P>
<P>
   That was it: Kansas City had no time-outs, the Jets had three.
They backed the Chiefs down the field like a chess master closing
in on Checkmate in eight moves.
</P>
<P>
   Testeverde to Chrebet for 6 yards to the 30. Timeout. Martin for
2 yards, Testeverde to Chrebet for 9. Time. 16 seconds left.
Timeout. Martin around right end for 1 yard to the 18. Two seconds
left. Timeout. John Hall comes on for the field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, the Chiefs commit one final blunder: Derrick Thomas
jumps offside, moving the Jets five yards closer. Hall nails a
32-yard field goal. Game over.
</P>
<P>
   While his teammates mob Hall, Ray Mickens knelt in the middle of
a muddy field and clenched fists, punched the air.
</P>
<P>
   His uniform was covered with mud, but this was the kind of grime
you don't mind. Now the game was over and reporters made the mad
rush to the locker room to get reactions.
</P>
<P>
   I got up, then looked down at the rain soaked field, thought
about the Jets' heroic effort and eased back down in my chair. This
was a game that speaks for itself.

 &HT;    AirTran flight's bumpy landing probed
 &HT;    By Nathanial W. Cook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The National Transportation Safety Board is
investigating an emergency landing Sunday by a Dallas-bound AirTran
flight that was forced to return to Atlanta shortly after takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 737 with 100 passengers returned to Hartsfield
International Airport after the cockpit crew noticed a warning
light indicating a possible hydraulic problem with the plane's
ground steering mechanism, said AirTran spokeswoman Cara Maruskin.
</P>
<P>
   The plane lost steering control after landing, and the nose gear
collapsed after hitting a berm on the runway, said Kathleen Bergen
of the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no problem with the landing itself, but because of
the steering problem, the plane rolled off the runway and onto an
embankment,'' Maruskin said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 passengers with minor injuries were transported to
South Fulton Medical Center and Southern Regional Medical Center.
The injuries included bruises and abrasions from sliding down
chutes while evacuating the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The incident happened around 5:30 after Flight 867 took off from
Hartsfield for Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most serious incident involving AirTran since May,
when a DC-9 flying from Atlanta to Chicago hit bad weather in North
Georgia and made an emergency landing in Chattanoogawith a smashed
cockpit window and a nose cone ripped off.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran, which plans to replace some of its 737s next year,
reported recently that it was taking two of them out of service by
letting their leases expire. The carrier also is furloughing some
of its workers in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier said that the cutback reflects less optimism on its
ability to further expand service this year. It did not say how
much it had hoped to expand its schedule.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran, formerly known as ValuJet, changed its name more than a
year after the May 11, 1996, crash in the Florida Everglades that
killed 110 people. Investigators said that crash was caused by a
fire fed by illegally carried oxygen generators.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: JEFFERSON AND SALLY HEMINGS, TOGETHER AT
LAST? 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BRENT STAPLES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Historians are spinning in their armchairs over the news that
geneticists have turned up a match between a descendant of Thomas
Jefferson and an offspring of Sally Hemings, the slave rumored for
two centuries to have had a long-running affair with America's most
celebrated president. Hero worshipers argued violently that the
affair had not taken place, seeing Jefferson as pristine and above
sex _ not just with a slave, but with anyone other than his wife.
Faced with rumor and innuendo _ and no physical evidence _ even
historians who believed in the affair took the position that we
would never know the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The case shows that Jefferson lied about sex in the last century
just as William Jefferson Clinton did in this one. It also
vindicates people like the historian Fawn Brodie and the novelist
Barbara Chase-Riboud who were scorned as lust peddlers for thinking
the master and the slave had an affair. But from a historical
standpoint, the proof that Jefferson slept with Sally Hemings
brings almost nothing to our understanding of Jefferson, Hemings or
the system of plantation slavery that brought them into contact.
</P>
<P>
   The Jefferson-Hemings story begins in the 1780s in Paris, when
Jefferson, bereaved at the death of his wife, accepted the post of
ambassador to France. Dashing Sally, as visitors called her at
Monticello, arrived in Paris in 1786 accompanying Jefferson's
daughter. But once back at Monticello, Sally bore at least five
children, beginning with Tom in 1790 and ending with Eston in 1808.
</P>
<P>
   Historians argued that Jefferson's ``basic character'' made him
immune to illicit sex. Joseph Ellis suggested in his most recent
book that Jefferson sublimated his sex drive into architecture,
making Monticello a perpetual work in progress that was built and
rebuilt almost up to the day he died. Ellis and others also note
that none of Jefferson's many thousands of letters mentioned
Hemings or contained even a hint of lust. What we now know is that
this lust was being satisfied with Sally Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   Bear in mind as well that Hemings and Jefferson's wife were
half-sisters, fathered by the same plantation owner. Raised in the
same household, they would have had similar tastes, and they may
have had similar features. It is easy to imagine Jefferson, widowed
and lonely, cleaving to a young replica of his dead wife. That he
reached out to Sally is understandable. But it makes him neither
better nor worse than his father-in-law, and thousands of other
slave masters (and slave mistresses, too) who took slave lovers
within plain view of the neighboring gentry.
</P>
<P>
   Some modern observers assume that Sally was a passive victim of
forced intercourse. Rape was a constant hazard on the plantation.
But well-positioned slave women who crossed racial lines often did
so to improve their children's chances of survival. Mulatto
children often prospered during and after slavery because they were
literate, professionally aggressive and thought themselves the
equals of whites _ all of which they acquired through close
proximity to the plantation elite. Sally Hemings would have known
these tactics well, as her own mother practiced them.
</P>
<P>
   If the utilitarian version of this relationship does not suit
you, consider the loving quasi-marriage depicted by Ms.
Chase-Riboud or in the Merchant and Ivory film ``Jefferson in
Paris.'' If we assume that Hemings loved Jefferson, she got some of
what she wanted: a loving relationship and valuable education and
trades for her children. What she could never have was full stature
as a partner.
</P>
<P>
   But this version introduces a riddle about Jefferson's racism,
which grew coarser and more intractable over time. He started out
as a cautious believer in abolition, but retreated steadily from
that position, thinking that slavery needed to be kept intact, in
part to preclude race mixing. The notion that he developed and
hardened these attitudes while having a truly loving relationship
with a black woman seems implausible. If this is what happened,
Jefferson was more conflicted and self-deceptive than we knew.
</P>
<P>
   A few people will see something redemptive in the fact that
Jefferson fathered children with a black woman. But nothing done in
bed would atone for the fiercely bigoted views of black people put
forth in ``Notes on the State of Virginia.'' The most committed
racists reveled in illicit sex in the slave quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Among our presidents, Thomas Jefferson has been the most
controversial and paradoxical. When Americans speak of him, they
elaborate a personal relationship with the Founding Father who
conjured democracy out of nothing _ or the mere mortal who failed
to break the chains of slavery, poisoning the Republic's future.
Last week's disclosure adds to the mystery of Jefferson but does
nothing to solve it.

 CHRON - VOLATILITY  
 VOLATILE SITUATION FOR STOCKS  &HT;     By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The stock market has been fluctuating wildly these past few months,
scaring the wits out of investors who had been lulled into
believing that it only went straight up.
<P>
   The market soared 18 percent from January 1 to mid-July, then
plummeted more than 19 percent by August 31, then turned on a dime
and has risen nearly 14 percent since then.
</P>
<P>
   If that kind of volatility seems frighteningly high, it is.
Since mid-July, volatility _ the market's daily move, up or down _
has averaged 1.4 percent per day _ about three times the long-term
average.
</P>
<P>
   Shell-shocked investors, watching the Dow plunge 200, 300 and
even 500 points in a single day, might think this is the
most-volatile worst &LR; market ever.
</P>
<P>
   It's not, in percentage terms.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's 513-point free-fall on August 31 amounted to a 6.4
percent decline.
</P>
<P>
   That was bad, but nothing compared to the Dow's 508-point crash
on Oct. 19, 1987, which amounted to 22.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A 500-point drop today, in percentage terms, would be equivalent
to about a 130-point drop in October 1987 or a 17-point drop in
October 1929 _ the month of  &LR; history's other great market crash.
</P>
<P>
   Although this year's volatility is high by historical standards,
volatility was much greater at the time of the 1929 and 1987
crashes.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1929, stocks moved up or down _ mostly down _ by an
astounding 3.57 percent per day.
</P>
<P>
   The picture was strikingly similar in October 1987, when the
market crashed again and volatility shot up to 3.51 percent for the
month.
</P>
<P>
   This year, volatility has averaged just under 1 percent percent
_ bad enough to scare many investors to sell some or all of their
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   That could be a big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Lynch, one of the leading market gurus, has steadfastly
insisted that anyone investing for the long haul should remain
fully invested in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   He points out that stocks offer the best long-term returns of
any financial instrument, and that no one _ himself included _ can
consistently time the market successfully.
</P>
<P>
   That is the majority view among professional money managers.
</P>
<P>
   But there also is an old saying on Wall Street that your
portfolio must pass ``the sleep test.'' If you are so worried about
your investments that you can't sleep at night, then you might want
to mix in a few bonds and even some ready cash, to reduce the
volatility and the risk.
</P>
<P>
   You can do that with the help of asset-allocation models devised
by financial experts. They help you decide _ based on such
considerations as your age, risk tolerance and economic outlook _
how to distribute your funds.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best is available for free on Smart Money magazine's
Web site  &LR; (www.smartmoney.com/si &LR;   &LR; /tools/oneasset). &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to use, and lets you quickly explore a broad range of
investment scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   The calculator prompts you to key in your age, the size of your
investment portfolio, the amount of money you save annually, the
amount of your investment portfolio you expect to spend in the next
10 years, the dividend or interest yield you need from your
investments to meet expenses, your tax bracket, your tolerance for
market volatility and your outlook on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Based on your answers, SmartMoney advises you precisely how to
distribute your funds among various classes of stocks, fixed-income
investments such as bonds, and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for example, a hypothetical 40-year-old in the 28
percent tax bracket with $150,000 in investments, annual savings of
$3,000, no need to raid principal during the next 10 years, no need
for dividend income to meet expenses, a volatility tolerance in the
low-to-medium range and an expectation that the economy will be on
the weak side.
</P>
<P>
   For such an investor, SmartMoney recommends this asset
allocation:
</P>
<P>
   _24 percent in large-capitalization stocks
</P>
<P>
   _22 percent in small-cap stocks
</P>
<P>
   _20 percent in foreign stocks
</P>
<P>
   _16 percent in fixed-income investments
</P>
<P>
   _17 percent in cash
</P>
<P>
   If you are in your mid-20s, with a large portfolio, substantial
savings, a high tolerance for volatility and you expect a strong
economy, SmartMoney suggests that you put 98 percent of your funds
into stocks, primarily small-caps.
</P>
<P>
   If you are very old, with a small portfolio, minimal savings, a
low tolerance for volatility and you expect a weak economy, you
will be advised to keep as little as 3 percent of your portfolio in
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Another good asset-allocation model is available from the
Vanguard mutual-fund group, in the form of an 11-question quiz.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Depending mainly on the number of years left until you retire,
but also on your volatility tolerance, your investment experience
and your income, Vanguard recommends allocating between 10 percent
and 100 percent of your portfolio to stocks.

AN OFFICE LABOR OF LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - CANCER   By Ilana DeBare 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
ethAnn Berliner worked in the glass office next to Carolyn Cates
for about six years, but their relationship remained mostly
professional. The two women shared vacation anecdotes and photos of
Berliner's infant son, but never socialized outside work or
exchanged personal details of their lives.
<P>
   Then Cates got terminal breast cancer. Berliner ended up
coordinating an e-mail network of co-workers who became a kind of &LR; 
 &LR; surrogate family for Cates _ shopping for her, cooking meals,
driving her to medical appointments and toward towards  &LR; the end,
staying with her around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Berliner spent numerous nights at Cates' house, including one
night when she curled up at the foot of Cates' bed, massaging her
feet while the dying woman reminisced about old college friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four or five years ago, I'm not sure Carolyn would have
accepted anybody from the office helping her,'' Berliner said.
``But when she disclosed her illness, we were transformed from
quasi-friends or colleagues to being friends. Over time, this whole
organization fell in love with this person because we got to know
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Cates, who died in July, was a researcher at WestEd _ a
300-person nonprofit institute based in San Francisco that does
educational research for the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers these days are filled with stories of things going
wrong in workplaces, from lawsuits and layoffs to sexual harassment
and shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Cates and WestEd is one of the things going right _
a woman who chose to share her struggle to survive with her
co-workers, and co-workers who rallied to help her with open &LR; 
hearts &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``Work is one of the biggest issues for people dealing with
cancer: `How much should I work? How much should I let people at
work know?' '' said Elise NeeDell Babcock, author of a book about
cancer called ``When Life Becomes Precious: A Guide for Patients,
Loved Ones and Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be you couldn't even mention the word `cancer.' Now
there's more openness, and workplaces try to accommodate people
more. ... But that workplace (WestEd) is still very unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Workplace responses to serious illness at work have changed over
the past 15 years. Activism by people with AIDS and breast cancer
has made it easier and more acceptable to discuss life-threatening
conditions. &UR;  &LR; Medical science has improved so that people with
diseases like cancer can often go on working while they undergo
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   And the 1991 American with Disabilities Act now requires most
employers to provide ``reasonable accommodations'' that will let
seriously ill workers stay on the job.
</P>
<P>
   But not all companies support ill workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know many people with HIV who are hesitant to tell anyone at
their company because they fear retaliation,'' said Ross Woodall, a
volunteer with the San Francisco AIDS Foundation who often speaks
to employers about dealing with AIDS at work.
</P>
<P>
   In Cates' case, she received workplace support on two levels. On
a formal level, company managers helped her apply for disability
insurance, encouraged her to stay as involved as she wanted, and
kept her desk and office ready for her until her death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our CEO was 100 percent in support of anything that anyone
could do to help Carolyn,'' said Doris Smith, an administrative
assistant who had a longtime friendship with Cates.
</P>
<P>
   On an informal level, other employees voluntarily did whatever
they could to help.
</P>
<P>
   Cates, who was 56 when she died, needed more support than some
other people might. She was unmarried, had no siblings, and had
recently lost her parents when she received her cancer diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   She was also a fiercely independent person who had never
previously asked people at work for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to her illness, Carolyn never asked for help. She didn't
know &LR;  how  &LR; to ask for help,'' Berliner said. ``Those who worked
with her saw it as her strength and her weakness. So when she
learned to ask for help, there was no way anyone in this
organization was not going to be there for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Cates confronted her diagnosis directly, using her skills as an
academic researcher to analyze treatment strategies. She was
equally direct with her colleagues _ telling them of the diagnosis
at a staff meeting and stating without embarrassment that she would
need their support in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Cates' directness was key in setting a tone for how the office
would deal with her illness, and created an opening for people to
spontaneously offer help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us tend to keep our problems to ourselves, but Carolyn
was outspoken and up-front about her illness from the beginning,''
said Smith. ``Carolyn really led the way. She was so up-front that
she engaged people.''
</P>
<P>
   Cates attacked her illness with her characteristic Molly
Ivins-style Texan humor. One time, when she was losing her hair,
she showed up at work in a Marilyn Monroe wig.
</P>
<P>
   She was also determined to keep working as much as she could.
</P>
<P>
   Her pluck inspired some co-workers who had barely known her
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``She handled things in such an admirable way, it was a great
lesson to other people,'' said Tania (CQ) &LR; Madfes, a researcher who
knew Cates casually from occasional meetings together. ``I found
myself doing things for her that I'm not sure I'd do for someone I
was related to _ laundry, cleaning, changing linen, going up and
down her steep stairs when my back was out.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; How to Help
</P>
<P>
   Not all employees had an easy time figuring out how to help.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Baker, who was Cates' supervisor when she became ill, had
worked with her for about 20 years. They were good friends who
shared a love of jazz. But as a man, Baker was uncertain how to
help someone with breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she announced she was ill, I felt a little awkward,''
Baker said. ``As a man, I couldn't get that close when treatment
modalities were happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker sent Cates flowers several times _ until colleagues told
him that she hated getting flowers. Finally he settled on mailing
her a book-on-tape each week and calling her a few days later to
chat about the book _ an arrangement she enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   Baker also helped Cates keep a hand in WestEd's work, even when
she had gone out on disability leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd call me and I'd tell her we were going to be discussing
a particular issue, and she'd say, `I think I should come in for
that,''' Baker recalled. ``She would do it and be a real part of
what we were talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Cates' health went up and down like a roller coaster for nearly
two years, through rounds of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Her main support came from three close friends outside of
WestEd, who helped Cates make her medical decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Those friends called upon WestEd staffers when Cates needed
anything from clean laundry to companionship.
</P>
<P>
   Cates' friend Judith Warren Little would call Berliner with a
request. Berliner would send out an e-mail to some of her WestEd
colleagues. Some of them, in turn, would e-mail other colleagues _
a quick way to mobilize support that didn't exist a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine having done this without e-mail,'' Little
said. During one five-week period toward the end of Cates' life,
WestEd employees helped her other friends provide round-the-clock
companionship for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The routine became integrated into my household,'' recalled
Berliner. ``I had a young son. I'd put him to bed and then tell him
I was going to sleep over in Aunti  &LR; Auntie Carolyn's house.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience of caring for Cates ended up profoundly affecting
many people at WestEd _ changing their views of themselves as well
as their workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Lurie, an administrative assistant, drew direct
inspiration from Cates when she too found herself diagnosed with
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``She showed me how to come into work and be strong,'' said
Lurie. ``One time Carolyn went with me to my oncologist. The next
day she put all these notes in my computer: It was like a five-page
report on what he'd said my options were.''
</P>
<P>
   Faye Mueller, a researcher who is the only WestEd employee to
work out of a home office, felt part of a workplace community for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work in extreme isolation,'' Mueller said. ``Most often,
people don't even know I'm a regular employee. But through the
e-mails about Carolyn, I began to get a feeling I was part of this
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Some staffers said the experience with Cates was an antidote to
a disturbing sense of facelessness they'd been feeling in recent
years, as WestEd opened satellite offices and added scores of new
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three or four years ago, I realized I had to drop the idea
that I could know everybody at work,'' said Smith. ``It was a
terrible feeling. Carolyn was a catalyst for us feeling a sense of
community while in an expanding organization.'
</P>
<P>
   Despite its recent growth, WestEd remains a workplace with a
core of longtime employees who have been there for a decade or
more. Cates herself worked there for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Some staffers privately question whether Cates would have found
as much support in an organization dominated by newer employees.
</P>
<P>
   They wonder what will happen when personal crises occur in
tomorrow's workplace, where employees change jobs every couple of
years and companies increasingly rely on independent contractors or
temporary staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how, in an organization that's constantly turning
over, you'd organize support for someone who is ill,'' said Cates'
friend Little.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, about three months after Cates died, more than 40
WestEd employees joined thousands of other marchers in Golden Gate
Park for a ``Making Strides Against Breast Cancer'' walkathon.
</P>
<P>
   The company paid for special T-shirts. The marchers included
Cates' workplace caregivers as well as WestEd CEO Glen Harvey and
numerous employees who hadn't been directly involved in her care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people felt that what we were doing was extra
hard work or heroic,'' Berliner said, recalling the support that
she and other WestEd workers gave to Cates. ``It was really easy.
We just did it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were teaching ourselves how to do this,'' said Jeanne
Elliott, a researcher. ``Many times you don't know how to respond.
But people would be talking and someone would say, `I brought
Carolyn some food.' And you'd say to yourself, `I could do that.'
We got better at it.''

BRUINS WINNING ON EMPTY?

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Actually, Andy Meyers, you ARE the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the Bruins escaped Stanford on Saturday evening
with a 28-24 victory, Meyers, a senior guard, called UCLA's 12
penalties ridiculous. ``We're not the Raiders,'' he scoffed.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, Mr. Meyers.
</P>
<P>
   With the injuries and inconsistencies, the young defense,
depleted offense and sporadic kicking game, the Bruins now
epitomize the ``just win'' survival mantra Al Davis made famous.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's formula is different each week: fourth-quarter offense at
Arizona, overtime defense against Oregon, a trick play at Cal and a
turnover against Stanford. But it's also the same. The offense
sputters for a few quarters, then shifts to a higher gear for the
decisive touchdown. The defense bends, bends, bends like the
central section of Pacific Coast Highway, then makes a
game-altering play.
</P>
<P>
   How long will the equation hold? Not long. The defense is too
young: Three of UCLA's top 21 players Saturday were seniors, and
those demographics won't change in the next month. The Bruins can't
rely on goal-line stands and late-game turnovers each week. Perhaps
next year but not now.
</P>
<P>
   To finish unbeaten, the offense must carry them.
</P>
<P>
   And not the offense we've seen in recent weeks. For a variety of
reasons, Cade McNown and Co. sputtered against Oregon, Cal and,
yes, Stanford. To survive and advance in their 11-round,
single-elimination tournament _ seven down, four remaining _ the
Bruins will require a series of 35- and 40-point performances.
</P>
<P>
   That won't be easy considering the weather in Corvallis and
Seattle and the USC defense. But the load lightened a bit when
tailback DeShaun Foster returned from a sprained knee to spark the
fourth-quarter comeback against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Foster gives the Bruins a big-play dimension tailbacks Jermaine
Lewis and Keith Brown cannot duplicate. As the best receiver of the
trio, his presence unlocks a drawer of screen and misdirection pass
plays necessary to keep blitzing defenses at bay.
</P>
<P>
   How ironic that it took the Pac-10's worst defense (Stanford) to
expose UCLA's lone offensive shortcoming. The Cardinal is as slow
as it is young, and the teams it cannot stop _ Oregon, for
instance, and Arizona State _ have game-breaking speed at receiver
and tailback.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bruins aren't particularly fast, especially without
receiver Freddie Mitchell. Brown is powerful and shifty but not
speedy. He runs through holes in the defense, but he rarely runs
PAST the defense. Receivers Danny Farmer and Brian Poli-Dixon have
what coaches call game speed: They run better against an opponent
than against a stopwatch _ but they are, to some extent, products
of the system.
</P>
<P>
   Foster doesn't have sprinter speed. He's no Justin Fargas, Chad
Morton or Skip Hicks. But his vision and power make him faster than
he is. He sees holes quickly, thus gaining a half-step edge on the
defense. Nor is he slowed by arm tackles. Defenses have to be
cognizant of his every step and that makes the other Bruins seem a
split-second faster.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA awoke Sunday to find itself No. 3 in the writers' poll and
No. 4 in the coaches' poll, two spots lower than last week.
Contrary to popular coach-speak, a win, apparently, is not a win.
Style counts.
</P>
<P>
   But at this point, it makes little difference. The Bruins have a
difficult closing month and their goal remains unchanged: Just win
and the strength-of-schedule rating should be enough to secure a
Fiesta Bowl invitation. &QL;

the option. After Sailer missed badly from 53 yards, trying a
50-yarder was questionable. And 12 penalties? Grade: C+

 CHRON - CANCER BOX  
 HOW TO LEND YOUR SUPPORT TO CO-WORKER FACING DEATH  &HT;     BY Ilana DeBare 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Is one of your co-workers or employees faced with a
life-threatening illness? Here are some suggestions for how  &LR; to
help them:
<P>
   _Take your cues from the ill worker. Some people want a lot of
support from co-workers; others prefer to handle their illnesses
privately.
</P>
<P>
   _If you're this person's supervisor, sit down with them and find
out their plans and preferences. What kind of benefits will they
need? What kind of schedule and workload will they be able to
handle? How much health information do they want to share with you
and with other employees?
</P>
<P>
   _Don't reduce the person's responsibilities without consulting
them. Some people with serious illnesses find it very important to
continue working: It's one part of their life where they still feel
in control.
</P>
<P>
   _Feel free to offer health information if the person seems
interested, but don't shove your personal advice or ``cure'' down
his or her throat.
</P>
<P>
   _Find out if your company allows employees to donate their
unused sick leave to a colleague with a major illness.
</P>
<P>
   _Ask the ill worker if he or she would like to appoint someone
in the office as a ``point person'' to coordinate support and
provide updates to the rest of the office on the ill person's
health.
</P>
<P>
   _Offer to help in concrete ways. Some ideas: Send meals. Raise
money from co-workers for home-delivered restaurant meals. Help
with child care. Do errands or laundry. Provide rides to doctors'
appointments. The important thing is communication, so you can find
out what your colleague needs or wants.
</P>
<P>
   _Don't pressure the sick person to be cheerful or heroic.
Comments like ``Cheer up'' or ``You're so brave'' can make people
feel obligated to put on a facade of happiness.
</P>
<P>
   _Educate yourself and other employees. Many people still have
out-of-date stereotypes about cancer, AIDS and other diseases. You
can obtain pamphlets and speakers from groups like the American
Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   _See if your company has an employee assistance program, which
can provide professional counseling to individuals or groups on how
to deal with illness at work.
</P>
<P>
   _Don't forget the caregivers. Taking care of a sick partner,
child or parent can be as draining as the illness itself. Employees
who have seriously ill family members may also need support from
their supervisors and colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Want more information? The American Cancer Society offers
excellent written materials such as ``When Someone You Work With
Has Cancer.'' See its Web site at  &LR; www.cancer.org &LR;  or call (800)
227-2345 for a copy. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Other health groups like the San Francisco AIDS Foundation also
offer brochures and guest speakers on illness at work. And the book
``When Life Becomes Precious,'' by Elise NeeDell Babcock, includes
a chapter on dealing with cancer in the workplace.

<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ Building on his background as a popular
Democratic mayor of this Sunbelt city, Martin Chavez would like to
picture himself as New Mexico's future governor. But with his
wire-rimmed glasses and the beleaguered status of Democrats in the
region, political cartoonists might sketch him as a New Mexican
spotted owl.
</P>
<P>
   With Tuesday's election, Democratic governors in the interior
West risk falling in status from endangered to nearly extinct.
</P>
<P>
   In the 14-state area bounded by the Sierra Nevadas on the West
and the Missouri and Arkansas Rivers on the East, 11 of the
governors are Republicans. In the Republican-led states that have
races, Democrats are not expected to make inroads. In the three
states with Democratic governors, Colorado, Nebraska and Nevada,
Republican candidates approach the elections with leads in opinion
polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Rocky Mountain area, it's tough, we just don't have the
kind of representation we used to,'' Roy Romer, Colorado's governor
and chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said last week,
while campaigning in Colorado for Gail Schoettler, the Democratic
candidate in the race to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, when Romer was first elected governor in 1986, the
Western Governors' Association was a Democratic club. Fifteen years
ago, only two states in the 14-state region, North Dakota and South
Dakota, had Republican governors.
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts attribute the change to ``the Valhalla
syndrome'' _ white conservatives fleeing social strife in
California and Texas for a low-crime, mountain paradise. In
Colorado, for every Democrat who moved to the state in the last
decade, two Republicans did. Evenly balanced only a decade ago,
voter registration in Colorado now favors the Republicans by
130,000 voters.
</P>
<P>
   Here in New Mexico, there are 60 percent more registered
Democrats than Republicans. But the governor, Gary Johnson, is a
Republican, and four members of the five-member congressional
delegation are Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a real change in New Mexico, we are becoming
more Republican in voting,'' said Chris Garcia, who has taught
political science at the University of New Mexico for the last 29
years. ``The people coming in from California and Texas are a lot
more conservative, more affluent, more likely to support the
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was speaking at the end of a campus forum, featuring the
two contenders, Chavez and Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the clearest philosophical choice between two
competing visions of government,'' the political scientist
continued. ``Martin Chavez is in the classical mold of New Deal
government and programs. Gary Johnson, in contrast, hews not only
to the traditional Republican view of low taxes, but extends into
libertarianism.''
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, Ms. Schoettler, who is the state's lieutenant
governor, often plays down her party affiliation and offers a
centrist, pragmatic approach. Her Republican opponent, Bill Owens,
is the state treasurer, and he offers white-collar, Christian
conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   In a measure of shifts in Colorado, The Denver Post, once the
state's liberal voice, endorsed Owens and almost all Republicans
running for Congress, including Bob Greenlee, the candidate to
represent the 2nd District, which includes Boulder. In the Senate
race, The Post editorial board endorsed Ben Nighthorse Campbell,
the Republican, spurning Democratic candidate Dottie Lamm, its
former columnist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a massive movement of people into Colorado and
New Mexico from California, and that has changed the political
complexion of those states,'' said Federico Pena, a Democrat and
former member of the Clinton Cabinet. Mayor of Denver in the
mid-1980s, Pena returned to Denver this fall to be an investment
banker, deflecting appeals from some Colorado Democrats that he run
for statewide office.
</P>
<P>
   In Nevada, the other interior Western state with a Democratic
governor, polls indicate that Kenny Guinn, the Republican
candidate, has a small edge over the Democrat, Jan Jones. In a
state where party registration is evenly split, Ms. Jones was mayor
of Las Vegas, Nevada's largest city. Guinn has been a banker, the
president of a gas corporation and a superintendent of schools.
</P>
<P>
   In Nebraska, Mike Johanns, the mayor of Lincoln and a
Republican, is leading strongly in polls against Bill Hoppner, a
Democratic lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, Dick Wadhams, campaign manager for Owens, said of the
shifts he has seen in recent decades: ``The generation of Democrats
that dominated the Rockies in the '70s and '80s has basically come
and gone. The West is becoming more conservative in its outlook.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; MANY FACTORS CAN INFLUENCE HIRING DECISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I worked for an insurance company for 10 years as a regular
employee and a supervisor. I left a year ago because the director
and assistant director of my unit were both wishy-washy managers
with no backbone.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I learned that the director was leaving the company
for good. I applied for his job. Now I hear that the assistant
director is being promoted  &LR; in &LR; to that job, even though I have
stronger educational credentials and many of my former co-workers
thought I should have gotten the position. Is this fair?
</P>
<P>
   A: It may very well be that you're more qualified for this job
than the assistant director.
</P>
<P>
   But there may be more to this picture than meets the eye.
Company executives may see some unrealized potential in the
assistant director _ for instance, management experience or
leadership skills that are more relevant than educational
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   They may also have felt loyal to an internal candidate and
chosen him over an ``outsider.''
</P>
<P>
   There's even the possibility they may actually &LR;  like &LR; 
(CQ) &LR; wishy-washy managers who don't challenge edicts. In that case,
you wouldn't have been a good fit in this job.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I'd advise you to forget about this company and move on
with your career and life. Stop nursing old resentments and turn
your attention to finding an employer who will truly appreciate
your skills and energy.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &QL; 
 &LR; Q: I work for a startup firm that was having serious financial
problems in 1997. Each salaried employee was given the following
choice: Work for stock options in lieu of a regular paycheck or
leave the company. This arrangement lasted for three months, until
the company regained its financial footing. It is now more than a
year later, but we still haven't been paid for those three months.
What can we do?
</P>
<P>
   A: Stock options are terrific as a bonus or benefit on top of
your regular salary.
</P>
<P>
   But they're not so great as a replacement for your salary. In
fact, that violates state and federal labor laws.
</P>
<P>
   Employers are required to pay the equivalent of minimum wage to
all their workers, salaried or hourly. They are also generally
required to pay their staff with cash or a check _ not with
groceries, merchandise coupons or stock options.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've always got to pay at least minimum wage, and stock
options are not minimum wage,'' said Jeff Wohl, an employment
lawyer with Orrick Herrington &AMP; Sutcliffe in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing wrong with your company trying to use options
to lower its payroll costs. Startups do this a lot. But the correct
approach would have been to pay very  &LR; low salaries _ and provide
options as a substitute for the higher paycheck that employees
could be drawing elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   What can you do? Even if you voluntarily agreed to accept the
options instead of a salary, you can still file a claim for unpaid
wages with the California labor commissioner at (415) 557-7878. But
you should move quickly: The labor code has a two-year statute of
limitations on oral contracts.
</P>
<P>
   You should also be aware that the company was only required to
pay you minimum wage. So the commissioner would probably award you
just three months' worth of minimum-wage paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Are three months of minimum-wage paychecks worth creating a
confrontational situation with your employer? That's up to you.
</P>
<P>
   If you're generally unhappy and ready to move on, it's probably
worth filing a claim. But if you're happy at this job and want to
advance at the company, it may be best to keep quiet &LR;  mum &LR; , hope
you make some money off the options someday, and write this episode
off as a learning experience.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: My friend works in a well-known consumer electronics store.
His pay is based solely on sales commissions, although the company
pays him minimum wage for any week that his commissions don't add
up to the equivalent of a minimum-wage paycheck. My question
involves overtime. The company often asks my friend to come in
before his shift starts or stay after it's over. But they don't pay
him overtime. Is this legal?
</P>
<P>
   A: In most cases, California companies are required to pay
overtime to all nonexempt employees who put in more than 40 hours
in a week.
</P>
<P>
   But state labor law gets pretty complicated when it comes to
salespeople who are paid on a commission basis. Here's the story,
according to Tom Grogan, assistant chief of the California Division
of Labor Standards Enforcement:
</P>
<P>
   _Salespeople are not entitled to overtime if they spend more
than half their work time away from their employer's place of
business.
</P>
<P>
   _Salespeople are not entitled to overtime if more than half
their pay is in the form of commissions, and if their earnings
amount to at least 1.5 times the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   The first scenario covers traveling travelling salespeople &LR;  who
spend most of their time out in the field. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The second scenario applies to your friend. He is paid
entirely in commissions, so he meets that criteria for overtime
exemption. Does he meet the criteria of being paid 1.5 times the
minimum wage? That probably varies from week to week, depending on
his sales.
</P>
<P>
   The California minimum wage is $5.75 per hour, so 1.5 times the
minimum wage would amount to $345 for a 40-hour week.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose your friend had a terrific week and earned $700. He'd
clearly be making too much money to qualify for overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
   But suppose he had a crummy week and earned just $300. Then he
would be entitled to overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
   If your friend wants help figuring out his legal situation, he
could call the California labor commissioner's office at (415)
557-7878. Or he could call the Employment Law Center, which offers
free legal advice to low-income workers at (415) 864-8208.

 CHRON - STREET SMARTS   Tiny BroadVision Poised to Be Big Winner at the Small-Cap Table 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Now that small-cap stocks are seeing the light of day, BroadVision
could lead the return of the Lilliputians.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the Redwood City concern has been overlooked
by Wall Street, but now BroadVision is starting to grab attention.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it's an Internet-related play that is already
making money, has met or beat Wall Street consensus earnings
estimates since going public and appears to be taking the lead in a
new category of enterprise software tied to the World Wide Web. The
company's core product, dubbed ``extended relationship management
software,'' is business software that links companies with their
customers over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in this space before it was a space,'' says  &LR; 
claims  &LR; BroadVision Chief Financial Officer Randall Barton. Of
course, ``space'' is Valley-speak for business segment. BroadVision
fans say it could possess some of the makings of becoming another
PeopleSoft or Siebel Systems, only it may boast a Yahoo! &LR;  kicker to
boot. Now, that description may wreak of hyperbole, but that's the
kind of thinking it takes to win big at the small-cap table.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's the view of Will Edwards, chief investment
officer of Palo Alto Investors, a private investment partnership
that concentrates on micro-cap stocks. Definitions vary, but most
investors consider stocks with market-caps below $1 billion as
small-caps. And Edwards' firm considers market-caps below $350
million as micro-caps. BroadVision is no longer a micro-cap with a
valuation of $363 million.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards' fund has held as many 600,000 shares of BroadVision and
currently owns slightly more than 300,000 shares. The portfolio
manager ``reluctantly sold'' some of his holdings in the stock when
it ran up to $29 a share in July. BroadVision closed Friday at $15,
which is off its secondary offering price of about $16 a share in
March. It went public at $7 in June, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Why did Edwards sell? His hedge fund, like most private
investment partnerships, has particular guidelines that are pledged
to its partners. And Edwards must keep the dollar-value of any
single stock at, or below, 15 percent of the total dollar-value of
his portfolio. After picking up BroadVision shares at under $7
during the fourth quarter of last year, his holdings in the company
grew to the point that they flirted with the 15 percent ceiling, he
says. He since has gone back to the well to buy more BroadVision
shares during the recent market correction.
</P>
<P>
   So, Edwards thinks BroadVision is still poised to rise along
with the potential rebound of the small-cap market. He admits that
picking small-caps has been a rough way to earn a living, but he
believes the tide may be turning in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   Palo Alto Investors' portfolio ``has been flat for the last
couple of years, (but) I think we're seeing signs (of a small-cap
comeback),'' Edwards says.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 small-cap stock index is showing some spunk.
``You've seen a broad-based rebound across almost all sectors, but
especially in small-caps,'' says senior financial analyst Kenneth
Trbovich of the Red Chip Review, a Portland, Ore., research firm
specializing in small-cap stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Since October 8, the Russell 2000 has risen almost 22 percent
compared to about 11 percent for the Dow Jones industrial average
for the same period, Trbovich points out.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the broader Dow began its comeback in September, but
small-cap fans like what they are seeing, Trbovich says.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Edwards predicts mixed results for small-caps for
the remainder of the year due to tax-loss selling, a practice by
fund managers to offset taxes passed on to their investors by
liquidating certain stocks.
</P>
<P>
   However, by the first of the year, Edwards is optimistic that a
small-cap rally could flourish and begin to give BroadVision a
boost.
</P>
<P>
   He is particularly impressed with BroadVision's ability to claim
title to the ``first-mover'' tag, an ever-important designation of
Internet companies that indicates they are leaders in their
segments. Yahoo! &LR;  and Amazon.com are prime examples of
first-movers.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards thinks that BroadVision has taken the first-mover
advantage away from Open Market of Burlington, Mass., which was
Wall Street's darling when it went public. Part of the reason for
BroadVision's undervaluation, in his opinion, has been that
investors mistakenly bet on Open Market as the early winner of the
``one-to-one electronic commerce'' software race, he says. Open
Market closed Friday at about $6 a share, well of  &LR; off its 52-week
high of $29.13.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a local company take on strong competition and
win,'' Edwards says.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, small-caps stocks often have lower valuations for
good reasons. Among other risks, BroadVision has been criticized by
an investment research company for certain accounting practices
involving acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   But Edwards, who relies on his own research, contends that the
practices in question are neither misleading nor detrimental to the
company. What's more, he cautions that investing in smaller stocks,
in general, takes some fortitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick to picking micro-caps is being able to handle
illiquidity. That's the least efficient segment of the market,''
Edwards notes.
</P>
<P>
   And where there is inefficiency, there is opportunity.

HURRICANE DEATH TOLL: 1,000 AND RISING IN CENTRAL AMERICA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla.)  (Eds: SUBS throughout to update, recast, add quotes.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Intense and widespread flooding in the wake of Hurricane
Mitch has killed more than 1,000 people in Central America, with
hundreds more still missing, their villages buried under huge
mudslides, relief and government officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In northwestern Nicaragua, more than 360 bodies entombed
overnight by one such avalanche were recovered during the day from
settlements at the foot of the Casita Volcano, near Posoltega,
about 45 miles northwest of Nicaragua, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing rainfall and extensive damage to roads and bridges
hampered relief efforts all over Nicaragua and Honduras, the
countries most severely affected by the powerful late-season storm.
Some residents were evacuated from the area around Posoltega when
rivers began rising late last week, but officials said they
expected the death toll in the area to rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some communities were completely destroyed,'' said Leonora
Rivera, a spokeswoman for the Nicaraguan Red Cross. ``The number of
dead will increase considerably once it stops raining and we can
get into isolated areas,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, Nicaragua's Minister of Defense, Pedro Joaquin
Chamorro Barrios, said, ``Between 1,000 and 1,500 may have died''
when mudslides on the slopes of the volcano came crashing down on
peasant villages at the bottom. ``We are dealing with a national
tragedy, which all of Nicaragua is mourning.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, areas east of Managua have been inundated by
rampaging flood waters, driving thousands from their homes. Lake
Managua and Lake Nicaragua, normally separated by a narrow strip of
land, have risen so much and so rapidly that they have merged,
leaving the town of Tipitapa and sections of the Pan-American
Highway under several feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not just this country, but all of Central America is cut
off,'' President Arnoldo Aleman of Nicaragua said in a televised
address in which he urged vulnerable people to seek shelter on high
ground. His Honduran counterpart, Carlos Flores, found himself
trapped in San Pedro Sula, an industrial city of 500,000 people,
cut off from the capital by flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in both countries said they were having difficulties
obtaining reliable death counts from affected zones. Normal
communications have been severed, and many residents have fled to
other areas on their own, leading Juan Navarro, a spokesman for
Aleman, to caution that ``there is a lot of anarchy'' in the
estimates being reported in local press accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot yet specify with certainty the magnitude of the
disaster and the number of dead,'' Aleman said before declaring
three days of national mourning Sunday night in remembrance of what
he would only estimate as ``hundreds'' of fatalities. ``But I
believe that since the earthquake of 1972, we have not suffered so
much loss of human life as the misfortune experienced in recent
days.'' The quake destroyed much of Managua and killed as many as
5,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   With sustained winds of up to 180 mph at its peak, Mitch was by
far the strongest storm of the 1998 hurricane season. But the bulk
of the damage has occurred as it diminished in recent days from a
rare Category 5 storm, the most severe on the Saffir-Simpson scale,
to a tropical depression stalled over the Gulf of Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   For several days, a strong front over the Gulf of Mexico
prevented the storm from pushing northward, thereby sparing Cancun
and the Yucatan Peninsula, which had been directly in the storm's
original path. As a result, heavy rains have fallen ceaselessly for
nearly a week not just in Honduras and Nicaragua, but throughout
Guatemala and El Salvador, both of which have also declared states
of national emergency, and in Belize.
</P>
<P>
   In some parts of Central America, rainfall exceeding two feet
was recorded in a single 24-hour period. With rivers already
overflowing in several nations, the National Hurricane Center here
on Sunday was predicting up to 10 more inches of rain for the
northern half of Central America, which was sure to worsen the
crisis. A spokesman said Sunday night that the situation was too
chaotic to estimate rainfall for Monday, adding that the center
expected the rains to ease considerably overnight.
</P>
<P>
   In Tegucigalpa, capital of Honduras and home to nearly a million
people, the raging waters of the Choluteca River swept away entire
neighborhoods over the weekend, as well as cars, trucks, trees,
power lines and livestock. More than 130 people were reported to
have drowned, and as residents fled or sought safety on roofs,
police reported that looters were raiding stores and homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The capital has been leveled,'' Mayor Cesar Castellanos said.
``Blocks and blocks of middle-class and poor neighborhoods, shops _
they have all been completely demolished.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Later Sunday, Castellanos and three other people were reported
to have been killed when their helicopter crashed during a flight
to inspect damage and repair efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In Guatemala, a light plane, said by local officials in the
province of Quetzaltenango to be the property of an American
missionary group, also crashed in heavy rain, and a dozen
passengers were reported killed.
</P>
<P>
   The lightly populated Bay Islands, a favorite haunt of divers
about 30 miles off the northern coast of Honduras, appear to have
been especially hard hit. Over the weekend, a television crew flew
over the islands of Guanuja and Roatan, isolated from the mainland
for nearly a week, and filmed scenes of devastation: houses, hotels
and palm trees flattened and boats strewn about like toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forces of nature are hammering us in every inch of
national territory,'' said the commander of the Honduran Armed
Forces, Gen. Mario Hung Pacheco.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Rodolfo Pacheco, chief of the Honduran Air Force, said:
``This is a catastrophe beyond measure. It's incredible. The entire
nation is in danger.''

TENNYSON LEADS UCLA UPSET OF HOOSIERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ McKinley Tennyson cries during practice, the pain
from his quadriceps and hamstring is so great.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on Sunday, in his first soccer match since Oct. 16, it was
the UCLA forward making Indiana cry.
</P>
<P>
   Tennyson, who pronounced himself at 70 percent, scored and
assisted Seth George on the game-winner to lift the third-ranked
Bruins to a 2-1 victory over the No.1-ranked Hoosiers in the final
of UCLA's annual Pacific Soccer Classic.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (13-2) won their tournament for the 10th time and
beat the Hoosiers (16-2) for the third time in three meetings. The
last time, Tennyson scored to give his team the national title.
</P>
<P>
   This match might not have had as much riding on it, but it meant
so much to Tennyson, a sophomore forward, who was named to the
all-tournament team.
</P>
<P>
   First, he's an Indiana native, born and reared in Indianapolis.
Playing against the Hoosiers naturally motivates him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we meet Indiana, the No.1 program in the country, you
have to come out and play,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, it didn't appear he would get the chance because
this season hasn't been so kind to him. He pulled a hamstring
muscle three weeks ago and strained his quadriceps a week later.
</P>
<P>
   Since playing for a few minutes against UC Irvine on Oct. 16,
Tennyson hadn't seen the game pitch. He missed the loss to Cal
State Fullerton and the wins over Sacramento State and St. Mary's,
the latter on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, practice has been excruciating.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still limping around,'' George said. ``He was really
hurt. He was crying in practice, just trying to rise above it.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that kept Tennyson going was he wanted to play against
some old friends. Indiana's Matt Fundenberger and he were teammates
on Lebanon North Central High's 1996 state-championship team. Plus,
Tennyson and Hoosier Matt Garcia played together on the U.S.
under-20 national team.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA coach Sigi Schmid also heads the under-20 squad, so he
knows what Tennyson can do. But last week, when Tennyson could have
played, Schmid held him out because he was out of shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `You're gonna take a week to 10 days and get back
in fitness,''' Schmid said.
</P>
<P>
   Tennyson actually was ready on Friday, when the tournament
began, but Schmid decided to hold him out until Sunday because the
risk of injury in the cold night air was too great. Besides, there
was the likely Indiana matchup Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Tennyson played about 20 minutes. Not long after he entered, he
took a Pete Vagenas pass in the 37th minute and gave the Bruins a
1-0 lead when he headed down the ball off Indiana goalie T.J.
Hannig, who came into the match having given up just four goals all
season.
</P>
<P>
   Tennyson gave the Bruins the lead for good in the 50th minute
when he passed ahead to George, who beat Hannig one-on-one for his
12th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed in that second goal. We lost our
composure,'' Indiana coach Jerry Yeagley said. ``I credit Seth. He
beat his man.''
</P>
<P>
   In between, Indiana tied the score without trying. Two minutes
after Tennyson had put the Bruins ahead, Dema Kovalenko booted a
ball forward that bounced over UCLA goalie Nick Rimando and into
the goal.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't enough. Tennyson exulted as he ran around the field,
shouting at many of the 3,155 fans. The pain seemed far away at
that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to prove that I'm still here,'' he said, ``and I want
to get back into the swing of things. I try to rise for the big
game.''
