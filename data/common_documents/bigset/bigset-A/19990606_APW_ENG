<HEADLINE> Graf, McEnroe To Team at Wimbledon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Steffi Graf will team up with John McEnroe to play  
mixed doubles at Wimbledon. The pair will get a wild card 
invitation from the All England Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``John asked me and I said yes,'' Graf said after winning the  
French Open on Saturday. ``I had to promise him that I would give 
it my all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steffi Graf will turn 30 on June 14 and 40-year-old McEnroe, who  
won the mixed doubles here in 1977, now works as a commentator for 
NBC television and plays on the seniors tour. 
</P>

	 *FAMILIAR CLOTHING:* In honor of the four musketeers who brought  
France its first Davis Cup victory, officials for Sunday's final 
dressed in identical outfits to those Rene Lacoste wore on the 
tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Jean Brorotra, Jacques Brugnon and Henri Cochet,  
Lacoste helped bring the cup to France back in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
	For the men's final, the umpire and linesmen were all outfitted  
by the Lacoste clothing company, run by Lacoste's son, Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roland Garros stadium has a special relationship with the  
musketeers as it was built in 1928 to host the team's defense of 
the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ALL BETS ARE ON:* Andrei Medvedev lost the French Open final  
Sunday but he still won $55 just the same. The Ukrainian made a bet 
with some of his German friends that he would be back in the top 50 
by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Medvedev was ranked No. 100 at the start of the tournament but  
after making it to the final, his ranking will be in the 20s by 
next week. Medvedev joked about his bet paying off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should try another bet and try to get to the top 20,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On his strategy of trying to make it in the top 10, Medvedev  
referred again to his girlfriend, Anke Huber, and his improvement 
since they started dating. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looks like I just have to stick to Anke and make sure she  
doesn't leave me,'' he said. ``Then I will be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TALENTLESS AGASSI:* After winning the French Open and a career  
Grand Slam on Sunday, Andre Agassi confided that he thought he 
didn't have many other talents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no rhythm whatsoever, no musical ability, no ear for  
language. I have very few talents,'' said a modest Agassi. ``I 
can't even stand up on roller skates.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ONES TO WATCH:* Names to remember for the future: Lourdes  
Dominguez Lino of Spain and Guillermo Coria of Argentina. They won 
the girls and boys singles finals of the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Lino beat France's hope for the future, Stephanie Foretz, 6-4,  
6-4. On the boy's side, it was an all Argentine final when Coria 
ousted David Nalbandian 6-4, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Past winners of the French Open junior tournaments have gone on  
to do well. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1990s, the winners have included men's finalist Andrei  
Medvedev and on the women's side, Australian Open winner Martina 
Hingis and runner-up Amelie Mauresmo. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, eight players have won both junior and senior  
singles titles at Roland Garros, including Ivan Lendl and Mats 
Wilander.

<HEADLINE> Hurdles for Clinton Paid-Leave Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's proposal to let states tap  
into their unemployment funds to offer paid leave for new parents 
faces significant obstacles, benefit analysts say, because states 
likely will be reluctant to draw on accounts reserved for 
out-of-work people. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the biggest concerns: What would happen if the  
unemployment rate, now the lowest in nearly three decades, 
escalated sharply and depleted state benefit accounts now flush 
with cash? 
</P>
<P>
	``The business cycle does occur, and good times are followed by  
tougher times economically,'' said Emily DeRocco, director of the 
Interstate Conference of Employment Security Agencies, an 
association of state employment officials. 
</P>
<P>
	DeRocco predicted that states, which individually would have to  
adopt Clinton's plan, will think ``very, very carefully'' before 
adding new parents to their unemployment rolls. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act has eased the strain on  
workers who must care for new babies by guaranteeing up to 12 
weeks' unpaid leave. But additional help is needed for those who 
cannot afford to take time off without pay, Clinton said in a 
speech two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The president announced he had directed the Labor Department to  
write new regulations letting states provide unemployment benefits 
to parents of newborn or newly adopted children who choose to take 
the leave guaranteed under the 1993 law. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 6 million parents could be eligible for such programs  
each year nationwide, administration officials estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economy has been good and unemployment has been down and  
states have benefited,'' said Grace Kilbane, director of the 
federal Unemployment Insurance Service. ``If states have very 
healthy balances in their (unemployment) funds, then they're in a 
good position if they want to broaden eligibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates of adding new parents to the unemployment rolls in  
Maryland, Massachusetts, Vermont and Washington requested the 
federal clearance. Their proposals generally would offer full 
unemployment benefits, averaging $200 a week nationally, during 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's endorsement has sparked hope that state legislatures  
might now take the idea more seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hits a chord with people. People understand it. ... The  
best way to take care of your family is to do it yourself,'' said 
Vermont state Sen. Jan Backus, a Democrat who has sponsored 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	An economic expansion -- the longest in the nation's peacetime  
history -- has boosted tax collection and padded many states' 
unemployment accounts beyond what is normally kept in reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	The Massachusetts account, for example, is approaching $1.8  
billion, enough to pay benefits for at least two years. Labor 
unions, women's groups and others pushing for paid leave there have 
calculated it would cost $150 million a year, or about $1.25 per 
worker per week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our view is, can you afford a cup of coffee for your employees  
per week so they can have the peace of mind?'' said Monica Halas, 
senior employment attorney at Greater Boston Legal Services. 
</P>
<P>
	Employers who pay the taxes that fill unemployment coffers do  
not see it that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got a bit of a bait and switch here,'' said Dan Danner,  
vice president for public policy at the National Federation of 
Independent Business. ``An attitude by some ... is let's expand the 
programs to fit the taxes, and if we have a surplus, heaven forbid 
you give it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to state taxes, employers must pay a federal  
unemployment tax of 0.8 percent on the first $7,000 of each 
workers' wages. That money goes, in part, to a bailout fund that 
makes loans to states when their own accounts prove insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
	The $7.4 billion federal account has no loans outstanding. But  
during a recession earlier this decade, six states and the District 
of Columbia had to borrow $1.9 billion, and in the 1980s, borrowing 
by 32 states exceeded $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Worse, the bailout account went bankrupt in 1977, and money from  
the general Treasury had to be loaned to states so they could pay 
unemployment benefits. To replace that, lawmakers added a 0.2 
percent surcharge to the federal unemployment tax, which is not 
scheduled to expire until 2007. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happens if unemployment goes up? Do you raise payroll  
taxes then, to continue to pay for this?'' Danner said of the 
proposals for paid leave. ``Once you create the program you can't 
take it away, or at least it's politically difficult.''

<HEADLINE> Europe Has Faith in Damaged Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- You can't see it or stuff it in your wallet, and  
it exists as little more than a bookkeeping entry for governments 
and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Europe's regional currency, the euro, remains a potent  
symbol of regional unity despite a 12 percent plunge in its value 
against the U.S. dollar since its January debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank statements in Finland, supermarket signs in Portugal, menus  
in France -- all of them list prices in euros, along with equivalent 
figures in markkaa, escudos and francs. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven countries formed the common currency in an effort to  
create a borderless economy and enhance their global 
competitiveness. By harmonizing their economies, the group also 
hoped to create a worthy rival to the dollar as a reserve currency 
and move closer toward the ultimate goal of political unification. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro began its rocky descent almost from the outset,  
tumbling from $1.1789 on Jan. 4 to $1.0318 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the causes for its weakness have been economic torpor in  
Germany and Italy, fears of a widening conflict in the Balkans, and 
public disputes over the wisdom of interest rate cuts by the 
European Central Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, unexpectedly robust economic growth in the  
United States has strengthened the dollar, reinforcing perceptions 
of the fledgling euro as a financial runt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Confidence has been dented almost since day one,'' says Neil  
Parker, an economist at The Royal Bank of Scotland. ``It will take 
time to repair the damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, popular sentiment in favor of the euro remains strong  
in many parts of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	In an international poll published last week in the Italian  
newspaper La Stampa, 77 percent of those interviewed in Italy said 
the euro was a good thing -- an increase of 10 percent from last 
November, before the euro was even launched. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll showed Spain with the second-highest approval rating at  
71 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a good thing given one condition: that it results in the  
elimination of borders in Europe,'' said Roberto Morici, 33, a 
consultant in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	The nations using the euro are Austria, Belgium, Germany,  
Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, 
Spain. Britain, Denmark and Sweden have opted to stay out, for now. 
</P>
<P>
	The countries in ``euroland'' are all on track to replace their  
own national currencies with the euro in 2002, even though some 
people have taken little notice of it. And despite its 
disappointing performance, no regional leader has called for a 
withdrawal from the common currency. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a very sad day ... if one considered longer-term  
political issues in light of shorter-term fluctuations in financial 
markets,'' said Charles Goodhart, an economics professor at The 
London School of Economics. 
</P>
<P>
	Like all freely traded currencies, the euro's value reflects the  
degree of confidence investors have in it. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro got a brief boost from the abrupt resignation on March  
11 of Germany's former finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine, who had 
argued vociferously in favor of lowering European interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	But it faltered after NATO aircraft began bombing targets in  
Yugoslavia on March 24. Economists and currency analysts say the 
euro's value has eroded by as much as three cents against the 
dollar due to fears that fighting in Kosovo might spill over into 
neighboring countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav and NATO generals met for a second day Sunday to hash  
out the details for a Serb troop pullout from Kovoso, delaying a 
hoped-for end to NATO air raids. 
</P>
<P>
	Many euro-watchers point to sluggish growth in Germany and Italy  
-- which together account for half the region's economic output -- as 
the underlying reason for the currency's continued weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is, do you believe in European growth? It's  
all about fundamental economics,'' said David Bloom, senior 
currency strategist at HSBC in London. 
</P>
<P>
	A weak euro has its advantages, enabling euroland's exporters to  
sell their products more cheaply than competing goods denominated 
in other currencies. That, in turn, should help rekindle growth and 
enable Europe's laggards to catch up with its sprinters -- Ireland, 
Spain and Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
	Schering AG, a German pharmaceuticals company, says the weakened  
euro should help generate stronger overseas sales of its 
diagnostics drugs, which are used as imaging agents for X-rays. 
Sales of diagnostics depend heavily on competitive pricing, 
explained Kemalettin Uenal, a currency manager for the Berlin-based 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The soft euro also underscores the need for economic reforms,  
especially those making it easier for the region's companies to 
hire and fire workers, said Hung Tran, chief economist at Rabobank 
of the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Until European growth picks up, the euro is likely to continue  
slipping toward parity with the dollar, a level seen as 
psychologically worrisome for the common currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, many Europeans are confident enough to put money of  
the euro's long-term viability. 
</P>
<P>
	Juha Paunonen, chief executive of a Helsinki consulting firm  
called HTML Software, is investing $700 for software to make his 
accounting system euro-compatible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imagine if the New York Stock Exchange started using the  
British pound,'' he said. ``You couldn't have a bigger change.''

<HEADLINE> Kurds Warn About Ocalan's Fate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Like many of his fellow Kurds, a  
shopkeeper named Emin says he has been abiding by a call for peace 
from imprisoned rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan. 
</P>
<P>
	The streets of the largely Kurdish neighborhoods of Istanbul and  
of southeastern Turkey have been quiet as Kurds patiently watch 
Ocalan's trial on charges of treason. But they warn that the court 
will be choosing between war and peace when it decides whether 
Ocalan will hang. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will mean more war, and more death'' if Ocalan is sentenced  
to the gallows, said Emin, who refused to give his full name for 
fear that he could be arrested for speaking out in support of the 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 37,000 people, mostly Kurds, have already died as a  
result of the 15-year struggle between Turkish forces and Ocalan's 
Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK. 
</P>
<P>
	For most of last week, Turks were captivated by images of the  
stocky rebel leader addressing a courtroom on the prison island of 
Imrali, 35 miles south of Emin's impoverished Istanbul neighborhood 
of Gazi. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first public address in Turkey since his rebels took up  
arms, Ocalan called for peace and offered to help bring his 
fighters down from the barren mountains of southeastern Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	``We held out the olive branch,'' Emin said. ``Now it's up to  
them to take it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey dismisses the rebels as terrorists who want to destroy  
the country, and has refused any talks. Many Turks have said 
Ocalan's offer is merely a tactic to avoid a death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	The court hearing Ocalan's case rejected requests Friday from  
his attorneys to invite politicians to testify that he had been 
seeking peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Some have questioned whether the rebel leader, who was  
humiliated when he was abducted by Turkish commandos in February, 
even has enough authority with his rebels to forge a peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan is widely expected to be sentenced to hang. If parliament  
endorses his sentence, he would be the first person executed in 
Turkey since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Turkey's 12 million Kurds have assimilated into Turkish  
society and do not support the rebels. But analysts warn that 
hanging Ocalan would alienate most Kurds from the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would institutionalize the notion of vendetta between Turks  
and Kurds,'' said Baskin Oran, a political scientist at Ankara 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan has warned that his death would be avenged.  
</P>
<P>
	``What will happen if I die?'' he asked the court. ``The  
organization will send out thousands of fighters, and hundreds of 
thousands of people will die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For years, Turkey has portrayed Ocalan as a ruthless killer, and  
it would be difficult for authorities to show any leniency. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkish authorities ``don't accept that there is a war in Turkey  
and they don't accept that there is a Kurdish side,'' said Ragip 
Zarakolu, a columnist for Bakis, a daily that concentrates on the 
Kurdish issue. ``This is their last chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities, however, see the fight in the southeast as a  
struggle against terrorism and view Ocalan's capture as a move that 
is likely to break the back of his organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The court has refused to hear from the families of slain  
guerrillas, but has allowed weeping relatives of Turkish war dead 
to speak about the pain they have suffered. 
</P>
<P>
	Some have attended the trial draped in red Turkish flags. Most  
carry pictures of slain relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guerrillas have mothers too!'' said Kemal, a retired  
construction worker who also refused to give his full name. ``When 
they speak up, they get beaten and arrested; the mothers of the 
Turkish martyrs are given flowers and are on television.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan's trial is scheduled to resume Tuesday, when prosecutors  
are to begin their final statements. Defense lawyers said they will 
ask for a month's suspension to prepare the defense and to allow 
Ocalan to review thousands of pages of material. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers on Sunday complained that the court was actively  
working to foil Ocalan's defense. They have faced endless 
procedural restrictions in court and have only been allowed to meet 
with Ocalan two hours a week with masked security officials 
present. 
</P>
<P>
	They have even had difficulties finding hotels to stay in.

<P>
	WEST ALLIS, Wis. (AP) -- For the second straight CART race, a  
crewmen's helmet may have saved him from serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Ty Manseau, the vent man for Michael Andretti, sustained a  
possible cervical spine injury when he was run over by Andretti 
during a pit stop early in Sunday's Miller Lite 225. 
</P>
<P>
	CART officials said Manseau was awake, alert and had no head  
injury, no broken bones or paralysis. The crewman was transported 
by ambulance to Milwaukee County General Hospital where he 
underwent a CAT scan and X-rays of his neck. Officials said he had 
some bruises and he was released. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 29, during a race in Madison, Ill., Dave Stephens, a  
crewmen for Gil de Ferran, was knocked down during a pit stop. His 
helmet was cracked, but Stephens, who had a mild concussion, was 
treated and released at a St. Louis hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	CART announced Friday it will make helmets for crewmen mandatory  
beginning with the opening practice for the race in Cleveland on 
June 27. Meanwhile, Bell Helmet distributed more than 100 helmets 
to crewmen for Sunday's race without charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally, fuelers and vent men have worn helmets in recent  
years. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NOT YET:* Helio Castro-Neves won the first pole of his CART  
career on Saturday, but his first victory will have to wait for 
another weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro-Neves led the first 14 laps before beginning to slow  
suddenly because of a problem with his turbocharger air pressure, 
known as boost. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not our turn yet,'' said Castro-Neves, a 24-year-old  
Brazilian who gave the crowd a treat on Saturday when he 
enthusiastically celebrated his pole. ``The next one will be.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WELL HEELED:* Carl Hogan, who owns the unsponsored  
Lola-Mercedes Castro-Neves started from the pole Sunday after 
finishing second last week in Madison, Ill., is running the full 
CART schedule on his own money. 
</P>
<P>
	The trucking magnate from St. Louis has only Hogan Racing on the  
sidepods of the car driven by Castro-Neves. But Hogan doesn't want 
anybody feeling sorry for him because he doesn't have a big-dollar 
sponsor in a series in which $10 million budgets are commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, it sort of offends me when I read or hear reporters  
refer to us as a poor underfunded team,'' Hogan said. ``I believe 
our budget is comparable with any single-car effort in CART. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our equipment, frequency of testing, all of that is equal to  
other teams, I believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is a very unusual situation in a sport that generally  
depends on sponsor money to determine how competitive a team can 
be. 
</P>
<P>
	``As to why I continue without a major sponsorship, you really  
can't explain it or justify it rationally,'' Hogan said. ``But it's 
the competition. I just want to beat Chip (Ganassi) and Carl (Haas) 
and Cal (Wells). And, as long as I have that competitive urge, 
we're going to carry on.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TECHNICAL TIDBITS:* Paul Tracy's victory Sunday came in a  
Honda-powered Reynard on Firestone tires. 
</P>
<P>
	For Honda, it was the fourth win in seven starts this season and  
the 35th victory in the 92 races since the Japanese company entered 
CART competition in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 25th consecutive win for Firestone and its 50th  
victory for since the tire company returned to Champ Car 
competition in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OLDEST OVAL:* A lot of people believe the Indianapolis Motor  
Speedway, which opened in 1909 and held its first 500-mile race in 
1911, is the oldest auto racing track in America. 
</P>
<P>
	Those people would be wrong.

<HEADLINE> Casinos Increase Lobbying, Handouts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As a federal panel was wrapping up its study  
of the gambling industry, House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt 
flew to Las Vegas to pick up a $250,000 check from the chairman of 
Mirage casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Democrats and Republicans have made similar fund-raising  
trips since Congress created the gambling commission in 1996. Many 
have taken behind-the-scenes tours of casinos on Las Vegas' famed 
Strip, chatting with blackjack dealers, learning how the security 
staff ferrets out cheaters, or watching how the industry trains its 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	When it comes to influencing legislation, the casinos are not  
leaving anything to chance. 
</P>
<P>
	They have pursued a double strategy of on-location lobbying and  
campaign cash in hopes of solidifying support against some 
recommendations approved by the federal commission that studied the 
impact of gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Gambling Impact Study Commission issues its  
recommendations to Congress, the president, Indian tribes and 
governors on June 18. Among the recommendations it has approved: a 
moratorium on new lotteries and casinos, and legislation to outlaw 
gambling on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say the industry has won over many friends.  
</P>
<P>
	``In Congress right now, it would be a struggle to get any  
anti-gaming thing passed,'' said William Thompson, a professor of 
public administration at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. 
``They've got the bucks and the opposition doesn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks in part to gambling industry supporters on the panel,  
most of the report's dozens of recommendations will be aimed toward 
state government. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to casinos, the commission studied gambling on  
Indian land, aboard riverboats and cruises, at pari-mutuel tracks 
and in state lotteries. Its recommendations include raising the 
betting age to 21, increasing help for addicted gamblers, and 
banning betting on college sports. 
</P>
<P>
	The casinos count on the Republican-controlled Congress to  
protect their interests at the federal level, even though religious 
conservatives are urging the party to crack down on gambling as a 
social ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the industry's champions are Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., whose state is home to a growing casino industry, 
and top House Democrat Gephardt of Missouri, which allows riverboat 
gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott led a group of Senate Republicans in 1997 to the MGM Grand  
in Las Vegas, where they toured an employee training center before 
mingling with donors. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Gephardt and other top House Democrats toured the  
Mirage before joining donors over shrimp and lamb chops at a 
buffet. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt and the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means  
Committee, Charles Rangel of New York, returned last month to meet 
with the chairman of Mirage Resorts, Steve Wynn, and accept his 
$250,000 contribution for House Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy to have widespread support from individuals and  
groups who know how close we are to winning back the House,'' 
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman John Del 
Cecato said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Fahrenkopf, the gambling industry's chief lobbyist and a  
former Republican Party chairman, said touring casinos and mingling 
with their executives help educate lawmakers so they will better 
understand the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the same lines, a former board chairwoman of the Nevada  
Hotel-Motel Association, Rep. Shelley Berkley, D-Nev., has urged 
the casino industry to bring her fellow freshmen to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Gaming Association's lobbying expenses increased  
from $760,000 in 1997 to $860,000 in 1998. The group's other 
lobbyists include former Rep. Dennis Eckert, D-Ohio, and a former 
White House chief of staff, Kenneth Duberstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Since forming a political action committee in December 1995, the  
association has given $194,410 to federal candidates and political 
parties. Some of the individual casinos have given far more. 
Harrah's has contributed more than $1 million since 1995. Mirage 
boosted its giving from $159,800 in 1995-96 to $528,846 in 1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a right to be heard and represented in the halls of  
Congress,'' Fahrenkopf said. ``We want to be players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The support for casinos within the Republican Party is troubling  
to many religious conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will continue to urge my party to turn down donations from  
gambling interests,'' said Republican presidential hopeful Gary 
Bauer, who endorsed the commission's recommendations Friday. ``I 
think inevitably that money corrupts politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., who sponsored the legislation creating  
the commission, said, ``I think people who are very strongly 
pro-family ask, 'How can you take this money?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting concerns about the industry's influence, the  
commission will recommend that states limit how much gambling 
interests can contribute to campaigns for state or local office. 
</P>
<P>
	As in Congress, gambling interests are well entrenched in many  
states to rebuff the commission's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, Indian tribes and the casino industry pumped $88  
million last fall into a referendum on expanding Indian gaming. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, the video poker industry spent millions in  
1998 on behalf of Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jim Hodges. He 
defeated GOP Gov. David Beasley, who called the industry a 
''cancer.''

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A moderately strong earthquake early Sunday  
rattled southern Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador. There were no 
reports of any deaths or damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5.7-magnitude quake occurred about 2:10 a.m. and was  
centered in the Pacific Ocean about 100 miles west of Guatemala 
City, according to reports from the Mexican government news agency, 
Notimex. 
</P>
<P>
	The earthquake caused alarm in hospitals and apartment buildings  
in Chiapas, Mexico's southernmost state, Notimex said. In 
Guatemala, thousands of people ran from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake also was felt in western and central El Salvador,  
including San Salvador, the capital.

	SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- A Swedish man suspected of killing  
two police officers in his home country has been captured by Costa 
Rican police. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Olsson, 26, was arrested Saturday night in Alajuela, 12  
miles northwest of San Jose, where he had rented a home with his 
mother, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Costa Rica has no extradition treaty with Sweden, a  
judge ordered him held for two months in order to determine how to 
resolve the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Olsson allegedly committed a bank robbery in which  
two Swedish policemen were killed. At the time, he was on a weekend 
furlough from prison, where he was serving a six-year term for 
plotting to murder a mother of five. 
</P>
<P>
	The case has received wide media coverage in Sweden, where  
crimes of violence are rare. Only about 30 Swedish officers have 
been killed in the line of duty this century.

	CALI, Colombia (AP) -- Thousands of people marched Sunday in  
Colombia, calling for an end to kidnapping and a peaceful 
settlement to a three-decade civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	The protest came a day after leftist rebels released five  
worshippers who were snatched a week ago, along with more than 100 
others, from a Catholic mass in an upscale Cali neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	About 55 of the churchgoers are still in rebels' hands, along  
with 25 passengers and crew members abducted when the same group 
hijacked an airplane in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia has the highest kidnapping rate in the world, with  
about 1,500 cases reported every year.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's indigenous tribes are  
contracting the lethal AIDS virus at a higher rate than the rest of 
the population, according to a new government report. 
</P>
<P>
	While 0.3 percent of the population of 157 million are infected,  
at least 0.4 percent of Brazil's estimated 330,000 Indians have the 
virus, according to a Ministry of Health report published Sunday in 
the Rio daily O Globo. 
</P>
<P>
	But experts say government statistics are ridiculously low --  
officially there are only 400,000 people infected with the AIDS 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the government has underestimated the number of whites  
infected with AIDS, imagine what it must be among Indians,'' AIDS 
researcher David Uip told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Health officials say Indians are more susceptible to the virus  
because of prostitution, polygamy, unwillingness to use condoms and 
lack of knowledge about the virus. A federal AIDS campaign began 
targeting Indian villages with pamphlets in native languages in 
1998. Educational videos were added in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Next to the United States, Brazil has the highest number of AIDS  
cases in the hemisphere.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) - The Brazilian tax board has fined  
ex-President Fernando Collor de Mello the equivalent of $3.2 
million for income tax evasion, a newspaper reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Collor has been fined for not reporting $940,000 worth of income  
between 1989-1992 and could be criminally charged by the nation's 
attorney general, the Rio daily Jornal do Brasil reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, Collor became the first popularly elected president  
after two decades of military rule. He promised to fight 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was impeached on corruption charges and later resigned in  
1992 after being linked to a massive scheme of kickbacks and 
commissions from public works contracts. The Supreme Court then 
revoked his political rights until 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A fugitive Mexican banker who claims he  
donated the equivalent of $25 million to the governing party's 
campaigns in 1994 in fact contributed far less, according to a 
spokesman for President Ernesto Zedillo. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Cabal Peniche, who is fighting extradition from  
Australia, told The Miami Herald in a letter last month he had made 
a $15 million contribution to the campaign of Luis Donaldo Colosio, 
a candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party who was 
assassinated in March 1994. Cabal said he then added $5 million for 
Zedillo, who replaced Colosio in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The banker also reported contributing $5 million to the 1994  
campaign of Tabasco Gov. Roberto Madrazo. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the Herald released Sunday, Zedillo's spokesman  
said a review of contribution records showed Cabal donated 1 
million pesos to the party in May 1994. The amount at the time was 
equivalent to $285,000 and is now worth $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman, Fernando Lerdo de Tejada, said Zedillo had no  
knowledge of any contribution by Cabal either during his campaign 
or that of Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
	Cabal is accused of bank fraud totaling as much as $700 million  
-- most of it allegedly in fraudulent loans from two banks he owned 
to shell companies he also owned.

<HEADLINE> Texas Quarterback Has Appendectomy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN (AP) -- Texas quarterback Major Applewhite underwent an  
appendectomy early Sunday after complaining of stomach pains. 
</P>
<P>
	Applewhite, coming off a record-setting freshman season playing  
alongside Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams, is expected to miss 
three to four weeks of offseason work. He should be ready for the 
start of fall practice in early August. 
</P>
<P>
	Applewhite told assistant trainer Tom McVan of the pain  
Saturday. When it persisted, Applewhite met McVan at St. David's 
Hospital. Doctors observed him for most of the evening and the 
surgery was performed shortly after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Applewhite, the Big 12 freshman of the year, threw for 2,453  
yards and 18 touchdowns as the Longhorns went 9-3 last season, 
including a Cotton Bowl victory over Mississippi State.

<HEADLINE> Europe Has Faith in Damaged Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- You can't see it or stuff it in your wallet, and  
it exists as little more than a bookkeeping entry for governments 
and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Europe's regional currency, the euro, remains a potent  
symbol of regional unity despite a 12 percent plunge in its value 
against the U.S. dollar since its January debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank statements in Finland, supermarket signs in Portugal, menus  
in France -- all of them list prices in euros, along with equivalent 
figures in markkaa, escudos and francs. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven countries formed the common currency in an effort to  
create a borderless economy and enhance their global 
competitiveness. By harmonizing their economies, the group also 
hoped to create a worthy rival to the dollar as a reserve currency 
and move closer toward the ultimate goal of political unification. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro began its rocky descent almost from the outset,  
tumbling from $1.1789 on Jan. 4 to $1.0318 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the causes for its weakness have been economic torpor in  
Germany and Italy, fears of a widening conflict in the Balkans, and 
public disputes over the wisdom of interest rate cuts by the 
European Central Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, unexpectedly robust economic growth in the  
United States has strengthened the dollar, reinforcing perceptions 
of the fledgling euro as a financial runt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Confidence has been dented almost since day one,'' says Neil  
Parker, an economist at The Royal Bank of Scotland. ``It will take 
time to repair the damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, popular sentiment in favor of the euro remains strong  
in many parts of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	In an international poll published last week in the Italian  
newspaper La Stampa, 77 percent of those interviewed in Italy said 
the euro was a good thing -- an increase of 10 percent from last 
November, before the euro was even launched. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll showed Spain with the second-highest approval rating at  
71 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a good thing given one condition: that it results in the  
elimination of borders in Europe,'' said Roberto Morici, 33, a 
consultant in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	The nations using the euro are Austria, Belgium, Germany,  
Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, 
Spain. Britain, Denmark and Sweden have opted to stay out, for now. 
</P>
<P>
	The countries in ``euroland'' are all on track to replace their  
own national currencies with the euro in 2002, even though some 
people have taken little notice of it. And despite its 
disappointing performance, no regional leader has called for a 
withdrawal from the common currency. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a very sad day ... if one considered longer-term  
political issues in light of shorter-term fluctuations in financial 
markets,'' said Charles Goodhart, an economics professor at The 
London School of Economics. 
</P>
<P>
	Like all freely traded currencies, the euro's value reflects the  
degree of confidence investors have in it. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro got a brief boost from the abrupt resignation on March  
11 of Germany's former finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine, who had 
argued vociferously in favor of lowering European interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	But it faltered after NATO aircraft began bombing targets in  
Yugoslavia on March 24. Economists and currency analysts say the 
euro's value has eroded by as much as three cents against the 
dollar due to fears that fighting in Kosovo might spill over into 
neighboring countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav and NATO generals met for a second day Sunday to hash  
out the details for a Serb troop pullout from Kovoso, delaying a 
hoped-for end to NATO air raids. 
</P>
<P>
	Many euro-watchers point to sluggish growth in Germany and Italy  
-- which together account for half the region's economic output -- as 
the underlying reason for the currency's continued weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is, do you believe in European growth? It's  
all about fundamental economics,'' said David Bloom, senior 
currency strategist at HSBC in London. 
</P>
<P>
	A weak euro has its advantages, enabling euroland's exporters to  
sell their products more cheaply than competing goods denominated 
in other currencies. That, in turn, should help rekindle growth and 
enable Europe's laggards to catch up with its sprinters -- Ireland, 
Spain and Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
	Schering AG, a German pharmaceuticals company, says the weakened  
euro should help generate stronger overseas sales of its 
diagnostics drugs, which are used as imaging agents for X-rays. 
Sales of diagnostics depend heavily on competitive pricing, 
explained Kemalettin Uenal, a currency manager for the Berlin-based 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The soft euro also underscores the need for economic reforms,  
especially those making it easier for the region's companies to 
hire and fire workers, said Hung Tran, chief economist at Rabobank 
of the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Until European growth picks up, the euro is likely to continue  
slipping toward parity with the dollar, a level seen as 
psychologically worrisome for the common currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, many Europeans are confident enough to put money of  
the euro's long-term viability. 
</P>
<P>
	Juha Paunonen, chief executive of a Helsinki consulting firm  
called HTML Software, is investing $700 for software to make his 
accounting system euro-compatible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Imagine if the New York Stock Exchange started using the  
British pound,'' he said. ``You couldn't have a bigger change.''

<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- An older Esmerelda has welcomed the new.  
</P>
<P>
	Gina Lollobrigida, who played the gypsy Esmerelda in a 1956 film  
version of ``The Hunchback of Notre Dame,'' got a standing ovation 
at the world premiere of a new version -- a stage musical by Disney. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian actress was guest of honor at the brand-new,  
sold-out theater Saturday night for the unveiling of the adaptation

</P>
<P>
	The Broadway-style show, produced at a cost of more than $25  
million, marks the first time Disney has put on a new show outside 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the creative team, including Academy Award-winning  
composer Alan Menken and Tony- and Pulitzer Prize-winning director 
James Lapine, is American, the show was translated during 
rehearsals into German. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening night audience, full of local celebrities, gave it  
wild cheers and a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Musical heaven,'' said Helmut Koprian, who came to the  
premiere from Hamburg with his wife.

	Disney has said it would wait to see how the show does in Berlin  
before deciding whether to stage a production in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Japan Bank Execs Said Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Prosecutors on Sunday arrested four former  
executives of a troubled Japanese bank who are suspected of having 
extended questionable loans to an ailing construction company, a 
media report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those taken into custody include Fukutoku Bank's former managing  
director, 58-year-old Mutsuo Higashi, Kyodo News reported, citing 
unnamed prosecution sources. Three lower-level officials also were 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Also served an arrest warrant was Toshio Michiyama, 57, the head  
of the distraught construction firm for his alleged role in 
accepting roughly $8.1 million in shady loans from the bank, Kyodo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in the Osaka Prosecutors Office declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Fukutoku Bank merged with another mid-sized bank based in the  
western city of Osaka last October. 
</P>
<P>
	The product of that merger, Namihaya Bank, received $2.5 billion  
from a pool of government funds earmarked for bailing out troubled 
banks, Kyodo said. 
</P>
<P>
	A month before the merger, bank officials are suspected of  
having provided loans to a paper company set up by the construction 
firm despite knowing that the company was unlikely to be able to 
repay the money, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Racial Suit Divides Boeing Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- A racial discrimination lawsuit that once  
united Boeing's black workers has now divided them, the result of a 
$15 million settlement labeled fair by one side, unjust by the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason I gave up $30,000 is because it didn't give me any  
remedy to what was going on,'' said Kevin Biglow, a Boeing worker 
who opted out of the settlement. ``And you can't buy me off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Racial discrimination concerns in 1996 led to a class action  
lawsuit against Boeing, whose black workers claimed they were 
passed over for promotions and were later threatened for 
complaining about it. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Boeing and attorneys for the plaintiffs reached  
agreement on a consent decree -- which lays out how Boeing would 
avoid racial discrimination in the future -- and the $15 million 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	But since then, accusations of greed and deception have clouded  
what many thought was a triumph for Boeing's black work force. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy centers on a disagreement about the effect the  
consent decree will have on workers facing discrimination at the 
plants and the amount of money people will get from the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates say the consent decree offers real change for workers  
and that those fighting the agreement are only trying to get more 
money out of Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the deal say the decree is worthless and the  
settlement payments not enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics also accuse the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the civil  
rights leader who helped broker the settlement, of accepting a 
payoff from Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing Chairman Phil Condit is accused of directing multimillion  
dollar contracts to two black-owned businesses that may have ties 
to Jackson's Rainbow-PUSH Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's office has denied the allegations, and Boeing has said  
the charges are based on hearsay. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed deal, about 12,900 past and present Boeing  
workers would share $7.3 million. The largest payments would go to 
the more than 200 named plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys representing the workers would get $3.8 million,  
including $750,000 for reviewing the claims and monitoring the 
conditions of the proposed consent decree. 
</P>
<P>
	The remainder would go to Boeing diversity programs. The deal  
calls for Boeing to revamp its Equal Employment Opportunity system, 
implement a nondiscrimination layoff policy, address promotion 
practice complaints and create a system to monitor problems. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge in Seattle has postponed until Sept. 23 a  
hearing to determine if he will approve the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing Wichita employee David Roberts, who supports the  
settlement, said workers need to give the decree a chance to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these people out there that's in this lawsuit, they  
want to basically say, 'We want a million dollars apiece. Let's 
bring Boeing to their knees,''' Roberts said. ``Let's think about 
this. You bring Boeing to its knees, who have you hurt? 
</P>
<P>
	``Boeing's a big company. Boeing would look mighty stupid to put  
anything in writing that they're not prepared to stand by.''

<HEADLINE> Spectator Killed at Baja Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ENSENADA, Mexico (AP) -- A Baja 500 desert racer crashed into a  
crowd of spectators after losing control of his vehicle Saturday, 
killing a man and injuring eight other people, according to 
broadcast reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Luis Alberto Valdez died shortly after he was struck by the  
truck during the 30th Tecate SCORE Baja 500 Desert Race, a 460-mile 
course in the northern part of the Baja California peninsula, 
KFMB-TV reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Baldwin, of Laguna Beach, lost control of his full-sized  
pickup less than 10 miles into the race, his father told the 
television station KGTV. Baldwin was taken by helicopter to Mercy 
Hospital in San Diego, where he was listed in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``They spent I guess about a half an hour with the jaws of life  
prying him out of the car,'' Jim Baldwin, the driver's father, 
said. ``The car was in a pretty big wreck. His helmet, which is as 
good a helmet you can get ... was all cracked and so if it weren't 
for the helmet I don't think he'd be here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for Ensenada police did not immediately return phone  
calls seeking comment. The sponsor of the race, SCORE 
International, did not have details of the fatality but confirmed 
that Baldwin, 29, and his co-driver Mike Laughlin, 32 of Irvine, 
Calif., crashed about two miles into the race. 
</P>
<P>
	The event drew more than 200 drivers and motorcycle racers from  
the United States, Japan and Mexico. The race consists of pickup 
trucks, cars, motorcyles and all-terrain vehicles.

<HEADLINE> Travolta Can Now Fight for Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John Travolta's comeback is old news. Now he's  
so big in Hollywood he can really throw his weight around. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can get things done that a studio might not normally do,''  
Travolta says in Sunday's Daily News. ``I told my manager, `If we 
can't do the things now that we want to do, what good is the 
power?' It's a waste, basically. Let's test it and try to get the 
things done that we believe in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One result of that effort is ``Battleship Earth,'' a movie  
version of L. Ron Hubbard's science fiction novel. Shooting begins 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the pinnacle of using my power for something,'' Travolta  
said. ``We've been trying to make it for 10 years, but we never got 
a script that was right. Hubbard had been writing sci-fi, fantasy 
and pulp since 1937, and it's high time it was done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbard is the founder of Scientology, which Travolta has  
followed for nearly a quarter-century. 
</P>
<P>
	Travolta's latest release is the upcoming ``The General's  
Daughter,'' a drama about an Army investigator trying to find a 
killer.

<HEADLINE> Cathay, Pilots Resume Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Cathay Pacific Airways pilots continued to call  
in sick Sunday, forcing the carrier to cancel more flights even 
after the two sides reopened talks in their pay dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay grounded 55 of its 116 scheduled flights, slightly fewer  
than previous days. It paid other airlines to fly an additional 30 
flights to help carry its passengers, a company statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay had angered the pilots by pulling out of nine weeks of  
talks on proposed pay cuts and imposed a June 11 deadline for them 
to either take the pay deal, resign or be fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Government labor negotiators brought the two sides back to the  
negotiating table on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiators for all sides remained tip-lipped over what was  
discussed, but they agreed to meet again sometime this week, 
indicating they may be edging closer to an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as we're talking, that's progress,'' John Findlay,  
general secretary of the Hong Kong Aircrew Officers Association, 
told reporters Sunday after a forum on labor relations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong carrier wanted to cut its senior pilots' pay by an  
average of 7 percent over two years in exchange for stock options. 
The pilots insisted that Cathay promise them annual pay increases 
later if they promise to take the cuts. The carrier refused. 
</P>
<P>
	Claiming they were stressed over the layoff threats, the pilots  
began calling in sick en masse on May 28, disruption Cathay 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay posted a net loss of $69 million last year, running up  
its first red ink since 1963, as passenger traffic plunged amid 
Asia's economic crisis and Hong Kong's deep recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots say that if any union member is fired in the dispute,  
they may strike.

</P>
<P>
	HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) -- Lloyd Burke, who earned the Medal of  
Honor for leading his Army battalion to secure a hill that had been 
occupied by the enemy during the Korean War and also served in 
World War II and Vietnam, died Tuesday. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke died shortly after returning from a trip to Indianapolis  
for the dedication of a memorial honoring every person who has 
received the highest award for military valor. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke, a Tichnor native, joined the Army in 1943. He was  
decorated for his actions as a lieutenant during the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had been fighting on that hill 23 days and we'd lost a lot  
of men,'' Burke said. ``I was in the rear, I decided to go ... and 
secured the hill about midnight. My battalion came down off the 
hill at about 2 a.m.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was surprised he won the medal for his actions on  
Oct. 28, 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just did my job that day,'' he said in an interview shortly  
before his death. ``I don't think I did anything special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He received the medal from President Harry S. Truman on April 5,  
1952, and retired from the military in 1978. 
</P>
<P>

French Resistance and toward the end of the war frequented the 
circle of painters close to Pablo Picasso. 
</P>
<P>

vast paintings in an abstract style that he said were ``the exact 
reflection of experienced reality.''

<P>
	WACO, Texas (AP) -- Mickey Humphrey, a Waco Tribune-Herald

<HEADLINE> Private Jails Care for Sick Inmates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WOODLAND, Pa. (AP) -- For the county jails, state lockups and  
federal prisons within a short drive of this central Pennsylvania 
nowhere, Norm Cox has a pitch: Send me your sick, and I'll save you 
millions. 
</P>
<P>
	His Corrections National Corp. is building a 700-inmate medical  
prison here. It's the nation's second private lockup designed to 
deal with the ever-increasing ranks of sick inmates and those over 
age 55 in this era of three-strikes-and-you're-out sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	CNC is one of several private corrections companies venturing  
into medical care with promises of big savings for cash-strapped 
public jails and prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	CNC and Just Care Inc., which opened the first private medical  
prison in Columbia, S.C., in October, are following the lead of 
many state governments. 
</P>
<P>
	From Ohio to Louisiana to California, states are investing in  
wards and entire hospitals to treat prisoners. About 100 miles 
south of the CNC site, Pennsylvania already houses about 400 
inmates, most sick, at its Laurel Highlands State Prison. 
</P>
<P>
	These public efforts please budget watchdogs and advocates for  
elderly inmates. But the same groups are wary of the private firms' 
foray into medical care. 
</P>
<P>
	Their concern is oversight: When states deliver their sick to  
private wardens hundreds of miles away, how will they make sure 
their prisoners are getting good health care? 
</P>
<P>
	``I have mixed feelings, frankly, about private geriatric  
units,'' said Jonathan Turley, founder of the Project for Older 
Prisoners. ``There is the added need to generate profit, and that 
could potentially interfere with care and security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Just Care's Columbia Care Center, CNC's $45 million prison  
would not handle emergencies or surgery. Instead, both companies 
target prisoners who need nursing attention, but not 
hospitalization. Inmates recovering from surgery, AIDS patients, 
hepatitis sufferers, paraplegics, mental patients -- all would be 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	These are prisons' costliest burdens, and more are on the way.  
</P>
<P>
	The federal and most state governments don't have an exact  
number of prisoners over 55, but the generally accepted figure is 
about 50,000. Pennsylvania now houses 1,586 of them and expects the 
number to triple by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	At 55 years old, inmates are more likely than the general  
population to have chronic illnesses, experts say, because of the 
ravages of doing time and, in many cases, drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sick inmates, on average, cost three times more to house than  
those in the general prison population. At Laurel Highlands, the 
annual cost-per-inmate is $77,649, compared to $23,776 at 
Pennsylvania's other prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	That cost can be much higher. If a prison system has no medical  
center, it must send inmates to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina has a contract with Richland Memorial Hospital,  
which charges $1,048 per day for a bed, plus $288 per day for a 
respirator and $880 per day for intensive care. Add wages for 
24-hour security, and the cost tops $2,000 per day. Just Care will 
provide the same services for $460 per day. 
</P>
<P>
	For a state that spends $35.5 million a year -- 15 percent of its  
corrections budget -- on health care, that's too good to pass up. 
Gail Fricks, a deputy corrections director, was enthusiastic about 
the center after a 30-day trial, and South Carolina plans to send 
more prisoners there. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was wonderful,'' Ms. Fricks said. ``Security loved it, and  
I loved it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While large states are building their own medical prisons, Tull  
Gearreald, Just Care president and a former Merrill Lynch 
investment banker, thinks county jails and prison systems in small 
states will be just as eager as South Carolina to contract out. 
</P>
<P>
	States facing prison crowding can get more beds for their buck  
by putting up a general population prison and leaving it to the 
private companies to build the more expensive health care jails. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a bad trade-off, one critic says.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm troubled about it because our secretary of corrections has  
absolutely no authority, no oversight, was not consulted,'' said 
Julia Glover Hall, president of Pennsylvania Prison Society, which 
monitors prisons and jails. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent scandals do not help CNC. A private prison in Youngstown,  
Ohio -- the Northeast Ohio Correctional Center, owned by the 
Corrections Corp. of America -- drew the most attention after at 
least 13 inmate stabbings and two inmate deaths in its first year 
of operation, 1997-98. A year ago, six inmates, four of them 
killers, escaped briefly from the center. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania's Department of Correction admits it will have no  
control over CNC's facility, unless it signs a contract to send 
some of its sick prisoners there. But the Department of Health 
would certify the facility annually, and Cox said he will apply for 
accreditation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because we don't have long-term medical contracts, if they  
don't think we're doing a good job, they'll take 'em back,'' 
Gearreald said.

<HEADLINE> Court Access Changed After Simpson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                      *AP Special Corespondent    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Nearly five years ago, the televised  
courtroom saga of O.J. Simpson gave Americans a chance to observe a 
justice system that long seemed remote. It was perhaps an 
invaluable civics lesson, but one that will likely never happen 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	The veil that shrouds legal procedure from the prying eyes of TV  
cameras has returned, and efforts by judges to limit news coverage 
of trials has intensified. 
</P>
<P>
	Call it post-O.J. traumatic stress syndrome.  
</P>
<P>
	``The legacy of the O.J. Simpson trial is judicial distrust of  
televised trials and public distrust of the jury system,'' said 
Peter Arenella, a law professor at the University of California, 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``People now think it's too easy for juries to be packed and  
racially motivated,'' he said. ``The jury system got a black eye it 
didn't deserve because it is one area of the judicial system that 
really does work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The backlash, some say, was not the case itself. Rather, it was  
the verdict, one still contested by many who watched the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many judges think the O.J. case got out of control because of  
the media and led to what they see as an aberrant verdict,'' said 
Laurie Levenson, an associate dean at Loyola Law School. 
</P>
<P>
	What if Simpson had been found guilty of murdering Nicole Brown  
Simpson and Ronald Goldman outside her condominium on June 12, 
1994? 
</P>
<P>
	``People would have said it was a bit of a spectacle but they  
would not be as upset,'' Levenson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Rex Heincke, who represents numerous media outlets in  
Los Angeles and has fought to get cameras into court since the 
Simpson trial ended in 1995, said his job now is much harder. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a widespread belief among judges that televising the  
proceedings had given the public a serious misrepresentation of how 
the judicial system worked,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Lance Ito became the subject of virulent  
criticism for his conduct of the trial and other judges feared they 
could come under similar attack if they oversaw a televised trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Simpson case did not increase public confidence in the  
judiciary,'' said Heincke. ``There was a feeling it also 
contributed to a circuslike atmosphere outside the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case details became legendary. A dog's howling wail, two  
blood-stained gloves found miles apart, a house guest's tale of 
thumps in the night and the trail of blood drops on the walk to 
Simpson's house were all part of the scenario that trial devotees 
could recite from memory. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case pushed all the hot buttons,'' said Levenson. ``It  
pushed the race button and the celebrity button.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In spite of the hoopla, the Simpson case had little actual  
impact on the rules of law. The trial led to calls for jury reform 
and bar associations urged lawyers to stop talking so much outside 
court. But there were few substantial changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had a greater impact on the psyche of those involved in the  
legal system than on legal doctrine,'' said Levenson. ``It takes a 
lot more than O.J. to change hundreds of years of jurisprudence.''

<HEADLINE> The Cup Is Hockey's Ultimate Symbol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Pat Verbeek was 17 years old the first time he was  
in the same room as the Stanley Cup. His father urged him to get 
closer to hockey's most cherished prize, put an arm around it and 
pose for a snapshot. 
</P>
<P>
	No thanks, he said. He'd rather wait until he earned that right.  
</P>
<P>
	Now 35, the Dallas Stars forward is four wins from finally  
touching his sport's holy grail. The Stanley Cup finals between 
Dallas and the Buffalo Sabres begin Tuesday night at Reunion Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've spent 16 years trying to get this far,'' said Verbeek,  
who had been stopped twice before in the conference finals. 
``You've got to make the best of it when you're here because you 
may never get another chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Verbeek is one of many Dallas players whose career resumes are  
filled with impressive honors yet lack the most important of all -- 
an NHL championship. 
</P>
<P>
	That void is especially large for top Dallas players Ed Belfour,  
Brett Hull and Mike Modano. Each has a lengthy list of personal 
kudos, yet they're each 0-1 in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	For them, winning a title would validate their individual glory  
and certify them as great team players as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can turn in all the All-Star appearances and personal  
accolades for this moment to play for the Cup,'' Modano said. 
``People grade guys on how many championships you win nowadays. One 
would be fine with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cup represents a similar stakes game for Sabres goaltender  
Dominik Hasek. Already the consensus choice as the world's top 
goalie, Hasek can enhance that status by leading seventh-seeded 
Buffalo to a title. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a child I didn't even know what a Stanley Cup was, but it  
is my focus right now,'' said Hasek, who led the Czech Republic to 
the 1998 Olympic gold medal. ``It takes a couple of years to 
understand what it means to the players and fans to win the Stanley 
Cup. That's why I am here today in Buffalo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars have eight Cup winners and four others who have been  
to the finals and lost. Six Sabres have been to the finals and 
between them they've won one game. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Ludwig, one of three Dallas players who won the Cup with  
Montreal in 1986, said he thinks players who have felt the joy of 
winning are as motivated or even more than those who haven't. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of us who know what it's like at the end of the  
rainbow and we want that back,'' the 38-year-old defenseman said. 
``For a few of us, we know we don't have many kicks of the can 
left. To us, this is very important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas, the top-seeded team in the West, comes into the finals  
on a roll, having beaten second-seeded Colorado twice while facing 
elimination. Some viewed that series as the true finals, noting the 
Western Conference champion has won the last three Cups, each with 
sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
	Modano upset several Buffalo players by saying Dallas ``is  
anticipating a bit of a letdown in the finals'' because the Sabres 
are the East's seventh-seeded team. 
</P>
<P>
	He clarified his stance Sunday and praised Buffalo for  
``deserving to be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody else was saying that there was going to be a  
letdown; I didn't think there would be,'' he said. ``I think that's 
a lot of the hockey geniuses around the NHL predicting that, 
considering Colorado and our series was a pretty good series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres, however, are still treating Modano's initial  
comments as bulletin board material. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think a team that's really on a mission is going to  
have one of their leaders saying that the team's going to have a 
letdown after the conference final,'' Buffalo center Michael Peca 
said. ``If a team's on a mission, those kind of statements aren't 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're already setting up excuses, saying that the Western  
Conference was their Stanley Cup. But he may say things that he 
doesn't realize he's saying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres were underdogs against Ottawa, Boston and Toronto and  
won each series, so they don't mind the same label despite a 
playoffs-best 12-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone's saying that they're going to run away with it;  
we're fine with that,'' Sabres defenseman Bryan Woolley said. 
``We're used to that. Nobody expected us to get this far, that's 
for sure.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Mitsubishi in Talks With Fiat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Mitsubishi Motors Corp. reportedly has  
begun talks with Italian automaker Fiat about a tie-up to supply 
each other with key parts as well as fully assembled cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese carmaker also started similar talks with France's  
Peugeot SA, the Nihon Keizai business daily reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The reported move comes after Ford Motor Co. bought Volvo AB's  
car division in January, raising doubts about the future of an 
existing joint production venture in Europe between Volvo and 
Mitsubishi Motors. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi Motors will discuss supplying Fiat with its GDI  
direct-injection gas engines, the paper said. The two automakers 
also may agree to share other components or car models which 
complement their existing product lines, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, the Japanese company is considering buying GDI  
engines made with its technology by Fiat and Peugeot for use in 
Mitsubishi Motors cars sold in Europe, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-NFL Lineman Steinkuhler Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYRACUSE, Neb. (AP) -- Former Nebraska football star Dean  
Steinkuhler has been arrested on suspicion of domestic assault 
after his wife called police during a disturbance at his home. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputies arrested Steinkuhler on May 29 after being called to  
the house, Otoe County Sheriff Jim Gress said. Steinkuhler was 
released from jail hours later on $1,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's quite a big guy, so he can make you kinda nervous,''  
Gress said. ``But he did not resist arrest. He was cooperative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Otoe County Attorney Max Kelch has not received reports on the  
incident to decide if charges will be filed. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim had only minor injuries and did not require  
hospitalization, Gress said. The assault was classified as a 
misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinkuhler, 38, who is a member of the Syracuse City Council,  
did not immediately return a telephone call made to his home Sunday 
by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinkuhler won the Lombardi Award and Outland Trophy in 1983 as  
the nation's top college lineman. He played eight years as an 
offensive lineman for the NFL's Houston Oilers and in 1996 was 
inducted into the Nebraska High School Hall of Fame.

<HEADLINE> After Lighthouse Leaves, What Next? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUXTON, N.C. (AP) -- With the Hatteras Lighthouse move imminent,  
many residents wonder what will become of the three concrete-and 
sheet-pile groins that protect the lighthouse when their reason for 
existing is gone. 
</P>
<P>
	Islanders fear that, if the groins are permitted to  
disintegrate, the delicate balance of man and nature that sustains 
this long slip of sand will be upset, jeopardizing their 
livelihoods. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard, with 16 buildings near the lighthouse and plans  
to add 23 more, has a clear stake in preserving the groins. It is 
assessing the cost of assuming their maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're also examining whether there are other beneficiaries to  
those groins, such as businesses, local government,'' said Coast 
Guard Lt. Cmdr. Fred Sommer, executive officer of the civil 
engineering unit in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy built the groins in 1969 to protect its facility in  
Buxton in the elbow of Cape Hatteras Island. The groins also 
protect the lighthouse, motels, homes and a state highway. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Navy left, the Coast Guard took over, and the National  
Park Service began maintaining the southernmost groin to protect 
the lighthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	But that will stop once the lighthouse is moved 2,900 feet later  
this month to its new site. 
</P>
<P>
	``My guess is they might have, without any maintenance, another  
10 years as they're functioning now,'' says Robert Dolan, professor 
of environmental sciences in coastal geology at the University of 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will degrade slowly until 25 years from now, they'll be  
history. A big storm could change all of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The uncertainty makes island residents uneasy.  
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly the groins have become a part of this coastline  
here,'' says John Hooper, owner of the Lighthouse View Motel, one 
of three motels at least partially protected by the groins. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're protecting the Coast Guard facility, they're  
protecting the private oceanfront, and most of all, they're 
protecting Route 12, where it's most vulnerable, at the narrowest 
part of the island.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Should the Atlantic breach N.C. 12 at Hatteras Island's  
narrowest part, businesses and residents from Buxton south to 
Hatteras Village would be isolated from the estimated 700,000 
tourists who visit each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolan says the groins' impact hasn't been all positive. While  
they have protected the lighthouse shoreline and built up the beach 
to the north, they also have eroded beaches to the south. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite human efforts, he says, nature eventually will reclaim  
the island. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, none of this is going to solve problems over the  
long run,'' he says. ``Over the next 100 years, the shoreline is 
going to come back(ward) anyway. But the groins are delaying it.''

<HEADLINE> Boxer Roy Jones' Speed Unifies Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BILOXI, Miss. (AP) -- Roy Jones made it look so easy, dancing  
into the ring then around Reggie Johnson, taunting him, dominating 
him from start to finish. He even took time to talk to Michael 
Jordan, who sat ringside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope everyone had as good a time as I did, because I had a  
damn good time,'' Jones said Saturday night after becoming the 
first undisputed light heavyweight champion in 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' speed and quickness gave him a huge edge and a huge  
victory. He won every round on his way to a unanimous decision. 
Every judge had it 120-106 in favor of Jones, who added Johnson's 
IBF title to the WBA and WBC crowns he already had. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roy was real quick,'' Johnson said. ``I didn't have time to  
counter his punches. Coming into the fight, I knew I had to give a 
lot and take a lot of punches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was able to reach only one of those goals -- taking a lot  
of punches. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 40-1 with 33 knockouts, landed 273 punches to Johnson's  
49, and connected with 63 jabs to 16 for Johnson. CompuBox showed 
that Jones landed 210 power punches, Johnson 33. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was carefully guiding the punches,'' Jones said, holding his  
fists aloft. ``I've got radar in these things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It seemed that way. Jones knocked down Johnson twice and  
repeatedly had him wobbling. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who weighed 174 pounds, used a straight right 1:58 into  
the first round to knock down Johnson. The Houston fighter got up 
quickly, but was bleeding from his right eye. 
</P>
<P>
	In the third round, Jones countered a right from Johnson with a  
left-right combination that sent him to the canvas. Again Johnson 
got up quickly and the bell ended the round. By that time, blood 
was streaming from Johnson's eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 171, was only able to fight back in spurts by the  
fourth round. The rest of the time he was backing away or covering 
up. When he managed to get inside, Jones punished him with jabs and 
uppercuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Halfway through the 12-round fight his face was swollen, his  
white trunks streaked with blood. But Johnson, 39-6-1, kept 
answering at the bell. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd, which included a big contingent from Jones' hometown  
of Pensacola, Fla., called for a knockout. There were some boos 
late in the fight when Jones didn't press his attack. Johnson did 
go down in the 12th after a solid right from Jones, but it was 
ruled a slip. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could have pressured him and knocked him out, but why would  
I take a chance on him getting a lucky punch and knocking me out?'' 
Jones said. ``That's not very businesslike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Jones was not completely businesslike.  
</P>
<P>
	He couldn't resist showboating when it became apparent how  
completely he was dominating the fight. At one point, he backed 
Johnson to the ropes, looked at Jordan and shouted, `Watch this!'' 
before throwing a flurry of jabs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had the best player ever in the building and at the same  
time, we had the best boxer in the building,'' said Jones, himself 
a former professional basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fifth defense of his titles in the last 18 months for  
Jones. He became the only fighter to currently hold a unified title 
and only the third undisputed light heavyweight champion, joining 
Bob Foster and Michael Spinks.

<HEADLINE> Congress Returns for Busy June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Guns and money dominate the agenda as Congress  
returns Monday from a weeklong Memorial Day break, with Republicans 
hoping to master two issues that have caused them fits this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Judiciary Committee plans to write a wide-ranging  
juvenile justice bill this week that Republicans hope will avoid 
the kind of setbacks GOP senators endured in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democrats, seizing on the public outcry after shootings  
April 20 at Colorado's Columbine High School, forced Republicans to 
add gun restrictions to a juvenile justice bill approved by a 73-25 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate also could vote this week on spending  
bills, from agriculture to defense, for the budget year beginning 
Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	These must-pass measures have caused heartburn for Republicans:  
The bills cut domestic programs too much or not enough, insist 
competing groups of GOP lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Those problems, plus House leaders' failure to win enough votes  
before vacation to begin debate on a defense budget bill, have some 
Republicans grousing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope we can agree on an agenda and transmit that agenda to  
people concerned about our focus,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., 
a presidential contender who has taken on Senate leaders before. 
</P>
<P>
	Discussing the spending bills, McCain said: ``If we're in  
disagreement with the president, make our differences very clear so 
we can do battle on our grounds rather than let him define the 
argument.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the crime front, the House's juvenile justice bill will not  
reach the full chamber until the week of June 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, has  
said the bill's gun-control provisions will be similar but not 
identical to the Senate's. These include background checks of 
firearms purchasers at gun shows and requirements that handguns be 
sold with trigger locks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde's bill is expected to be broader than the Senate measure,  
however, offering proposals he said would ``curb the culture of 
violence that has engulfed our young people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said the bill must  
address such issues as enforcement of existing laws and social 
factors that desensitize children to violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``This goes so far beyond the issue of guns that it would be so  
naive and frankly irresponsible to confine our attention to nothing 
other than the guns issue,'' he said Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the 
Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are waiting to see what Hyde, R-Ill., proposes before  
making their next move. In a private strategy session in late May, 
Clinton urged House Democrats to press for stiffer requirements, 
such as raising the age for owning handguns and assault-style 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	As for spending legislation, the House plans to resume debating  
a $61 billion measure to finance farm and food programs next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before the holiday break, conservatives slowed work on the  
bill by offering amendment after amendment. Their point was to cut 
spending on the farm and other bills and persuade GOP leaders to 
present a plan for avoiding a year-end negotiation with Clinton in 
which he could force billions more to be spent. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we get back, and it's the same bill, and there's no  
strategy, I'll be back out there to delay it,'' said Rep. Tom 
Coburn, R-Okla., a leader of the conservatives who stalled the 
agriculture measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate turns attention to a $288.8 billion defense spending  
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the Senate's second-ranking  
Republican, said Sunday he expects Congress to pass most of the 
appropriations bills before the summer recess in August, thought it 
will be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important for us to do our work and to get our business  
done.'' he said on CBS' ``Face the Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other expected legislative action:  
</P>
<P>
	--The defense bill that stalled in the House will be debated and  
will propose cutting off money after Sept. 30 for the air war 
against Yugoslavia, a spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The provision, set before recent Kosovo peace developments, had  
led President Clinton to threaten a veto. Hastert, R-Ill., removed 
it last month, angering many lawmakers and contributing to the 
bill's delay. Hastert's spokesman, Pete Jeffries, said the reworked 
bill ``will reflect Republican priorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The Senate appears ready to pass a bill aimed at curbing  
frivolous lawsuits related to Year 2000 computer problems. The 
House approved a similar measure in May. Changes in the Senate bill 
met Democratic demands to eliminate punitive damage caps for large 
businesses. But some Senate Democrats say the legislation infringes 
on consumers' rights and are predicting a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Senate also will try again to vote on a GOP plan intended  
to require that Social Security surpluses go only to reduce the 
national debt. Democrats believe that requirement would do nothing 
to ensure the long-term health of the retirement program. They are 
likely to use procedural tactics again to prevent a vote on final 
passage. 
</P>
<P>
	--The House plans to vote soon on a bill that would lead to  
nuclear waste being stored at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.

<HEADLINE> Allergy Sufferers Go On Offensive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lydia Scheimer's son, Chris, stopped breathing a  
few years ago during an asthma attack instigated by allergies. He 
recovered, but their Hawthorne, N.Y., house is still reeling from 
the aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Convinced her family's health was being threatened by  
microscopic dust mites and other allergens in their home, she 
declared war though a series of home improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	They encased all mattresses and pillows in plastic, tossed out  
carpets where mites can breed and replaced wool couches with 
leather upholstered ones. They also installed air filters and air 
conditioners with special filtration systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The family cat was even sent packing.  
</P>
<P>
	More and more Americans are realizing that their itchy eyes,  
sneezing and other allergic reactions are caused not only by 
seasonal grass, pollens and ragweed, but by dust-borne allergens 
that sleep in their beds and hide in their sofas. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35 million Americans with allergies form a sizable market  
for the increasing number of allergy-control products designed to 
help people control the sources of irritation around their homes. 
Catalogs, distributed mostly through allergists and over the 
Internet, describe devices intended to control dust and moisture, 
from humidifiers to nose masks to air purifying systems worn around 
the neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the newest products target dust allergies. Scientists  
say such allergies are caused by dust mites, which, unlike molds 
and pets, are hard to avoid. They thrive in all but the driest of 
climates and are ubiquitous in the carpets, bedding and furniture 
upholstery. 
</P>
<P>
	At the annual meeting of nation's allergists in Orlando, Fla.,  
in April, the exhibition hall featured nearly as many small allergy 
product companies as major pharmaceutical manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Firms tout expensive, high-tech air cleaners. They hawk powerful  
and costly machines said to suck up the smallest of contaminants. 
Some companies even sell special teddy bears that can be washed to 
destroy dust mites that cuddle up on them. 
</P>
<P>
	But does any of it work?  
</P>
<P>
	Some yes, some no, experts say.  
</P>
<P>
	Allergists say the best steps to reduce exposure to allergens  
usually cost the least amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
	Allergists recommend mattress, box spring and pillow covers  
because they trap dust mites where they breed. They say certain 
types of vacuums, particularly steam cleaners, can also be useful 
because they can suck the mites from carpets and trap them in 
filter bags. They advise patients to get rid of carpeting, 
especially in the bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts say air cleaners are of little use because the  
mites are too heavy to float in the air for long. Such filters, 
though, can work to reduce pet dander. Experts caution against 
cleaning your home's air ducts because the mites don't do any harm 
there. They also express doubts about special carpet powders. 
</P>
<P>
	Encasing your pillow, mattress and box spring usually can cost  
about $150. Air filters and special vacuum cleaners can cost $500 
or more. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can eliminate the mite exposure, patients need  
medication less and have improved lung function,'' said Dr. Robert 
Bush, an allergist in Madison, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	Scheimer estimates her family has spent several thousand dollars  
altering their home to reduce allergens. ``Nothing was a waste,'' 
she said. Her two children, Chris and Julia, have asthma which is 
exacerbated by allergies. She also suffers from allergies. 
</P>
<P>
	``A little bit is not enough,'' Scheimer said. ``So for us we  
went 100 percent'' to reduce indoor allergens. 
</P>
<P>
	Because no public companies operate in the allergy products  
field, there's scant data on the industry. But allergists say 
they're seeing many more companies trying to pitch their wares. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our growth has been astronomical,'' said Ken Krugman,  
president of Allergy Asthma Technology, a privately-held firm based 
in Morton Grove, Ill., outside Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales are increasing as more consumers search for solutions that  
don't involve prescription medications, allergy product makers say. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is increasing and it has to do with awareness and  
education about indoor allergens,'' said Jordan Lera, president of 
Houston-based Allergy Free. The company sells products through the 
mail and advertises mainly on the Paul Harvey radio show. 
</P>
<P>
	While indoor allergens are a year-round problem, he said  
business spikes in the fall and spring when outdoor allergies peak. 
</P>
<P>
	Allergists caution people to talk to their doctor before  
investing in special gadgets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their main interest is not your health, but economic gain,''  
said Dr. Tim Craig, an allergist at Hershey Medical Center in 
Hershey, Pa.

<HEADLINE> Linux Vendor Red Hat To Go Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Red Hat Inc., which won investments by major  
information technology companies seeking to build a software 
challenger to Microsoft, says it will go public with a $96.6 
million stock offering. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which found a way to take software available free  
worldwide and sell packaged versions backed with technical support, 
said Friday it has filed a registration statement with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering 
of its common Stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Hat is a leading vendor of Linux, a software code developed  
by Linus Torvalds in the early 1990s when he was a student in 
Finland. Linux is best known for being an operating system that 
rarely crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	The company and the code began gaining notice last fall with  
major technology companies such as Intel, IBM, Netscape, and Oracle 
buying a stake in Red Hat. 
</P>
<P>
	But Linux still has a ways to go before it is considered a rival  
of Microsoft. Windows runs about 85 percent of the world's personal 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. will act as lead underwriter of Red Hat's  
IPO. Other underwriters include Thomas Weisel Partners and ETrade 
Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of shares to be sold was not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	Red Hat revealed in the filing that up to this point virtually  
all of its income has come from selling boxes of Red Hat Linux 
software. The company is looking at its Web site and income from 
services, like custom development and training, as sources of 
future revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Hat is close to profitability, the company said it its SEC  
filing. Revenues have been doubling annually and are listed as 
$10.7 million for 1999. Its net loss for the fiscal year, which 
ended Feb. 28, was $130,000. Red Hat spends about 20 percent of its 
revenue on research and development. Since March 1998, Red Hat's 
staff has grown from 36 to 130 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Stacy Quandt, an analyst with Giga Information Group in Santa  
Clara, Calif., said Red Hat will be closely watched after making 
the first Linux-related IPO. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first of many,'' she said. LinuxCare and VA Linux  
Systems, both based in Northern California, also are IPO 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	The single biggest chunk of the company is owned by board member  
Frank Batten Jr. of Norfolk, Va. Batten, chairman of the media 
company Landmark Communications, owns 25 percent of Red Hat. 
Landmark owns The Weather Channel and major regional newspapers, 
including the News &AMP; Record of Greensboro, the Virginian-Pilot of 
Norfolk and the Roanoke (Va.) Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Of all of the technology companies -- like IBM, Netscape, Oracle  
and SAP -- that have made highly publicized investments in Red Hat, 
only Intel was identified as a significant owner of the company, 
with a 5 percent stake.

<HEADLINE> 'Swan Lake' Director Wins Two Tonys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Matthew Bourne took two Tony awards Sunday, for  
best direction and best choreography of a musical for his work on 
``Swan Lake,'' a modern-dress retelling of the famous ballet with 
an all-male corps of swans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm absolutely astonished. ... best director of a musical  
that's not even a musical,'' Bourne said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, when he picked up the choreography prize, he said,  
``I'm just very grafeful Bob Fosse wasn't eligible in this category 
this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also thanked Tchaikovsky, the ``Swan Lake'' composer, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Lez Brotherston's costume design for ``Swan Lake,'' featuring  
feathered capri pants, also won a Tony. The other design awards 
were split between two shows -- Richard Hoover and ``Not About 
Nightingales'' for sets and Andrew Bridge and ``Fosse'' for 
lighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Falls won the award for best director of a play for  
``Death of a Salesman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Parade'', a short-lived musical love story set against the  
backdrop of a murder and lynching in pre-World War I Georgia, 
picked up awards for best score (music and lyrics by Jason Robert 
Brown) and book. 
</P>
<P>
	```Parade' isn't over yet,'' said its book writer Alfred Uhry,  
best known as the author of ``Driving Miss Daisy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Uhry said it will open next June in Atlanta and then tour,  
adding: ``Who knows, look for us to come back to New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the play's the thing, not the musicals, at this year' s  
ceremony, with the emphasis on revivals, particularly potent 
productions of Arthur Miller's ``Death of a Salesman'' and Eugene 
O'Neill's ``The Iceman Cometh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two classics were expected to provide most of the drama as  
Broadway honored the best of a theater season that produced no 
major musical smash, but a number of hit plays, both old and new. 
</P>
<P>
	``Salesman'' and ``Iceman'' square off for best-revival honors,  
with their two leading men, Brian Dennehy and Kevin Spacey, going 
to the mat for the top acting prize. 
</P>
<P>
	Competing for best-play honors were two entries by American  
writers, ``Side Man,'' Warren Leight's turbulent tale of a jazz 
musician and his family, and Tennessee Williams' ``Not About 
Nightingales,'' written more than 60 years ago but only now running 
on Broadway by way of the Royal National Theater in London and 
Houston's Alley Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Also up for best play were Patrick Marber's ``Closer,'' a sleek  
tale of sexual intrigue set in present-day London, and ``The 
Lonesome West,'' Irish playwright Martin McDonagh's comedy slugfest 
between two bitter brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest in the best-musical competition was minimal, with most  
of the attention focused on two very different candidates: 
``Fosse,'' a salute to the choreographer Bob Fosse, and ``Parade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both box office and attendance figures rose during the 1998-99  
Broadway season although not as much as in previous years. Total 
grosses topped $588.1 million, while more than 11.6 million people 
saw a Broadway show. 
</P>
<P>
	Production climbed, too, with 39 new shows, compared to 33 the  
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet no big new musical, the kind like ``Cats'' that can run and  
run and run, made an appearance. Only ``Fosse'' appears headed for 
an extended stay. Of the musical revivals, ``Annie Get Your Gun'' 
was the sturdiest show, although what happens when Bernadette 
Peters leaves early next year is a question mark. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The 53rd annual Tony Awards returned to a Broadway theater, the  
Gershwin, this year, because Radio City Music Hall, its home for 
the past two years, is being renovated. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony also featured a series of presenters instead of one  
host. Rosie O'Donnell, who did those chores for two years, declined 
this year because of her busy schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tony winners in 21 categories were chosen by more than 800  
voters, including members of the theater community and theater 
journalists. The Tonys are named after Antoinette Perry, founder of 
the American Theater Wing, a theater service organization.

<HEADLINE> Hatteras Lighthouse To Be Moved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUXTON, N.C. (AP) -- Later this month, crews will begin rolling  
the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse from its perch beside a sometimes 
angry and threatening ocean to a safer spot in a dense maritime 
forest. 
</P>
<P>
	The 208-foot-tall lighthouse, the tallest in the nation, will  
move at a snail's pace, an inch or two a minute, with frequent 
stops for adjustments. Rigged to the brick structure are dozens of 
sensors to measure tilt, expansion, temperature and vibration. If 
anything seems wrong, the move will halt rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to go very slowly,'' project consultant Pete  
Friesen said during a media briefing June 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The lighthouse is being moved by the National Park Service  
because it sits only about 150 feet from the Atlantic Ocean and 
there are fears it could be toppled by erosion. When the 
128-year-old lighthouse was built, it sat about 1,600 feet away 
from the ocean. It will be the same distance from the sea when the 
$10 million move is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	The actual length of the trip is 2,900 feet along a wide gravel  
road prepared just for the lighthouse, making it appear from the 
air like a space shuttle ready to roll to its launching pad. 
</P>
<P>
	The move has been accepted, grudgingly in some cases, by  
residents of this island village. Many people here fought the 
project even after Congress appropriated money for the move. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the move said the lighthouse might fall or be  
seriously cracked during the move. They wanted the park service to 
rebuild three groins on the beach and add a fourth one to catch 
sand and build up the beach in front of the lighthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``We fought our battle and we lost,'' said Danny Couch, leaning  
on a truck outside his service station and shopping center that has 
the lighthouse as backdrop. ``I'm ready to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friesen said it will be hard to see actual movement as the  
structure creeps along, covering 20 to 70 feet a day. One sign of 
movement park rangers will listen for is the screeching, 
steel-against-steel sound of Hillman rollers against their track 
made of steel I-beams. 
</P>
<P>
	Park service officials expect to have the structure ready for  
tourists to climb by next Memorial Day. Work began in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is big,'' said Richard Lohr, president of International  
Chimney Corp., the Buffalo, N.Y., company that renovated the 
lighthouse in 1991-92 and was hired for the move. 
</P>
<P>
	Before it can move, crews have to slowly jack the 208-foot brick  
structure up 5 feet. One hundred hydraulic jacks will raise the 
5,000-ton lighthouse, now sitting on a crisscrossed pile of steel 
beams, so tracks and rollers can be installed under the tower, said 
Friesen. 
</P>
<P>
	Each jack will sit atop a 7-inch-by-15-inch roller assembly and  
will be controlled by a specially-made control panel with dials and 
knobs for each jack. 
</P>
<P>
	Sections of track will be moved ahead of the structure after the  
lighthouse passes over them. The track will be laid on steel mats, 
which are placed on top of a foot of compacted gravel. 
</P>
<P>
	Weather and equipment will determine how soon seven jacks  
attached to the tracks can apply the first gentle push to the 
lighthouse and start it moving. 
</P>
<P>
	Friesen said some people worry that the lighthouse might wobble  
and fall as the structure starts to move. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were familiar with jobs where the move happened with  
cables and there is a moment of inertia ... when the cable 
contracts,'' he said. ``That's not going to be. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to fall.''  
</P>
<P>
	Approximately 28 days after the move starts -- around mid-July,  
the lighthouse will be at its new site, where a concrete foundation 
pad awaits and keepers' houses already have been relocated. Some 
120,000 bricks, each weighing 7 1/2 pounds, will become the new 
lighthouse foundation, replacing solid granite from the old site. 
</P>
<P>
	Lohr said his company has moved lighthouses on Block Island,  
R.I., and Cape Cod, Mass., but neither was as tall as the Hatteras 
lighthouse. The company warmed up for the move last year with a 
135-foot chimney in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	``The theory of the move is to replace the existing foundation  
with a moving foundation,'' said Lohr, whose firm recently moved 
the Shubert Theater in Minneapolis. ``The system itself for the 
move has evolved. It's about 50 percent art and 50 percent 
science.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lighthouse is insured for $6 million during the move, and  
Lohr said his company could rebuild it if necessary. He said the 
structure will be safe so long as the hydraulic jacks do their jobs 
and keep it level; the lighthouse can survive even hurricane-force 
winds sitting on the jacks.

<HEADLINE> Scab Detector Used in Wheat Fields / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- A new device that acts like a vacuum  
cleaner could help wheat growers fight disease. 
</P>
<P>
	North Dakota State University plant pathologist Leonard Francl  
is putting the suction device in 17 fields this spring. It could 
provide an early warning system for farmers and help them use 
fungicides to fight scab, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scab, a fungus also known as Fusarium head blight, shrivels  
kernels of wheat and barley. The disease thrives in moist 
conditions and creates toxins that can make the grain unsuitable 
for food and animal feed. It has devastated farmers' crops in the 
upper Midwest in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Up until now, they watched the weather and they just kind of  
fretted and worried about how much it's raining and whether or not 
that's enough to bring the fungus out or the spores up,'' Francl 
said. ``And so we're providing that extra information for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new device traps spores to sample them for disease. It  
stands about 3 feet high and has a large wind vane on the back. A 
U-shaped tube carries the debris to a container. It even sports a 
rain shield. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sucks air in at a fairly good clip, about 16 liters per  
minute, and that volume of air is then pulled into the machine, and 
any particles that are in the air are deposited,'' Francl said. 
</P>
<P>
	The equipment will be used in the Red River Valley and across  
northern North Dakota. Francl or an assistant will stop at the 
sites three times a week, collect samples and bring them back to 
examine under a microscope to see if spores exist in the fields. 
</P>
<P>
	That will provide another piece of important information for  
farmers, Francl said. If spores are found, he will know the fungus 
is present. Then, if the plant is at a sensitive growth stage in 
late June with ample moisture, Francl will advise farmers that the 
disease could pop up. 
</P>
<P>
	The only question remaining is when fungicide should be sprayed.  
Francl said he's still working on that, but he can help farmers 
make better decisions about whether and when to spray. 
</P>
<P>
	Francl will make the information public on a toll-free telephone  
line so that farmers near the sites can be aware of what's 
happening. He also plans to post the information on the Internet. 
The site will be ready in several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Francl said he hopes to have most of the devices in place by  
Thursday. If they help, he said he'll expand the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcia McMullen, a plant pathologist at North Dakota State, said  
she doubts May's heavy rainfall would have much of an effect on 
scab this summer. But if a lot of rain continues until the end of 
June or the first half of July, the fungus will have a good 
opportunity to thrive. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weather at that time will be critical,'' McMullen said.

<HEADLINE> Mets' Valentine Gets the Message </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mets general manager Steve Phillips insists he  
didn't fire three coaches to send his manager a message. Bobby 
Valentine heard him anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have to be told anything,'' Valentine said before  
Sunday's game against the New York Yankees. ``I know I am not doing 
my job as good as I should be. I don't need a message when we are 
one game under .500 with a $70 million payroll. We're not doing the 
job we need to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a stunning move late Saturday night, Phillips fired pitching  
coach Bob Apodaca, bullpen coach Randy Niemann and hitting coach 
Tom Robson from his struggling team. 
</P>
<P>
	The dismissals came after the Mets lost their eighth straight  
game, 6-3 to the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Phillips' public backing, Valentine knows he could be  
next. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are not better in the next 55 games, then I should not  
be manager,'' Valentine said. ``I can't see it lasting much beyond 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advisor Dave Wallace, the Los Angeles Dodgers' pitching coach  
for three years, will take over the pitchers, minor league pitching 
coordinator Al Jackson takes over the bullpen, and minor league 
hitting coordinator Mickey Brantley becomes hitting coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Apodaca and Robson were two of Valentine's closest confidants.  
Apodaca came with Valentine from Triple-A Norfolk when Valentine 
took over the Mets two year's ago. Robson was on Valentine's staff 
in Texas from 1986-92. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine, who said he had an emotional meeting Saturday night  
with his coaches, never considered quitting his job to protest the 
firings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I came close to that,'' he said. ``I talked to  
the coaches to look for guidance. I think I knew what I wanted to 
do but I just needed reinforcement. And I got it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After spending $165.9 million to upgrade the team this  
offseason, the Mets were the favorite for the NL wild-card and 
perhaps to even challenge the Atlanta Braves in the NL East. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, after starting 27-20, the Mets are in third place in  
the division and 11th place overall in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a $70 million investment in this team and we are not  
giving up at this stage in the year,'' Phillips said. ``We still 
have time to recover and get back on track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York began the day with a 4.87 ERA, 12th among 16 teams in  
the National League. Last year, the Mets were fourth in the NL at 
3.76. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had a magic formula, I'd give it to you,'' Wallace said.  
``I go by my own instincts. I am going to be myself, communicate 
with the pitchers and do the best I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite leading the NL in on-base percentage, the Mets are 10th  
in the league in runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just a way to shake things up,'' third baseman Robin  
Ventura said. ``Unfortunately, these guys are the easiest to move 
around. As a player, you feel responsible for those guys not being 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips originally wanted to wait to make the move until after  
the circus of the subway series. But after media reports of 
Apodaca's firing surfaced Saturday, Phillips felt he had no choice. 
</P>
<P>
	But facing a large media contingent in the basement of Yankee  
Stadium before playing Roger Clemens and the World Series champions 
was not the most comfortable situation for either Phillips or 
Valentine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there could be a worse place for this,''  
Valentine said.

<HEADLINE> Congress Returns for Busy June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is returning to work with Republican  
leaders seeking to quell discontent within their own ranks long 
enough to pass crucial spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, strongly opposed to GOP budgets it  
sees as hurting social programs, said it will offer the Republicans 
little help. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think they should go back to the drawing board and figure  
out what they want,'' White House chief of staff John Podesta said 
Sunday on CBS' ``Face the Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also are of two minds about a major juvenile crime  
bill making its way through the House. Legislation aimed at 
reducing juvenile offenders has long been a GOP priority, but 
Democrats succeeded, following the April 20 shootings at Colorado's 
Columbine High School, in linking the bill to gun restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate approved a version, which includes providing safety  
locks and requiring background checks for gun show purchases, by a 
73-25 vote, and the House Judiciary Committee plans to finish work 
this week on a similar version. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said on NBC's ``Meet  
the Press'' that the bill would contain gun provision, some of 
which he opposes. ``There's a broad base of things we've got to 
look at. This goes far beyond the issue of guns,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate, reconvening today from a week-long  
Memorial Day recess, may make another stab this week at voting on 
some of the spending bills for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the break, House GOP leaders were forced to set aside an  
agriculture spending bill and a measure authorizing defense 
spending because of mini-rebellions within the party. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope we can agree on an agenda and transmit that agenda to  
people concerned about our focus,'' Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a 
Republican presidential contender, said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding the spending bills, McCain said: ``If we're in  
disagreement with the president, make our differences very clear so 
we can do battle on our grounds rather than let him define the 
argument.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla., said his party has no  
intention at this time of negotiating with the White House over 
priorities. The administration is interested in more spending and 
``so, frankly, I don't think it's time to sit down and do a grand 
summit now,'' he said Sunday on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	The House is expected to resume debating a $61 billion measure  
to finance farm and food programs next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before the holiday recess, conservatives slowed work on the  
bill by offering a string of amendments. Their point was to cut 
spending on the farm and other bills and persuade Republican 
leaders to present a plan for avoiding year-end negotiations with 
Clinton in which he could force billions more in spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we get back, and it's the same bill, and there's no  
strategy, I'll be back out there to delay it,'' said Rep. Tom 
Coburn, R-Okla., a leader of the conservatives who stalled the 
agriculture measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate, meanwhile, was turning its attention to a $288.8  
billion defense spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
	In other expected legislative action:  
</P>
<P>
	--The defense bill that stalled in the House will be debated, as  
will a proposal to cut off money after Sept. 30 for the air war 
against Yugoslavia, said Pete Jeffries, spokesman for House Speaker 
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The cutoff provision had led Clinton to threaten a veto. Hastert  
removed it last month, angering many lawmakers and contributing to 
the bill's delay. Jeffries said the reworked bill ``will reflect 
Republican priorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The Senate appears ready to pass a bill aimed at curbing  
frivolous lawsuits related to Year 2000 computer problems. The 
House approved a similar measure in May. Changes in the Senate bill 
met Democratic demands to eliminate punitive damage caps for large 
businesses. But some Senate Democrats say the legislation infringes 
on consumers' rights and they predict a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Senate also will try again to vote on a GOP plan intended  
to require that Social Security surpluses go only to reduce the 
national debt. Democrats believe that requirement would do nothing 
to ensure the long-term health of the retirement program. They are 
likely to use procedural tactics again to prevent a vote on final 
passage.

<HEADLINE> Tranquility Lake Wins at Hollywood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Tranquility Lake, the 7-10 favorite,  
led all the way in winning Sunday's $261,500 Gamely Breeders' Cup 
Handicap at Hollywood Park by 5 1/2 lengths over Midnight Line. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye and carrying 119 pounds,  
Tranquility Lake covered 1 1/8 miles on turf in 1:46 in scoring her 
third straight victory by over four lengths and her first win in a 
Grade I race. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Sunday, jockey Chris Antley, back from his  
disappointment at the Belmont Stakes, rode Magicalmysterycat to her 
second victory in as many starts in the $74,550 Cinderella Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Tranquility Lake, a 4-year-old Kentucky-bred daughter of Rahy,  
paid $3.40, $2.40 and $2.10. The win was the fifth in 12 lifetime 
starts for Tranquility Lake and was worth $157,800, raising her 
career earnings to $506,900. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the kind of horse this old man likes to ride,'' said  
the 47-year-old Delahoussaye, a Hall of Famer. ``She showed a lot 
of promise when she was younger. Now that she's mature, she's 
really something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Midnight Line crossed the finish line 4 1/2 lengths ahead of Green  
Jewel and returned $5.40 and $2.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Jewel was a nose in front of Sapphire Ring at the wire and  
paid $2.60 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Happyanunoit was fifth and last in the 33rd running of the race  
for fillies and mares. Cyrillic, Tuzla and Virginie were scratched. 
</P>
<P>
	Magicalmysterycat took the lead entering the stretch and went on  
to win the 5 1/2-furlong Cinderella Stakes for 2-year-old fillies by 
1 1/4 lengths over Sweet Defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Magicalmysterycat, the 3-5 favorite who ran coupled in the  
wagering with fourth-place finisher Shimmering Night, was timed in 
1:06 and paid $3.20, $2.20 and $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Magicalmysterycat earned $42,660 to raise her earnings to  
$69,660. 
</P>
<P>
	Shimmering Night returned $3.20 and $2.20, and third-place  
finisher Princes Melissa paid $2.40 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	``A key was, I got a little breather around the turn and when I  
called on her, she fired and held the other filly safe,'' Antley 
said. ``There really wasn't much to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Antley rode Charismatic, the Kentucky Derby and Preakness  
winner, to a third-place finish in the Belmont on Saturday, missing 
out on the Triple Crown. Charismatic fractured the cannon bone and 
sesamoid in his left foreleg and won't race again. 
</P>
<P>
	Antley was scheduled to be a guest of President Clinton on  
Monday at the White House.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Co., IBM To Form Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Personal computer maker Acer Inc. will  
announce a partnership Monday with International Business Machines 
Corp. that is slated to bring it orders worth $7.8 billion, 
published reports said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the strategic alliance, Acer will become the sole  
manufacturer of IBM computers and computer parts sold in Asia, and 
the companies will jointly develop new products and share licensing 
for some technologies, the Economic Daily News reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Acer, Taiwan's largest personal computer maker,  
have declined to comment on the deal, but expectations have already 
pushed the company's stock price up more than 13 percent over last 
week, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM last year purchased about $2 billion worth of computers and  
computer parts from Taiwan, the paper said. It did not say how much 
of that was purchased from Acer. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-year alliance would be the largest ever international  
cooperation accord struck by a single Taiwanese company in dollar 
terms, the United Daily News said. 
</P>
<P>
	Acer has entered into previous deals with American computer  
companies, most prominently in 1989, when it took a 47 percent 
stake in a joint venture with Texas Instruments to make memory 
chips. Acer bought out Texas Instruments' share last year.

<HEADLINE> Gordon's Save Streak Ends at 54 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- You can't save 'em all.  
</P>
<P>
	But for more than a year it seemed that Tom Gordon might, as he  
racked up a major league record with 54 consecutive save 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	The streak, which ended Saturday, doesn't rank with some other  
big numbers -- Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak or Cal Ripken's 
stretch of 2,632 consecutive games played -- but it's still 
impressive. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's an incredible run. That's an amazing run,'' Boston  
pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said. ``That's something I don't think 
you'll see in a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The run of successful saves ended when Atlanta's Javy Lopez  
lined a double just inside the third-base line, driving in two runs 
in the ninth inning and giving the Braves a 6-5 win. Afterward, 
Gordon got encouragement from his Red Sox teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were all there for me,'' he said. ``They said, `let's go  
out and start a new streak.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon said he doesn't consider himself a closer, although his  
exceptional curveball and fastball are suited to the role. He 
claims he doesn't even know all the requirements for earning a save 
and said he tried not to dwell on the streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a blessing to get 54 in a row,'' he said, but ``I've got  
a lot to learn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon became a full-time starter with Kansas City in 1994,  
joined Boston in 1996 and didn't relieve for the Red Sox until Aug. 
20, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	On that day, he pitched a perfect ninth in a 5-4 win in Oakland.  
That was the first of nine straight successful conversions. He then 
started 1998 with saves in his first three chances before 
squandering an opportunity on April 14 against Oakland, although he 
got the win. 
</P>
<P>
	But he didn't blow another regular-season save the rest of the  
year, finishing with 43 in a row and leading the American League 
with 46 overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Sept. 24, he broke the record of 41 straight saves he  
shared with Trevor Hoffman and Rod Beck. He did it by striking out 
the side in the ninth in a 9-6 win over Baltimore that clinched a 
wild-card berth for Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	He did fail in a save situation in Game 4 of the AL playoffs in  
which Cleveland clinched the series. But he started this season 
with 11 straight successful save chances despite missing time with 
an elbow problem. 
</P>
<P>
	He had control problems in his first few appearances after  
returning but said he felt better Saturday when he retired the 
first two batters before singles by Chipper Jones and Brian Jordan 
set the stage for the end of the streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he has a chance to learn something new: how to pitch after  
blowing a save. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't thought that far in advance,'' he said. ``I'm just  
looking forward to going out there again. I won't change my 
approach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon hadn't pitched since last Monday when he recorded his  
third save in three games in an 8-7 win over Detroit, although he 
did throw 27 pitches in the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, ``I came back and was throwing strikes the way I'd  
like to,'' Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
	He just didn't get the save.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's disappointing,'' Gordon said. ``I've done a lot of good  
things in this role and it's something I've grown to like. There's 
still a long way to go. I'm looking forward to the challenge.''

<HEADLINE> Simpson Living With the Notoriety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Forget the glory days of gridiron triumphs,  
Hertz commercials and movies that endeared him to millions. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years after his ex-wife and her friend were found dead  
outside her Brentwood condominium, the defining event in O.J. 
Simpson's life is the case that became what many called the Trial 
of the Century. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a legacy that leaves him dismayed with both the news media  
and an American public still fascinated by a man acquitted in court 
but convicted in the minds of many. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone used this as their cause, and I've learned to live  
with it,'' Simpson said in an interview with The Associated Press. 
``It isn't about me anymore. It's about having a scapegoat. 
</P>
<P>
	``People need something to argue about,'' he says. ``I listen to  
these talk shows and I think our country is bored. How else can 
they keep these stories going for so long? I guess we can't deal 
with our lives, so we sit around talking about someone else's 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a moment of reflection, Simpson adds, ``The O.J. case  
evidently has become part of people's lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On June 12, 1994, Nicole Brown Simpson was slashed to death  
along with Ronald Goldman. Simpson, tried for the murders, was 
acquitted in 1995 and released from jail to begin his life anew 
amid a backlash from those who believed he got away with murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Both victims' families sued him in civil court and won judgments  
of $33.5 million in damages in 1997 from a jury that held him 
liable under a different standard of proof. That verdict is still 
on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Simpson successfully challenged paying the award and  
lives well today on a hefty pension plan he set up when he was 
making millions. Such pensions are exempt from civil court 
judgments, although any money Simpson earns would be seized 
immediately by the court. 
</P>
<P>
	His life today is shaped by those boundaries, but Simpson exudes  
a cheerful personality. ``My premature retirement is not as bad as 
it's cracked up to be,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	The years of his superstardom are a dim memory.  
</P>
<P>
	``I play golf. I raise two kids. I don't go out. I live the  
simplest, most regulated life, not the life I imagined for myself. 
But I find it rewarding,'' he says. ``I have two terrific kids, I 
have friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is a girlfriend named Christie, but he avoids discussing  
the relationship. His priority now, he says, is caring for Justin, 
10, and Sydney, 13. He drives them to and from school and attends 
their athletic events. The children live with him while his 
in-laws, Lou and Juditha Brown, battle for custody. Recent reports 
have indicated an amicable settlement is near, but neither side 
wants to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson, whose Brentwood home was sold in foreclosure and torn  
down by the buyer, rents a Pacific Palisades home for $6,000 a 
month, drawing $25,000 a month on his $4 million pension. In 
another spectacle last February, lawyers for the Goldmans and 
Browns auctioned personal property seized from the home, garnering 
$430,000, more than half of it from a man who bought Simpson's 
Heisman trophy to impress his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	His older children, Jason and Arnelle, visit frequently and his  
sister, Shirley Baker, spends large amounts of time with him and 
the children. His longtime housekeeper and secretary remain loyal 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson adamantly maintains he did not kill his ex-wife and her  
friend and he insists the case will be solved eventually. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the likelihood of someone else being arrested,  
Simpson says, ``I have no doubt it's going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few private detectives are working on their own time, he says,  
following leads they occasionally bring to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``If one day there's a new D.A., my goal is to take this stuff  
to him and tell him to look into it,'' Simpson says. 
</P>
<P>
	``If tomorrow I was able to solve this case, I wouldn't spend  
one day at the trial of those people,'' he adds. ``They (messed) up 
my life, but I don't feel the disgust people displayed toward me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those public displays have become rare, he says, part of what  
Simpson believes is the potential for a normal life. He was able to 
take his children to see the ``Star Wars'' prequel at a local 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
	``I signed about 100 autographs,'' he says. ``People were  
hugging me. They were very nice except for one guy who yelled 
something. I know if the media was there, that's all they would 
have reported.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A golfing enthusiast, Simpson is forced to play on public  
courses because the exclusive country clubs don't want him. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, he was accosted by a man with a gun outside the  
Griffith Park golf course. He wrestled with the man and chased him 
by car, but he got away. No one was ever arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eventually I'm going to move,'' he says, probably to Florida.  
A recent house-hunting expedition there again produced headlines. 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles or elsewhere, he realizes the case will persist.  
For Simpson, the day that changed his world is never far from 
memory. ``It seems like a lifetime ago and at times it seems like 
yesterday,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> Matchup for the Stanley Cup Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A look at the matchup for the Stanley Cup finals:  
</P>
<P>
 *Dallas Stars (51-19-12, regular season) vs. Buffalo Sabres 	
</P>
<P>
                            (37-28-17) 	
</P>
<P>
	1998-99 Series Record: Tied 1-1.  
</P>
<P>
	Outlook: Both teams are trying to win their first Stanley Cup.  
It is the Stars' first appearance in the finals since moving from 
Minnesota, where the franchise made the championship round twice. 
As the Minnesota North Stars, they lost to the New York Islanders 
in 1981 and to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1991. The Sabres lost in 
their only finals appearance, to the Philadelphia Flyers in 1975. 
Dallas won the teams' first meeting of the season on Oct. 10, 
scoring three power-play goals against Dominik Hasek in a 4-1 
victory at Reunion Arena. Rookie Martin Biron earned his first 
career victory, filling in for the injured Hasek, in the Sabres' 
2-1 win at Marine Midland Arena on March 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Woolley leads Buffalo in playoff scoring with 13 points  
(three goals, 10 assists), followed by Curtis Brown, Michael Peca 
and Alexei Zhitnik (12 points each). Brown leads the team with 
seven goals -- three game-winners. Miroslav Satan, the Sabres' 
leading scorer (40 goals, 26 assists) in the regular season, 
returned in the Eastern Conference finals after missing the 
semifinals with a foot injury. Hasek -- likely to win his third 
straight Vezina Trophy, fifth in six years, as the league's top 
goalie -- has a 1.82 goals-against average and a save percentage of 
.938 in the postseason. The Sabres, unbeaten in seven home games, 
will be well-rested after having had eight days between games. 
Hasek will have to be in top form if Buffalo is to extend the 
series and have a chance at winning. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas' strength is playing coach Ken Hitchcock's disciplined  
defensive system and wearing down its foes. The Stars, who have won 
the Presidents' Trophy as the NHL's top team for the second 
straight season, are 7-2 at home in the playoffs. Sixth in the 
league in power-play percentage during the regular season, Dallas 
struggled with the man advantage in the first two rounds 
(5-for-52), but was 5-for-28 against the Avalanche. Joe Nieuwendyk 
(nine goals, nine assists) has five game-winners -- including two in 
overtime. Mike Modano has 16 points, including 11 assists, followed 
by Jamie Langenbrunner (nine goals, five assists). Goalie Ed 
Belfour and the Stars' defense shut down Colorado in Games 6 &AMP; 7 of 
the Western Conference finals -- both 4-1 victories. Belfour also 
had a shutout in Game 3 and has a .927 save percentage and a 1.83 
GAA in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Dallas in 6 games.

<HEADLINE> Beach Ripped Out for Oil Cleanup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AVILA BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Hard times closed businesses. El Nino  
storms flooded streets and ripped apart piers jutting out from this 
classic California beach town. But it took a leaky petroleum 
pipeline to force the demolition of the entire commercial 
beachfront -- at the peak of the summer season. 
</P>
<P>
	The last shop owners tore down surfing posters and shuffled out  
boxes of swimsuits on Sunday. Down the street, an ocean breeze 
carried the putrid smell of oil from a slick floating atop an 
algae-green-colored pool at the bottom of a huge pit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen buildings come and go in this town,'' said Matthew  
Farmer, a 32-year Avila Beach resident. ``But to see them all go 
under the bulldozer in one swoop is pretty sickening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Summer has been canceled at Avila Beach this summer. Unocal  
Corp., making good on its promise to clean up a 400,000-gallon 
plume of diesel, crude oil and gasoline that has leaked into the 
ground under the town of 300 people for decades, began the cleanup 
in the fall. It is scheduled to be finished in time to reopen the 
beach next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the beach is off limits, blocked by orange mesh fencing,  
concrete barricades and ``DO NOT ENTER'' signs. The only people are 
security guards who stroll the deserted street with foot-long 
batons dangling from their belts. 
</P>
<P>
	In summers past, up to 5,000 tourists converged each day on this  
funky, laid-back town's secluded stretch of beach, tucked into a 
curl of land that reaches out into the Pacific Ocean, about 180 
miles northwest of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Children played on swing sets while dogs chased Frisbees through  
fierce volleyball matches, Farmer recalled. His buddies gathered on 
the pier to fish or catch crab. Dolphins teased the sunbathers, 
while seals and sea otters stayed farther out. 
</P>
<P>
	But underneath the sand, Union Oil Co. was pumping 2 million  
barrels of oil a month from tanks above town to tankers at the 
wharf. Union Oil purchased much of the land in 1902 and was 
operating there until July 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, a property owner doing a soil test found the  
contamination. 
</P>
<P>
	Unocal agreed in June 1998 to an $18 million settlement to pay  
for community service, natural resources and recreation projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The company must rip out all the homes and businesses along  
Front Street, the main drag that runs between the beach and a row 
of shops, and dig down 40 to 60 feet to remove oil-soaked soil. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two buildings were considered historically significant  
enough to save -- they'll be removed intact and replaced once the 
cleanup is complete. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rest, once they're bulldozed, get picked up by a crane and  
turned into mulch,'' Farmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gone are Andy's Munchies, Mr. Rick's Bar, Cafe Avila, 500 Front  
Street Swimsuits, Lighthouse Bar &AMP; Grill, and an old trailer park 
where people paid $350 a month to rent space. Residents must head 
out of town to buy groceries. 
</P>
<P>
	A smelly, 40-foot-deep sand pit as big as half a football field  
and encased by corrugated metal has replaced the colorful 
boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's their beach, we just live here,'' said Bill Price,  
carrying out boxes from his shop, The Sea Barn, which is in line 
for the next round of demolition. ``We live where the debris meets 
the sea.''

<HEADLINE> Old Browns Huddle Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HIRAM, Ohio (AP) -- Wiping the sweat from his brow, Walt Michaels  
looked back over his shoulder toward the ``The Hill'', a steep 
incline on the Hiram College campus that many Cleveland Browns 
remember well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was always hot like this,'' said Michaels, a linebacker  
with the Browns from 1952-61. ``Then we'd end practice and walk up 
that hill. Paul Brown figured it was good for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This weekend, Michaels was one of 120 former Browns back at  
Hiram, Cleveland's summer training home for 23 years, for a reunion 
billed as ``The Boys are Back in Town '99.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Cleveland returning to the NFL this season as an expansion  
team following a three-year hiatus, Browns' fever is back too, and 
thousands of fans walked the picturesque campus in 90-degree heat 
to mingle with their football heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the notable Browns, who paid their own way to the reunion,  
were Hall of Famers Dante Lavelli and Lou ``The Toe'' Groza, Greg 
Pruitt, Don Cockroft, Bob Golic, Frank Minnifield, Milt Plum, Paul 
Wiggin and Webster Slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's new coach Chris Palmer also attended the  
festivities, which were free to the public and included an 
autograph session where fans had Browns sign footballs, helmets, 
T-shirts, cleats and even some seats taken from the old Cleveland 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Michaels, who had Palmer on his coaching staff while with the  
USFL's New Jersey Generals, said he's always admired Browns fans 
for their passion. 
</P>
<P>
	``They know their football and they love their football,'' said  
Michaels, whose son, Mark, works for the new Browns. ``It's one of 
those special NFL cities like Kansas City, Green Bay and Denver. 
Those are the only places you'd see something like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michaels said he enjoys getting together with former teammates  
to remember the good old days. 
</P>
<P>
	``The great thing about reunions are the stories you hear and  
the chance to lie about how good you were,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As Michaels and the other former Browns sat in the college's  
Price Gymnasium, a line of hundreds of fans snaked around the 
building waiting their turn to get autographs. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other fans were letting the Browns come to them.  
</P>
<P>
	Tim Jenks, 41, and Danny Malm, 33, drove Jenks' van painted  
orange like a Browns helmet down from Northeast, Pa., for the 
weekend. As the players made their way across campus, several 
stopped to autograph the van, which has ``Dawg Pound Bound'' 
written on one side and a Browns helmet logo painted on the other. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenks, whose vanity license plate reads, FANATIK, bought the van  
for $600 in 1995, ``right before the Browns left'' and now calls it 
``my bad habit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to drive it to each home game and will have seats in  
the ``section 218 of the Dawg Pound'' at Cleveland's new lakefront 
stadium. While gladly allowing other fans to have their pictures 
taken next to his van, Jenks said he can't wait for the first home 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect to beat Pittsburgh in the opener,'' he said. ``Why  
not?''

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Finds Natural Gas Deposit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea has discovered a natural  
gas deposit off its southeast coast that can be extracted for sale, 
government officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The deposit was found in July, 37 miles from Ulsan, and  
state-run Korea Oil Corp. recently completed two test drillings, 
said the officials at the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and 
Energy. 
</P>
<P>
	All tests proved that commercial extraction of the natural gas  
is economically viable, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deposit is expected to yield between 170 billion and 200  
billion cubic feet of natural gas worth $800 million, or four to 
five months of the nation's gas needs, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Facilities will be installed to begin production before 2002,  
they said. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea began searching for oil and natural gas deposits in  
its continental shelf in 1969. None of more than half a dozen 
deposits found previously proved to be economically feasible.

<HEADLINE> Jaguars' Lageman Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Defensive lineman Jeff Lageman, a key  
component in making the Jacksonville Jaguars competitive early in 
their existence, said Sunday he will retire after 10 seasons in the 
NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the 1998 season, he signed a one-year contract in hopes  
of reaching the Super Bowl for the first time. On the first play of 
the season, however, he tore his biceps and was lost for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	He remained an important presence around the Jaguars locker room  
and in the community, but his absence at Jacksonville's offseason 
conditioning program and lack of contact with coach Tom Coughlin 
made it clear he would not return. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he plans to stay in Jacksonville, where he came as a  
free agent in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important accomplishments of my career have to do  
with some of the things I've been able to do in Jacksonville,'' 
Lageman said. ``And it wasn't all with winning on the field. It was 
some of the leadership things I've been able to help out with. 
Being able to show younger players the right way to be a pro 
athlete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before coming to Jacksonville, Lagemen spent six personally  
successful but frustrating seasons with the Jets. He started 81 of 
the 82 games he played over that span, leading New York in sacks 
three seasons and becoming a fan favorite on a downtrodden team. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking for some veteran leadership on a young team in their  
expansion season, the Jaguars signed him. Lageman recorded the 
final 12 1/2 of his 47 sacks over three full seasons with the Jaguars, 
although it may have been his locker room demeanor that helped the 
team most. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was more than just defense,'' Coughlin said after the  
injury shelved him for 1998. ``He's a solid person in the 
lockerroom, a solid citizen. He's not afraid to give his opinion 
about things, in terms of right and wrong, how he leads his life, 
what he thought was important and wasn't important. He's certainly 
going to be missed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lageman, a three-year starter for Virginia and an All-America as  
a senior, got married in May and plans to continue devoting time to 
several charitable projects. He also serves as a host for a weekly 
fishing show on radio and could be involved with the Jaguars' 
television productions.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Official Warns of Food Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- With pressure building to find out how  
cancer-causing dioxin ended up in some Belgian foods, the country's 
top health official admitted Sunday that the government has no 
system of checking ingredients of animal feed for contamination. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no controls at the entry point of the food chain,''  
said Health Minister Luc Van den Bossche. ``Things can go wrong 
there permanently.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene said a special commission is  
needed to investigate how tainted food ended up on Belgium's dinner 
plates. 
</P>
<P>
	Animal feed contaminated with dioxin led the government to order  
stores to stop selling poultry, eggs, fatty pork and beef and all 
byproducts. The bans, along with nagging insecurity, have kept 
Belgians from eating favorite dishes such as roast chicken, waffles 
and chocolate mousse. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of butchers and bakers were either closed Sunday or  
were planning to close in the coming days because most of their 
products have been discredited or banned since the dioxin scandal 
broke last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The government maintains the problems began when animal fat,  
contaminated with dioxin most likely from mechanical oil, was mixed 
up with 176,000 pounds of feed for poultry, pigs and cattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is having trouble pinpointing which farms used  
the tainted animal feed, forcing officials to keep the products off 
the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	``The major problem remains to separate the suspect firms from  
the others. I still don't have any certainly so I won't publish a 
list,'' Dehaene said. ``There is simply too much at stake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling Socialists criticized the delay.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm scandalized that we are unable to come with a list. I wait  
with impatience for an explanation,'' said Vice Premier Elio di 
Rupo. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgium's health and farm ministers resigned Tuesday after it  
became clear they had known about the problem for a month without 
informing the public or even the prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Dioxin is a byproduct of the manufacture of some herbicides and  
pesticides, and it has been thrust to the center of elections that 
are one week away. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgium has long had problems keeping its food healthy. The  
illegal use of artificial hormones in beef has turned into a 
lucrative fraud racket, highlighted when a hitman killed a 
veterinary inspector a few years ago. Those responsible have yet to 
be brought to trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers over the weekend had to be creative in their shopping,  
especially since fish shops and organic food stores couldn't keep 
up with demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Many sought out Italian salamis or Spanish hams.  
</P>
<P>
	Outside Belgium, other governments quickly adopted measures to  
contain Europe's worst food scandal since Britain's 1996 Mad Cow 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States blocked European Union imports of pork and  
poultry, and Singapore banned all EU meat products. Countries from 
Switzerland to South Korea took similar measures against Belgian 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal broke last week when media reported that fat laced  
with cancer-causing dioxin was used to make poultry feed. It became 
clear the feed also was used for pigs and cattle.

<HEADLINE> Blazers Unable To Solve Spurs' D </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- When it comes to being embarrassed by the  
San Antonio Spurs, the Portland Trail Blazers had a lot of company 
this postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers added their names to the Spurs' victims list Sunday,  
losing 94-80 for a sweep of the best-of-7 series. Since falling to 
Minnesota in Game 2 of the first round, the Spurs have reeled off 
10 straight playoff wins, looking almost invincible in eliminating 
the Timberwolves, Los Angeles Lakers and Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	Admission to that expanding club brought little consolation to  
the Blazers, who for much of the season were under the impression 
that they had the best team in the Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we were capable of beating them coming into the  
series, but they proved that they are the best in the league right 
now,'' Portland guard Damon Stoudamire said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers may be a title contender one day soon, but the Spurs  
became the conference power in just a few short months. San Antonio 
started out 6-8, and lost at Portland 90-85 in mid-March. After 
that, the Blazers lost seven in a row to the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	The key has been the Spurs' consistency on defense, especially  
this series. Portland scored 304 points in the four games, smashing 
the NBA playoff record-low of 323 scored by Cleveland against 
Indiana in the first round last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their interior defense is as good as it gets,'' Blazers guard  
Greg Anthony said. ``They've got those two 7-footers to clog up the 
middle. They're just tough to operate against. They are very 
disciplined, and play together as a team as good as anyone I've 
seen in a long time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't doubt that they'll go on and win the championship.''  
</P>
<P>
	For the second straight game, the Blazers endured just enough of  
a dry spell to allow the Spurs to pull away. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers pulled ahead 59-58 on Stoudamire's runner with 1:40  
left. But Duncan came back on the next possession, put back a miss 
by David Robinson and converted a three-point play to give the 
Spurs a 62-59 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	After Isaiah Rider's two free throws pulled Portland to 64-63  
early in the fourth, the Spurs went on a 17-4 burst, making all 
seven of their shots. 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 3 Friday night, San Antonio used a 16-0 third-quarter  
run to turn a close game into an 85-63 rout. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts,'' said Portland forward Brian Grant, who averaged  
8.3 points in the series after scoring 15.3 in series wins over 
Phoenix and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cried,'' said Stoudamire, who scored 21 points but was booed  
during introductions for his two-point, 1-for-12 shooting 
performance Friday night. ``I think a couple of other guys teared 
up too. This team has been through so much this year. We've had 
people on our backs all year, talking that we would melt down. But 
the guys really do care about winning. We did pull together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers said they're confident they can compete for the  
Western Conference title again next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have a better feel for what it takes the next time  
around,'' Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy said. ``Very few teams ever 
get there without having to pay the price of a learning experience. 
This is a start for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Portland lineup may not be the same, however. Rider can opt  
out of the last year of his contract, although he said he wants to 
return. But Rider said third-year forward Jermaine O'Neal, a free 
agent, won't be back, and more surprisingly, that Anthony wouldn't 
return. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony, who signed a two-year contract for a $2.1 million, said  
only he's keeping his options open. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't afford Greg Anthony. Do your homework,'' Rider said.

<HEADLINE> Duval Is Ready for U.S. Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) -- Even though David Duval finished six strokes  
behind Tiger Woods in the Memorial Tournament on Sunday, Duval said 
he's primed for the U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2 in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm real close to having everything where I want it,'' Duval  
said after his 2-under 70 left him tied for third at Muirfield 
Village Golf Club. ``If I play as well as I did this week or even a 
little bit better, I'll be pretty pleased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval said he was never able to make the one shot he needed to  
apply pressure to Woods, who played in the group behind Duval. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was right where I wanted to be through eight holes,'' said  
Duval, who trailed by four shots at that point. ``I had a good look 
at No. 9, a good look at No. 10. But they weren't as close as I 
would have liked. Those might have made a difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Behind Woods by five strokes to start the round, Duval said  
Woods' superlative play -- he shot a final-round 69 to finish at 
15-under 273 -- never left an opening. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to balance being aggressive and being stupid,'' Duval  
said. ``I choose to make 15-footers instead of forcing shots in 
there. ... I just didn't make shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *JANZEN PREPARES:* Defending U.S. Open champion Lee Janzen said  
he was coming to the Memorial Tournament not so much to win as to 
prepare himself to defend his title at Pinehurst. 
</P>
<P>
	He gave himself a barely passing grade in meeting that goal.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've got less to work on next week than I did a year ago,'' he  
said. ``I'm still in the same spot. I'm still not making any putts 
outside 10 feet. On the days I hit it good, I play pretty well. But 
if I don't, it's about impossible to make a birdie.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BROWNE'S RUN:* Olin Browne started the day tied for 30th, 10  
shots behind leader Tiger Woods. He had about as much chance of 
winning the Memorial Tournament as Buster Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe because he had so little to gain, Browne played as if he  
had nothing to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played aggressive golf today and was rewarded for it,'' he  
said after shooting a 7-under 65 that left him at 9-under 279. ``It 
was really a fun day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He hit a 20-foot birdie putt on No. 1 and pushed the  
accelerator. He had two-putt tap-in birdies at Nos. 5 and 7, both 
par-5s, rolled in a 10-footer at No. 11 and an 8-footer at 12. Then 
at No. 14, he chipped in from the back fringe for another birdie 
and then got up and down for birdie at 15 to go 4-for-4 on the 
par-5s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time I got into a jam I managed to save myself,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He said since he had no chance of catching Woods, he was free to  
go at pins and take chances. He knew the front-runners, Woods and 
Vijay Singh, weren't going to crumble in the 90-degree heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tiger's at the top of his game and Vijay had a career year  
last year and already has won once this year and is one of a hand 
full of players you look at every week,'' Browne said. ``What you 
have is two of the marquee guys going at it mano-a-mano. They have 
proven in the past they're entirely capable of handling situations 
and not only that, but abusing the golf course and the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MEMORY LAPSE:* Ever wonder how golfers are able to remember  
every club, distance and shot during their round? 
</P>
<P>
	It's selective memory, a compartmentalization of facts and  
figures that is astounding to duffers who have difficulty just 
remembering what their 18-hole score was. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can ask me a club I hit two years ago and I'll remember,  
but ask me who I played with last week on Saturday and, if it was 
one of those days, I couldn't tell you if you gave me 20 guesses,'' 
Justin Leonard said.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged higher against the yen early  
Monday on the strength of the U.S. economy. Japanese stocks 
advanced moderately. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 122.34 yen in early trading, up 0.72 yen from  
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its New York level of 122.22 
yen late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average added 142.75  
points, or 0.88 percent, moving to 16,443.50 in the first 30 
minutes of trading. On Friday, the Nikkei closed up 73.25 points, 
or 0.45 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar gained ground against the yen  
as investors were reassured by fresh U.S. government data 
underscoring the strength of the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said Friday that the U.S. unemployment rate  
dipped to a 29-year low of 4.2 percent in May, although payroll 
jobs increased but a fraction of what was expected. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 126.64 yen, up from  
125.29 late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices started moderately higher after  
Friday's advance on Wall Street and the yen's decline against the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Also boosting the stock market was news that the government  
decided Friday to close Toho Mutual Life Insurance Co., a troubled 
medium-sized Japanese insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said problems at Toho were known, though some worry that  
more financial institution closures could happen in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some risk for another financial institution to fail,''  
said Tsuyoshi Nomaguchi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Financial Supervisory Agency ordered the closure  
of Toho Life. The company's liabilities were found to have exceeded 
its assets by 200 billion yen ($1.64 billion). 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section gained 9.56 points, or 0.73 percent, to 1,326.09 in 
early trading. The TOPIX closed down 1.16 points, or 0.09 percent, 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government bond was  
unquoted early Monday. It settled at 1.635 percent late Friday, 
with its price standing at 97.97 yen.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Rapper and businessman Percy ``Master P''  
Miller came back to the housing project where he grew up and threw 
an all-day party. 
</P>
<P>
	Officially, he came to shoot a video for ``Hoody Hooo'' -- the  
new single by Tru, the rap trio of Master P and his younger 
brothers, Corey ``C-Murder'' Miller and Vyshonn ``Silkk the 
Shocker'' Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	But the thousands who crowded around the stage and hung out of  
windows in the B.W. Cooper project also got lots of food, a parade, 
free T-shirts and Master P action figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Master P said many people have been asking when he would do  
something in New Orleans. ``I said whenever I did another big 
video, I'm going to take it home. That's what I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The whole production will cost about $1.5 million, Master P  
said. ``Da Crime Family,'' the Tru CD that contains ``Hoody Hooo,'' 
was released Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Kilborn Gets Part in Soap Opera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Late night's smuggest talk show host has broken  
into daytime soaps. 
</P>
<P>
	After begging for a spot on ``The Bold and the Beautiful,''  
Craig Kilborn has earned a small part as a nurse in the June 18 
episode, TV Guide reports in its June 12 issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Kilborn, host of ``The Late, Late Show with Craig Kilborn,''  
will play Nurse Peabody, a male nurse attending to pregnant heroine 
Taylor Hayes, played by Hunter Tylo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a big part,'' Kilborn said. ``I wheel in an  
ultrasound machine and say to Taylor's gynecologist, `If you have a 
problem with it, just give it a light tap on the side.' Then they 
hand me a urine sample, and I put it up to the light and say 'Hmm, 
looks pretty healthy, but I'll check.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kilborn said he's relieved he doesn't have a bigger part on the  
afternoon soap opera. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to confess I've never actually seen the damn show,'' he  
said. ``I wanted to be on it because I really love the title.''

<HEADLINE> How To Get People To Exercise? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Getting nonexercisers off their couches begins  
with getting them to put exercise on their minds. 
</P>
<P>
	How to do this still puzzles researchers. But they do know it is  
not easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We definitely don't know that much, but we're learning,'' said  
Brad Cardinal, assistant professor of sport and exercise psychology 
at Oregon State University, Corvallis. 
</P>
<P>
	Surveys show 20 percent to 25 percent of Americans get no  
exercise, and another third get too little to improve their health. 
The numbers don't change much from year to year, despite a stream 
of scientific discoveries on the health benefits of doing at least 
some physical activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Even people who would be expected to pay attention don't, said  
Cardinal's colleague, Tim White of Oregon State. ``I'm astounded by 
people who had heart disease, when they get out of direct 
supervision, will drop back to the 25 percent level,'' he said. 
``If that doesn't get you going, I don't know what will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What it takes to nudge those people into exercise has been an  
understudied area, Cardinal said. But researchers are finding there 
is a multistage process by which some nonexercisers start doing 
healthful physical activity -- and some even turn into athletes, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The process begins with those who are not exercising and not  
thinking about it. Some of these people, called 
``precontemplators,'' will respond to information about the gains 
that can be made through physical activity, Cardinal said. Among 
the benefits are a lower risk of death from causes including heart 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``Initially, all we ask is to move from `I'm not thinking about  
it' to `thinking about it,''' Cardinal said. 
</P>
<P>
	It has to be a soft sell, because pressure to get these folks to  
become physically active probably won't work, Cardinal said. And if 
they have strong objections, ``we tell them, `Let's talk in 6 
months,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If these people start thinking about about becoming more active,  
they are now ``contemplators,'' Cardinal said. ``The idea is now, 
`Let's get them to prepare,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At this point, the nonexercisers might respond to ideas on how  
to fit activity into a busy schedule, such as keeping a time diary 
to spot any free periods. Or the contemplators might be shown 
targets of opportunity, such as taking the stairs instead of the 
elevator, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	This easy-hit approach fits current federal guidelines of at  
least 30 minutes of physical activity, in blocks of as little as 10 
minutes, on most days, White said. ``The exercise lite prescription 
is that incremental activity -- little acts in the course of the day 
-- add up,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A person ready to try exercise could use a lot of support,  
Cardinal said. Those who want to use clubs will have to find a 
convenient one with hours that fit their schedule; those who will 
work out at home may need a few exercise videos and maybe some 
equipment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Next comes the crucial part -- the baptism by fire, when the  
activity is just beginning. Picking up a new habit requires a 
person to overcome obstacles. New exercisers need rewards for their 
good work, such as a subscription to a health magazine, Cardinal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	They also need forgiveness when they lapse -- and lapse again --  
along with encouragement to keep trying, Cardinal said. And if the 
original exercise program turns out not to fit the individual, 
there has to be a fallback, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	People who make it six months as new exercisers can be  
considered to have started the habit and become ``maintainers,'' 
Cardinal said. But they still can become discouraged and give up. 
They may have had overly optimistic expectations of how their 
workouts would change their bodies, and decide exercise hasn't done 
what they wanted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people make it past the maintainer stage and turn exercise  
into a major part of their identity, Cardinal said. These 
``transformers'' don't see problems as barriers to exercise, but 
simply as obstacles to be hurdled. They also see themselves so much 
as exercisers that they sell the idea to others, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cardinal and White say America doesn't make it easy to get  
healthful physical activity. America has so many reasons to sit on 
its duff -- from escalators and elevators to TV remotes and computer 
terminals -- that activity has to be re-engineered into daily 
living, White said. 
</P>
<P>
	This designed-for-comfort ethos ought to be reversed, for health  
reasons, Cardinal said. For instance, buildings could have 
stairwells in the center and elevators on the side, so people would 
be encouraged to walk rather than ride, he said.

<HEADLINE>  Space Shuttle Returns to Earth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- With an unusual nighttime shuttle  
landing safely accomplished, NASA turned its attention Sunday to 
uncertainties about the next flight and follow-up trips to the 
space station. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia is supposed to lift off next month with an X-ray  
telescope, but the mission is in question because of doubts about 
the motor needed to boost the $1.5 billion observatory to the right 
orbit. And the Russian Space Agency's money problems and delays in 
building the space station go on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always hope for the best, plan for the worst,'' NASA  
Administrator Daniel Goldin said moments after Discovery landed, 
completing a successful delivery run to the new international space 
station. 
</P>
<P>
	As for launching the Chandra observatory by the end of July,  
Goldin noted: ``At this point, I am not satisfied.'' The mission 
may well slip into 2000, he acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Russia's ability to meet its space station commitments,  
he said: ``I have cautious optimism ... sometime in July, we'll 
take a good, hard look and then we'll freeze the (assembly) 
schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's been frozen -- and unfrozen -- numerous times before.  
</P>
<P>
	All that momentarily was set aside as Discovery emerged like a  
ghost ship from the night sky and touched down at 2:03 a.m. on 
Kennedy Space Center's floodlighted runway. Infrared cameras 
tracked the shuttle's approach. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only the 11th time that a space shuttle landed in  
darkness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Welcome home, Discovery, from the first docking mission to the  
international space station,'' radioed Mission Control. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to be home,'' replied commander Kent Rominger.  
</P>
<P>
	The astronauts skipped the traditional shuttle walkaround and  
picture taking, and instead asked to be driven straight to crew 
quarters. They left Goldin and other top managers waiting on the 
landing strip, fueling speculation that one or more of the crew 
might be nauseous as sometimes happens to returning astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA insisted the astronauts were fine and merely eager to be  
reunited with their families. 
</P>
<P>
	During their 10 days in orbit, Rominger and his crew  
accomplished everything they set out to do. They unloaded 2 tons of 
supplies at the space station for future inhabitants, replaced bad 
electronic boxes, and installed mufflers over noisy fans. On their 
way home, they dropped off a glittering, mirrored satellite called 
Starshine that schoolchildren will track until it falls out of 
orbit at the beginning of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuttle program manager Ron Dittemore said the astronauts, along  
with everyone else involved in the mission, did ``a super job and 
made everything look so easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Astronauts aren't due back at the space station until December,  
when they're supposed to haul up more supplies aboard Atlantis. But 
that mission cannot take place -- and neither can any other missions 
to the 6-month-old space station -- until the Russians launch a 
crucial service module that will double as crew quarters. The 
component is scheduled to fly in November, 1 1/2 years behind 
schedule, provided all the testing between now and then goes well. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's more immediate concern involves Columbia and the Chandra  
telescope, also running a year late because of a multitude of 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The upper-stage motor on Chandra is similar to one that  
malfunctioned aboard a military satellite in April, leaving the 
spacecraft in a uselessly low orbit. An Air Force investigation 
into the failure continues. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, NASA is proceeding toward a July 22 launch of Columbia,  
the only shuttle big enough to hold the 45-foot telescope. Goldin 
stressed, however, that he won't give the final go-ahead until 
``the NASA team walks into my office and says they understand 
exactly what went wrong, they understand how it was fixed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASA has until mid-August to send Columbia on the  
telescope-delivery mission without impacting other shuttle 
missions, Dittemore said. The problem is that NASA's oldest shuttle 
is due for its regularly scheduled tune-up and, unless it flies 
soon, it will have to undergo eight to nine months of maintenance 
before launching Chandra. That would bump the mission -- the first 
to be commanded by a woman -- into late 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it takes a year, it will take a year,'' Goldin said. ``Time  
is not an issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cost for each month Chandra remains on the ground: $6  
million to $8 million.

<HEADLINE> USA Women Beat Canada in Soccer 4-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Instead of the dominant performance it has  
come to expect, the United States women's soccer team got a wake-up 
call heading into the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Mia Hamm had one goal and two assists Sunday as the United  
States fought off a tenacious Canadian national team 4-2 in the 
Americans' final exhibition before the third women's Cup begins 
play in less than two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did a good job of disrupting us from the beginning,''  
said Hamm, whose 109th international goal extended her own record. 
``They played a very distinct style and won a lot of first and 
second balls, which we didn't do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team struggled with its timing and organization for  
much of the game. Canada led 1-0 and was tied 2-2 late in the first 
half, but Kristine Lilly's goal in the 45th minute gave the United 
States the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
	Charmaine Hooper scored both goals for Canada, which lost its  
13th straight game to the United States, a streak dating to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Tiffeny Milbrett, playing in her hometown for the first  
time with the U.S. national team, had a goal and assist. Former 
University of Portland teammate Shannon MacMillan added an assist 
on Cindy Parlow's insurance goal, the only one of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Canadians played hard; they put our defense under  
pressure,'' U.S. coach Tony DiCicco said. ``It was a strong game 
for us, just a couple of breakdowns that are very correctable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team improved to 15-2-1 this year, including 9-1 in a  
Nike-sponsored ``Road to Pasadena'' tour. Its only losses this year 
came to China, which along with Norway will be one of USA's 
toughest challengers for the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The team will take a week off before traveling to New Jersey to  
prepare for their World Cup opener June 19 against Denmark at 
Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada opens against Japan the same day in San Jose, Calif.  
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team played tentatively in the first half, and its  
failure to mark the speedy Hooper led to a surprising 1-0 deficit 
in the seventh minute. Hooper took a cross from Jenette Haas and 
headed it past goalie Briana Scurry in the left corner of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States tied it four minutes later on a goal by Hamm,  
who took a pass from Milbrett, ran toward the left post and fired 
it past goalie Karina LeBlanc. 
</P>
<P>
	``That first goal gave us our edge back and got the crowd back  
into it,'' said Hamm, whose record 108th goal came in a 3-0 win 
over Brazil May 22, breaking the mark of 107 by Italy's Elisabeth 
Vignotto. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of 23,325 was the largest to watch a U.S. women's  
exhibition on American soil, except for doubleheaders that included 
a men's game. The previous largest crowd was 17,358 in May 1997, 
when USA played England in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	``This crowd is getting us geared up and ready for the crowds  
that we're going to encounter in the World Cup, and the kind of 
game we're going to encounter,'' Milbrett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Portland is one of seven host cities for the third women's World  
Cup. A total of 425,000 tickets have been sold for the tournament, 
including 65,000 for the opening doubleheader at Giants Stadium.

<HEADLINE> Simpson Living With the Notoriety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Forget the glory days of gridiron triumphs,  
Hertz commercials and movies that endeared him to millions. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years after his ex-wife and her friend were found dead  
outside her Brentwood condominium, the defining event in O.J. 
Simpson's life is the case that became what many called the Trial 
of the Century. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a legacy that leaves him dismayed with both the news media  
and an American public still fascinated by a man acquitted in court 
but convicted in the minds of many. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone used this as their cause, and I've learned to live  
with it,'' Simpson said in an interview with The Associated Press. 
``It isn't about me anymore. It's about having a scapegoat. 
</P>
<P>
	``People need something to argue about,'' he says. ``I listen to  
these talk shows and I think our country is bored. How else can 
they keep these stories going for so long? I guess we can't deal 
with our lives, so we sit around talking about someone else's 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a moment of reflection, Simpson adds, ``The O.J. case  
evidently has become part of people's lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On June 12, 1994, Nicole Brown Simpson was slashed to death  
along with Ronald Goldman. Simpson, tried for the murders, was 
acquitted in 1995 and released from jail to begin his life anew 
amid a backlash from those who believed he got away with murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Both victims' families sued him in civil court and won judgments  
of $33.5 million in damages in 1997 from a jury that held him 
liable under a different standard of proof. That verdict is still 
on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Simpson successfully challenged paying the award and  
lives well today on a hefty pension plan he set up when he was 
making millions. Such pensions are exempt from civil court 
judgments, although any money Simpson earns would be seized 
immediately by the court. 
</P>
<P>
	His life today is shaped by those boundaries, but Simpson exudes  
a cheerful personality. ``My premature retirement is not as bad as 
it's cracked up to be,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	The years of his superstardom are a dim memory.  
</P>
<P>
	``I play golf. I raise two kids. I don't go out. I live the  
simplest, most regulated life, not the life I imagined for myself. 
But I find it rewarding,'' he says. ``I have two terrific kids, I 
have friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is a girlfriend named Christie, but he avoids discussing  
the relationship. His priority now, he says, is caring for Justin, 
10, and Sydney, 13. He drives them to and from school and attends 
their athletic events. The children live with him while his 
in-laws, Lou and Juditha Brown, battle for custody. Recent reports 
have indicated an amicable settlement is near, but neither side 
wants to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson, whose Brentwood home was sold in foreclosure and torn  
down by the buyer, rents a Pacific Palisades home for $6,000 a 
month, drawing $25,000 a month on his $4 million pension. In 
another spectacle last February, lawyers for the Goldmans and 
Browns auctioned personal property seized from the home, garnering 
$430,000, more than half of it from a man who bought Simpson's 
Heisman trophy to impress his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	His older children, Jason and Arnelle, visit frequently and his  
sister, Shirley Baker, spends large amounts of time with him and 
the children. His longtime housekeeper and secretary remain loyal 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson adamantly maintains he did not kill his ex-wife and her  
friend and he insists the case will be solved eventually. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the likelihood of someone else being arrested,  
Simpson says, ``I have no doubt it's going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few private detectives are working on their own time, he says,  
following leads they occasionally bring to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``If one day there's a new D.A., my goal is to take this stuff  
to him and tell him to look into it,'' Simpson says. 
</P>
<P>
	``If tomorrow I was able to solve this case, I wouldn't spend  
one day at the trial of those people,'' he adds. ``They (messed) up 
my life, but I don't feel the disgust people displayed toward me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those public displays have become rare, he says, part of what  
Simpson believes is the potential for a normal life. He was able to 
take his children to see the ``Star Wars'' prequel at a local 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
	``I signed about 100 autographs,'' he says. ``People were  
hugging me. They were very nice except for one guy who yelled 
something. I know if the media was there, that's all they would 
have reported.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A golfing enthusiast, Simpson is forced to play on public  
courses because the exclusive country clubs don't want him. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, he was accosted by a man with a gun outside the  
Griffith Park golf course. He wrestled with the man and chased him 
by car, but he got away. No one was ever arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eventually I'm going to move,'' he says, probably to Florida.  
A recent house-hunting expedition there again produced headlines. 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles or elsewhere, he realizes the case will persist.  
For Simpson, the day that changed his world is never far from 
memory. ``It seems like a lifetime ago and at times it seems like 
yesterday,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> Dane Wins U.S. Cycling Road Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Jakob Piil of Denmark outsprinted four  
riders to win the First Union USPRO cycling championship Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-year professional rider Piil, 26, of the Danish Acceptcard  
team, was helped by teammate Morten Sonne, who dropped back to help 
Piil reach the leaders in the final three laps of the 156-mile 
race. Piil collected $33,500 for the win. 
</P>
<P>
	Marty Jemison, 34, of Salt Lake City, took the U.S. Professional  
Road Championship Jersey as the top American finisher, ending up 
fifth overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Piil said he was riding in all the attacks and credited Sonne,  
who finished fourth overall, with helping him take first place. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a big victory for me. Sonne knows I am powerful in the  
sprint so he wanted me up there,'' Piil said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's First Union Liberty Classic, Petra Rossner of  
Leipzig, Germany, sprinted to her third consecutive win, beating 
second place Karen Dunne of Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 72-mile women's race, Rossner, 32, of the German National  
team, launched her sprint in the final 200 meters, pulling more 
than a bike length ahead of second place Celestial Seasonings' 
Dunne. Hanka Kupfernagel of Berlin, who rides for Greenery Hawk, 
took third in the sprint , securing her lead in the World Cup 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossner took home $10,000 for first place.

<HEADLINE> Driver Hurt in Nebraska Bus Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRETNA, Neb. (AP) -- Thirty-two passengers traveling to a concert  
by charter bus escaped serious injury Sunday when the bus struck a 
cement support column below a highway overpass. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver, Elmer McNish, 69, apparently fell asleep or suffered  
from an unknown medical condition, said Sarpy County Sheriff's Sgt. 
Don Voss. 
</P>
<P>
	McNish was in fair condition after being taken by helicopter to  
a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Some passengers were treated for broken bones but most had  
bumps, bruises and scrapes, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus, operated by Eppley Express, left the interstate,  
traveled about 100 yards and hit a cement support below the 
Nebraska Highway 31 overpass. It went up an embankment and came to 
rest slightly at a tilt but otherwise upright. It wasn't known how 
fast the bus was going. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash occurred on Interstate 80 about 10 miles southwest of  
Omaha. The group, from Grand Island and Kearney, was traveling to a 
concert in Council Bluffs, Iowa.

<HEADLINE> Klan Leader Says He Was Attacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A Ku Klux Klan leader says someone threw a  
tear gas grenade into his house early Sunday while he was asleep in 
front of the television. 
</P>
<P>
	The Klansman claims his attackers were a government ``killing  
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	C. Edward Foster, who identified himself as the grand wizard of  
the Invisible Empire of the Pennsylvania Ku Klux Klan, said he 
suffered burns to his face and chest and his eyes stung from the 
tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was fire, smoke. I had blood all over me. They threw an  
incendiary grenade with CN gas in it. That's the real hard gas the 
government would throw in a building to get you out,'' said Foster, 
who called The Associated Press to report the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the injuries he described, Foster refused medical  
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania state police were investigating the incident in  
Walston, a small coal town just north of Punxsutawney, which is 
about 65 miles northeast of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a killing team connected to the government,'' Foster  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	State Trooper Guy Felmlee said he has found no evidence of  
government involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't what he's talking about there,'' Felmlee said.  
</P>
<P>
	Foster was convicted in 1969 of sexually assaulting a college  
student, burning her car and fatally spearing her dog with a pool 
cue. He was sentenced to two years in a county facility.

<HEADLINE> Some Tips To Reducing Allergies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here are some tips to reduce dust mites-- without spending a lot  
of money: 
</P>
<P>
	--Wash all bedding, including blankets, mattress pad and  
comforters, in hot water every week. 
</P>
<P>
	--Buy a dehumidifier and keep humidity below 50 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--If you have curtains, wash weekly. Blinds are easier to clean.  
</P>
<P>
	--Remove carpeting from the bedroom. Linoleum and hardwood floors  
are best. 
</P>
<P>
	--Put mattresses and pillows in plastic covers. Tape over length  
of zippers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Don't sleep on upholstered (stuffed) furniture.  
</P>
<P>
	--Remove stuffed furniture and stuffed animals (unless the  
animals can be washed) and anything under the bed. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dust often.  
</P>
<P>
	--Don't use aerosols or spray cleaners in the bedroom.  
</P>
<P>
	--Cover bedroom air vents with several layers of cheesecloth to  
lower the number of allergens coming from outside. 
</P>
<P>
	--Avoid using a vacuum cleaner. If vacuuming must be done, a dust  
mask may help.

<HEADLINE> Duval Is Ready for U.S. Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) -- Even though David Duval finished six strokes  
behind Tiger Woods in the Memorial Tournament on Sunday, Duval said 
he's primed for the U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2 in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm real close to having everything where I want it,'' Duval  
said after his 2-under 70 left him tied for fourth at Muirfield 
Village Golf Club. ``If I play as well as I did this week or even a 
little bit better, I'll be pretty pleased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval said he was never able to make the one shot he needed to  
apply pressure to Woods, who played in the group behind Duval. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was right where I wanted to be through eight holes,'' said  
Duval, who trailed by four shots at that point. ``I had a good look 
at No. 9, a good look at No. 10. But they weren't as close as I 
would have liked. Those might have made a difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Behind Woods by five strokes to start the round, Duval said  
Woods' superlative play -- he shot a final-round 69 to finish at 
15-under 273 -- never left an opening. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to balance being aggressive and being stupid,'' Duval  
said. ``I choose to make 15-footers instead of forcing shots in 
there. ... I just didn't make shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *JANZEN PREPARES:* Defending U.S. Open champion Lee Janzen said  
he was coming to the Memorial Tournament not so much to win as to 
prepare himself to defend his title at Pinehurst. 
</P>
<P>
	He gave himself a barely passing grade in meeting that goal.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've got less to work on next week than I did a year ago,'' he  
said. ``I'm still in the same spot. I'm still not making any putts 
outside 10 feet. On the days I hit it good, I play pretty well. But 
if I don't, it's about impossible to make a birdie.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BROWNE'S RUN:* Olin Browne started the day tied for 30th, 10  
shots behind leader Tiger Woods. He had about as much chance of 
winning the Memorial Tournament as Buster Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe because he had so little to gain, Browne played as if he  
had nothing to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played aggressive golf today and was rewarded for it,'' he  
said after shooting a 7-under 65 that left him at 9-under 279. ``It 
was really a fun day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He hit a 20-foot birdie putt on No. 1 and pushed the  
accelerator. He had two-putt tap-in birdies at Nos. 5 and 7, both 
par-5s, rolled in a 10-footer at No. 11 and an 8-footer at 12. Then 
at No. 14, he chipped in from the back fringe for another birdie 
and then got up and down for birdie at 15 to go 4-for-4 on the 
par-5s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time I got into a jam I managed to save myself,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He said since he had no chance of catching Woods, he was free to  
go at pins and take chances. He knew the front-runners, Woods and 
Vijay Singh, weren't going to crumble in the 90-degree heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tiger's at the top of his game and Vijay had a career year  
last year and already has won once this year and is one of a hand 
full of players you look at every week,'' Browne said. ``What you 
have is two of the marquee guys going at it mano-a-mano. They have 
proven in the past they're entirely capable of handling situations 
and not only that, but abusing the golf course and the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MEMORY LAPSE:* Ever wonder how golfers are able to remember  
every club, distance and shot during their round? 
</P>
<P>
	It's selective memory, a compartmentalization of facts and  
figures that is astounding to duffers who have difficulty just 
remembering what their 18-hole score was. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can ask me a club I hit two years ago and I'll remember,  
but ask me who I played with last week on Saturday and, if it was 
one of those days, I couldn't tell you if you gave me 20 guesses,'' 
Justin Leonard said.

<HEADLINE> Wrecked Plane's Computers Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Federal investigators removed part of  
the twisted and charred fuselage of an American Airlines jet on 
Sunday in an effort to get to computers that controlled the 
aircraft's mechanical systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The computers could help investigators learn whether Flight  
1420's spoilers, reverse thrusters and braking systems were 
functioning properly when the plane landed in a storm Tuesday night 
and skidded off the end of the runway, broke apart and caught fire, 
killing Capt. Richard Buschmann and eight passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators consider information from the computers crucial to  
determining whether mechanical failure, human error, weather or 
some combination caused the first domestic commercial airline 
deaths in 1 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything is a possible cause. What we need to do is ...  
start narrowing the scope,'' said Greg Feith, the National 
Transportation Safety Board's lead investigator. 
</P>
<P>
	The computers are located in the lower part of the MD-82's  
fuselage, underneath the cockpit and inaccessible until the main 
wreckage is lifted and removed, Feith said. Removal of the larger 
pieces will likely wait until Monday, when a lull in air traffic 
would permit closing a runway to move the hull to a private hangar 
near the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have recovered and are analyzing the plane's  
flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, and have 
interviewed witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``They give us a lot of information but they don't give us all  
the answers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet's spoilers -- panels on the trailing edge of the wings --  
were supposed to be raised at touchdown to break the plane's lift 
and slow the aircraft. Reverse thrusters from the engines are 
usually engaged until the plane slows to a speed at which the pilot 
can safely steer it on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	In a hospital interview Friday, First Officer Michael Origel  
told investigators that he believes the captain set the spoilers. A 
flight data recorder indicates they never popped up when the plane 
landed. 
</P>
<P>
	While much of the early investigation focused on a severe  
thunderstorm -- with wind gusts to 75 mph -- Origel told the NTSB 
that the plane approached the airport through a break in the 
clouds. He said he saw the runway through the entire approach. 
</P>
<P>
	Origel, who was released Saturday from a hospital where he had  
been recovering from a broken leg, also told authorities he 
believed the jet hydroplaned on the runway. Investigators have said 
the runway was adequately grooved and that the jetliner had a firm 
grip on the pavement.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Women's Open Notebook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST POINT, Miss. (AP) -- Grace Park left one last mark on  
amateur golf at the U.S. Women's Open, again outdoing Jenny 
Chuasiriporn. 
</P>
<P>
	In her last event before turning pro, Park set an Open scoring  
record by an amateur with a 5-under 283 at Old Waverly Golf Club to 
tie for eighth place. The 283 is seven strokes better than the mark 
Chuasiriporn set last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad that's it over, this tournament. I was a little bit  
stressed out,'' Park, the NCAA champion from Arizona State, said 
after a closing 1-over 73 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Park became the second player ever to win golf's  
three major women's amateur titles in the same year. She beat 
Chuasiriporn to win the U.S. Women's Amateur. Chuasiriporn had a 
6-over 290 in the Open last year and lost in a 20-hole playoff to 
Se Ri Pak. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Chuasiriporn, who made her pro debut in this year's Open  
by not making the cut, Park does not plan to take any sponsor's 
exemptions into LPGA Tour events with hopes of getting her card. 
</P>
<P>
	Park will instead play the remaining eight events on the Futures  
Tour. She can earn her card by finishing in the top three on the 
money list, or be exempt to the finals of Q-school by finishing 
fourth through 10th on the list. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready to move on,'' Park said. ``I'm looking forward to  
playing in Futures events the rest of the summer. I'm going to 
stick with the Futures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Open exemption was based on her amateur titles, Park  
had to wait until after the USGA championship to turn pro. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other amateur to make the cut, Kellee Booth, shot a  
2-over 290 to match the mark set by Chuasiriporn last year. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PARK PENALTY:* Park's final-round 73 including a two-stroke  
penalty that was almost more costly. 
</P>
<P>
	While searching for her ball in the rough at No. 8, Park's  
caddie stepped on the ball. Park then declared an unplayable lie, 
taking a one-stroke penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until playing partner Sherri Steinhauer pointed it out  
on the next hole did Park realize that she also had to take a 
penalty stroke for the caddie stepping on the ball, even though it 
was unplayable. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the score not been changed to a double bogey instead of a  
bogey before Park signed her scorecard at the end of the round, she 
would have been disqualified and her record score would not have 
stood. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GREEN DROPS:* Tammie Green's streak of five straight top 10  
finishes at the U.S. Women's Open came to an end this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Green finished at 11-over 299, last among the 63 players who  
made into the weekend rounds. It was her worst finish in the 12 
Opens where she has made the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, Green has seven top 10 finishes at the Open, the best as  
runner-up in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *KUEHNE CHAMPION:* Reigning U.S. Amateur champion Hank Kuehne  
was at Old Waverly Golf Club on Sunday to watch his sister, Kelli, 
in the final round of the U.S. Women's Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelli Kuehne played in the final group with champion Juli  
Inkster, but finished in third place -- seven strokes behind Inkster 
and two behind Sherri Turner -- after a closing 2-over 74 that put 
her at 9-under 279. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *IGNORING CRITICS:* Old Waverly founder/owner George Bryan, who  
four years ago convinced the U.S. Golf Association to bring the 
Women's Open to his course, isn't concerned by some of the 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been some controversy about the softness of the golf  
course and controversy about being in the middle of nowhere,'' 
Bryan said Sunday. ``Some people like living in Mississippi. Each 
to their own is the way I look at it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other than that, I think everything's been perfect.''  
</P>
<P>
	Unseasonably mild conditions prior to the tournament kept the  
rough from growing to its usual challenging standards and rain 
earlier in the week softened the greens and fairways. As a result, 
the Old Waverly course yielded record low scores for an Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not embarrassed that some of them are 10, 15 under,''  
Bryan said. ``These girls can play, they are the greatest athletes 
in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DEER HOLE:* Lori Kane and Turner got an up-close look at the  
Mississippi wildlife on the green at No. 9 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	As Turner was preparing to putt, a small deer emerged from the  
trees between the fairways of Nos. 1 and 9. After initially 
stopping in its tracks, the deer sprinted toward the green. 
</P>
<P>
	After making a couple of turns on the front side of the green,  
the deer tried to escape under a nearby grandstand. It instead 
bounced off of the green canvas covering, rolling backwards. 
</P>
<P>
	The spooked deer then got up and leaped over a row of people  
sitting on the ground, running to the openness of the driving range 
and the trees beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
	No spectators were hurt.

<TEXT>
<P>
	INTERLAKEN, N.Y. (AP) -- From a pile of dirt excavated near his  
family's gas station, Mike Potts lifted out a basketball-sized 
boulder, heaved it unsteadily over his head and smashed it against 
another rock. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no crystal inside, as he'd hoped. But embedded in one  
large limestone chunk was a glassy object, shaped a bit like a 
hand. Was it an ancient tree root? A bone from an animal that long

odd-shaped rock?

	``I thought it might be a couple million years old,'' said  
Potts, 34, a mechanic who scours nature as much for physical 
exercise as for any sense of intrigue. ``To find out it's 375 
million years old is kind of a shock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not only that: It is almost certainly a fossil, and no ordinary  
one. John Chiment, a paleontologist at Cornell University, suspects 
the black, grainy-textured stone was once the root of a branching 
glass sponge. 
</P>
<P>
	Such sponges, which are among the simplest forms of animal life,  
are found today miles down in the ocean, in very cold, dark waters. 
At that intense depth, the ocean floor is gelatin-like, and clams, 
shrimp and myriad microscopic creatures have few anchors other than 
sponges to hold onto. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-inch-long find, with its unusual appendages and tiny  
fossils of ancient organisms attached, emerged in November from a 
cavity being dug for a 15-foot-deep gas tank. Potts was persuaded 
to pass it along to Cornell through a neighbor who works at the Ivy 
League school in nearby Ithaca. 
</P>
<P>
	It was no less of an enigma in Chiment's hands, but intriguing  
enough to unleash the kind of exhaustive detective hunt with 
unforeseen twists that is commonplace in the jigsaw-puzzle world of 
paleontology. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiment and graduate student Sande Burr finally found a  
promising match in Volume 21 of a 40-volume chronicle of the 
world's first around-the-world oceanographic survey. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1870s, while dredging the miles-deep waters off the  
Philippines, the crew of the British vessel HMS Challenger 
recovered the only known living specimen of a branching glass 
sponge. It's supposedly secreted away in a British museum 
somewhere. Chiment is hoping he'll soon get to inspect it. 
</P>
<P>
	Distinct from squishy protein bath sponges or hard sponges made  
of calcium carbonate, glass sponges make their skeletons out of 
silica. Those equipped with branches the width of a finger appear 
to be extremely rare. 
</P>
<P>
	Some have been spotted lately using robotic submersibles. There  
may be plenty more in the murky depths. But there's been no sight 
of them thus far in the fossil record of New York, one of the 
world's best-explored strata. 
</P>
<P>
	Heralding Potts' discovery via the Internet then produced a  
surprise: Folks around central New York sent in similar specimens 
they'd picked up over the years. Chiment now has amassed eight 
possible branching glass sponge fossils or ``perhaps an unknown 
group of glass sponges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what we're on to is a locality that is preserving a  
different group of animals than most of the previously very 
well-known Devonian fossil localities around here,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Devonian Period some 410 million to 360 million years  
ago, eons before the advent of birds, dinosaurs and humans, an 
inland sea covered much of eastern North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Judging from the profusion of fossils gathered in New York since  
the 1810s, notably Devonian corals and non-branching glass sponges, 
the standard theory is that this sea was probably never more than 
300 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
	The existence of branching glass sponges would revive an old  
debate about whether the sea was much deeper in spots. However, 
paleontologists believe it's more likely those sponges once 
flourished in sunlight-penetrating waters and then, for whatever 
reasons, retreated to the oceans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe they were pushed out of their preferred habitat by  
something else, say the corals,'' Chiment mused. Or now that 
oceanographers are finding that the ocean abyss seems as rich in 
species as rain forests or coral reefs, ``it may be the opposite. 
All of these questions are still open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because minute marine fauna such as trilobites and brachiopods  
tended to accumulate on them, ancient sponges could turn out to be 
peerless storytellers of ocean evolution, Chiment said. 
</P>
<P>
	And since sponges seem to form part of the mysterious missing  
link between single-celled bacteria and multi-celled animals, 
knowing them better might lend more immediate value -- such as new 
disease-fighting drugs or clues to why some coral reefs are dying. 
</P>
<P>
	While paleontology continually raises tantalizing questions,  
many fossils end up in ``problematica drawers -- all those things we 
don't understand yet because there's little or nothing to compare 
them to,'' Chiment said. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Chiment and Burr are busy consulting glass sponge  
specialists, subjecting their specimens to an array of imaging 
tests and deciding whether to publish their findings. They're also 
appealing to colleagues everywhere to dig through their 
problematica. 
</P>
<P>
	``More and better material could show up and that would be very  
helpful,'' said Warren Allmon, director of Ithaca's Paleontological 
Research Institution, which boasts the world's largest collection 
of Devonian glass sponges. ``This is one of the best explored 
places on earth and new things still keep coming up. Amateurs are 
out there collecting every weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Potts is a convert. He now spends a few hours a week ``standing  
around like a chicken pecking at rocks'' in the woods and fields 
near this village a few miles from Cayuga Lake. ``It's become a 
neat hobby,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Driver Hurt in Nebraska Bus Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRETNA, Neb. (AP) -- Thirty-two passengers traveling to a concert  
by charter bus escaped serious injury Sunday when the bus struck a 
cement support column below a highway overpass. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver, Elmer McNish, 69, slumped over in his seat moments  
before the crash after suffering from an apparent heart condition, 
said Sarpy County Sheriff's Sgt. Don Voss. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's Capt. Jeff Davis said McNish sustained injuries  
stemming from the crash but ``the main reason he is hospitalized is 
a cardiac problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said he had no additional information about McNish's  
ailment, but investigators were confident the crash stemmed from a 
medical problem and that McNish had not fallen asleep. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we spoke to him few hours ago, he said he thought he  
blacked out,'' Davis said. ``At this point, it looks like a medical 
cause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some passengers were treated for broken bones but most had  
bumps, bruises and scrapes, police said. McNish was in fair 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus, operated by Eppley Express, left the interstate,  
traveled about 100 yards and hit a cement support below the 
Nebraska Highway 31 overpass. It went up an embankment and came to 
rest slightly at a tilt but otherwise upright. It wasn't known how 
fast the bus was going. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash occurred on Interstate 80 about 10 miles southwest of  
Omaha. The group, from Grand Island and Kearney, was traveling to a 
concert in Council Bluffs, Iowa.

<HEADLINE> Study of Mentally Ill Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Darren knows exactly what President Clinton  
means when he speaks of the stigma associated with mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old with mild retardation and an anxiety disorder  
realizes some people are put off by his appearance, by his 
trembling hands, as he makes his rounds delivering packages in New 
York City for Bullet Messenger. 
</P>
<P>
	``It bothers me sometimes,'' Darren said. ``I wish I was like  
others, you know?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to deal with it, you know? You have to deal with  
it,'' he said. ``I go out five days a week and try to do the best 
that I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A White House conference Monday seeks to dispel myths about the  
mentally ill and encourage acceptance of people like Darren who 
often are marginalized by society. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing host at the event are the president, Vice President Al  
Gore and their wives. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hard truth is, in too many of our communities and in too  
many of our hearts, mental illness is misunderstood and feared,'' 
Clinton said in his weekly radio address. ``Too many people with 
mental illness are denied the opportunity to fully participate in 
American life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the conference, Clinton is announcing a $7.3 million study by  
the National Institute of Mental Health to explore mental illness. 
He also is notifying health plans that provide care to federal 
workers that they must offer the same coverage for mental illness 
and substance abuse as they do for physical disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, the administration is pressing Congress to pass a  
bill to stop forcing the mentally disabled to give up Medicare or 
Medicaid benefits if they go to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Darren gave up a few hundred dollars a month in federal benefits  
when he went to work for Bullet Messenger. ``Keep myself 
occupied,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That paradox is most unfortunate,'' said Hannah Achtenberg  
Kinn of the League Treatment Center, which has treated Darren for 
11 years and helped place him with the messenger service. The 
center withholds clients' last names to protect their privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal for our people, and their most important goal for  
themselves, is to live like everyone else -- which in our society is 
defined as working,'' Kinn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Darren, who was not invited to Monday's conference, said he  
hopes it might help dispel stereotypes. Kinn welcomed the White 
House attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important that people see each other as people with the  
same goals and desires and frailties,'' she said. ``It's sort of 
the last area in our society where there is a terrible stigma.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than changing policy, Monday's conference seeks to change  
attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the most widely believed and most damaging myths is  
that mental illness is a personal failure, not a physical 
disease,'' said Tipper Gore, the vice president's wife, who 
recently disclosed that she was treated for depression. ``Nothing 
could be further from the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore, a longtime advocate for the mentally ill, took the  
lead in organizing the conference. It will be linked by satellite 
to more than 1,000 sites across the nation, with veteran newsman 
Mike Wallace, who also overcame depression, acting as host. 
</P>
<P>
	Five cabinet secretaries and more than 20 members of Congress  
from both parties are to participate in the daylong session at 
Howard University. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton issued an executive order Friday to eliminate the  
government's stricter hiring and promotion standards for mentally 
disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
	As the conference opens, Clinton is serving notice to the 285  
health-care groups serving the Federal Employees Health Benefits 
Plan that they will have to offer mental health and substance abuse 
treatment on par with treatment for other disabilities if they want 
to stay in the plan. The step was expected to raise the plan's 
mental health premiums by about 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope it will serve as an incentive for other employers to  
be model employers around the country,'' said Chris Jennings, the 
president's adviser on health care policy.

	NATO Insists Bombing Will Continue  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Insisting it will continue bombing  
until it sees the dust of departing troops on the road, NATO warned 
the Yugoslav military today to stop using the ``final round'' in 
Kosovo to shell innocent civilians and neighboring Albania. The 
alliance said it had also knowledge of mass looting by Serb forces 
in Kosovo while its military leaders are discussing the technical 
details of the withdrawal of the 40,000 troops from the province. 
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said ongoing talks between Yugoslav and 
NATO generals at an air base in northern Macedonia could be 
extended for several extra sessions. 

</P>
<P>
	Cohen: Pullout Timetable `Not Crucial'  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The timetable for a Yugoslav military  
withdrawal from Kosovo is not as important as ensuring the pullout 
is accomplished without delays, Defense Secretary William Cohen 
said today. The main concern, Cohen told ABC, is making sure that 
``there is no slow-rolling here. We are not going to allow any kind 
of deliberate policy of delaying day by day.'' Cohen also said the 
Russians, who have not agreed on participation in the 50,000-member 
NATO-led peacekeeping force, are welcome to join but they will be 
under a NATO commander and will not occupy a separate section of 
Kosovo.

construction of Jewish settlements in land claimed by the 
Palestinians but will not dismantle existing settlements, according 
to draft guidelines for Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak's emerging 
coalition published today. The guidelines, published in the Haaretz 
newspaper and confirmed by Barak spokesman David Ziso, show Barak's 
determination to assume power soon -- with or without outgoing Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line Likud party. Barak met 
today with acting Likud leader Ariel Sharon in their second meeting

	Jordan Cops Confiscate Racy T-Shirts

<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Authorities have confiscated dozens of  
T-shirts with lewd messages from markets in this conservative 
Muslim nation, a newspaper reported today. Among the milder 
messages on the T-shirts were ``I am ready for sexual offers'' and 
``Buy me,'' according to the daily, al-Aswaq. Some people had no 
idea what the English words were or meant. ``What a shame, I never 
thought about the meaning,'' said a 21-year-old woman, wearing a 
white T-shirt with ``I am trash'' on it. Police are investigating 
the source of the goods.

says Internet users in 15 European countries have coordinated 
efforts to win a reduction in costs, including a flat-rate charge 
for local calls, similar to that in the United States. The 
countries where Internet users were participating in today's 
boycott, the campaign says, are Austria, Belgium, Britain, the 
Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, 
Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.

	PARIS (AP) -- Andre Agassi, seeking a rare career Grand Slam,

the next two to tie the score in the French Open final today. After 
losing the first two sets, 6-1, 6-2, Agassi won the next two 6-4, 
6-3. Medvedev, the lowest-ranked player ever to reach the French 
Open final, easily dominated the first two sets, but Agassi turned 
the match in the third. Agassi, seeded 13th, is trying to become 
only the fifth man to win all four major events. He won the 1992 
Wimbledon, the 1994 U.S. Open and the 1995 Australian Open.

<HEADLINE> Racial Suit Divides Boeing Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- A racial discrimination lawsuit that once  
united Boeing's black workers has now divided them, the result of a 
$15 million settlement labeled fair by one side, unjust by the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason I gave up $30,000 is because it didn't give me any  
remedy to what was going on,'' said Kevin Biglow, a Boeing worker 
who opted out of the settlement. ``And you can't buy me off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Racial discrimination concerns in 1996 led to a class action  
lawsuit against Boeing, whose black workers claimed they were 
passed over for promotions and were later threatened for 
complaining about it. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Boeing and attorneys for the plaintiffs reached  
agreement on a consent decree -- which lays out how Boeing would 
avoid racial discrimination in the future -- and the $15 million 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	But since then, accusations of greed and deception have clouded  
what many thought was a triumph for Boeing's black work force. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy centers on a disagreement about the effect the  
consent decree will have on workers facing discrimination at the 
plants and the amount of money people will get from the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates say the consent decree offers real change for workers  
and that those fighting the agreement are only trying to get more 
money out of Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the deal say the decree is worthless and the  
settlement payments not enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics also accuse the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the civil  
rights leader who helped broker the settlement, of accepting a 
payoff from Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing Chairman Phil Condit is accused of directing multimillion  
dollar contracts to two black-owned businesses that may have ties 
to Jackson's Rainbow-PUSH Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's office has denied the allegations, and Boeing has said  
the charges are based on hearsay. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed deal, about 12,900 past and present Boeing  
workers would share $7.3 million. The largest payments would go to 
the more than 200 named plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys representing the workers would get $3.8 million,  
including $750,000 for reviewing the claims and monitoring the 
conditions of the proposed consent decree. 
</P>
<P>
	The remainder would go to Boeing diversity programs. The deal  
calls for Boeing to revamp its Equal Employment Opportunity system, 
implement a nondiscrimination layoff policy, address promotion 
practice complaints and create a system to monitor problems. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge in Seattle has postponed until Sept. 23 a  
hearing to determine if he will approve the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing Wichita employee David Roberts, who supports the  
settlement, said workers need to give the decree a chance to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of these people out there that's in this lawsuit, they  
want to basically say, 'We want a million dollars apiece. Let's 
bring Boeing to their knees,''' Roberts said. ``Let's think about 
this. You bring Boeing to its knees, who have you hurt? 
</P>
<P>
	``Boeing's a big company. Boeing would look mighty stupid to put  
anything in writing that they're not prepared to stand by.''

<HEADLINE> Stewart Flirted With NASCAR History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOVER, Del. (AP) -- For quite a while Sunday, Tony Stewart looked  
like he was about to make history. 
</P>
<P>
	He dominated the middle segment of the MBNA Platinum 400 before  
finishing fourth to Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Bobby Labonte. 
Stewart was trying to win in just his 13th Winston Cup start. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was attempting to become the first rookie to win a race  
since the late Davey Allison in 1987. Allison won for the first 
time in his 14th start. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't pay for the first three-quarters of the race,''  
Stewart said. ``But we're happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With four top-five finishes in the five races he should be.  
Still, he wanted the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little disappointed,'' he admitted, ``I would have liked  
to run up front where I was all day. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of the day, and looking at the big picture, I'm  
very, very happy to be where we are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That would be fifth in the series standings, a lofty position  
for a rookie. But Stewart is no ordinary rookie, considering his 
past as a champion of the Indy Racing League and one of the 
greatest USAC short-track racers ever. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	GORDON'S STATIC: This has been a difficult season for three-time  
Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon. He has had five terrible finishes 
this year, and remains a longshot to win a record-tying third 
straight title. 
</P>
<P>
	But prior to Sunday -- when he moved up two spots in the  
standings with a second-place finish in the MBNA Platinum 400, 
communicating with crew chief Ray Evernham had not been a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was having a lot of trouble hearing on the radio,'' Gordon  
said. ``I couldn't tell if Ray was saying, `Let off and stretch it 
out' or `Go for it, and we're going to hope for a caution.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	They never got the late caution they needed, forcing Gordon to  
pit for a splash of gas. That gave Bobby Labonte the win, the 
second year in a row Gordon has been beaten in an economy run. 
</P>

	JARRETT'S DAY: Dale Jarrett vanished inside his hauler  
immediately after the MBNA Platinum 400, saying he was not feeling 
well. That can happen to a driver on a warm day on a high-banked 
track that saps so much energy. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jarrett, the Winston Cup points leader, wasn't very  
disappointed with his fifth-place finish. With it, he added 18 
points to his advantage over Jeff Burton, and now leads by 51. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just missed the setup a little bit, and just had to hang  
on,'' Jarrett said. ``But we made another top-five out of it, and 
that's the thing you have to do when you're not the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	EARNHARDT'S IDEAS: Dale Earnhardt won seven Winston Cup  
championships by recognizing the need for change when it arises. 
</P>
<P>
	So, after finishing 11th Sunday in the MBNA 400 at Dover Downs  
International Speedway, Earnhardt said he discovered what needs 
altering. 
</P>
<P>
	``We learned something for the next race,'' he said. ``I think  
we learned that we're probably going to bring back another car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even that might not be enough. Earnhardt has returned with  
plenty of new cars after losing efforts on The Monster Mile. He has 
three victories in 41 races at the track -- the last in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	NOT ANXIOUS: Ken Schrader didn't last long, crashing just seven  
laps into the race. And, while he was upset at what he said was a 
tap by Kenny Irwin that sent him sliding into the first-turn wall., 
Schrader wasn't necessarily unhappy about missing the most of the 
400 laps over the Monster Mile. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can you get back in there?'' Schrader was asked as his junked  
Chevrolet was towed to the garage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, I hope not,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But he did, and gained two positions and a few compensatory  
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Schrader wound up 41st in the field of 43, losing for the  
248th consecutive time. The 44-year-old driver from Fenton, Mo., 
hasn't won since this race in 1991.

<HEADLINE> New Lincoln Envelope Unveiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Abraham Lincoln's likeness now appears  
on a new prestamped envelope offered by the U.S. Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Postal Service unveiled the envelope at a ceremony in  
Lincoln's hometown Saturday. It features Lincoln's likeness in 
profile surrounded by a blue background, and will cost 40 cents, 
postage included. 
</P>
<P>
	Like all designs used for U.S. stamps and other postal  
stationery, the Lincoln likeness was chosen by the national 
Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee. It was created by Richard 
Sheaff of Scottsdale, Ariz., who has designed several commemorative 
stamps for the postal service. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted to focus on freedom and democracy,'' said Sue  
Litterly, spokeswoman for Springfield's post offices. ``That was 
why they decided on this particular likeness of Abe Lincoln for 
this particular envelope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The envelopes go on sale nationwide on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Big Leaguer Eddie Stanky Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRHOPE, Ala. (AP) -- Eddie Stanky, a fiery second baseman who  
helped three different teams win National League pennants, died 
Sunday of a heart attack. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanky, nicknamed ``The Brat,'' played 11 seasons in the majors  
and had a career batting average of .268. He led the NL in walks 
three times and in runs scored once. 
</P>
<P>
	He played on pennant winners with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947,  
the Boston Braves in 1948 and the New York Giants in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	When Bobby Thomson hit his pennant-winning homer for the Giants  
in 1951, Stanky ran out of the dugout and jumped on the back of 
manager Leo Durocher, who was coaching third base. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanky ended his career as a player-manager for the St. Louis  
Cardinals in 1953, and later managed the Chicago White Sox and 
Texas Rangers. He managed the Rangers for just one game in 1977, 
then quit because he was homesick. 
</P>
<P>
	His record as a major league manager was 467-435.  
</P>
<P>
	Stanky also was a successful coach at the University of South  
Alabama, where he compiled a 488-193 record during his 14-year 
tenure. After taking over the school's lowly baseball program in 
1969, he led the Jaguars to five NCAA tournaments, two Sun Belt 
Conference titles and two No. 1 rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had played in beautiful parks with beautiful locker rooms,''  
Stanky said. ``At South Alabama, I inherited a rock pile for a ball 
field, with no dugouts, a four-foot-high fence around it and no 
grass on the infield.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanky helped change all that by putting a much improved product  
on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``He brought the University of South Alabama from just about  
point-zero to a national power in three or four years,'' said South 
Alabama coach Steve Kittrell, who played for Stanky at the school 
for three seasons. ``He put South Alabama on the map 
athletically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanky briefly left the school to manage the Rangers in June  
1977. The Rangers beat the Minnesota Twins 10-8 in his first game, 
but Stanky resigned the next day in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Robinson, who was then the Rangers' executive vice  
president, was in his hotel room when he got a call that morning 
from Stanky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Hey. You want to have a cup of coffee?''' Robinson  
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `I'm at the airport.'  
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Why are you at the airport?'  
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `I can't take the job. I'm getting on an airplane.  
I'm homesick for my family.' Then he hung up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanky then flew back to Mobile, where he got his old job back  
at South Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	``The (Texas) players just joked about it,'' said Tom Grieve, a  
former Rangers player who is now a broadcaster for the team. ``The 
players started saying, `Gee. What if we would have lost that game? 
What would he have done then?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanky, who missed the 1980 season at South Alabama after  
undergoing open heart surgery, was a tough, demanding coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was hard to play for,'' said Pete Phillips, who played  
under Stanky at South Alabama. ``He accepted no excuses, but he 
showed responsibility for us as a ballplayer and as a person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanky, who retired in 1983, was an old-style ballplayer who  
wasn't afraid of new ideas. He advocated the adoption of the 
designated hitter -- now used in the American League and the NCAA -- 
more than 20 years before it was approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanky was elected to the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 1977.  
</P>
<P>
	Stanky is survived by his wife, Dickie; three daughters,  
Beverly, Kay and Marianne; and one son, Mike. Funeral arrangements 
were incomplete Sunday.

	On June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee of Virginia proposed to the  
Continental Congress a resolution calling for a Declaration of 
Independence. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	In 1769, frontiersman Daniel Boone first began to explore the  
present-day Bluegrass State. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1848, French postimpressionist painter Paul Gauguin was born  
in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1864, Abraham Lincoln was nominated for another term as  
president at his party's convention in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1929, the sovereign state of Vatican City came into existence  
as copies of the Lateran Treaty were exchanged in Rome.

at Niagara Falls, New York from Canada on the first visit to the 
United States by a reigning British monarch. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1948, the Communists completed their takeover of  
Czechoslovakia with the resignation of President Eduard Benes. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1967, author-critic Dorothy Parker, famed for her caustic  
wit, died in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, Israeli military planes destroyed a nuclear power plant  
in Iraq, a facility the Israelis charged could have been used to 
make nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten years ago: 169 people were killed when a Suriname Airways  
airplane crashed in a tropical forest near the Paramaribo airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago: President Clinton addressed the French National  
Assembly, challenging his generation of Allied leaders to strive 
for greater European unity or face ``the grim alternative'' of 
violence like that in Bosnia. Twelve-year-old Vicki Van Meter of 
Meadville, Pa., completed a trans-Atlantic flight, landing in 
Glasgow, Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: In a crime that shocked the nation, James Byrd  
Junior, a 49-year-old black man, was chained to a pickup truck and 
dragged to his death in Jasper, Texas. (Three white men were 
arrested; so far, one of them, John William King, has been 
convicted of murder and sentenced to death.) At the Tony Awards, 
``The Lion King'' won best musical and ``Art'' was named best play.

<HEADLINE> Accused Killer Claims Sleepwalking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Scott Falater doesn't deny stabbing his wife 44  
times. 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't deny holding her head under water in their swimming  
pool as the life bled out of her. 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't deny stashing the knife and his bloody clothes in his  
Volvo before police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	But he does deny being able to remember anything about it.  
Falater's defense to first-degree murder charges: He was 
sleepwalking. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did it without any conscious thought. He did it because he  
was sleeping,'' defense lawyer Michael Kimerer told jurors at the 
start of Falater's trial. The defense is seeking acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense portion of the case continues Monday, with  
psychologist Janet Tatman facing cross-examination by prosecutors. 
She says sleepwalking is the best explanation for Falater's 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Juan Martinez says the sleepwalking claim is  
nonsense, and he plans to seek the death penalty if Falater is 
convicted. Martinez told jurors that Falater's actions were too 
deliberate to have been the work of a sleepwalker. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, on a night in January, neighbors heard Yarmila  
Falater's screams and moans for up to 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Koons has testified he watched over his backyard fence as  
Falater went inside to wash his hands, ordered his dog to lie down, 
then rolled his wife's body into the pool and held her head under 
water. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimerer and Falater's family describe him as a mild-mannered  
family man, a devoted husband and father. 
</P>
<P>
	``He couldn't kill anybody,'' said his father, Fred Falater.  
</P>
<P>
	But Martinez has said there were problems in the Falaters'  
marriage, and has a request pending to allow a witness to testify 
that, in the months before her death, Mrs. Falater said she once 
caught a sexually transmitted disease from her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Sleep disorder experts say it is possible for people to perform  
complex tasks -- and even kill -- while sleepwalking. Experts for 
Falater's defense cite his childhood history of sleepwalking and 
the stress of overseeing a failing computer chip for Motorola as 
strong backing for his claim. 
</P>
<P>
	Falater also had been trying to fix a faulty swimming pool pump  
that evening, and the defense speculates his wife interrupted him 
while he was trying again to fix it in his sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is possible to trigger a violent reaction by interfering  
with them (sleepwalkers),'' Tatman testified for the defense 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez has his own panel of experts who are skeptical of  
Falater's story. 
</P>
<P>
	Falater's efforts to hide evidence, in particular, strike some  
experts as highly unusual. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems so well planned,'' said Steven Lenik of the Sleep  
Disorder Center at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have covered it up and hidden it is a little more involved  
than what the typical sleepwalker does,'' Lenik, who is not 
involved in the Falater case, told KTAR radio in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Convincing a jury could be just as difficult, said Northeastern  
University law professor Rose Zoltek-Jick. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea that someone can argue they did precise, deliberate  
acts and that they were sleepwalking seems to the average mind sort 
of absurd,'' Zoltek-Jick said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sleepwalking defense did work for Kenneth Parks, who was  
acquitted in Canada on murder charges for the 1987 stabbing death 
of his mother-in-law. One of the experts in Parks' case, Dr. Roger 
Broughton, is a defense witness for Falater. 
</P>
<P>
	But the prosecution also is ready to cite that case. Martinez  
said Friday he has talked to a coworker of Falater who is prepared 
to testify that Falater talked about the Canadian case a few weeks 
before he killed his wife.

<HEADLINE> National Library Needs Leak Fixes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When it rains, it leaks.  
</P>
<P>
	That is the story at the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum in  
Boston, which houses thousands of photographs, Kennedy's 
presidential papers and Ernest Hemingway's letters and manuscripts. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say the leaks are not threatening the collections. But  
some are bad enough that during a hard rain buckets have to be 
placed in strategic spots, preferably out of public sight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of them are fairly minor,'' said Brad Gerratt, the  
library's director. ``But when you see water coming into the 
building, you want to take some action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So does the National Archives and Records Administration, which  
includes the Kennedy and nine other presidential libraries. The 
agency predicts it will cost $6 million to $7 million to fix the 
leaks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to take remedial action by the year 2002, in any  
case,'' said the archives' spokesman, Gerald George. The archives 
may request the first part of the money from Congress for the 
fiscal year starting Oct. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerratt is not worried about what may happen in the meantime  
because consulting engineers who studied the leaks last summer 
found no imminent threat of drastic deterioration. Some leaks 
temporarily were patched during that evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm comfortable with their recommendation that we have a  
couple of years left,'' Gerratt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, no one wants to wait too long.  
</P>
<P>
	The nine-story library, built in the late 1970s on Dorcester Bay  
just south of Boston, houses all materials from the Kennedy White 
House, including the president's notes, records and files. Also 
stored are records of presidential friends and associates, 
including the president's brother and attorney general, Robert F. 
Kennedy, speechwriter Ted Sorensen and national security adviser 
McGeorge Bundy. 
</P>
<P>
	The collection includes several hundred thousand photographs  
that were part of the official White House collection, gifts 
Kennedy received as president and gifts that were sent to his 
widow, Jacqueline, after Kennedy was assassinated Nov. 22, 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	The library also houses Hemingway's papers, including letters  
and manuscripts of his books. 
</P>
<P>
	Hemingway's widow, Mary, was able to travel to Cuba to retrieve  
her husband's belongings in the tense period after the 1961 Bay of 
Pigs invasion with a visa granted by the Kennedy administration. 
She offered the papers to the library in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the leaks are in archival and museum storage areas,  
although important papers are kept away from problem areas, Gerratt 
said. Other leaks are in the front lobby windows, office windows, 
the library's glass pavilion and roofs on the second, third and 
ninth floors. 
</P>
<P>
	The library's entrance plaza also needs rebuilding. It has  
waterproofing problems, and the granite paving system is buckling 
due to clogged expansion joints and poor drainage. 
</P>
<P>
	Such problems ``endanger the facility and its holdings,''  
according to an internal archives document. ``It is imperative that 
these problems be addressed as quickly as possible to prevent 
further deterioration and to ensure that the irreplaceable holdings 
of the library are protected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the leaks, the library's seawall is deteriorating. If  
left unchecked, the document said, that problem could endanger the 
site and patrons.

<HEADLINE> Hurting Blue Jays Lose Top Starter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Chris Carpenter, Toronto's most consistent  
starter this season, will miss Monday night's assignment against 
the New York Mets because of a tender right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Roy Halladay will pitch in place of Carpenter.  
</P>
<P>
	Carpenter approached surprised club officials on Saturday and  
told him his elbow was puffy and sore. 
</P>
<P>
	He had an X-ray taken, which proved inconclusive. Carpenter  
later went to Birmingham, Ala., to see orthopedic specialist Dr. 
James Andrews. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a little inflammation there, but right now nobody  
knows what it is,'' Blue Jays manager Jim Fregosi said. ``If 
there's a problem, I presume he'll have it taken care of there. If 
not, I guess he'll come back and be ready to go fairly soon. We'll 
have to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite being pegged as the fifth starter coming out of spring  
training, Carpenter leads the team in innings pitched (74 1-3), 
complete games (two) and is the only regular starter with an ERA 
under five (3.63). 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't mention any problems with his elbow after his last  
start, a 9-7 win over the Chicago White Sox last Wednesday in which 
he pitched 6 1-3 innings and gave up three runs to improve his 
record to 4-5. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it's nothing bad,'' said fellow starter Kelvim Escobar.  
``Carp's been our best starter. We need him.''

<HEADLINE> Clemens Knocked Out in Third Inning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Roger Clemens was knocked out by the New York  
Mets in the third inning Sunday night in his attempt to win his 
21st straight decision. 
</P>
<P>
	After breezing through the first inning, the New York Yankees  
ace allowed four runs in the second and three in the third, 
including a two-run homer to Mike Piazza. Clemens was replaced by 
Todd Erdos after allowing an RBI single to Benny Agbayani. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets, who began the night with an eight-game losing streak,  
broke loose in their first game since firing pitching coach Bob 
Apodaca, hitting coach Tom Robson and bullpen coach Randy Niemann. 
Dave Wallace, Mickey Brantley and Al Jackson took over the 
respective jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time this season that Clemens has left a game  
facing a big deficit. On April 27 at Texas, Clemens was trailing 
5-0 after two innings when he was lifted because of tightness in 
his hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees rallied to win that game 7-6, and preserve Clemens'  
streak, which is now the longest in AL history. Clemens has not 
lost since May 29, 1998, against Cleveland, while pitching for 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens has 10 no-decisions and a 3.07 ERA during the streak. He  
is tied with Rube Marquard for the third longest in history. Roy 
Face won 22 straight decisions for the Pittsburgh Pirates from 
1958-59. Carl Hubbell has the major league mark of 24, set with the 
Giants in 1936-37. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens allowed seven runs and eight hits in 2 2-3 innings.

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Veterans Recall D-Day Heroics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France (AP) -- Some stood still on Omaha  
Beach, staring poignantly at a tide once turned red by the blood of 
their comrades. Others avidly shared war tales in bunkers once 
occupied by enemy snipers. 
</P>
<P>
	While NATO and Yugoslav generals discussed a peace deal for  
Kosovo, American World War II veterans gathered Sunday along 
France's Normandy coastline to commemorate the 55th anniversary of 
the D-Day landings, the first breach of Hitler's Atlantic wall. 
</P>
<P>
	Now gray-haired and many needing canes for support, an estimated  
1,000 U.S. veterans, accompanied by at least 1,500 family members, 
retraced some of their steps along beaches, cliffs and roads where 
thousands were gunned down in a deafening hail of German machine

<HEADLINE>  U.S. Veterans Recall D-Day Heroics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France (AP) -- Some stood still on Omaha  
Beach, staring poignantly at a tide once turned red by the blood of 
their comrades. Others avidly shared war tales in bunkers once 
occupied by enemy snipers. 
</P>
<P>
	While NATO and Yugoslav generals discussed a peace deal for  
Kosovo, American World War II veterans gathered Sunday along 
France's Normandy coastline to commemorate the 55th anniversary of 
the D-Day landings, the first breach of Hitler's Atlantic wall. 
</P>
<P>
	Now gray-haired and many needing canes for support, an estimated  
1,000 U.S. veterans, accompanied by at least 1,500 family members, 
retraced some of their steps along beaches, cliffs and roads where 
thousands were gunned down in a deafening hail of German machine 
gun fire and mortars.

	CLOVERDALE, Calif. (AP) -- A van carrying church group members on  
a camping trip ran off a highway embankment Sunday and plunged 50 
feet into a creek bed, killing one person. Twelve people were 
injured, two critically. 
</P>
<P>
	A caravan of about 50 members Redwood City-based Templo de la  
Luz was traveling south on U.S. Highway 101 near Cloverdale when 
the van, carrying 13 people, blew a tire and tumbled off the road. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident, which occurred about 1:30 p.m., shut down the  
state's main coastal highway in both directions for an hour, the 
California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people were airlifted to Sutter Medical Center in Santa  
Rosa, where two men were in critical condition with multiple 
fractures and other injuries. No information was immediately 
available about the other person. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight men and a boy were taken to Ukiah Valley Medical Center,  
where all but one were in stable condition. One man was in fair 
condition.

<HEADLINE> Man Sets Self on Fire at Courthouse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WESTMINSTER, Calif. (AP) -- A man who had been ordered to stay  
away from certain county and city offices set himself on fire 
outside a courthouse and ran burning through a line of people 
waiting to pay traffic tickets, police and witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	Muhammad Akram Qureshi, who suffered second- and third-degree  
burns over 80 percent of his body, died Saturday at University of 
California, Irvine Medical Center in Orange, police spokesman Lt. 
Phil Marshall, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Qureshi, 50, poured an accelerant over his head in front of the  
West Justice Center on Friday and ignited himself with a pack of 
matches, then ran burning through a line of people waiting to pay 
traffic citations. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Qureshi lit himself on fire, he appeared to be praying in  
front of the courthouse, said homicide Detective Rich Mize, one of 
about two dozen witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	A commissioner on Thursday had ordered Qureshi to stay away from  
the Islamic Society of Orange County, the Board of Supervisors, 
Garden Grove police station, Garden Grove City Hall and the offices 
of the county counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	Qureshi had been feuding with the Islamic group since it banned  
him in March 1997 for disruptive behavior, members said.

<HEADLINE> Charismatic Has Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- D. Wayne Lukas was pleased.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've had just three of the most beautiful works you'll ever  
see,'' the Hall of Fame trainer said early Sunday morning at 
Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	He was talking about the workouts of three 2-year-old colts from  
his barn. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-year-olds are a symbol of hope in horse racing, especially  
in the spring, a year away from the testing Triple Crown races. 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours later, the 3-year-old colt Charismatic was led from  
Lukas' barn, put on a van and taken to a nearby veterinarian clinic 
for surgery. Four screws were put into his left foreleg to repair 
fractures of the cannon bone and sesamoid. 
</P>
<P>
	What happened to the great grandson of Secretariat on Saturday  
while finishing third behind Lemon Drop Kid and Vision and Verse in 
the Belmont Stakes in an unsuccessful bid for the Triple Crown was 
a reminder that injury and death are only a hoof beat away. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemon Drop Kid, who paid $61.50, is being pointed to the Jim  
Dandy and Travers in August at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic will never race again. His career now will be that  
of a stallion. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was absolutely a maintenance-free horse,'' Lukas said of  
the robust chestnut colt. ``He's had one vitamin shot since I've 
been training him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Stephen Selway, who performed the 2 1/2-hour surgery on  
Charismatic, said the injury ``was not the worst of this kind I've 
ever seen, but it was a nasty one. He'll be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selway said Charismatic's left leg was fitted with a cast, and  
if he is shipped by airplane, he should be ready to travel in a few 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything went smoothly in terms of everyone getting to the  
horse quickly,'' Selway said. ``I don't know if Chris Antley 
necessarily saved his life, but he certainly helped in preventing 
any further damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 63-year-old Lukas, as familiar with the ups and downs of  
racing, of the adulation and criticism as anybody, said one of his 
duties Sunday was to lift the spirits of his employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to keep going,'' he said. ``I told them, `Boy, aren't  
we lucky the way the horse is handling this. He's going to have a 
future. We didn't lose the horse.''' 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 85,818, the largest in New York racing history, was  
attracted by Charismatic's bid to become the 12th Triple Crown 
champion and the first since Affirmed in 1978. They also came for a 
possible showdown between Charismatic and the filly 
Silverbulletday, winner of 11 of 12 starts, who was making her 
debut against colts. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday finished seventh in the 12-horse field, one spot  
ahead of Menifee, the runner-up in the Derby and Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd cheered the duel between Charismatic and  
Silverbulletday for the first mile of the testing 1 1/2-mile classic. 
Fans roared as Charismatic tried mightily to hold off Lemon Drop 
Kid and Vision and Verse in the stretch. Then the crowd turned 
quiet as not long past the wire, jockey Chris Antley pulled up 
Charismatic and dismounted. Soon the horse ambulance arrived to 
take the stricken warrior back to his barn. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a certain element of the public, even my wife (Laura),  
who is a (quarter-horse) trainer, that can't handle this part of 
the game,'' Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't always play out these Hollywood scripts the way we  
want to,'' Lukas added. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic had caught the public imagination by going from  
running in a claiming race in February to challenging for the 
Triple Crown in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Scotty Schulhofer, trainer of Lemon Drop Kid, who  
finished ninth in the Kentucky Derby and skipped the Preakness, nor 
Bob Baffert, Silverbulletday's trainer, were at Belmont Park on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Schulhofer's son and assistant, Randy, said his father went home  
to Hallandale, Fla., for a break and would return Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	As Lemon Drop Kid crossed the finish line, a head in front of  
Vision and Verse, with Charismatic another 1 1/2 lengths back, Randy 
Schulhofer turned to his 72-year-old father and said, ``Do you 
believe that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I do,'' said the trainer who has maintained Lemon Drop  
Kid is as nice a colt as he's had in his Hall of Fame career. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Bill Mott said plans were uncertain for Vision and  
Verse, the Illinois Derby winner, who was trying to become the 
first Belmont winner not to have started in the Kentucky Derby or 
Preakness since the Schulhofer-trained Colonial Affair in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Hutton, an assistant to Baffert, said Silverbulletday will  
be flown back to Churchill Downs at Louisville, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Baffert praised jockey Jerry Bailey for ``wrapping  
up'' the filly and not using her when it became apparent in the 
upper stretch she could not win. 
</P>
<P>
	Antley was praised by owner Bob Lewis and Lukas for his quick  
action on pulling up Charismatic when it became apparent to him 
something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Antley's action in sending Charismatic to press the pace-setting  
filly through the first mile before taking the lead approaching the 
quarter pole, was questioned by some observers, but not by Lukas. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had to draw it up on paper, I wouldn't have had him that  
close,'' Lukas said, ``but he was doing it so easy. You don't' want 
to give up anything that comes easy in a horse race. The horse is 
always right.''

<HEADLINE> With ABL Gone, WNBA Starts Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- OK, so the WNBA won. Now what?  
</P>
<P>
	After 2 1/2 seasons, the rival American Basketball League has  
folded, leaving the Women's National Basketball Association as the 
only women's pro league in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12-team WNBA begins its third season June 10, buoyed by the  
infusion of ABL talent, the star power of Chamique Holdsclaw, 
unionized players and expansion teams in Orlando and Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think we've proven beyond a doubt the existence of an  
audience for women's professional basketball,'' WNBA President Val 
Ackerman said. ``We've found we have a very different fan base than 
the NBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crowds consisting mostly of women and families boosted the  
league average to 10,000 fans per game last season. That's more 
than double the 4,000 average projected for the league's first 
season in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	As a testament to the WNBA's success, four more teams will be  
added in 2000. Seattle, Portland, Denver, Indianapolis, Miami and 
Toronto are vying for a franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, all the top talent will be in a WNBA uniform. The  
ABL filed for bankruptcy before Christmas, handing its rival 
several Olympians and All-Americans among the 35 ABL players 
selected in the 50-player WNBA draft last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the ABL, it was great to play a full (winter) season, but  
no one knew the players,'' said Sue Wicks of the New York Liberty. 
``Now in the WNBA, you'll be able to see all the best players. 
You're going to meet some new stars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 11-week WNBA summer season will introduce Yolanda Griffith  
in Sacramento, Natalie Williams in Utah, DeLisha Milton in Los 
Angeles, Jennifer Azzi in Detroit, Dawn Staley in Charlotte, 
Jennifer Rizzotti in Houston and Katie Smith in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Holdsclaw, a four-time All-American who led Tennessee to three  
consecutive national titles, was the No. 1 pick by the Washington 
Mystics. 
</P>
<P>
	Touted as the Michael Jordan of the WNBA, Holdsclaw is expected  
to be the league's crossover star. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no doubt that she is going to be a very, very  
successful pro,'' Ackerman said. ``We recognize that now is the 
time when we really need to test the strength of our audience. We 
have to be in a position where we are not only winning over new 
fans, but we are bringing back our old fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old Holdsclaw -- wooed constantly in college by shoe  
companies -- recently signed a five-year contract with Nike. But she 
admits she's no Air Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an honor to be considered in the same breath, but I'm not  
Michael Jordan,'' she said. ``I'm the first Chamique Holdsclaw. And 
I think that is where the women's game has to get to, when women 
are recognized on their own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 156 players in the WNBA formed a players' union last fall. A  
dispute over salaries delayed the draft one week before both sides 
signed the league's first collective bargaining agreement in April. 
</P>
<P>
	While the four-year contract set a salary scale for draft picks,  
minimum salaries for rookies and veterans, guaranteed contracts at 
midseason and provided a year-round health and benefits package, 
former ABL players took a substantial pay cut from their $80,000 
average salary. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal increased the minimum salaries from $15,000 to $30,000  
for veterans and $25,000 for rookies, plus a 5 percent pay raise 
each year. A handful of top players in the league have personal 
service contracts of $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we got were the bare minimums, but we're satisfied with  
that because women's basketball has to win out above everything,'' 
said Cynthia Cooper, the two-time league MVP of the Houston Comets. 
``Four or five years from now, things will be different. There is 
room to grow with the salaries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the court, two-time defending champions Houston remains the  
team to beat. Orlando, with former Purdue coach Carolyn Peck, and 
Minnesota, guided by former ABL Columbus Quest coach Brian Agler, 
will be among those trying to dethrone the Comets. 
</P>
<P>
	Peck coached the Boilermakers to the NCAA title over Duke in  
March, and Agler built consecutive ABL championship seasons at 
Columbus. His Minnesota Lynx team has five former Quest players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the WNBA now is the elite league in the world, and I  
think all the fans, the media, the coaches and the players will see 
that in a short period of time,'' Agler said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ABL is not going away quietly. Attorneys general in  
California, Illinois, Connecticut, Ohio and Washington began an 
antitrust investigation into whether the WNBA used illegal tactics 
to limit the ABL's television and sponsorship opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABL, a fall-winter league that opened in 1996, played a  
44-game season. It had six sponsors and a limited number of 
regular-season games televised on Fox Sports Net when the league 
folded. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the WNBA has had a dozen sponsors since the  
league's inception, including Sears, General Motors, American 
Express and Anheuser-Busch. 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA will televise three games a week on NBC, ESPN and  
Lifetime. The inaugural All-Star game at Madison Square Garden will 
be televised on July 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans will also see a new hand checking rule in effect this  
season and an extended playoff format. Six teams will make the 
playoffs, with a one-game quarterfinal followed by a best-of-3 
conference finals and championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The playoffs start Aug. 24 and end no later than Sept. 5.  
</P>
<P>
	The former ABL players used a larger international ball and will  
need to adjust to the smaller collegiate ball used by the WNBA. The 
upside is more players may attempt to dunk. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been dreaming about it,'' said Griffith, the No. 2 draft  
pick by the Sacramento Monarchs. ``I can throw the ball down, and 
this ball is small. I'm going for it -- if we're winning.''

<HEADLINE> Investors Little Less Enthusiastic / Ticker Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If the Federal Reserve wants investors to start  
thinking a little harder about the risks they take, it is getting 
some results. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Fed's statement on May 18 that it was considering a  
tighter credit policy, the markets have given telltale signs that 
the people who buy and sell stocks and bonds feel more cautious. 
</P>
<P>
	The most obvious evidence has been a 31 percent drop in prices  
of Internet stocks on the Dow Jones Internet Commerce Index, the 
speculative stars of the late 1990s, from their April high. 
Analysts say the same story is being told elsewhere -- for instance, 
in the bond market, where the spread in yields has widened between 
ultrasafe Treasury securities and riskier high-yield and 
international bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investor enthusiasm has ebbed for a while,'' says Byron Wien,  
investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Or in the words of Jim Griffin at Aeltus Investment Management  
in Hartford, Conn., ``The new monetary bias makes the risk 
assessment of investment options seem more important than the 
calculation of potential reward. Fear is making inroads on greed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ostensible cause for the Fed's change of attitude was  
concern that inflation might be reviving in the producing and 
consuming economy, as evidenced by a 0.7 percent jump in the 
consumer price index for April. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond that, though, Alan Greenspan, the central bank's  
chairman, has long made it plain that he keeps a close watch on 
inflation in securities prices as well. Two and a half years ago, 
he issued his famous warning about ``irrational exuberance'' on 
Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The new notes of caution come just as confidence has been  
increasing about the chances for worldwide recovery from the Asian 
financial crisis of the past two years. That helps explain a recent 
pickup in the pace of business in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	To some observers, a little worry about credit-tightening is a  
happy alternative to the deflation scare that swept through the 
markets last summer and fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Essentially, what the market continues to do is unwind the  
real economic fear of last year, which motivated investors to own 
the safest vehicles in each asset class,'' says Greg Smith, chief 
investment strategist at Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``For bonds, the safest vehicle was U.S. Treasuries, while in  
stocks investors deemed the large-cap growth stocks the safest. The 
world now is economically safer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Smith's view, that helps encourage investors to venture into  
economically sensitive industrial stocks, and the shares of 
medium-sized and smaller companies, all but ignored in the narrow 
market of the past couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the data over the next few weeks will confirm  
that a small amount of inflation is not a problem when examined 
realistically,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists on the Street also note that the world economy still  
has a long way to go to recover from the jolt it has suffered 
lately. In that setting, they say, it's very unlikely that the Fed 
would take severe steps to push interest rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
	David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International  
Inc., says the depressing effect of the Fed's recent jawboning on 
emerging-market bonds ``revealed that markets that had appeared to 
be functioning smoothly for several months in fact remain quite 
fragile and vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lesson was clear: Other markets, and other countries'  
economies, would suffer if the base interest rate in the U.S. were 
raised. Surely, Fed officials were watching.''

<HEADLINE> Dems Predict First Lady Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two New York Democrats predicted Sunday that  
Hillary Rodham Clinton would win the state's Senate race in 2000. 
Republicans signaled the first lady will be hounded because she 
never has lived in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton has not announced her candidacy but has said she  
will form a committee to help raise and spend money, the first step 
toward becoming a formal candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hillary Clinton will generate enormous respect and will win,''  
said Rep. Nita Lowey, the Democratic congresswoman who abandoned 
tentative Senate campaign plans to get out of the first lady's way. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said although Mrs. Clinton has not  
lived in New York, her message of ``bread-and-butter issues that 
affect people's lives'' is one that resonates across America. 
</P>
<P>
	There was little doubt among Republicans or Democrats questioned  
on Sunday's television news shows that Mrs. Clinton will run in 
2000 to succeed retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	But her chief political adviser, Harold Ickes, was quoted as  
saying it remains possible she might not run at all. In an 
interview with The Washington Times, Ickes said that prospect would 
come about only because of ``a very severe set of circumstances'' 
that might include poll numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have treated this as something that has moved beyond  
the point of no return,'' Ickes said. ``Clearly she reserves the 
right to withdraw if circumstances warrant it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the two principal GOP candidates, Rep. Rick Lazio, said  
on NBC that his expected primary against New York Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani will not necessarily harm the party. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans will be unified against Hillary Clinton for so  
many different reasons, on philosophical reasons but also because, 
listen, she doesn't live here,'' Lazio said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's never lived here. She hasn't worked here. She hasn't  
spent one day of her life in New York outside the Plaza hotel. ... 
Everybody in New York realizes that this is not about serving the 
people of New York. This is about personal power, and they reject 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lowey said Mrs. Clinton will beat either Giuliani or Lazio  
because ``New Yorkers care what you are for rather than where you 
are from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schumer also brushed off such carpetbagger complaints.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Founding Fathers ... left it up to each state to determine  
the residential qualifications, and different states have different 
ones,'' Schumer said on ABC's ``This Week.'' In New York, he said, 
``Most of us are children or grandchildren of immigrants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing on NBC, Republican national chairman Jim Nicholson  
said, ``There are a lot of people in New York who could have served 
very well in the Senate. ... I think there's some real serious 
questions about whether a liberal like Hillary Clinton can win in 
New York today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans were not unanimous in putting down a Clinton New  
York run. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said on CNN's ``Evans,  
Novak, Hunt &AMP; Shields'' that Mrs. Clinton would be ``certainly a 
terrific candidate.'' And, she said, ``I think that she and Rudy 
Giuliani are going to have a great race, and I think that either of 
them would be very good senators for their areas of influence.''

<HEADLINE> Jones Wins 100, Morrison Wins Bonus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- In a meet hurt by the withdrawal of two  
marquee runners, Marion Jones captured the 100-meter race Sunday at 
the inaugural TFA ProChampionships. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones returned to the track where she starred at last year's  
Goodwill Games and easily beat Inger Miller, winning in 11.33 
seconds while running into a strong wind. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was nice to come here and get a victory,'' Jones said. ``It  
was a little disappointing that not more people were here, but it 
will take some time to get spectators out to an event such as 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The meet drew a sparse crowd of 3,184 after Michael Johnson and  
Gail Devers withdrew last week. Johnson, the Olympic gold medalist 
and world record-holder in the 200 meters, withdrew because of the 
death of his grandmother. Devers has hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>
	A random drawing among six TFA events rewarded the women's  
100-meter hurdles winner with a $100,000 bonus, and Melissa 
Morrison won the jackpot payoff. The other events eligible for the 
prize were the women's 100 and 800, the men's 200, 110 hurdles and 
the 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the biggest payoff of my life,'' Morrison said after  
she won in 12.98 seconds. ``With this money, I could pay off my 
Visa bill, my mother's Visa bill and some of her other bills.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The association and its ProChampionships were established in  
April in an attempt to generate track and field interest in the 
United States and to give American athletes the opportunity to 
perform at home. 
</P>
<P>
	The TFA is the first established outdoor pro league and plans to  
have a full schedule of events next year in addition to the 
ProChampionships. 
</P>
<P>
	Devers' absence and the strong wind took some of the luster off  
the women's 100, and the times were not impressive. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people will see my time and say, `We've got her  
now,''' Jones said after running well below her personal best of 
10.65 seconds. ``Let them think that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without Johnson, Maurice Greene, the world's No. 1 in the 100,  
won the 200 in 20.37 seconds. However, after his race he was more 
interested in the women's jackpot race. 
</P>
<P>
	``The winner of this race is my new girlfriend,'' Greene  
proclaimed before it began. ``At least until the $100,000 is 
gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Obadele Thompson, who doubled in the 200, captured the 100 in  
10.29 seconds overcoming a quick start by Jon Drummond. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Wade won the men's 110 hurdles in 13.39 seconds to beat  
Mark Crear and Olympic and world championship gold medalist Allen 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Stacy Dragila set an American women's record with a pole vault  
of 14 feet, 10 3/4 inches, beating the mark of 14-7 1/2. The world mark 
is 15-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Other winners in the 15-event meet were: Noah Ngeny, who won the  
men's mile in 54.66 seconds; Kenya's Paul Bitok, who took the 3,000 
in 7 minutes, 43.11 seconds; Sergey Klyugin of Russia, who won the 
high jump at 7 feet, 5 1/4 inches; John Godina, who took the shot put 
with a throw of 68-0 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	A jumpoff was needed for Lawrence Johnson to win the pole vault  
at 18-8 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	In other women's events, Regina Jacobs won the 800 in 1:59.64,  
Leah Pells of Canada took the mile in 4:30.22, Tisha Waller won the 
high jump with a leap of 6-5 and Russia's Yelena Govorova won the 
triple jump at 46-11 1/2.

	COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- Beetle Bailey has gotten his transfer  
orders to return to the site where he was born.

<P>
	A statue of the famous cartoon character is moving a block west,  
to the site of the University of Missouri campus hangout where

<HEADLINE> Sprewell To Start, Miller To Shoot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell will move into the starting  
lineup and Reggie Miller promises to shoot more in Game 4 of the 
Eastern Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	With both teams still shaking their heads Sunday over the  
unlikely finish to Game 3, the coaches of the New York Knicks and 
Indiana Pacers plotted major strategy changes for Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, who has been unhappy coming off the bench all season,  
will move into the starting five in place of Kurt Thomas as the 
Knicks employ a smaller lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the way I think we can win the series,'' coach Jeff Van  
Gundy said. ``We caught a miracle last night, we all know it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, who has not been a dominating presence on offense, will  
be asked to carry more of the load for the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question I've got to be more aggressive, I've got  
to shoot more -- 15 to 20, even 25 shots,'' Miller said. ``And I 
think that's going to be the case more in Game 4.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks took a 2-1 lead in the best-of-7 series Saturday  
night when Larry Johnson made a rare four-point play with 5.7 
seconds left for a 92-91 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers were still upset with the ruling by official Jess  
Kersey on the play, saying the referee should have disallowed the 
shot since the whistle came at least a half-second before Johnson 
released the shot. But the Pacers also knew that they blew a chance 
to lock up the game by failing to score over the final 3:20. 
</P>
<P>
	``No question a lot of breaks have gone New York's way, but  
we've given them a lot of breaks as well. A few of these games 
we've kind of handed it to them on a silver platter,'' Miller said. 
``We've played terrible the last three minutes of each and every 
game and were lucky to win one of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks, on the other hand, have played poorly in the first  
few minutes of each game. That was one of the reasons why Van Gundy 
has decided to start Sprewell. 
</P>
<P>
	Another concern is the potential for foul trouble with the  
Knicks' remaining big men in the absence of Patrick Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't like that Kurt and (Chris) Dudley were out there  
together when they're both the primary defenders on (Rik) Smits,'' 
Van Gundy said, referring to the Pacers' 7-foot-4 center. 
``Secondly, I didn't like our second unit defense giving up 30 
points in the second quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Van Gundy started Dudley in place of Ewing in Game 3,  
Indiana used 6-7 Chris Mullin to guard the 6-11 Dudley. In Games 1 
and 2, New York had exploited the matchup of Mullin trying to guard 
the faster, stronger Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of being able to go at Mullin, we couldn't. And so it  
really got us off to a bad start, and I think it would continue to 
get us off to a bad start,'' Van Gundy said. ``I know I would have 
made the change if the miracles wouldn't have happened last night, 
and miracles happening don't change what I think we need to do to 
win this series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the Pacers practiced at Madison Square Garden on Sunday,  
Miller vowed to attack his matchup against Allan Houston by trying 
to take him one-on-one. Miller is averaging 15.7 points in this 
series, down markedly from his 23.7 playoff average in the first 
two rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller has attempted 33 shots, including 11 3-pointers, and is  
shooting 42 percent. He attempted only nine shots in Game 3, and 
the Pacers were unable to get him the ball for the final shot in 
Games 1 and 3, although he did win Game 2 with two free throws with 
2 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I think Reggie's too unselfish,'' Bird said.  
``Reggie's got to shoot 15 times a game. I can remember watching 
the Eastern Conference finals when I wasn't coaching and I'd look 
at the newspaper the next day and say: `Wow, you can't win when 
Miller shoots 12 times.' Now I'm in it and he's shooting nine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to getting Miller more shots, Bird says he plans to  
run more plays for Jalen Rose -- especially if Travis Best's groin 
pull keeps him out of the game and forces Rose, averaging 7.7 
points in the series, to be the backup point guard. Best said his 
status was 50-50.

<HEADLINE> No Regrets for Hingis After Tantrum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- After reflecting, but not sleeping, following her  
traumatic defeat to Steffi Graf, Martina Hingis said she has no 
qualms about her tantrums during the French Open final. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't regret anything that I did. That's me, that's how I am  
on court,'' Hingis said after losing Sunday's women's doubles 
final. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably not everyone loves it, but that's the protection I  
have. It is protection for myself against everybody,'' the Swiss 
star said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis repeatedly battled with the umpire and linesmen during  
Saturday's final. She received a warning and was penalized a point. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year-old was repeatedly jeered by the crowd, which  
gradually turned in Graf's favor as the match went on. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can you sleep if you lose a match like that?'' she asked.  
``Not much hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teamed with Anna Kournikova in the doubles final against Venus  
and Serena Williams, there were no tantrums, no contested calls -- 
and a supportive crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	And after her second defeat of the weekend, Hingis was all  
smiles and said she is doing her best to forget her defeat to Graf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to think about it anymore. It's behind me. It was  
yesterday and there is future tomorrow,'' Hingis said after losing 
with Kournikova 6-3, 6-7 (2-7) 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hingis is still clearly upset at the French crowd's  
passionate backing for Graf. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the first time the crowd was against me. I had it a  
few times at this tournament already,'' Hingis said. ``I totally 
had a bit of a breakdown, but only after the match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After her defeat, Hingis shook hands with Graf and immediately  
walked off the court before returning, in tears, in the arms of her 
mother, Melanie Molitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, if it hadn't been for her mother, Hingis said she would  
have probably stayed in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	``Would you go out there if everyone boos you out, if nobody  
wants you to win?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis still feels unappreciated by Roland Garros spectators.

<P>
	``After losing the second set, I was mentally broke. I was not  
just fighting against her, but the whole crowd, the referee, the 
line calls,'' she said. ``It wasn't the way I felt it should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the people don't see how my game is, I don't deserve this  
tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that there is any lack of desire to come back.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll show everybody that I can win this tournament,'' she  
said.

<HEADLINE> N.J. USBL Team To Fold After Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- The owner of the Atlantic City  
Seagulls is throwing in his cards. 
</P>
<P>
	After four seasons with the U.S. Basketball League team here,  
owner Ken Gross said Saturday he will fold the franchise after this 
season because he can't continue taking $100,000-a-year operating 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to look to either move it to another city or I'm  
just going to pack it in, maybe attempt to sell it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going for a third straight championship. We're 15-4. Why  
aren't people coming out? I give away so many free tickets just to 
get people here. But paying customers? There's just not enough to 
make it work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, less than 1,000 people turned out for the Seagulls'  
game against the Long Island Surf at the 2,000-seat Atlantic City 
High School gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is averaging 989 people per game, lowest since it began  
play in this casino city in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Gross, an entrepreneur who owns a Delaware County, Pa.,  
investment firm, hoped that low ticket prices, an exciting product 
and the presence of local players like former Middle Township High 
School standout LaMarr Greer would help the team succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at this,'' he said, surveying the empty stands. ``It's a  
disgrace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Regular fans are similarly disappointed.  
</P>
<P>
	``In Atlantic City, it just seems like sports do not go over  
well,'' said resident Tony Leavitt, 65. ``There's no reason why 
this shouldn't make it. The facility is marvelous. And you can't 
beat the prices. You can take a family of six for $40. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's a resort, and even the people who live here are  
wrapped up in the business of tourism this time of year,'' he 
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Clint Mathis scored in the 64th minute  
and Kevin Hartman made three saves for his league-leading sixth 
shutout as the Los Angeles Galaxy defeated the Kansas City Wizards 
1-0 Sunday in a matchup of Major League Soccer's lowest-scoring 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Mauricio Cienfuegos began the scoring sequence with a pass to  
Cobi Jones, who dribbled past charging goalkeeper Chris Snitko 
toward the goal line and passed back to Mathis for his third goal 
of the season and the team's eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles led 11-10 in shots, with both teams taking three  
shots on goal. Hartman made saves on shots by Nino Da Silva in the 
29th minute, Chris Henderson in the 38th and Digital Takawira in 
the 87th. 
</P>
<P>
	Snitko made two saves, stopping Steve Jolley's shot in the fifth  
minute and Joe Franchino's in the 16th. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones had the best scoring opportunity of the first half when  
his shot in the 35th minute beat Snitko but hit the left goal post. 
Jones also beat Snitko in the 70th minute but his shot also hit the 
left post. 
</P>
<P>
	The Galaxy improved to 6-6, while Kansas City fell to a  
league-worst 1-10. The Wizards beat the Galaxy 2-1 on May 8 for 
their only victory.

<HEADLINE> European Internet Boycott Called </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European Internet users, campaigning to reduce  
local telephone charges, called a 24-hour boycott of the World Wide 
Web on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Campaign for Unmetered Telecommunications says Internet  
users in 15 European countries have coordinated efforts to win a 
reduction in costs, including a flat-rate charge for local calls, 
similar to that in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign, which ran a similar boycott Jan. 31 with seven  
countries participating, also asked all telephone users to join the 
one-day strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The primary goal for Web surfers, who pay by the minute for  
their European local calls, is introduction of unmetered charges 
for connections to an Internet service provider using a telephone 
modem ``to enable everyone who wants to access the Internet without 
incurring open-ended costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	British Telecom Internet Plan this week announced it was  
introducing a toll-free weekend access number for subscribers to 
its plan, who pay a monthly subscription fee. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign welcomed the decision, but said Wednesday that  
users were still tied to a single Internet service provider, ``as 
with all `free' offers so far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The countries where Internet users were participating in  
Sunday's boycott, the campaign says, are Austria, Belgium, Britain, 
the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, 
Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.

<HEADLINE> Sabres' Satan Strikes Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The name inspires smart remarks and dumb  
looks. It happens every time Miroslav Satan puts his credit card on 
the table. 
</P>
<P>
	``They ask me, `Is this really your name?''' the Buffalo Sabres  
forward said. 
</P>
<P>
	His standard response: ``Only in America.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres' appearance in the Stanley Cup finals that begin  
Tuesday night in Dallas ought to clear up any confusion over the 
name of their leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	It's ``SHUH-tan.'' Odds are you'll be hearing it a lot.  
</P>
<P>
	When the Slovakian takes the ice, there are no references to the  
little horned fellow from down below. 
</P>
<P>
	Satan can't melt ice or zap opponents with lightning bolts. Just  
a subtle shift and a little stickwork will do, sometimes a lot of 
stickwork. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's making great plays at both ends of the rink and even  
stepped up his physical play,'' linemate Geoff Sanderson said. 
``Miro's got no panic button out there. Most players tend to rush 
the play, rush the shot. Miro likes to stickhandle almost right 
into the net.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To ensure delivery, Satan occasionally will follow the puck into  
the net. He led the team with 40 goals during the season, then an 
ankle bruise in the first round of the playoffs sidelined him for 
nine games. 
</P>
<P>
	He picked up where he left off with a goal in a 4-2 win over  
Toronto in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great asset to have back in the lineup after the  
injury,'' said Curtis Brown, who centers a new line with Satan and 
Sanderson. ``He showed all year that he's one of the premier 
offensive players in the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A holdout who missed the entire preseason, Satan signed a  
one-year contract with the Sabres at the airport as the team 
prepared to leave off for its season opener in Dallas in October. 
</P>
<P>
	One of 10 Sabres whose contracts expire at the end of the  
season, Satan will remain with Buffalo if he and the Sabres can 
work out the math. 
</P>
<P>
	``He certainly is near the top of the list of priorities,'' said  
Buffalo general manager Darcy Regier, who needed scoring after 
trading holdout Donald Audette this season. Audette was Buffalo's 
leading goal scorer in 1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that we didn't have Audette this year provided him an  
opportunity,'' Regier said. ``We also saw a higher level of 
commitment from Miro. He was more involved in things besides just 
scoring goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Satan, a threat on the power play who also can kill penalties,  
was second to Audette in goals and first in points last season 
while playing only about 12 minutes a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``For about 30 games I was on the fourth line or the third line  
and wasn't playing with guys I wanted to play with,'' Satan said. 
``It was a tough situation for me. I needed something to happen for 
me to break through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A contract squabble kept Satan out of camp. He stepped in and  
made an immediate impact. ``The team wasn't playing very well and 
they decided to use me more,'' Satan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Lindy Ruff upped Satan's ice time to around 20 minutes a  
game and put him on the penalty-killing unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo survived much of the playoffs without Satan, but the  
Sabres are glad to have him back. 
</P>
<P>
	``He helps us offensively and adds to a team that's already  
deep,'' Sabres captain Michael Peca said. 
</P>
<P>
	When he turns too suddenly or stops too quickly, Satan gets a  
sharp reminder of his injury. 
</P>
<P>
	It happened in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference quarterfinals  
against Ottawa. A slap shot by Sabres defenseman Alexei Zhitnik 
struck him square on the right ankle. It took much longer than 
expected to heal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew right away I was done for a game or two,'' Satan said.  
``Then they took X-rays and said it's not broken. It's going to be 
a couple days, maybe a week and I'll be back. But it wouldn't 
heal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Satan returned, he formed a line with Brown and Sanderson.  
They clicked. 
</P>
<P>
	``He creates something almost every time he's out there,''  
Sanderson said. ``Miro's the playmaker on the line. If Brownie and 
I can get the puck back in the offensive zone and look for Miro, 
it's just a matter of getting it to him and getting open.''

<HEADLINE> The Wrist-Radio Is Almost a Reality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Beth Vargo doesn't invite crooks to eat hot lead from a machine  
gun. Rarely is she hogtied aboard a burning yacht loaded with 
dynamite. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Dick Tracy, Vargo is no comic-strip crime-fighter. The  
biggest cliffhanger in her life is whether she'll have to strand 
her husband at the commuter train station. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet she yearns to wear a sleek wrist radio, just like the  
hard-boiled hero with the yellow fedora and bulldozer jaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargo directs a small museum in an old courthouse in the Chicago  
suburb of Woodstock, Ill. It's devoted to seven gritty decades of 
Tracy and his creator, Chester Gould, both largely forgotten in an 
era of George Lucas sci-fi spinoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Vargo doesn't even own a cell phone. Too clumsy and disruptive.  
But she figures that some of Tracy's reliability would rub off if 
she wore his squawk-box, even if she weren't thwarting thugs like 
Flattop, Mumbles and Pruneface. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I forget things, it doesn't go over very well,'' Vargo  
says. ``I need something smaller and more fashionable than a cell 
phone. If they made a wrist radio that was compact and cute, I'd 
wear one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gould first sketched the wrist radio under the cuff of Tracy's  
tailored suit more than a half-century ago. Updated for the 21st 
century with video, computer and cell phone, it remains the Holy 
Grail for gadget freaks and a symbol of ergonomic perfection. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the most enduring among many futuristic instruments that  
Gould created to fight crime. 
</P>
<P>
	When Tracy first cocked his arm and summoned the police  
dispatcher Jan. 13, 1946, the otherwise terse detective filled the 
airwaves with a euphoric chatter exceeding anything he uttered to 
his longtime love, Tess Trueheart. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the most remarkable invention of its age,'' Tracy gushed.  
``It's miraculous. It both sends and receives!'' From that moment, 
Gould highlighted the gizmo with a thick black arrow so readers 
wouldn't miss it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wrist radio is the one thing people always ask to see when  
they come to the museum,'' Vargo says. ``We have a toy model. I'm 
surprised that somebody hasn't made a real one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vargo may be more surprised than ever.  
</P>
<P>
	Engineers at Bell Labs, birthplace of the transistor and the  
laser, are testing minuscule voice, video and computer components 
crammed onto a single computer chip. A communicator using this 
master chip would fit neatly under a shirt sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
	Its developers say the design solves problems of earlier  
prototypes that were too expensive, power-hungry and incoherent. It 
could be in stores within a few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Packing more functions on a single semiconductor chip is  
critical,'' says Peter Gammel, who develops wireless components at 
Bell Labs, the research arm of Lucent Technologies in Murray Hill, 
N.J. ``The Dick Tracy watch is at the forefront of the digital 
parade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prototype was created in 1947, when Dick Tracy was the  
subject of feature films and a radio program, as well as the comic 
strip. The National Bureau of Standards stuffed tiny radio tubes 
into a wristwatch case. It was heralded in Life magazine, but its 
one-mile range was too limited for real cops and robbers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past 20 years, consumer electronics giants from Sanyo to  
Swatch have introduced ungainly digital imitations. Last month, 
Samsung unveiled a wrist telephone in South Korea, but it's twice 
the size of a normal watch. A U.S. release date has not been set. 
</P>
<P>
	The race to develop the wrist communicator recalls the evolution  
of timekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
	Centuries ago, each village had an enormous gear-driven clock in  
a tower that was widely visible. Few townspeople needed their own 
clocks; most were farmers who lived according to the sun's cycles. 
Only now, when computers operate by milliseconds, have clocks been 
reduced to tiny digital units embedded in a myriad of appliances. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's cell phone is the communications equivalent of the  
turn-of-the-century timepiece, the pocket watch. Both contain about 
100 parts. And like the pocket watch, the cell phone is poised to 
become an anachronism as key components shrink. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Greg Blonder of AT&AMP;T Ventures introduced a Dick Tracy  
prototype that unfolded from the wrist into a palm-sized receiver. 
Better, but still cumbersome. 
</P>
<P>
	``A cell phone is not like eyeglasses that seem as if they're  
part of your body,'' says Blonder, who anticipates devices to 
directly communicate thoughts in order to keep conversations 
private. ``How many times have we seen people who are patting their 
pockets and, by the time they find their cell phone, it stops 
ringing?'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Bell Labs, Gammel experiments with combinations of miniature  
components deposited on a silicon chip. The microphone is made of 
layers of thin, semiconducting films etched into a pyramid 100 
microns high. 
</P>
<P>
	A filter made of layers of aluminum nitride is 100 times smaller  
than the ceramic filter used in cell phones. It blocks unwanted 
signals from interfering with the receiver. The inductor, which 
determines the proper frequency, also shrinks to a micron-sized 
wire loop. 
</P>
<P>
	Bundling microcomponents also resolves the problem of sufficient  
power. Larger prototypes required bit batteries, yet couldn't 
operate for years like a watch. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarity is another concern. Most phones strain to understand  
voice-based instructions and conversation crackles. But Gammel's 
microcomponents sound impressively clear. To demonstrate, he played 
the aria ``Nessun Dorma'' from Puccini's ``Turandot''; Luciano 
Pavarotti's tenor peals like a church bell. 
</P>
<P>
	It might be unnerving to hear opera through a wrist instrument  
rather than Dick Tracy barking, ``Piggy the Butcher is wanted for 
murder. Over and out!'' Using opera, Gammel says, demonstrates that 
microtechnology is capable of communicating nuance and grand style, 
not just black-and-white facts. 
</P>
<P>
	Still to be added: Video, text messaging, computing and  
satellite navigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``People always want access to as much communication as they can  
get,'' Gammel says. ``They react very strongly to video. Seeing the 
person you're talking to enhances the human experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone agrees the device would sell, even if it works.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm positive that the technology is there,'' says Boomer  
Christy of Bedford, Ind., who brokers vintage timepieces, including 
the 1940s Dick Tracy caricature watch, on the Internet. ``But after 
Dick Tracy fans are satisfied, who will buy one?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Design gurus say a new device ultimately will fail if it does  
not easily do what people want. No more, no less. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Norman, author of ``The Invisible Computer,'' would combine  
phone and watch with a voice recorder, calendar and address book. 
But no frills: no video or music, no Internet searches, no global 
stock trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wristwatch-TV-phone works best in the comic strip,'' he  
says. ``This disease of feature-itis guarantees complexity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's an argument that even Gammel, the engineer of the ``real''  
Dick Tracy radio, can appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
	For inspiration, all he has to do is lift his wrist. Ticktock! A  
pristine Benrus from the 1930s, which he winds himself.

<HEADLINE> Boxer Roy Jones' Speed Unifies Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BILOXI, Miss. (AP) -- Roy Jones made it look so easy, dancing  
into the ring then around Reggie Johnson, taunting him, dominating 
him from start to finish. He even took time to talk to Michael 
Jordan, who sat ringside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope everyone had as good a time as I did, because I had a  
damn good time,'' Jones said Saturday night after becoming the 
first undisputed light heavyweight champion in 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' speed and quickness gave him a huge edge and a huge  
victory. He won every round on his way to a unanimous decision. 
Every judge had it 120-106 in favor of Jones, who added Johnson's 
IBF title to the WBA and WBC crowns he already had. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roy was real quick,'' Johnson said. ``I didn't have time to  
counter his punches. Coming into the fight, I knew I had to give a 
lot and take a lot of punches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was able to reach only one of those goals -- taking a lot  
of punches. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 40-1 with 33 knockouts, landed 273 punches to Johnson's  
49, and connected with 63 jabs to 16 for Johnson. CompuBox showed 
that Jones landed 210 power punches, Johnson 33. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was carefully guiding the punches,'' Jones said, holding his  
fists aloft. ``I've got radar in these things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It seemed that way. Jones knocked down Johnson twice and  
repeatedly had him wobbling. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who weighed 174 pounds, used a straight right 1:58 into  
the first round to knock down Johnson. The Houston fighter got up 
quickly, but was bleeding from his right eye. 
</P>
<P>
	In the third round, Jones countered a right from Johnson with a  
left-right combination that sent him to the canvas. Again Johnson 
got up quickly and the bell ended the round. By that time, blood 
was streaming from Johnson's eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 171, was only able to fight back in spurts by the  
fourth round. The rest of the time he was backing away or covering 
up. When he managed to get inside, Jones punished him with jabs and 
uppercuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Halfway through the 12-round fight his face was swollen, his  
white trunks streaked with blood. But Johnson, 39-6-1, kept 
answering at the bell. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd, which included a big contingent from Jones' hometown  
of Pensacola, Fla., called for a knockout. There were some boos 
late in the fight when Jones didn't press his attack. Johnson did 
go down in the 12th after a solid right from Jones, but it was 
ruled a slip. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could have pressured him and knocked him out, but why would  
I take a chance on him getting a lucky punch and knocking me out?'' 
Jones said. ``That's not very businesslike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Jones was not completely businesslike.  
</P>
<P>
	He couldn't resist showboating when it became apparent how  
completely he was dominating the fight. At one point, he backed 
Johnson to the ropes, looked at Jordan and shouted, `Watch this!'' 
before throwing a flurry of jabs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had the best player ever in the building and at the same  
time, we had the best boxer in the building,'' said Jones, himself 
a former professional basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fifth defense of his titles in the last 18 months for  
Jones. He became the only fighter to currently hold a unified title 
and only the third undisputed light heavyweight champion, joining 
Bob Foster and Michael Spinks.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Co., IBM To Form Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Personal computer maker Acer Inc. will  
announce a partnership Monday with International Business Machines 
Corp. that is slated to bring it orders worth $7.8 billion, 
published reports said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the strategic alliance, Acer will become the sole  
manufacturer of IBM computers and computer parts sold in Asia, and 
the companies will jointly develop new products and share licensing 
for some technologies, the Economic Daily News reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Acer, Taiwan's largest personal computer maker,  
have declined to comment on the deal, but expectations have already 
pushed the company's stock price up more than 13 percent over last 
week, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM last year purchased about $2 billion worth of computers and  
computer parts from Taiwan, the paper said. It did not say how much 
of that was purchased from Acer. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-year alliance would be the largest ever international  
cooperation accord struck by a single Taiwanese company in dollar 
terms, the United Daily News said. 
</P>
<P>
	Acer has entered into previous deals with American computer  
companies, most prominently in 1989, when it took a 47 percent 
stake in a joint venture with Texas Instruments to make memory 
chips. Acer bought out Texas Instruments' share last year.

<HEADLINE> Truck Plows Into Busy NYC Crosswalk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A pickup truck speeding through a Manhattan  
intersection crowded with pedestrians ran a red light and hit 
people, a light pole and several other cars, killing one man and 
injuring 10 others. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver was charged with vehicular homicide and drunken  
driving. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro Robles, 34, was behind the wheel of the truck first seen  
moving erratically eastward on 72nd Street on Saturday night, said 
Detective Joseph Pentangelo. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck plowed through a busy Broadway crosswalk and struck  
two pedestrians, smashing into at four cars before coming to rest 
across the intersection, said Officer Joseph Cavitolo. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim, Isaac Speight, 79, died in one of the cars hit in  
the frightening chain reaction of collisions. . The car was twisted 
out of shape, with a gaping hole on its side and the wrecked hood 
sticking up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could hear the tires screeching all the way down the road.  
He must have been going 80 mph on the wrong side of the road,'' 
said Alex Glen, who crossed the street moments before the crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash site is one of the busiest intersections in the city,  
not far from Lincoln Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Some victims received hospital treatment and were released.  
Three remained hospitalized Sunday with multiple trauma injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Robles was charged with vehicular manslaughter, criminally  
negligent homicide, vehicular homicide, DWI and aggravated 
suspended license.

<HEADLINE> Congress Sent New Security Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is sending Congress  
a legislative package this week that would add $300 million to next 
year's spending on construction to improve security at overseas 
U.S. diplomatic missions. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House also is asking for $150 million a year for  
security construction from 2001 through 2004, bringing to $900 
million the new spending over the next five years, an 
administration official said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	And this $900 million comes on top of the White House's original  
request for $3 billion in construction over the five years starting 
in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Adm. William Crowe, who headed State Department panels  
that studied embassy security, and some members of Congress 
denounced the $3 billion figure as woefully inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Admiral Crowe's work played a valuable role in highlighting  
security needs,'' the administration official said. ``We believe 
this increased funding is necessary and will play an important role 
in helping protect American diplomatic personnel abroad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bomb blasts at embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam,  
Tanzania, last year prompted Crowe's systemwide survey of security 
facilities and procedures at missions abroad. The administration 
has already received $1.4 billion in emergency money to rebuild 
those missions, reinforce existing facilities and construct certain 
other embassies. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's amendment to President Clinton's proposed fiscal  
2000 budget provides supplemental money for the ``most immediate 
problems'' in the diplomatic service's security system ``in light 
of ... a steady stream of threats,'' the official said on condition 
of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the administration wants to spend $11.4 billion over 10  
years for embassy security, which includes $8.4 billion for 
construction and almost $3 billion for new operational costs 
related to security, such as guards and monitoring equipment.

	HILTON HEAD, S.C. (AP) -- A man restocking his bird feeder was  
attacked by an 8-foot alligator from a nearby lagoon.

<HEADLINE> Miami May Join WNBA Next Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- South Florida is in line to join the WNBA when the  
league adds four teams for next season, according to a published 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Herald, citing league sources, said in Saturday's  
editions that the league will grant Miami a franchise to begin play 
in the summer of 2000 at the new American Airlines Arena being 
built for the NBA's Heat. 
</P>
<P>
	A formal announcement is expected as early as Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't been notified of anything by the league,'' Heat  
spokesman Tim Donovan said Saturday. ``We'll be notified on Monday 
as to whether we've received an expansion franchise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	League spokesman Mark Pray confirmed expansion plans would be  
announced this week, but gave no further detail. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami is one of six cities being considered for WNBA expansion  
from 12 teams this season to 16 next year. Indianapolis, Denver, 
Seattle, Portland and Toronto are the other finalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Philadelphia and Oakland,  
Calif., also had expressed an interest but did not make the list of 
finalists. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the expansion process, each new team will be required  
to fulfill a minimum requirement of season tickets. Orlando and 
Minnesota, the WNBA's two newest teams, each had to sell 5,000 
season tickets for final approval, and that number could go higher 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
	In Orlando, the Miracle employed the help of Walt Disney World  
to secure the final 100 deposits needed to meet the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat sold out 21 of 25 games at 15,200-seat Miami Arena this  
past season as it won its second consecutive Atlantic Division 
crown. However, it failed to sell out its first playoff game 
against the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines Arena will seat close to 20,000, though  
capacity can be reduced to about 16,000 by closing off portions of 
the facility.

<HEADLINE> Casinos Increase Lobbying, Handouts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As a federal panel was wrapping up its study  
of the gambling industry, House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt 
flew to Las Vegas to pick up a $250,000 check from the chairman of 
Mirage casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Democrats and Republicans have made similar fund-raising  
trips since Congress created the gambling commission in 1996. Many 
have taken behind-the-scenes tours of casinos on Las Vegas' famed 
Strip, chatting with blackjack dealers, learning how the security 
staff ferrets out cheaters, or watching how the industry trains its 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	When it comes to influencing legislation, the casinos are not  
leaving anything to chance. 
</P>
<P>
	They have pursued a double strategy of on-location lobbying and  
campaign cash in hopes of solidifying support against some 
recommendations approved by the federal commission that studied the 
impact of gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Gambling Impact Study Commission issues its  
recommendations to Congress, the president, Indian tribes and 
governors on June 18. Among the recommendations it has approved: a 
moratorium on new lotteries and casinos, and legislation to outlaw 
gambling on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say the industry has won over many friends.  
</P>
<P>
	``In Congress right now, it would be a struggle to get any  
anti-gaming thing passed,'' said William Thompson, a professor of 
public administration at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. 
``They've got the bucks and the opposition doesn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks in part to gambling industry supporters on the panel,  
most of the report's dozens of recommendations will be aimed toward 
state government. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to casinos, the commission studied gambling on  
Indian land, aboard riverboats and cruises, at pari-mutuel tracks 
and in state lotteries. Its recommendations include raising the 
betting age to 21, increasing help for addicted gamblers, and 
banning betting on college sports. 
</P>
<P>
	The casinos count on the Republican-controlled Congress to  
protect their interests at the federal level, even though religious 
conservatives are urging the party to crack down on gambling as a 
social ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the industry's champions are Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., whose state is home to a growing casino industry, 
and top House Democrat Gephardt of Missouri, which allows riverboat 
gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott led a group of Senate Republicans in 1997 to the MGM Grand  
in Las Vegas, where they toured an employee training center before 
mingling with donors. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Gephardt and other top House Democrats toured the  
Mirage before joining donors over shrimp and lamb chops at a 
buffet. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt and the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means  
Committee, Charles Rangel of New York, returned last month to meet 
with the chairman of Mirage Resorts, Steve Wynn, and accept his 
$250,000 contribution for House Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy to have widespread support from individuals and  
groups who know how close we are to winning back the House,'' 
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman John Del 
Cecato said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Fahrenkopf, the gambling industry's chief lobbyist and a  
former Republican Party chairman, said touring casinos and mingling 
with their executives help educate lawmakers so they will better 
understand the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the same lines, a former board chairwoman of the Nevada  
Hotel-Motel Association, Rep. Shelley Berkley, D-Nev., has urged 
the casino industry to bring her fellow freshmen to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Gaming Association's lobbying expenses increased  
from $760,000 in 1997 to $860,000 in 1998. The group's other 
lobbyists include former Rep. Dennis Eckert, D-Ohio, and a former 
White House chief of staff, Kenneth Duberstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Since forming a political action committee in December 1995, the  
association has given $194,410 to federal candidates and political 
parties. Some of the individual casinos have given far more. 
Harrah's has contributed more than $1 million since 1995. Mirage 
boosted its giving from $159,800 in 1995-96 to $528,846 in 1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a right to be heard and represented in the halls of  
Congress,'' Fahrenkopf said. ``We want to be players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The support for casinos within the Republican Party is troubling  
to many religious conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will continue to urge my party to turn down donations from  
gambling interests,'' said Republican presidential hopeful Gary 
Bauer, who endorsed the commission's recommendations Friday. ``I 
think inevitably that money corrupts politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., who sponsored the legislation creating  
the commission, said, ``I think people who are very strongly 
pro-family ask, 'How can you take this money?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting concerns about the industry's influence, the  
commission will recommend that states limit how much gambling 
interests can contribute to campaigns for state or local office. 
</P>
<P>
	As in Congress, gambling interests are well entrenched in many  
states to rebuff the commission's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, Indian tribes and the casino industry pumped $88  
million last fall into a referendum on expanding Indian gaming. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, the video poker industry spent millions in  
1998 on behalf of Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jim Hodges. He 
defeated GOP Gov. David Beasley, who called the industry a 
''cancer.''

<HEADLINE> Baja 500 Racer Crashes Into Crowd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) --A man who crashed his racing truck into a crowd  
of spectators during the Baja 500 desert race was released from the 
hospital Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Baldwin, 29, of Laguna Hills lost control of his  
full-sized pickup and rolled into a crowd, killing a Mexican 
spectator and injuring more than a dozen others. 
</P>
<P>
	Luis Alberto Valdez, 33, died shortly after he was struck by the  
truck during the 30th Tecate SCORE Baja 500, a 447.6-mile course 
over treacherous and uneven desert terrain in the northern part of 
the Baja California peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	An Ensenada police spokesman said Mexican authorities were  
investigating the accident, but refused to release additional 
details. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Baldwin, who was also racing, said his son was apparently  
trying to pass him when the accident occurred about 7:30 a.m. 
Saturday. Both Baldwins registered in the trophy-truck division, 
the premier class in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``He went off the dirt road onto the paved road and was coming  
back onto the dirt road,'' the elder Baldwin said. ``The car rolled 
and there were a whole group of spectators there and I guess he 
rolled right through them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Baldwin, who was airlifted to Mercy Hospital after  
the accident, was released Sunday morning, said nursing supervisor 
Holly Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Baldwin's co-driver Mike Laughlin, 32, of Irvine was in serious  
but stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Spectator Zack Greinve, 21, whose hometown was unknown, was  
taken to San Jose Hospital in Ensenada after the accident and taken 
by helicopter to an unknown San Diego hospital on Sunday, an 
Ensenada hospital spokeswoman said. His condition wasn't known. 
</P>
<P>
	Two racers who were watching the race at the time -- Bob Ham and  
Craig Stewart -- were also hurt in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Ham was listed in good condition while Stewart suffered a broken  
shoulder. He is the son of Ivan Stewart, who won the overall and 
trophy truck divisions in Saturday's race. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, 30, was taken to University of California, San Diego  
Medical Center, where he was listed in serious condition after 
undergoing brain surgery to remove a blood clot. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not out of the dark yet ... but he's looking good,'' the  
elder Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Stewart covered the 447.6-mile course around the  
northern part of the Baja California peninsula in his Tundra Racing 
V8 Toyota Trophy-Truck in 8 hours, 57 minutes and 49 seconds, 
averaging 49.94 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``The course was very rough and technical, but the PPI/Toyota  
Trophy-Truck ran great all day,'' Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Fortin Jr. drove a Chevrolet-powered Jimco desert race car  
to finish second overall among four-wheel vehicles, 5:42 behind 
Stewart.

<HEADLINE> Freshmen Face More Meningitis Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- College freshmen, especially those who live  
in dormitories, face a higher risk of a potentially fatal bacterial 
infection than others in their age group, a study by the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention indicates. 
</P>
<P>
	As CDC and college health officials conduct further research to  
look for the reasons, they recommend that students consider getting 
vaccinated against meningococcal meningitis. 
</P>
<P>
	A $60 vaccine would prevent about three-fourths of the cases  
that occur among college students, Dr. MarJeanne Collins, director 
of health services at the University of Pennsylvania, said June 1 
at the annual meeting of the American College Health Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the disease is rare, Collins said it is devastating to  
the students, families and campuses affected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone that's had ... to talk to a parent who has just  
yesterday had an active, healthy college student, who today is 
informed that that student is dead, really feels the tragedy of 
this illness,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Michael Bruce, an epidemiologist at the CDC, reported that a  
study of 83 reported meningitis cases involving college students 
from September through May indicated a rate among freshmen of 1.4 
cases per 100,000, rising sharply to 3.8 cases per 100,000 among 
freshmen living in dormitories. 
</P>
<P>
	That compares with a rate of 1 case per 100,000 for 18- to  
22-year-olds nationally, and a slightly lower rate of 0.7 cases per 
100,000 for college undergraduates overall. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings reinforced an analysis by Johns Hopkins University  
School of Public Health researchers, published recently in The 
Journal of the American Medical Association, that said college 
students who live on campus face greater risk of meningitis 
infections than other students. 
</P>
<P>
	That study prompted the ACHA to renew a 1997 recommendation that  
all college students consider getting vaccinated against 
meningococcal disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both of these studies support the recommendation that colleges  
educate and inform students about the disease and provide access to 
the vaccine,'' Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
	The most common meningococcal disease is meningitis, an  
inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal 
cord. Early symptoms include fever, severe headache, nausea, 
vomiting, lethargy, stiff neck and rash. 
</P>
<P>
	Antibiotics can be effective, but treatment must begin  
immediately. About one in 10 people who get the illness die, or 
about 300 people a year nationally. About 10 percent of those who 
survive are left with brain damage, kidney failure, hearing loss or 
loss of limbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Of about 3,000 cases a year nationally, 125 to 175 afflict  
college students and 15 to 20 students die each year, according to 
public health estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said results are expected this fall from a more  
detailed study of students' lifestyles that will examine whether 
factors such as living situations, participation on sports teams, 
alcohol consumption or tobacco use affect meningococcal disease 
risk.

<HEADLINE> Ice Core Shows Greenhouse Gases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A 2-mile-long ice core laboriously drilled out of an Antarctic  
ice sheet shows that levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are 
higher now than at any time in the past 420,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
	As the longest ice core record of Earth's weather history  
obtained to date, the core also shows that those gases -- carbon 
dioxide and methane -- play a big role in warming the planet when 
ice ages end. 
</P>
<P>
	But how this icy record will influence current theories about  
global warming blamed on human activity isn't clear, the 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ice core gives us the past, not the future. But it adds to  
our thinking about the future, about the future of our climate,'' 
said Jean-Robert Petit, director of research at the National Centre 
for Scientific Research in Grenoble, France. ``It's clear that 
greenhouse gas levels are unprecedented compared with the previous 
400,000 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The core was extracted from 1992-98 by a U.S.-Russian-French  
team at Russia's Vostok research station, the coldest spot on 
Earth. Petit and team members endured readings as cold as minus 70 
Fahrenheit, though the station holds the world record low of minus 
129. 
</P>
<P>
	They stopped drilling about 120 yards short of a subterranean  
lake the size of Lake Ontario that's been trapped for perhaps 
millions of years beneath the ice sheet. Scientists want to send 
sterilized robots to explore the pristine lake and are protecting 
it from contamination until then. 
</P>
<P>
	Each cylinder-like chunk of ice drilled out of the ice sheet  
contains a record of snowfall, atmospheric chemicals, dust and 
bubbles of air. Those clues, trapped in icy layers like tree rings, 
enable scientists to reconstruct past climates. 
</P>
<P>
	The lengthy Vostok ice core is particularly significant because  
previous cores taken from Antarctica and Greenland dated back only 
about 150,000 years and showed just two ice age cycles. The new 
core reveals four ice ages at roughly 100,000-year intervals, 
shedding new light on how the icy interludes end. 
</P>
<P>
	All four appear to have given way to balmier times after levels  
of the heat-trapping gases carbon dioxide and methane rose by 
amounts smaller than the increase blamed on human industry in the 
past century. 
</P>
<P>
	The multinational team reported its findings in the June 3 issue  
of the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Petit and colleagues found carbon dioxide levels rose from about  
180 parts per million during each ice age's height to 280-300 ppm 
in the subsequent warm periods -- far below the current CO2 levels 
of 360 ppm. 
</P>
<P>
	Methane levels, meanwhile, rose from 320-350 parts per billion  
during the icy interludes to 650-770 ppb during the warm spells. 
Current methane levels are 1,700 ppb. 
</P>
<P>
	The levels of both greenhouse gases are expected to continue  
their rise in the next century due to continued burning of fossil 
fuels such as coal and other human activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``This study is probably the most convincing evidence to date  
that humans are making some really large changes to Earth's climate 
system,'' said Jonathan Overpeck, head of the paleoclimatology 
program at the National Geophysical Data Center in Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this says is we're going well beyond the bounds of  
natural variation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Petit estimates that the rising greenhouse gas concentrations  
contributed to about 50 percent of the post-ice age warming; he 
attributes the remaining heat to periodic shifts in Earth's orbit 
that increase the amount of sunlight warming the planet. 
</P>
<P>
	The natural rise in the gases was attributed to a variety of  
factors, including changes in oceanic processing of C02, increased 
plankton activity and the return of methane-producing swamps. 
</P>
<P>
	But the core also appears to call into question previous  
research suggesting a 500- to 1,000-year lag time between the 
post-ice age temperature increase and the CO2 increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the core suggests temperatures rose in step with rising  
C02 levels, a finding of interest to scientists studying global 
warming. 
</P>
<P>
	``This core is telling us to get busy and understand the climate  
system because it really could change,'' said Richard Alley, a 
professor of geosciences at Pennsylvania State University.

<HEADLINE>  Women's Basketball Hall Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A ceremonial net was cut down and the  
doors opened Saturday to the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame, the 
first devoted to any women's sport. 
</P>
<P>
	In walked some of the greatest players and coaches in the  
history of the game. Fourteen of the first 25 inductees attended, 
and most said they never sought or expected such recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I am very insignificant in the whole picture  
because I didn't have a great vision (of what the sport could 
become),'' said Texas coach Jody Conradt, the winningest coach in 
women's college basketball with 724 victories. ``I just got 
involved in basketball because I loved it. It was my passion. And I 
wanted to share that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $9.3 million, 32,000-square-foot hall carries this credo  
above the door: ``Honor the past. Celebrate the present. Promote 
the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dignitaries and inductees reflected on that.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it allows us to educate a lot of people that don't  
understand the over 100 years of history in our game and to 
appreciate the pioneers,'' said inductee Pat Summitt, coach of the 
hometown and six-time NCAA champion Tennessee Lady Volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now there is name recognition among some of the top  
players and coaches, but it is the people who lived and worked and 
persevered over a hundred years that really helped to grow our game 
and our sport,'' Summitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's game was born just months after Dr. James Naismith  
developed it for boys at the Springfield, Mass., YMCA in 1891. 
Senda Berenson adapted it for her bloomers-clad physical education 
classes at Smith College in 1892. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., mentioned Berenson, the  
professional All-American Red Heads that barnstormed the country 
from the 1930s through the 1970s, the early amateur players and the 
Olympians. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thanks to all of them, today literally millions of high school  
girls and thousands more in college are playing sports, competing 
not just with the big guys, but against, in and with the big 
leagues,'' Frist said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a hall might not have been possible until only a few years  
ago -- the explosion in popularity is that recent. Hall sponsors 
expect as many as 100,000 visitors a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the hall's inductees already have been inducted into  
the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, which has been 
admitting women since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them, Ann Meyers-Drysdale, said the Springfield hall is  
commendable but the Knoxville hall is special. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knoxville hall, she said, speaks to ``all the struggles and  
doors closing in the faces of the women'' and ultimately may be 
about more than the game itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not just about basketball, it is not just about sports.  
It is not just about women,'' Meyers-Drysdale said. ``It is about 
anybody if they put their mind to it, if they have a cause or an 
issue, that anything can be accomplished.''

	NATO To Intensify Air Campaign  
</P>
<P>
	KUMANOVO, Macedonia (AP) -- Talks aimed at putting the Kosovo  
peace plan into action collapsed early Monday, threatening the 
entire accord and prompting NATO to intensify its air campaign 
against Yugoslavia. NATO has ``no alternative but to continue and 
intensify the air campaign until such time as the Yugoslavs are 
prepared to implement the agreement fully and without ambiguity,'' 
said British Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson, the commander of NATO forces 
in Macedonia. NATO had narrowed its target list and cut down the 
number of sorties flown by alliance jets after President Slobodan 
Milosevic agreed to a peace plan on Thursday. NATO officials had 
hinted that if the peace process broke down, airstrikes would be 
more intense than before.

	U.S. Blames Serbs for Failed Talks  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Talks between NATO and Yugoslav military  
authorities on implementing a Serb troop withdrawal from Kosovo 
collapsed Sunday because the Yugoslavs made a proposal that would 
have delayed the entrance into Kosovo of a NATO-led peacekeeping 
force, U.S. officials said. The sticking point was a timetable for 
the withdrawal of the estimated 40,000 Serb army and special police 
forces, said Kenneth Bacon, spokesman for Defense Secretary William 
Cohen. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Sunday night was on 
her way to a meeting in Germany with the foreign ministers of the 
so-called G-8 -- the United States, Russia, Britain, Canada, France, 
Germany, Italy and Japan -- the eight countries that set out the 
principles for a Kosovo settlement.

	Indonesian Election Gets Under Way  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesians got their first real taste  
of democracy since 1955 on Monday, casting ballots for a new 
Parliament that will try to build on a year of reform but could be 
hampered by divisions. It was another major step away from 
authoritarian rule that ended when riots by pro-democracy student 
groups forced President Suharto to resign in May 1998 after 32 
years in power. Ironically, one of the first areas to vote Monday 
was East Timor, where many people see the Aug. 8 referendum on the 
territory's future as far more significant than the national 
election.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Judi Dench, who already won an Academy Award  
this year, picked up a Tony today for her role as an elegant, 
embattled actress in David Hare's drama ``Amy's View.'' Matthew 
Bourne took two Tonys, for best direction and best choreography of 
a musical for his work on ``Swan Lake,'' a modern-dress retelling 
of the famous ballet with an all-male corps of swans. Robert Falls 
won the award for best director of a play for ``Death of a 
Salesman.'' Elizabeth Franz's portrayal of the loyal Linda Loman 
won the featured-actress award.

	European Internet Boycott Called  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European Internet users, campaigning to reduce  
local telephone charges, called a 24-hour boycott of the World Wide 
Web today. The Campaign for Unmetered Telecommunications says 
Internet users in 15 European countries have coordinated efforts to 
win a reduction in costs, including a flat-rate charge for local 
calls, similar to that in the United States. The primary goal for 
Web surfers, who pay by the minute for their European local calls, 
is introduction of unmetered charges for connections to an Internet 
service provider using a telephone modem ``to enable everyone who 
wants to access the Internet without incurring open-ended costs.''

	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- For the first time in the 23 years since  
they joined the NBA, the San Antonio Spurs are in the finals. And 
they go there as one of the hottest playoff teams ever. The Spurs 
won their 10th straight playoff game, one short of the league 
record, and swept the Portland Trail Blazers from the Western 
Conference finals with a 94-80 victory today. The Spurs buried the 
Blazers with a 70 percent shooting performance in the fourth

	DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) -- Tiger Woods extricated himself from a series  
of trouble spots with par saves -- including a memorable chip-in at 
the 14th hole -- to hold off Vijay Singh this afternoon and win the 
Memorial Tournament by two strokes. Woods' second victory of the 
year was worth $459,000. It marked the seventh time in his pro 
career he carried the lead into the final day -- and the sixth time 
he still had it at the finish.

	NATO, Serb Talks Reportedly Snagged  
</P>
<P>
	KUMANOVO, Macedonia (AP) -- Talks on putting the Kosovo peace  
plan into action seemed close to collapse today, after Yugoslav 
generals failed to return from a short adjournment agreed to by 
NATO officers. The two sides met for 10 hours in Kumanovo, then 
agreed to take a break. But the Yugoslavs did not return, NATO 
said. In an indication of serious problems, Finnish President 
Martti Ahtisaari, the chief architect of the peace plan, postponed 
a visit to Beijing to discuss it with Chinese leaders.

	KUKES, Albania (AP) -- American B-52 bombers pounded Serb  
positions today near the Albanian-Yugoslav border as refugees and 
Albanian residents fleeing shelling by Yugoslav forces were taken 
to this already refugee-swollen town. The heavy bombers struck near 
the key border crossing point of Morini, sending towering clouds of 
black smoke into the sky from a hillside. The strikes were directed 
against Serb forces fighting guerrillas of the pro-independence 
Kosovo Liberation Army. Despite the bombing, Serb artillery 
continued to hammer at the guerrillas, who responded with mortar 
fire.

in an effort to get to computers that controlled the aircraft's 
mechanical systems. The computers could help investigators learn 
whether Flight 1420's spoilers, reverse thrusters and braking 
systems were functioning properly when the plane landed in a storm 
Tuesday night and skidded off the end of the runway, broke apart

groups that have waged an eight-year Islamic insurgency in Algeria. 
The step was seen as part of the president's attempt to end the

Salvation Front was poised to win. The violence has claimed 75,000

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two New York Democrats predicted today that  
Hillary Rodham Clinton would win the state's Senate race in 2000. 
Republicans signaled the first lady will be hounded because she has 
never lived in the state. Mrs. Clinton has not announced her 
candidacy but has said she will form a committee to help raise and 
spend money, the first step toward becoming a formal candidate. 
There was little doubt among Republicans or Democrats questioned on 
today's television news shows that Mrs. Clinton will run in 2000 to 
succeed retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan.

	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Discovery and a crew

run to the new international space station. There is uncertainty, 
however, about the next shuttle flight and follow-up trips to the 
space station. Columbia is supposed to lift off next month with an 
X-ray telescope, but the mission is in question because of doubts 
about the motor needed to boost the $1.5 billion observatory to the

<HEADLINE> 'Star Wars' Tops $250 Million Mark / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Light saber-wielding Jedi Knights and Julia  
Roberts' romance with Hugh Grant fended off Anthony Hopkins as a 
crazed ape-man at the weekend box office, industry estimates showed 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' held on to the No.  
1 spot, earning $32.2 million over the weekend to top the $250 
million mark. 
</P>
<P>
	The romantic comedy ``Notting Hill,'' starring Ms. Roberts and  
Grant, continued to fare well in its second week, taking in $15 
million over the weekend for a total of $49.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The only new film opening in wide release was ``Instinct,''  
starring Cuba Gooding Jr. and Hopkins as a murderous scientist 
living among jungle-dwelling apes. It earned only $10.2 million for 
third place. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instinct'' was expected to do better against ``The Phantom  
Menace,'' which remained strong despite losing 37 percent of its 
audience in its third week of release. Average ticket sales per 
screen for ``The Phantom Menace'' were $10,652, indicating 
half-filled houses. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Star Wars'' prequel is falling short of Hollywood's  
hyper-driven expectations, but it continues to do well and will 
likely top $400 million by summer's end, said Robert Bucksbaum, a 
Reel Source Inc. movie analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the studio was expecting better numbers for 'Star  
Wars' because schools are starting to close,'' Bucksbaum said. 
``And it should have done better, especially considering there is 
no real blockbuster competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That will dramatically change next week when the retro-comedy  
``Austin Powers'' sequel opens on Friday, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mike Myers film -- about a lusty, buck-toothed secret agent  
and his hairless nemesis, Dr. Evil -- appeals to the same audience 
of young males that comprises much of the ``Star Wars'' fan base. 
</P>
<P>
	``'Austin Powers' is going to be No. 1 next week. We'd bet the  
house on it,'' Bucksbaum said. ``This is the last hurrah for 'Star 
Wars' in terms of going without competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Mummy,'' ``Entrapment'' and ``The Matrix'' continued to  
fare well, claiming fourth, fifth and sixth place, respectively. 
The techno-mystery ``The Thirteenth Floor'' plunged to seventh 
place after a poor opening and earned only $1.9 million in its 
second week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Love Letter,'' which opened the same weekend as ``The  
Phantom Menace,'' dropped out of the top 10 with a paltry total 
gross of $6.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall box office earnings were down 10.7 percent compared to  
the same weekend last year, when ``The Truman Show'' opened, and 
``Godzilla,'' ``Hope Floats'' and ``Deep Impact'' were still going 
strong. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures 
are to be released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' $32.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Notting Hill,'' $15 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Instinct,'' $10.2 million  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``The Mummy,'' $7.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Entrapment,'' $3.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``The Matrix,'' $2.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``The Thirteenth Floor,'' $1.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Never Been Kissed,'' $1.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' $1.1  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Election,'' $900,000.

<HEADLINE> Report: Indy To Get WNBA Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Indianapolis will acquire one of four  
expansion franchises in the WNBA, The Indianapolis Star and News 
reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper, citing unidentified NBA sources, said the  
announcement could come Monday. Denver, Miami, Seattle, Toronto and 
Portland, Ore., also are under consideration. The 12-team league is 
to expand to 16 teams for the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indiana Pacers have been interested in a women's franchise  
since the NBA created the WNBA three years ago. But the Pacers did 
not pursue a team then because they were preoccupied with Conseco 
Fieldhouse, the arena set to open next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``The WNBA is a really important addition,'' Indianapolis Mayor  
Stephen Goldsmith told the newspaper. ``I think it sends a good 
message to young girls who are interested in playing sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA season starts its 32-game season on Thursday, with six  
teams making the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams in the WNBA are the Charlotte Sting, Cleveland Rockers,  
Detroit Shock, New York Liberty, Orlando Miracle, Washington 
Mystics, Houston Comets, Los Angeles Sparks, Minnesota Lynx, 
Phoenix Mercury, Sacramento Monarchs and Utah Starzz.

<HEADLINE> First Security, Zions Bancorp Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Consolidation continues to sweep the  
banking industry, with two Salt Lake City banks the latest to 
merge. 
</P>
<P>
	Zions Bancorp. said Sunday it agreed to merge with larger rival  
First Security Corp. in a $5.9 billion stock deal that would create 
the nation's 20th largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition will result in the loss up to 2,000 jobs, or  
nearly 12 percent of the banks' combined work force as 
administrative costs are streamlined, officials said at a joint 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The merged bank will be called First Security Corp., and have  
assets of $40 billion. Its headquarters will remain in Salt Lake 
City, where both banks are based. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger was approved by the boards of both banks Sunday  
afternoon. The deal is expected to close in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Banks are getting larger every day and we should be an  
effective competitor,'' First Security Chairman and CEO Spencer F. 
Eccles said. ``We looked at the realities of the marketplace, where 
scale and size are important. We're much stronger together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from both banks said they expect to they will have to  
sell branches in communities where only they go head-to-head in 
order to win regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
	They also plan to divest themselves of about $1.5 billion in  
deposits. 
</P>
<P>
	``There obviously is a lot of overlap,'' Zions Bancorp President  
and CEO Harris H. Simmons said of a combined 640 branches in 10 
Western states. 
</P>
<P>
	The banks plan to cut $108 million in administrative expenses  
starting in 2000. They also expect to eliminate 1,500 to 2,000 jobs 
from the combined work force of 17,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons said the banks can cut duplicative jobs without laying  
off employees by relying on ordinary attrition and imposing a 
hiring freeze. 
</P>
<P>
	First Security shareholders will receive 0.442 Zions share for  
each share of First Security common stock, valuing each First 
Security share at $28.90, a 55 percent premium to First Security's 
closing price Friday of $18.62 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons will serve as president, co-CEO and chief operating  
officer of the new bank, while Eccles will be named chairman and 
co-CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	First Security and Zions are longtime Utah institutions and  
fierce competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted all of his customers and he wanted all of mine,''  
Eccles said of Simmons, his one-time rival. ``Now we're happy.''

<HEADLINE>  Women's Basketball Hall Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A ceremonial net was cut down and the  
doors opened Saturday to the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame, the 
first devoted to any women's sport. 
</P>
<P>
	In walked some of the greatest players and coaches in the  
history of the game. Fourteen of the first 25 inductees attended, 
and most said they never sought or expected such recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I am very insignificant in the whole picture  
because I didn't have a great vision (of what the sport could 
become),'' said Texas coach Jody Conradt, the winningest coach in 
women's college basketball with 724 victories. ``I just got 
involved in basketball because I loved it. It was my passion. And I 
wanted to share that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $9.3 million, 32,000-square-foot hall carries this credo  
above the door: ``Honor the past. Celebrate the present. Promote 
the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dignitaries and inductees reflected on that.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it allows us to educate a lot of people that don't  
understand the over 100 years of history in our game and to 
appreciate the pioneers,'' said inductee Pat Summitt, coach of the 
hometown and six-time NCAA champion Tennessee Lady Volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now there is name recognition among some of the top  
players and coaches, but it is the people who lived and worked and 
persevered over a hundred years that really helped to grow our game 
and our sport,'' Summitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's game was born just months after Dr. James Naismith  
developed it for boys at the Springfield, Mass., YMCA in 1891. 
Senda Berenson adapted it for her bloomers-clad physical education 
classes at Smith College in 1892. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., mentioned Berenson, the  
professional All-American Red Heads that barnstormed the country 
from the 1930s through the 1970s, the early amateur players and the 
Olympians. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thanks to all of them, today literally millions of high school  
girls and thousands more in college are playing sports, competing 
not just with the big guys, but against, in and with the big 
leagues,'' Frist said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a hall might not have been possible until only a few years  
ago -- the explosion in popularity is that recent. Hall sponsors 
expect as many as 100,000 visitors a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the hall's inductees already have been inducted into  
the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, which has been 
admitting women since 1984.

<P>
	One of them, Ann Meyers-Drysdale, said the Springfield hall is  
commendable but the Knoxville hall is special. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knoxville hall, she said, speaks to ``all the struggles and  
doors closing in the faces of the women'' and ultimately may be 
about more than the game itself. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not just about basketball, it is not just about sports.  
It is not just about women,'' Meyers-Drysdale said. ``It is about 
anybody if they put their mind to it, if they have a cause or an 
issue, that anything can be accomplished.''

<HEADLINE> Broadway Honors Season's Best Plays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The play's the thing, not the musicals, at the  
1999 Tony Awards on Sunday, with the emphasize on revivals, 
particularly potent productions of Arthur Miller's ``Death of a 
Salesman'' and Eugene O'Neill's ``The Iceman Cometh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two classics were expected to provide most of the drama as  
Broadway honored the best of a theater season that produced no 
major musical smash, but a number of hit plays, both old and new. 
</P>
<P>
	``Salesman'' and ``Iceman'' square off for best-revival honors,  
with their two leading men, Brian Dennehy and Kevin Spacey, going 
to the mat for the top acting prize. 
</P>
<P>
	Competing for best-play honors were two entries by American  
writers, ``Side Man,'' Warren Leight's turbulent tale of a jazz 
musician and his family, and Tennessee Williams' ``Not About 
Nightingales,'' written more than 60 years ago but only now running 
on Broadway by way of the Royal National Theater in London and 
Houston's Alley Theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Also up for best play were Patrick Marber's ``Closer,'' a sleek  
tale of sexual intrigue set in present-day London, and ``The 
Lonesome West,'' Irish playwright Martin McDonagh's comedy slugfest 
between two bitter brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest in the best-musical competition was minimal, with most  
of the attention focused on two very different candidates: 
``Fosse,'' a salute to the choreographer Bob Fosse, and ``Parade,'' 
a love story set against the backdrop of a murder in Georgia in 
1913. ``Parade'' closed in February after a short run. 
</P>
<P>
	Both box office and attendance figures rose during the 1998-99  
Broadway season although not as much as in previous years. Total 
grosses topped $588.1 million, while more than 11.6 million people 
saw a Broadway show. 
</P>
<P>
	Production climbed, too, with 39 new shows, compared to 33 the  
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet no big new musical, the kind like ``Cats'' that can run and  
run and run, made an appearance. Only ``Fosse'' appears headed for 
an extended stay. Of the musical revivals, ``Annie Get Your Gun'' 
was the sturdiest show, although what happens when Bernadette 
Peters leaves early next year is a question mark. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The 53rd annual Tony Awards returned to a Broadway theater, the  
Gershwin, this year, because Radio City Music Hall, its home for 
the past two years, is being renovated. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony also featured a series of presenters instead of one  
host. Rosie O'Donnell, who did those chores for two years, declined 
this year because of her busy schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tony winners in 21 categories were chosen by more than 800  
voters, including members of the theater community and theater 
journalists. The Tonys are named after Antoinette Perry, founder of 
the American Theater Wing, a theater service organization.

<HEADLINE> 'Felicity' Star Gets Stage Fright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Felicity'' star Keri Russell gets stage fright  
when it comes to live TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``The day I did my first live talk show last September, `Rosie  
O'Donnell,' I was so nervous I cried,'' Russell says in Sunday's 
New York Post. ``I was walking out onto the stage I was crying but 
I was pretending that I was laughing. It was a nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The up-and-coming actress on the heavily hyped college drama  
never expected to make it big so early in her career, figuring 
she'd be footloose and fancy free at this point in her life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be saving money to travel around the world -- spend  
some time in Ireland,'' she said. ``Maybe work as a waitress and 
meet cool friends at night. Just traveling, being a little nomadic, 
bohemian girl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Felicity,'' which follows the ups and downs of a young woman  
going off to college in New York City, moves to Sunday nights next 
season.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Service Groups Redefine Roles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Predictability can offer a certain comfort,  
even if this is what you know: You will die young, of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	Chip Supanich knows.  
</P>
<P>
	When he learned he was HIV-positive in 1985, the San Franciscan  
took the diagnosis and his doctor's prognosis to heart. He started 
to party, party, party. And he developed a methamphetamine habit. 
</P>
<P>
	But he lived beyond predictions, and by 1996 he was homeless, 45  
pounds lighter and desperate for AIDS medications. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 38, Supanich says: ``I have faith that my life is not near  
its end.'' Yet, even as protease inhibitor drugs coax his weight 
back to normal, he concedes: ``I can be certain of nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AIDS service organizations find themselves in this same dilemma,  
simultaneously in transition and in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a horrible certainty, and now we have a mixed-bag  
certainty,'' says Craig E. Thompson, executive director of AIDS 
Project Los Angeles, who is HIV-positive. 
</P>
<P>
	Once, these organizations focused on helping patients get their  
affairs in order and on keeping them comfortable as they died. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with more patients like Supanich living longer, just how  
``exceptional'' a disease is AIDS? And what happens to the funds 
and supporters -- the voluminous network of help that became a 
phenomenon in itself? 
</P>
<P>
	They have to shift strategy, many say.  
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe in the long term we can't maintain that sense of crisis.  
Maybe it's finding a way to manage AIDS as a decades-long health 
problem,'' says Tom Metzger, spokesman for the National AIDS Fund, 
a nonprofit in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the AIDS death rate took a nosedive beginning in 1996 and  
brought public donations down with it, the Centers for Disease 
Control in Atlanta reports that the number of new HIV infections 
has remained steady through the decade with some 40,000 new cases 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, an estimated 15,000 groups serve patients with HIV.  
While some focus narrowly on such issues as mental health 
counseling, others are functioning more and more broadly -- much 
like welfare organizations with clients who require housing, 
insurance and help with drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``HIV is a problem in their life, but it's not the biggest,''  
says Pam Coleman, a caseworker at AIDS Project Los Angeles for 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the San Francisco AIDS Foundation not only helped  
Supanich decipher state insurance coverage, it also got him into 
subsidized housing -- a more stable environment that proved crucial 
for his daily regimen of 15 medications. 
</P>
<P>
	To adapt to this growing and needy population, nearly every  
organization has been forced to shift money and priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco AIDS Foundation last year expanded its housing  
program when the city gave it almost $3.3 million in housing 
grants, up nearly $1.5 million from 1997. At the same time, its 
clientele grew by 1,000 to 3,500, and it was forced to transfer 
one-third of its Spanish-speaking clients -- 54 people -- and about 
200 HIV-positive women out of special case management programs when 
the city gave $244,671 in grants to other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The National AIDS Fund, which has given more than $70 million to  
community AIDS groups in the past decade, eliminated matching funds 
in five cities last year as a handful of smaller organizations 
folded into others or disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
	Some resent the suggestion that AIDS groups should consolidate,  
as is happening in Los Angeles, or should rely on umbrella agencies 
for social services. One is Daniel Zingale, executive director of 
AIDS Action based in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	If the system of care and services built around HIV has been so  
remarkable, he says, why treat AIDS like other diseases? ``Why not 
treat other diseases the way we treat HIV disease?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But others say such extensive networks can waste money. While it  
makes sense for gigantic Los Angeles County to have some 100 AIDS 
agencies for patients to choose from, smaller communities don't 
need so many options, Thompson says. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need all those executive directors, all those people  
running agencies,'' he says. ``We're keeping agencies going 
potentially for the wrong reasons. People need to put their egos 
aside and their jobs aside and look at what's best for patients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the big groups are struggling. Gay Men's Health Crisis, the  
nation's largest nonprofit AIDS organization, may be hardest hit. 
In the past 1 1/2 years, the New York center slashed its staff of 300 
by 25 percent and its budget of $27 million by almost 20 percent. 
Yet, GMHC's caseload declined only about 4 percent, to 7,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, many other organizations are tapping into the AIDS  
activists' tradition of creative fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lots of other organizations have adopted the same tools very  
effectively,'' says Gustavo Suarez, a spokesman for the San 
Francisco AIDS Foundation. ``You've got lots of walks and lots of 
rides, not just for AIDS.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That has left veteran social workers frazzled. AIDS Project Los  
Angeles has swelled from a predominantly gay caseload of 4,200 men 
to 8,000 clients from diverse backgrounds. The 800 neediest get 
more intensive help -- leaving each case manager to supervise as 
many as 65. These days, one has to be sicker, with more problems, 
to make the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be when you worked with the clients you were able  
to take a couple minutes to talk to them and comfort them and give 
them extra attention about other things,'' Ms. Coleman says. ``You 
still attempt to do that, but there's someone else behind them so 
there's not a lot of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Kevin Bradley, another patient who relies on the San  
Francisco AIDS Foundation, the personal touches Ms. Coleman strives 
for are part of what keeps him coming back to a place he believes 
is essential to his survival. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without some place like this, where does one go?'' Bradley  
asks. ``I don't think it's over. I don't think we can ease up. I'm 
not completely confident that what's happening now is going to 
last.''

<HEADLINE> Time Names 20th Century Heroes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Time magazine's top 20 heroes and icons of the  
20th century run the gamut: a princess and a preacher, an aviator 
and an alcoholic, a gay man and ``The Greatest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alphabetically, they start with boxer Muhammad Ali and end with  
Alcoholics Anonymous founder Bill W. The eclectic group includes 
activists Rosa Parks and Harvey Milk, pioneer Charles Lindbergh and 
screen icons Marilyn Monroe and Bruce Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need our heroes,'' wrote assistant managing editor Howard  
Chua-Eoan, ``to give meaning to time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The list is the fifth and last in its top 100 people of the last  
100 years. Previous lists included the top 20 leaders and 
revolutionaries, artists and entertainers, builders and titans, and 
scientists and thinkers. 
</P>
<P>
	The new list included one generic entry: the American G.I., from  
World War I through the Kosovo conflict. And there was one family 
entry: the Kennedys, cited as America's most powerful family of the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the list included Princess Diana, Nazi victim Anne  
Frank, Billy Graham, Che Guevara, Helen Keller, Everest conquerors 
Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, suffragist Emmeline Pankhurst, 
soccer great Pele, baseball pioneer Jackie Robinson, dissident 
Andrei Sakharov and Mother Teresa. 
</P>
<P>
	Each icon was profiled by another well known 20th century  
figure, from ex-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger on soccer great 
Pele to George Plimpton on Ali. 
</P>
<P>
	The list was compiled by Time editors in consultation with CBS  
News and an assortment of public figures, academics, journalists, 
political analysts and other experts.

<HEADLINE> Report: Mitsubishi in Talks With Fiat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Mitsubishi Motors Corp. reportedly has  
begun talks with Italian automaker Fiat about a tie-up to supply 
each other with key parts as well as fully assembled cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese carmaker also started similar talks with France's  
Peugeot SA, the Nihon Keizai business daily reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The reported move comes after Ford Motor Co. bought Volvo AB's  
car division in January, raising doubts about the future of an 
existing joint production venture in Europe between Volvo and 
Mitsubishi Motors. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi Motors will discuss supplying Fiat with its GDI  
direct-injection gas engines, the paper said. The two automakers 
also may agree to share other components or car models which 
complement their existing product lines, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, the Japanese company is considering buying GDI  
engines made with its technology by Fiat and Peugeot for use in 
Mitsubishi Motors cars sold in Europe, the report said.
