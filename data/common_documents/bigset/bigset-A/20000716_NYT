WELLS: LET YANKEES FANS KNOCK TRADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- After winning the World Series in 1998, the
Yankees felt they could get better by trading for Roger Clemens,
sending David Wells, second baseman Homer Bush and reliever Graeme
Lloyd to the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a one-sided trade in favor of the Blue Jays, and
would have been even if Wells and Clemens were traded straight up.
</P>
<P>
   In 1 seasons since the deal, Wells is 32-12 with a 4.32 ERA,
Clemens is 20-16 with a 4.51 ERA. Sure, Clemens has a 1999 World
Series ring, but the Yankees would have won it without Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Said Wells, who has become the leading candidate to win the A.L.
Cy Young award: ''I'm sure they (Yankees) all regret it. I think
the fans are upset by it. But I'll let the fans scream and holler
at George Steinbrenner, and I'll go out and do my job. I don't hold
any grudges.''
</P>
<P>
   MOONLIGHTING: Tigers reliever Todd Jones has something to fall
back on if baseball doesn't work out. He writes a sports column for
a small newspaper in Georgia. These are his thoughts from the
All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the biggest things I noticed is how patient the
superstars were with everyone,'' he said. ''With the fans, the
media and with us other players. There are definitely two tiers of
players at these things. The ones who know they'll be an All-Star
again and the ones who can only hope. I was glad to see there
weren't any big egos in the clubhouse, but it took awhile for some
guys to let their guard down. Unlike me -- I don't have a guard to
let down.''
</P>
<P>
   YOU CAN'T PLEASE EVERYBODY: All-Star managers often are
criticized for selecting their own players over others that might
be more deserving. But Yankees manager Joe Torre drew the ire of
one of his own players for NOT selecting him.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees reliever Jeff Nelson, upset he wasn't chosen by Torre to
the A.L. squad, said: ''If I am not going to get the respect from
my manager, I am not going to be a bulldog and suck one up for the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees GM Brian Cashman spoke with Nelson about it, and Nelson
later apologized to Torre.
</P>
<P>
   ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK: Orioles players Scott Erickson, Sidney
Ponson and Jeff Conine were fined by manager Mike Hargrove for
taking an unauthorized trip from New York back to Baltimore to
attend a July 4 Metallica concert.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson was the winning pitcher in a victory at Yankee Stadium
in a July 4 afternoon game, and the three left after the game and
went to the concert that night in Baltimore. They returned early
the next morning. One day later, on July 6, Ponson gave up six runs
in 1 fr 1/3 innings in a 13-9 loss.
</P>
<P>
   RIPKEN WATCH: Rumors are circulating that Cal Ripken Jr.,
because of an ongoing back problem, will retire before the end of
the season. Ripken, 40, is expected to be activated from the
disabled list today. His current back problem apparently is related
to last year's back surgery. Doctors believe there is a disk
fragment floating around in his back. Ripken, obviously, isn't one
to give up easily and denies he is close to retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to put the uniform back on and see what happens,'' he
told the Baltimore Sun. ''I want to play as much of the second half
as I possibly can.''
</P>
<P>
   SHORT HOPS: A's first baseman Jason Giambi thanked fans in
Oakland for helping vote him into the All-Star game as a starter by
taking out a full-page ad in the Oakland Tribune. ... Since manager
Charlie Manuel ordered the ping-pong table out of the clubhouse and
banned card games, the Indians are 6-3.

DODGERS SHOULDN'T GIVE AWAY THE FARM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Deep, talent-rich farm systems are the reason the
New York Yankees and Atlanta Braves have been atop baseball for the
past decade, and every other organization is striving to get to
that level.
</P>
<P>
   So why would the Dodgers contemplate further depleting their
near-naked farm system to make a run at the second-tier pitcher who
guarantees them nothing but the loss of prospects, which will only
be felt with more impact later?
</P>
<P>
   The answer: a $90 million payroll, $200-per-game seats behind
home plate and luxury boxes that cost up to $300,000 per season.
</P>
<P>
   The big-market mentality says a team must win every year, but
the Dodgers shouldn't succumb to that. They shouldn't go out and
acquire a middle-of-the-road pitcher as the July 31 trading
deadline nears. They shouldn't think only about the next two
months, but about the next five years. By then, the farm system
should be mature and winning won't come sporadically, but
consistently.
</P>
<P>
   So far, managing general partner and CEO Bob Daly and general
manager Kevin Malone have said they'll exhibit the patience needed,
which means hanging on to young pitchers like Eric Gagne and Mike
Judd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to trade Gagne,'' Daly said. ``A long time ago
I said to Sean Connery when he said he would never do James Bond,
'Never say never again.' I learned from that statement, never to
say never. But the truth of the matter is a lot of teams are
interested in Gagne, but he's a guy the Dodgers are very high on.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the only way to go if the Dodgers are to end a
more-than-a-decade dry spell when it comes to winning the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   It may not bode well for this season, particularly if Darren
Dreifort and Gagne don't pitch better and Devon White can't be
effective when he returns from the disabled list, but it does hold
enormous meaning in the upcoming years.
</P>
<P>
   Not only in developing talent to play at the major-league level,
but to put the organization in better position when future trade
deadlines roll around.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were able to acquire Denny Neagle because their farm
system is loaded with talent. The Dodgers wanted Neagle but didn't
have the prospects to make the kind of deal the Yankees could.
Ditto with Philadelphia moving Andy Ashby to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it's frustrating for the Dodgers' front office, but it's
something they must muddle through.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a philosophy and a plan,'' Malone said. ``If you
have goals and a plan like we do, then you stick to it. To trade
two or three prospects away from our system, that's not part of the
plan. We'd like to upgrade, but we don't want to make a trade for
the sake of making a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get to the point of where the Yankees are. They
have depth and quality because they have numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   If it's the playoffs, fine. If it's short of the playoffs, then
it's not what the cash being doled out dictates, but it's the way
it is. It takes time to build a system, to build a winning
organization. Before Gene Michael revamped the Yankees'
minor-league system, they spent like mad but didn't win.
</P>
<P>
   But trying to bring in a second-line pitcher at the cost of
giving up prospects isn't the answer, especially when it will cost
the Dodgers more in the short and long runs. Get rid of a young
player making $200,000 this season and the Dodgers will have to pay
millions upon millions in the free-agent market to fill that void
later. And that's millions of dollars the Dodgers could use to
upgrade another area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to sacrifice our farm system to get a player
who would have only limited use this year, and maybe, at best, a
marginal player,'' Daly said. ``If we could get some player who has
long-term, positive effects on the organization, obviously anybody
would listen to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're not going to go out and get a pitcher who pitches
.500, who costs us a lot of money and costs us two or three
prospects.''
</P>

GREENE, JONES DASH INTO OLYMPICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL OBERJUERGE  
 San Bernardino Sun 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO -- Maurice Greene and Marion Jones have been faster.
</P>
<P>
   They may never have been happier.
</P>
<P>
   The world's fastest humans were nearly giddy with joy Saturday
after clinching berths for the Sydney Summer Games at the U.S.
Olympic Track and Field Trials at Sacramento State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the Olympic team, I made the Olympic team,'' Greene
sang in childish delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been 17 years now going at this thing called track and
field,'' Jones said. ``My dream always was to be an Olympian.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene, the world-record holder in the 100-meter dash at 9.79
seconds, recovered from a near-disastrous start to finish first in
10.01 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Jones also fought through a sluggish start, but won the women's
100-meter dash more convincingly (but still off her personal best
of 10.65), in 10.88 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to feel that Olympic spirit that everyone has always
talked a bout,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones led Inger Miller (11.05) and Chryste Gaines (11.13) in the
race for the top three spots.
</P>
<P>
   Greene was followed across the finish line by fellow HSI
teammates Curtis Johnson (10.06) and Jon Drummond (10.07).
</P>
<P>
   Drummond promptly predicted U.S. success in the 100 meters at
Sydney, even though American hegemony in the event has waned in
recent Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sun shines on a dog's behind every now and then, and now
it's flipped,'' Drummond said. ``It's time for world dominance.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Greene nor Jones has been in an Olympics, and their
reactions Saturday indicated what a void it has been -- despite
their various and sundry world and national championships.
</P>
<P>
   Greene flamed out in the first round of the 1996 trials; Jones
missed the 1996 season after suffering a broken bone in her foot
while playing basketball, which she has since given up.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said she expects the other American sprinters to work
well with Jones on the sprint-relay team in Sydney. ``I don't
dislike her,'' Miller said of Jones. ``I just get tired of
answering questions about her.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-time defending Olympic champion Gail Devers finished a close
fifth , at 11.149 seconds. The top three compete for the individual
medal, and the top four typically make up the relay team.
</P>
<P>
   Devers also is competing in the 100-meter hurdles here.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was asked about the long jump final, scheduled for today,
and exclaimed in mild exasperation, ``Can't I just enjoy this for a
couple of hours?''
</P>
<P>
   She predicted she would get a good night's sleep Saturday, ``as
opposed to last night,'' and be primed for an attempt to make the
team in the long jump, the weak link in her quest for an
unprecedented five track-and-field gold medals at Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   In other events on a scorching Saturday before another capacity
crowd at Hornet Stadium:
</P>
<P>
   -- Adam Nelson, a former linebacker at Dartmouth, was the
surprise winner of the shotput, in a meet-record 72 feet, 7 inches.
Nelson, 25, began intensive training in the discipline only three
years ago, and as recently as a month ago held a full-time job at a
Silicon Valley firm.
</P>
<P>
   C.J. Hunter, also known as Mr. Marion Jones, qualified second at
71-9, and Andy Bloom third at 70-10. John Godina's hopes to double
in the shot and discus ended with his fourth-place finish in the
shot, at 69-2 1/2 .
</P>
<P>
   Bloom said ``anyone who has been paying any attention could have
known '' the shot would produce outstanding competition. ``We came
here with four guys who have gone 70 feet this year, and I don't
think that's ever happened in one country.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said Saturday's results, ``should scare the hell out of
the Europeans.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Dawn Ellerbe won the women's hammer throw with an effort of
227 feet. The women's hammer is a first-time Olympic event.
</P>
<P>
   -- Michael Johnson sailed into the 400-meter final with a
semifinal-best clocking of 44.63. ``I ran only as hard as I had to
run to win and as sure myself a good lane'' for today's final,
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he might make an assault on his world record of
43.18, Johnson said, ``the goal here is to get to the Olympics.
It's about placing, not about time.''
</P>
<P>
   -- DeDee Nathan scored 6,343 points to win the heptathlon by
four points over UCLA alumnus Shelia Burrell.
</P>
<P>
   Finals Sunday include the men's and women's 400, the men's and
women's 1,500 and the women's long jump.

Jones, Greene lead the way in 100
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JERRY WIZIG &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ One down, two to go for Marion Jones at the
U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials.
</P>
<P>
   Waving a toy Australian koala bear to the crowd, Jones might
have felt it was slightly lighter than the 100-meter gold medal she
now will have a chance to win at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.
Jones, the event's favorite in this meet since winning the gold at
last year's World Championships at Seville, Spain, smoothly
accelerated down the track to lead the seven other finalists by a
comfortable margin in the 100 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing Jones' time of 10.88 seconds were Inger Miller, last
year's 200-meter world champion, in 11.05 and Chryste Gaines in
11.13.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Greene didn't have as easy a time of it in the men's
100, trailing several runners out of the blocks after two false
starts (neither by Greene) and staging his usual burst of blinding
speed the final 50 meters.
</P>
<P>
   The world-record holder and two-time world champion, Greene,
like Jones, made his first U.S. Olympic team with a notable time of
10.01 into a slight head wind. Joining him on the American 100 team
will be runner-up Curtis Johnson and Jon Drummond in third, both
clocking 10.07.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crossing the finish line, I couldn't believe the emotion of
it, realizing what had just happened,'' said Jones, whose husband,
C.J. Hunter, was second in the shot put Saturday and also qualified
for the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   Jones now has today's long jump final, then the 200 next weekend
in her remaining work load for a chance at five Olympic gold
medals. She virtually is assured a spot on the 400 relay team and
will be considered for the 1,600 relay as the fastest American thus
far this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something I have dreamed of since I was 9 years old, and it's
finally going to happen,'' Jones said of her Olympic aspirations.
``It's going to be the second time (today) I have been able to
compete against my idol (Jackie Joyner-Kersee) in the long jump,
and that also will make it a wonderful experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``People keep asking me about the pressure (of attempting to win
the five golds). I just wish I had a penny for every time I have
heard that. It's no pressure. It's just a goal I have set for
myself, and I will try the best I can to go and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones sounded like the hardest part was over, even though the
long jump has been her most troublesome event of late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't you just let me enjoy this for a couple of hours? Now I
can have a nice dinner, focus on the long jump and not have to
worry about going back and forth between the two (as in the
qualifying),'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Devers, the '92 and '96 gold medalist in the 100, and a
favorite to make the U.S. team in that event and the 100 hurdles
this week, faded to fifth in the final 25 meters after a fast
start. Nanceen Perry was sixth and Carlette Guidry, a two-time 400
relay gold medalist, was seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, referring to his upcoming 200-meter meeting with Michael
Johnson next weekend, sounded a conciliatory note after the two had
exchanged verbal shots recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot has been said this week, '' Greene said. ``The bottom
line is, I've made the team. I took the first step.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Marsh is left looking forward to the 200 after failing to
advance past the 100 semifinals. He never found his usual
acceleration gear and placed sixth, missing a berth in the final by
.009 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``My worst race of the year,'' said Marsh, the '92 Olympic gold
medalist in the 200. ``You hate for it to come at a time like this.
I didn't have the acceleration at the end like I usually have. I
have a week now to get refocused for the 200.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene, Curtis Johnson and Drummond all had to overtake Brian
Lewis, who blazed out of the blocks only to finish fourth in 10.09.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Greene, who was only seventh in the '96 trials
semifinals at Atlanta, was confident and relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a terrible start,'' he said, ``but I didn't let it worry
me. Ten seconds is a lot of time when you're running the race the
right way.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the space of about 15 minutes, Greene and Jones staged a
clinical demonstration.

OLD RIVALS ARE NEW MATES IN WOMEN'S 100
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ On Friday, presumably under the influence
of a tight deadline, gold-medal Olympian Michael Johnson wrote in a
national newspaper that he didn't think sprinter Inger Miller would
make the U.S. Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, alas, Miller came looking for the golden one.
``Where's Michael Johnson?'' she wanted to know, after finishing
second in the 100 meters of the U.S. Olympic Track and Field
Trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think maybe he should untwist those beads he's got in
his hair. They're on too tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was too busy, cruising in the final steps of his
400-meter semifinal. The better story was the three rivals suddenly
turned teammates: Miller, Marion Jones and Chryste Gaines, a native
of Dallas who went to South Oak Cliff High School. Or three men
letting loose 70-foot throws in the shot put.
</P>
<P>
   Blasting from the blocks in the women's 100 final, Jones torched
the testy Miller and the rest of a talented field. She was clocked
in 10.88 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, the closest pursuer, who had boldly said that she was
the one who could beat Jones, finished a well-beaten second in
11.05. Gaines was third in 11.13, and after 10 world-class seasons
on the track scene will be going to her first Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Devers finished fifth in 11.149 and lost a chance to become
the second woman to win consecutive Olympic 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
   While Jones was winning the 100, her husband, C.J. Hunter, found
himself in a dogfight to make the medal podium in the men's shot
put. Expected to be a two-man show between Hunter and 1996 Atlanta
silver medalist John Godina, the competition instead started
raining 70-foot throws.
</P>
<P>
   Relative unknown Adam Nelson let loose a personal-best throw of
72 feet, 7 inches on his final attempt of the day to win the
competition. Hunter had to toss the shot 71-9 on his final attempt
to secure a place on the Olympic team. And Andy Bloom grabbed the
third place on the team by throwing 70-10 3/4, also on his final
try.
</P>
<P>
   All three are members of the Nike Track Club, prompting the
oft-injured Bloom to remark: ``We knew this was going to happen for
a year. There's no doubt this was going to be the event it was.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner himself, however, wasn't so certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surprised? Yes,'' Nelson said. ``I'm so elated, I can't
believe what just happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's 72-7 is the longest throw in the world this year.
Godina, on the other hand, threw 69-2 1/2 and has the distinction
of being the farthest thrower in any U.S. trials not to make the
Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's heptathlon which concluded Saturday, DeDee Nathan
won by four points with 6,343 and ended a personal run of
heartbreak in which she had finished fourth in the two previous
Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   Shelia Burrell and Kelly Blair-LaBounty finished second and
third, respectively, and joined Nathan on the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 400, meanwhile, Johnson found himself in the
unusual position of not being in the lead as he turned for the
stretch in his semifinal heat. But Johnson seemed to take one peek
at Jerome Young in Lane Two, and then found a passing gear for the
next 30 meters or so. The Dallas resident was timed in 44.63.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the women asked for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said I wasn't going to make the team,'' Miller explained.
</P>
<P>
   To her right sat Jones, whose Olympic quest for five gold medals
_ in the 100, 200, long jump and both relays _ figures to be a
dominant theme as the Sydney Olympics near. Next to Johnson, Jones
has become track and field's most recognizable face, even though
only half of hers is visible in Nike's popular ``Mrs. Jones'' ad
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   No, she said once again Saturday, she doesn't feel pressure in
going for five gold medals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had a penny for every time someone asked me that, I'd be
rich,'' Jones answered.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Gaines immediately turned to Jones and, in unison,
shrieked, ``You're not now?''
</P>
<P>
   Oops, Jones winced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the wrong choice of words,'' said the impending queen of
track and field.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's events, Jones will try to secure her Olympic place
in the long jump. Finals are also scheduled in the women's high
jump, 400 and 1,500 meters, and in the men's pole vault and 1,500,
as well as Johnson's bid to win the 400. nn

TRACK'S CLOWN PRINCE GETS THE ULTIMATE LAUGH
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Hard to believe, but nine years have passed
since sprinter Jon Drummond wore a TCU track uniform.
</P>
<P>
   That would be nine years, three Olympic trials and a decade's
worth of run-on sentences. Wind-aided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why, but people seem to lose confidence in me and
they don't have faith in me,'' Drummond mused Saturday at the U.S.
Olympic Track and Field Trials. ``They forget about me or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, rumors of his track demise seem to have been sadly
misreported. Jon Drummond, who once dubbed ``himself'' ``The Clown
Prince of Track and Field,'' is headed back to the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Note to global media: Bring plenty of notebook paper.
</P>
<P>
   Bolting from the blocks in the final of the Olympic trials' 100
meters, the Philadelphia native actually led for the first 60,
before finally being passed by world-record holder Maurice Greene.
</P>
<P>
   Greene finished in 10.01 seconds, followed by somebody named
Curtis Johnson, who nipped Drummond at the tape. The finish photo
pegged Johnson's second-place time as 10.066 to Drummond's 10.070 _
barely an inch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to the Olympics, I'm going to the Olympics,'' Greene
nyah-nyah-nyahed in the interview tent.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that Greene is going, of course. Two-time
defending world champions and world-record holders are supposed to
survive even the cutthroat U.S. method of picking an Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   But with Drummond, who knows, even though he has been ranked in
the top nine in the United States every year since his senior
season at TCU?
</P>
<P>
   For the third time in his life, Drummond endured a bout with
spinal meningitis in 1999. Earlier this track season, he was
hampered by a strained hamstring. His entire career at TCU, in
fact, seemed like one long injury.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the footnote that, all rankings aside, Drummond has
never won the 100 meters at a major meet _ not the NCAAs (injured
in '90, second in '91), not the U.S. championships (second in '94,
cramps in '98, etc.), and not the Olympic Games (sixth in his
semifinal in Atlanta).
</P>
<P>
   ``The last Olympics,'' Drummond explained Saturday, ``that was
just a mind-blowing experience. It was like I made the team and,
oh, I forgot you've got to go run a race there.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth, Texas, remains a distant memory. Drummond lives in
southern California now, where he trains with Greene and Johnson as
part of HSI International's world-class stable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like you saw today _ that's our practice,'' Drummond said of
the post-race, chest-thumping, we-the-man celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of trash-talking,'' Greene interjected.
</P>
<P>
   Greene did put on a veneer of interview-tent humility and tried
to sound humbled just to have made the Olympic team. But he had
talked a lot louder on Friday night, when he won his heat in 9.93
seconds and clucked at how some people (Michael Johnson,
presumably) thought he might not be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things have been said, but the bottom line here is to
just make the Olympic team,'' Greene declared Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Well, whatever. Johnson, 26, is a North Carolina product who,
like Drummond, has never won the 100 in a major national or
international meet. And Drummond will be 32 when he toes the
starting line in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Drummond clearly has the credentials. But you have to wonder
what the rest of the sprinting world is going to think of a U.S.
team in the 100 meters that doesn't have Carl Lewis (very retired),
Dennis Mitchell (finished last) or Mike Marsh (sixth in semis) on
it.
</P>
<P>
   Lest we forget, a U.S. sprinter hasn't crossed the finish line
first in the Olympic 100 meters since Lewis did it 16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's Ben Johnson won the 1988 Olympic final, only to be
disqualified for running on something more than unleaded. Great
Britain's Linford Christie took the gold medal at Barcelona in
1992. And Jamaica-born Donovan Bailey, running for Canada, led a
stunning 100 finish in Atlanta in which no U.S. runner finished in
the medals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sun's going to shine on a dog's butt sooner or later,''
Drummond observed Saturday. ``It's time to flip it. It's time for
world domination _ ``Pinky and the Brain'' stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   While he mended from his recent hamstring injury, Drummond
lamented, nobody came to interview him. Fine, he said. Saturday was
a much better day to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every man who suffers tribulation, he triumphs,'' Drummond
declared. ``Today was just a pit stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics, he predicted, is going to be much better for Jon
Drummond the second time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a gold medal,'' he said. ``I think I've been through
enough that I want a gold medal.''
</P>
<P>
   Stayed tuned. And bring plenty of notebook paper. nn

JOHNSON CAN'T STOP FIRED-UP RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The Texas Rangers pulled off the almost impossible
Saturday, a feat that could make catching the Seattle Mariners a
piece of cake by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Texas trailed the National League's most dominant pitcher, 5-1,
after six innings in his own ballpark, and rallied for what could
be their biggest victory of the year in what easily was a classic
baseball game.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, this might have been the Rangers' most complete
team victory because they needed contributions from almost
everybody on the roster to pull out a 6-5 victory against Randy
Johnson and the Arizona Diamondbacks at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, and Thursday's thrilling ninth-inning comeback,
gave the Rangers two of three against the first-place Diamondbacks,
who entered the series with second-best home record in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tremendous win,'' Rangers closer John Wetteland said. ``Some
guys stepped up today; it was awesome. The guy announcing the game
referred to them as the shock troops. That's awesome. Guys who
rarely get to play got in there and won the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis Alicea delivered the game-winner, a two-out triple in the
11th inning off reliever Greg Swindell that scored Mike Lamb from
first base with the go-ahead run. But Alicea was merely the last in
a long line of heroes on a day when the Rangers' starting lineup
didn't include Rafael Palmeiro, Rusty Greer, Ivan Rodriguez or
Lamb.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great team win,'' starter Matt Perisho said. ``The bullpen
came through, great clutch hitting. That was baseball at it's
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Jeff Zimmerman might have been at his best at a time
when the Rangers need him most. Showing some flashes of the form
that made him an All-Star last year, Zimmerman pitched 21/3
scoreless innings to get the victory. He kept the go-ahead run at
third base in the eighth inning by striking out Jason Conti to end
the inning and kept the Diamondbacks from scoring in the 10th after
Matt Williams led off with a double.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zim, no doubt, is throwing the ball as good as we've ever
seen,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``He's throwing some
nice sliders, and he's throwing his fastball by people. He got some
real big strikeouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman and five other Rangers pitchers showed their grit by
holding the Diamondbacks to 1-for-11 with runners in scoring
position, including 0-for-6 from the eighth inning on, when one bad
pitch could have meant the ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Diamondbacks' one hit with runners in scoring
position may have led to their downfall. It was a two-out, two-run
double by Johnson in the sixth inning that gave the Diamondbacks a
5-1 lead. Johnson was thrown out trying to stretch the double into
a triple, and his jaunt around the bases might have zapped him of
some needed strength.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' comeback began the next inning when Scott Sheldon
singled with two outs and scored on pinch hitter Kelly Dransfeldt's
double into the left-field corner. That made it 5-2, and the
Rangers added three more off Johnson in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pretty deflated after the eighth,'' Johnson said. ``I
didn't put them away. There are no excuses. I let them back in the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Scarborough Green, who struck out in his first three at-bats,
led off with a walk, and, after Chad Curtis flied out, David Segui
singled to left. Bill Haselman then lined his second run-scoring
double to right, scoring Green and moving Segui to third.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona manager Buck Showalter then replaced Johnson with
right-hander Vicente Padilla, but the Rangers weren't through.
Greer, pinch hitting for Gabe Kapler, bounced out to first base to
score Segui, and, after Rafael Palmeiro was walked intentionally,
Lamb singled to center to bring home Haselman.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers _ who had one run, three hits and 11 strikeouts in
the first six innings _ had tied the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two nice ballgames to win here,'' Oates said. ``You come in
here and you're able to battle back. A lot of clutch performances
out there.'' nn

TRACK STARS ALSO RUNNING AT THE MOUTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO - We went to a track meet Saturday and a professional
wrestling match broke out. Oh, for a few breathtaking seconds it
was all above board; Marion Jones and Maurice Greene made the 2000
U.S. Olympic team just like everybody assumed they would, Jones
leaving rival Inger Miller and Chryste Gaines in her vapor trail
and Greene breezing by Curtis Johnson and training partner Jon
Drummond on the second day of the U.S. Olympic Track and Field
Trials at Cal State Sacramento's Hornet Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Then the winners reported to the big tent for their postrace
press conferences and the atmosphere turned from sublime to silly
in around eight seconds flat, which we're pretty sure is some kind
of record.
</P>
<P>
   It began with Miller, of all people, posing the first question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's Michael Johnson?'' the Canoga Park resident wanted to
know, her interest in locating the world's fastest 200 and
400-meter runner tied to a guest column he had penned for Friday's
editions of USA Today that read, in part, ``I think Inger Miller
will have a tough time making the team. I think she and some of her
teammates ... have lost focus and rested on what they did last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   And people think our pen is poisoned?
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who had won his semifinal heat in the 400 meters
shortly before the 100 finals, was nowhere to be found, thereby
breaking the first commandment of responsible journalism: He who
rips shall promptly show his face for the figurative or literal
slap he may have coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael has a lot to say,'' Miller sniffed. ``Maybe he should
untie some of those beads in his hair. They're too tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Sigh. So much for taking the higher road. Lord knows it is the
one less-traveled in track and field these days, since impertinence
was discovered to be a shortcut to celebrity and lots of newspaper
and magazine column inches.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, no sooner had Miller finished dissing Johnson than
someone asked: Since Jones has announced her intentions to win five
gold medals in Sydney, where does that leave Miller?
</P>
<P>
   ``That puts me, I guess, stopping her from doing that,'' Miller
said, the irritation rising like bile in her throat.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 24, joined Miller, 28, and Gaines, 29, on the podium soon
thereafter and immediately the temperature in the tent fell
precipitously. Though they were sitting no more than two feet
apart, Jones and Miller didn't exchange so much as a glance, much
less a hello or a handshake.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War? It's alive and well in Sprintville, where nobody
gives anybody credit and everybody feels under siege.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jones, the fastest living sprinter on the planet, cannot
outrun the slings and arrows. Asked if she feels any added pressure
because of her brash Olympic predictions, the former Thousand Oaks
and Rio Mesa high school standout sighed and replied, ``If I had a
penny for every time somebody asked me that, I'd be very, very
rich.''
</P>
<P>
   That got Miller and Gaines giggling like sorority sisters. Uh,
Marion, they reminded her in so many words, you (begin ital)are(end
ital) very, very rich.
</P>
<P>
   Touche, said the suddenly sheepish $7 million woman. ``Maybe the
wrong choice of words,'' Jones said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   That was as warm as the exchanges between Jones and her sprint
court would get. Let's hope their baton handoffs in the 400 relay
in Sydney are keener.
</P>
<P>
   The women's signal that they were through having to pretend to
be happy to be U.S. Olympic teammates was none too subtle. Greene,
25, burst into the tent, screaming in a sing-song voice, ``I made
the Olympic team. I made the Olympic team.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget that Greene is the world record-holder in the event and
remember this: The 1996 Olympics proceeded without him after he
failed to get out of the first round at the U.S. Trials.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, this day should have belonged to the 31-year-old
Drummond, who had the run of his life when you consider his
near-death experience last year. He was stricken twice with spinal
meningitis and was bedridden for almost three weeks with
excruciating pain because of inflammation of the membrane
surrounding his brain. He lost 20 pounds but not one ounce of his
faith in God.
</P>
<P>
   It's a heartwarming story, to be sure. But there's no place for
sentiment in today's mud-slinging scene. And so Drummond was
content to trade one-liners with Greene, playing Dean Martin to
Greene's Frank Sinatra while the very quiet (by comparison) Johnson
played the straight man a la Sammy Davis Jr.
</P>
<P>
   There was one moment when we thought Drummond was going to lose
it. Somebody recounted what Miller, one of his training mates at
UCLA, had said about Johnson and Drummond, in mid-swill, spit out a
mouthful of water and squealed.
</P>
<P>
   All this in the name of promoting track and field. Frankly,
their methods struck us as all wet.

MADSEN MAKES GOOD IMPRESSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAMES MELROY  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ An injured wrist has limited Laker
first-round draft pick Mark Madsen to just three games during the
2000 NBA Summer Pro League at the Pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   But, a word of advice for anyone that comes in contact with
Madsen.
</P>
<P>
   Never bring up the word ``limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 90 seconds after entering the game for the first
time in the first quarter, Madsen was on the ground, diving for a
loose ball and giving his team a jump-ball possession.
</P>
<P>
   Tenacious? Scrappy? Yes, those adjectives apply. But Madsen's
given nickname says it all: ``Mad Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to give you 100 percent all the time and that's the
kind of guy we like,'' said Laker assistant coach Tex Winter, after
the Lakers' 114-112 loss to the Warriors on Saturday afternoon.
``He's a very tough competitor. They don't call him `Mad Dog' for
nothing, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   What made the hustle even more impressive was the fact that
Madsen has only been able to compete in three games this summer due
to a wrist injury suffered before the summer league began.
</P>
<P>
   Madsen appeared to be a bit rusty early on, and the wrist injury
clearly bothered his shooting. In fact, according to Winter, Madsen
should not even be attempting to shoot much, if at all, because of
the injury.
</P>
<P>
   But Madsen said that getting out and getting his blood pumping
in a game situation was the most important thing right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good to get out there and run up and down,'' said
Madsen, who finished with seven points and four rebounds in just
under 30 minutes of action. ``Getting my wind back and my timing
back will take a little time, but I felt good and I feel like I am
contributing to the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he hasn't been able to take the court as often as he may
have liked, Madsen has found time to do other important things
while in Long Beach, such as visit his grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Madsen family as a whole, has strong ties to the
Long Beach area.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather, Bill Gould, lives right down the street (from
the Pyramid) as a matter of fact,'' Madsen said after the game.
``And my mom (Erlyn Gould Madsen) went to Millikan High. Her
picture is up at the school. She's a great violinist. She's one of
the best violinist that has ever gone through that school.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the highlight of the whole summer thus far, occured
last night for Madsen. But it was no where near the basketball
court.
</P>
<P>
   Madsen was asked what it felt like to slip on a Laker jersey,
even if it was just a summer league version. Madsen's face broke
into a smile, thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh it felt unbelievable,'' Madsen said. ``In fact, they gave
me my old No. 35 (to wear next season) and I was wearing it last
night in the hotel room.'' Porter trying to rise again
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the 1999-2000 college basketball season,
Chris Porter was on top of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Porter was on the cover of Sports Illustrated and expected to
lead Auburn to a final four appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Less than one year later, Porter is trying to show the Golden
State Warriors that he deserves to play this season, despite being
a second round draft pick this past June.
</P>
<P>
   But Porter, who was talked about as being a potential lottery
pick for the 1999 NBA Draft, is not letting his situation get him
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just trying to go out, have fun and prove myself out
here,'' Porter said after helping lead Golden State to a win over
the Lakers. ``That's what this league is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter, a 6-7 forward, was impressive for the Warriors, scoring
14 points and giving the crowd a chance to see his high-flying
abilities.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Porter made what seemed to be an impossible layup with
just over one minute left in regulation during a tie game, falling
out of bounds while drawing a flagrant foul from Lakers' guard John
Celestand.
</P>
<P>
   Porter made the free throw, but was unable to stay in the game,
suffering a thigh injury on the play.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the injury though, Porter remained positive on his
future in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know what I can do,'' Porter said. ``I just need to get
the ball and do my thing, then everything will take care of itself.
I am just going to work out and work on the things I need to do to
improve my game.'' Kobe vs. Magic?
</P>
<P>
   As the days' games neared end, there was still no confirmation
as to whether a much-anticipated match up would occur tonight at
7:30 when the Magic Johnson All-Stars take on Olimpia Milano of
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   No, the match-up of the teams is somewhat inconsequential in
comparison to the rumor that Magic Johnson may suit up to play with
his team, while Olimpia Milano may have the services of Kobe
Bryant, the team's owner.
</P>
<P>
   Though there was no confirmation that the two will take the
court tonight, Marni Colbert, the Director of Operations for the
Pro Summer League, did say that the summer league has ``extended an
invitation to both players.''

GALAXY WASTES BIG CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA - With a chance to claim the Western Division lead and
Major League Soccer's best record, what was left of the Galaxy
finally surrendered to what was left of D.C. United, 2-1, Saturday
in front of 15,714 at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   World Cup qualifying hit both teams hard. The Galaxy missed six
starters - Cobi Jones, Robin Fraser, Greg Vanney, Mauricio
Cienfuegos, Luis Hernandez and Ezra Hendrickson - to their national
teams.
</P>
<P>
   United, fighting for its playoff lives after winning three of
the first four MLS championships, benefited from having Bolivian
playmakers Marco Etcheverry and Jaime Moreno, who were both sent
back after reporting late to Bolivia's World Cup qualifying
training site.
</P>
<P>
   United was without Eddie Pope, Raul Diaz Arce, Ben Olsen and
Jeff Agoos because of injuries and national team commitments, but
the services of Etcheverry and particularly Moreno made the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno assisted on both of United's goals by Pete Marino and
A.J. Wood to keep United's (5-13-6, 21 points) playoff heart
beating while the Galaxy (10-6-7, 37 points) failed to pass
West-leading Kansas City (11-4-5, 38 points), which dropped a 2-0
decision to Columbus earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a frustrating loss because D.C. was there to be beaten,''
said Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid. ``I've always said that they're much
better than their record indicates, but tonight I didn't think they
were as good as D.C. has been in the past, so we let them off the
hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman made a bad decision that led to
United's first goal in the seventh minute.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno chipped a pass over Paul Caligiuri for Marino, who barely
beat the Galaxy's offside trap. Instead of holding his position
while Caligiuri recovered to chase Marino down, Hartman started to
charge out of his area, then stopped when he realized he couldn't
get to the ball before Marino.
</P>
<P>
   It left the D.C. striker with an empty net. All he had left was
a simple chip over Hartman's head for his ninth goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy answered quickly thanks to a United mistake. With
Galaxy midfielder Pete Vagenas nearby, D.C. defender Geoff Aunger
tried to drop a pass back for Carey Talley, but the ball slipped
off his foot. Talley and Aunger looked at each other instead of
chasing the ball, leaving Vagenas alone to run on and pick it up.
</P>
<P>
   Vagenas hurried in to challenge Talley, cutting outside to his
right, then finishing with a hard strike to the left corner to even
the match at 1-1 in the 17th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Vagenas had a chance to put the Galaxy in front early in the
second half, but a bad first touch following a perfectly placed
pass from Simon Elliott prevented him from beating United
goalkeeper Mark Simpson in the 51st minute.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno made the Galaxy pay again. The crafty striker beat Zak
Ibsen to the left endline, then slipped a pass in front for A.J.
Wood, who finished from 5 yards straightaway past Hartman to give
D.C. the game-winner in the 53rd minute.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy defender Danny Califf, sporting a new blond hairdo, said
the Galaxy spoiled a golden opportunity with a road game at Tampa
Bay next week.

   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Sparks guard Tamecka Dixon scored two
crucial free throws with 1.3 seconds to play to give the Minnesota
Lynx their sixth consecutive loss in a 58-57 decision in front of
6,071 at the Forum Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was a physical game from start to finish. The foul-plagued
Sparks got the victory without forward DeLisha Milton, who was
ejected after picking up her second technical early in the second
half. Overall, there were five technical fouls called, four on the
Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if the Lynx would spoil the Sparks night when Betty
Lennox scored an 18-footer from the right baseline to give
Minnesota a 57-56 advantage with 6.8 seconds to play. But Dixon got
the inbound pass from Mwadi Mabika, drove around to the right
baseline and drew a foul from former UCLA standout Maylana Martin,
who fouled out with her sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks had the lead much of the second half until the rookie
Lennox hit a 3-pointer from the top of the key to make it 55-54
Minnesota. But Lisa Leslie, who redeemed herself with 24 points, 13
rebounds and five blocked shots after a poor showing against the
Houston Comets Friday, scored two free throws with 12.8 seconds to
play to put the Sparks back up 56-55.
</P>
<P>
   It was a hard-fought win for the Sparks, who pulled within a
game of WNBA leader Houston in the Western Conference leader
Houston, to improve to 18-3.
</P>
<P>
   They had to find a way to get it done without Milton, who was
ejected after picking up her second technical foul with 18:25 to
play. Milton, who got into a little talking duel with the Lynx'
Keitha Dickerson, had just been called for an offensive foul on
Dickerson. Milton came down the court and was clapping her hands
when the official hit her with the technical. She said she was only
applauding the call, but the official obviously didn't see it that
way and ejected her. She left with two points and three rebounds in
16 minutes of play.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks squandered a 10-point lead in the physical first half
when technicals were called on Sparks coach Michael Cooper, Leslie
and Milton and the Lynx' Keitha Dickerson. Things got heated
between Milton and Dickerson, but the confrontation was quickly
diffused after an exchange of words.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie, Milton and Mwadi Mabika each picked up three fouls in
the half, which closed with a 26-25 Sparks advantage. Tamecka Dixon
sparked a 10-0 run with an 18-footer, but the Sparks weren't able
to maintain the momentum. Katie Smith scored 10 of her team's next
14 points to pull the Lynx within one point at the break.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Smith had 20 points and Martin finished with 11 points and
six rebounds for Minnesota (10-11).
</P>
<P>
   SPARKS NOTES: Allison Feaster suffered a bruised right knee with
three minutes to play in the game. ... Leslie, Milton and Mabika
are off to the WNBA All-Star Game in Phoenix Monday, while the rest
of the Sparks enjoy a two-day rest. ... Lennox and Smith are
All-Stars for the Lynx. ... The Sparks return to play Thursday with
a home game against New York.

BURRELL MAKES TEAM BUT FALLS SHORT OF VICTORY

<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO - Heaven help the competition if Shelia Burrell ever
masters the high jump. She came within four points of winning the
heptathlon at the U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials on Saturday
despite finishing 15th out of 17 competitors in the event on the
first day of the two-day competition.
</P>
<P>
   Burrell, 28, beat DeDee Nathan by nearly five seconds in the
competition-concluding 800 meters but couldn't overtake Nathan in
the standings. Nathan finished with 6,343 points to Burrell's
6,339.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan, 32, twice had missed the Olympic team by one spot,
finishing fourth at the 1992 and 1996 Trials. If there's anything
worse than coming close to making the Olympic team, it's not coming
close at all.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Burrell, who was 14th at the Trials in 1996. She was so
crushed by the result, she turned her back on track. ``I stopped
running track in '97 because I was so frustrated,'' Burrell said.
``So making the Olympic team is a huge deal for me. I've been
through so much to get to this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Burrell was working as a personal trainer in 1998 when she
decided to take on a very high-strung client: herself. She chose to
resume her relationship with the heptathlon, with Cal State
Northridge coach Jeff McAuley acting as a mediator.
</P>
<P>
   Burrell lived in Reseda until last fall, at which time she moved
to Manhattan, Kan., to get intensive coaching in the high jump.
``As you can see, I need help,'' she said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   She continues to seek out McAuley for coaching, sharing ideas
with him the way she does a water bottle with Nathan when they're
both competing. Marion Jones and Inger Miller, the two heptathletes
decidedly are not.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are they Jackie Joyner-Kersee, the American who put her
stamp all over the heptathlon before retiring in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be considered a great athlete like Jackie,'' Burrell
said. ``I aspire to be like her both on the field and off the
field. But nobody's going to break her (American) record (7,291
points).''
</P>
<P>
   Burrell's own career is proof you should never say never.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you what,'' she said, her eyes sparkling, ``If I figure
out the high jump, it's over. Look out.''

KEFLEZIGHI SEES VISION COME TRUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO - This is why Mebrahtom Keflezighi turned down the
chance three years ago to make history; this is why he passed on
becoming the first track athlete to represent his native Eritrea at
the World Championships:
</P>
<P>
   So that on a warm and windless July night in the capital of his
adopted state he could take a victory lap while clutching the
national flags of Eritrea and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``Months before the Olympics I was visualizing this. I'd be
visualizing it, visualizing it and visualizing it and then I'd tell
myself snap out of it because I had to stay focused,'' Keflezighi
said late Friday night upon becoming the first athlete at the U.S.
Olympic Track and Field Trials to earn a berth to Sydney with a
victory in the 10,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Keflezighi, 25, was timed in 28:03.32, his personal best by 26
seconds and .03 better than runner-up Alan Culpepper, who sneaked
up on Keflezighi in the final meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have been happy making the team, but I would have been
mad if he had passed me,'' said Keflezighi, who has been slowed
recently by tendinitis in his knees.
</P>
<P>
   The knees held up just fine Friday. The prohibitive prerace
favorite, Bob Kennedy, didn't compete because of injuries he
suffered in a car accident in May. Kennedy's absence created a
window of opportunity that the 5-foot-7 Keflezighi was able to slip
through. He took the lead on the 17th lap around the Hornet Stadium
track and, in his words, ``hung on'' the final two laps.
</P>
<P>
   Keflezighi, a former NCAA champion in the 5,000 and 10,000, fled
Eritrea with his family in 1985. He became a U.S. citizen in 1998.
Last year he finished fourth at the U.S. Championships and fifth at
the Pan American Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years ago when I graduated from UCLA, I talked with Coach
(Bob) Larsen and we set our goal for Sydney then,'' said
Keflezighi, the third of 10 children born to Russom, a taxi driver,
and his wife Awetash. ``The talent was there. I just needed the
chance to work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Larsen, who knows better than most the price Keflezighi paid in
beads of sweat for his berth to Sydney, was uncharacteristically
emotional after the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish you had film of me in the stands after he won,'' Larsen
said. ``People who know me know I'm low-key, but I was jumping up
and down.''
</P>
<P>
   Local update: USC junior Angela Williams, running in the same
100-meters semifinal heat as Marion Jones, finished sixth and
failed to advance to the finals. The 20-year-old was timed in
11.33, off her 1999 best of 11.04. ... Another casualty was John
Godina, the 1996 Olympic silver medalist in the shot put. Adam
Nelson put the shot 72 feet, 7 inches
</P>
<P>
   the best mark in the world in three years - and C.J. Hunter and
Andy Bloom posted career bests to surpass Godina, who fouled on his
final attempt. ``I just didn't have a big throw in me,'' a glum
Godina said. ... Frances Santin, a sophomore at Cal State
Northridge, advanced to the semifinals of the 400-meter hurdles
with a personal best qualifying time of 56.67. ... One of the
attending physicians at the meet is Dr. Eric Heiden, who won five
gold medals in speed skating at the 1980 Winter Olympics. Heiden is
an orthopedic surgeon at the UC Davis Medical Center.

<P>
   ``They are very gritty, defensively,'' Sparks coach Michael

</P>
<P>
   This was definitely one of those games with all the pushing and
showing going on.

left with two points and three rebounds in 16 minutes of play. ``I
came back down the court and clapped my hands, good call, good
call' ... and he threw me out. What can I do about it. They (the
officials) were sensitive tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said the official most likely took the gesture as a bit
of sarcasm. After the game he told Milton she had to be smarter in
situations like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't costs us a loss, but it did costs us D,'' Cooper
said. ``She apologized for it. ... These are the learning processes
for a championship team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks squandered a 10-point lead in the first half when
technicals were called on Cooper, Leslie and Milton and Dickerson.

   HMO - A health care meltdown in rural Arizona this summer is
forcing elderly residents to go to Mexico for affordable drugs, lie
about their addresses to maintain coverage and take menial jobs to
help pay for their care. Many retirees in rural communities are
cutting back on their medications because the HMO programs that
recently provided prescription benefits are gone. Story will move
in the ``A'' category.
</P>
<P>
   HMOSIDE -About 13,000 seniors are getting the boot Jan. 1 from
Medicare HMOs, the latest in a wave of exits that has pushed out
54,200 rural Arizonans from the federal health insurance program
since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves only one rural Arizona county, Santa Cruz, with an

<P>
   One rainy night in Anchorage, Alaska, anthropologist Nancy Yaw
Davis had an ``aha!'' moment.
</P>
<P>
   She began to make a connection between the Zuni people of the
Southwest and a caravan of Buddhist monks who, she believes,
migrated in the 14th century from Japan to the west coast of what
is now the American continent.
</P>
<P>
   Her theory, 40 years in the making, could shake up the field of
anthropology, which she says has become a bit stodgy.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the scientific establishment has dismissed her notion,
but she says with an impish grin, ``I've got them nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis discussed her just-published book recently
</P>
<P>
   at Changing Hands Bookstore in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Since that rainy Alaskan night in 1960, Davis has been gathering
bits and pieces of information on her theory while teaching,
raising a family and now running an Anchorage consulting firm
involved in research, writing and applied anthropology.
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of what became an obsession were planted when she was
a graduate student reading (beginitalic)The Mind of East Asia
(enditalic)by Lily Abegg. When she came across a chart detailing
the Chinese system of yin and yang, she found it remarkably similar
to a chart on Zuni religion she had prepared for a class three
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The similarity blew me out of the water,'' Davis says.
</P>
<P>
   By the next year, that discovery had led her on a path to her
master's thesis comparing the Zuni and Japanese languages,
including a long list of nearly common words. Her anthropology
professor at the University of Chicago was not impressed. He read
one paragraph of the paper and tossed it aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go back to Alaska and do something respectable,'' he told her.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional dogma rejected any notion that Native American
languages might have connections with other languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was devastated,'' Davis says, remembering feeling foolish
that she had worked so hard on a paper that would go unread.
</P>
<P>
   Crushed, she took the professor's advice. She returned to
Anchorage, began teaching at Alaska Methodist University, married
William Davis in 1962, bore three children and earned a doctorate
from the University of Washington in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of a Japanese-Zuni connection continued to haunt
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't stop,'' she says. ``It's a theory with 1,000
ideas.{hellip} I knew I was onto something hot that would be
accepted someday.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than 30 years, she pieced together those 1,000 ideas,
reading every Zuni article published, logging every nugget of
information. On Oct. 18, 1994 - Alaska Day - she began to write her
book.
</P>
<P>
   Here is her theory: Around the 11th or 12th centuries, ``all
hell was breaking loose'' in the social structure of Japan, and the
island nation was plagued by repeated natural disasters, including
a series of earthquakes. Davis believes Japanese sailors began to
leave the country in successive waves.
</P>
<P>
   One of the last of these waves of migration set sail around
1350, Davis believes, led by a group of Buddhist monks in search of
(beginitalic)Itiwanna, (enditalic)the center of the universe. Davis
surmises that favorable currents landed the monks in what is now
California.
</P>
<P>
   As the pilgrims moved eastward, they attracted Native Americans
drawn to the notion of (beginitalic)Itiwanna(enditalic). Disparate
clans united in a kind of search for Oz with trails eastward as
their Yellow Brick Road.
</P>
<P>
   In an area of what is now west-central New Mexico and
east-central Arizona, just south of Chaco Canyon, they believed
they had found their Emerald City
((beginitalic)Itiwanna(enditalic)), Davis says.
</P>
<P>
   Chaco Canyon was the subject of a recent public television
documentary narrated by Robert Redford, which
</P>
<P>
   examined the grand and vast settlement built by ancient people.
</P>
<P>
   Settlers in the Zuni territory, Davis says, were an amalgam of
Japanese, Anasazi and A:shiwi - the name the Zuni give themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence she has collected to support her theory includes
language, religion and crafts with roots in Japanese tradition but
distinctive from other Native American cultures. She has found
biological links through blood type, tooth shape, skull
configuration and a kidney ailment prominent in both the Zuni and
the Japanese. Both cultures had a mythology that embraced images of
the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Far-fetched?
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists believe so, holding to the traditional idea that
Native Americans are descended from people who migrated over land
from Siberia 12,000 years ago, traveling across the Bering Strait.
</P>
<P>
   Others have postulated theories of trans-Pacific contact between
people overseas and Native Americans without much credibility, says
Keith Kintigh, professor of anthropology at Arizona State
University. Kintigh, who specializes in Zuni and upper Little
Colorado archaeology, is mentioned in (beginitalic)The Zuni
Enigma(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of ink spilled over these theories, and it
hasn't gotten us very far,'' Kintigh says. ``These arguments are
hard to evaluate.''
</P>
<P>
   He would not comment specifically on Davis' book, since he has
not read it but says that out of 100 theories that seem to ``upset
the apple cart'' of anthropology, only one pans out.
</P>
<P>
   If true, Davis' theory would be ``a major change in the way we
think of these things,'' he says. ``I'm kind of skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the scientific community has so far dismissed her work
and snubbed her requests to present her findings at professional
conferences, Davis is undaunted. If nothing else, she says, her
book could spark a discussion of her ideas and blow the dust off
the field of anthropology.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the challenge, to open up the discussion,'' she says.
``If I'm wrong, prove that I'm wrong.'' Peter Schwepker/The Arizona
RepublicNancy Yaw Davis, author of a new book on a possible
Zuni-Japanese relationship, says, ``It's a theory with 1,000
ideas.''

   HMO - A health care meltdown in rural Arizona this summer is
forcing elderly residents to go to Mexico for affordable drugs, lie
about their addresses to maintain coverage and take menial jobs to
help pay for their care. Many retirees in rural communities are
cutting back on their medications because the HMO programs that
recently provided prescription benefits are gone. Story will move
in the ``A'' category.

<P>
   HMOSIDE -About 13,000 seniors are getting the boot Jan. 1 from
Medicare HMOs, the latest in a wave of exits that has pushed out
54,200 rural Arizonans from the federal health insurance program
since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves only one rural Arizona county, Santa Cruz, with an
HMO, a stark change from a few years ago, when rural Arizona was a
national model for its numerous choices in health care delivery.
Story will move in the `A' category.

   WNBA - By the measures of TV deals and sponsorship packages, as

close to the elite ranks of men's professional sports. Even still,
as the league readies for its biggest event of the year, the 2000
WNBA All-Star Game, to be played at America West Arena on Monday
night, there are subtle signs the WNBA is making its mark in the
cluttered iconography of American sports. Story will move in the

<TEXT>
<P>
   One rainy night in Anchorage, Alaska, anthropologist Nancy Yaw
Davis had an ``aha!'' moment.
</P>
<P>
   She began to make a connection between the Zuni people of the
Southwest and a caravan of Buddhist monks who, she believes,
migrated in the 14th century from Japan to the west coast of what
is now the American continent.
</P>
<P>
   Her theory, 40 years in the making, could shake up the field of
anthropology, which she says has become a bit stodgy.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the scientific establishment has dismissed her notion,
but she says with an impish grin, ``I've got them nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis discussed her just-published book recently
</P>
<P>
   at Changing Hands Bookstore in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Since that rainy Alaskan night in 1960, Davis has been gathering
bits and pieces of information on her theory while teaching,
raising a family and now running an Anchorage consulting firm
involved in research, writing and applied anthropology.
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of what became an obsession were planted when she was
a graduate student reading (beginitalic)The Mind of East Asia
(enditalic)by Lily Abegg. When she came across a chart detailing
the Chinese system of yin and yang, she found it remarkably similar
to a chart on Zuni religion she had prepared for a class three
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The similarity blew me out of the water,'' Davis says.
</P>
<P>
   By the next year, that discovery had led her on a path to her
master's thesis comparing the Zuni and Japanese languages,
including a long list of nearly common words. Her anthropology
professor at the University of Chicago was not impressed. He read
one paragraph of the paper and tossed it aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go back to Alaska and do something respectable,'' he told her.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional dogma rejected any notion that Native American
languages might have connections with other languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was devastated,'' Davis says, remembering feeling foolish
that she had worked so hard on a paper that would go unread.
</P>
<P>
   Crushed, she took the professor's advice. She returned to
Anchorage, began teaching at Alaska Methodist University, married
William Davis in 1962, bore three children and earned a doctorate
from the University of Washington in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of a Japanese-Zuni connection continued to haunt
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't stop,'' she says. ``It's a theory with 1,000
ideas.{hellip} I knew I was onto something hot that would be
accepted someday.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than 30 years, she pieced together those 1,000 ideas,
reading every Zuni article published, logging every nugget of
information. On Oct. 18, 1994 - Alaska Day - she began to write her
book.
</P>
<P>
   Here is her theory: Around the 11th or 12th centuries, ``all
hell was breaking loose'' in the social structure of Japan, and the
island nation was plagued by repeated natural disasters, including
a series of earthquakes. Davis believes Japanese sailors began to
leave the country in successive waves.
</P>
<P>
   One of the last of these waves of migration set sail around
1350, Davis believes, led by a group of Buddhist monks in search of
(beginitalic)Itiwanna, (enditalic)the center of the universe. Davis
surmises that favorable currents landed the monks in what is now
California.
</P>
<P>
   As the pilgrims moved eastward, they attracted Native Americans
drawn to the notion of (beginitalic)Itiwanna(enditalic). Disparate
clans united in a kind of search for Oz with trails eastward as
their Yellow Brick Road.
</P>
<P>
   In an area of what is now west-central New Mexico and
east-central Arizona, just south of Chaco Canyon, they believed
they had found their Emerald City
((beginitalic)Itiwanna(enditalic)), Davis says.
</P>
<P>
   Chaco Canyon was the subject of a recent public television
documentary narrated by Robert Redford, which
</P>
<P>
   examined the grand and vast settlement built by ancient people.
</P>
<P>
   Settlers in the Zuni territory, Davis says, were an amalgam of
Japanese, Anasazi and A:shiwi - the name the Zuni give themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence she has collected to support her theory includes
language, religion and crafts with roots in Japanese tradition but
distinctive from other Native American cultures. She has found
biological links through blood type, tooth shape, skull
configuration and a kidney ailment prominent in both the Zuni and
the Japanese. Both cultures had a mythology that embraced images of
the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Far-fetched?
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists believe so, holding to the traditional idea that
Native Americans are descended from people who migrated over land
from Siberia 12,000 years ago, traveling across the Bering Strait.
</P>
<P>
   Others have postulated theories of trans-Pacific contact between
people overseas and Native Americans without much credibility, says
Keith Kintigh, professor of anthropology at Arizona State
University. Kintigh, who specializes in Zuni and upper Little
Colorado archaeology, is mentioned in (beginitalic)The Zuni
Enigma(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of ink spilled over these theories, and it
hasn't gotten us very far,'' Kintigh says. ``These arguments are
hard to evaluate.''
</P>
<P>
   He would not comment specifically on Davis' book, since he has
not read it but says that out of 100 theories that seem to ``upset
the apple cart'' of anthropology, only one pans out.
</P>
<P>
   If true, Davis' theory would be ``a major change in the way we
think of these things,'' he says. ``I'm kind of skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the scientific community has so far dismissed her work
and snubbed her requests to present her findings at professional
conferences, Davis is undaunted. If nothing else, she says, her
book could spark a discussion of her ideas and blow the dust off
the field of anthropology.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the challenge, to open up the discussion,'' she says.
``If I'm wrong, prove that I'm wrong.'' Peter Schwepker/The Arizona
RepublicNancy Yaw Davis, author of a new book on a possible
Zuni-Japanese relationship, says, ``It's a theory with 1,000
ideas.''

   The people trying to brand Dave Richert a racist didn't bother
asking Diane Garner about the time Dave stopped by her house
demanding clothes and furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Dave's wife had told him about a Hispanic family who'd lost
everything. Richert rented a U-Haul truck and drove from friend to
friend, collecting whatever each could spare. He then delivered
everything to the grateful family.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw Dave labeled a racist in the paper, it just made me
sick,'' Garner says. ``Doesn't a person's life count for anything
anymore?''
</P>
<P>
   No. Not in politics
</P>
<P>
   Richert is the director of the Phoenix Planning Department. Last
April, he was at a meeting with a group of mostly Latino mobile
food vendors. One of the men at the meeting was translating for
another. Richert, who thought everyone in the room understood
English, interrupted the men and said, ``Speak English, I need to
understand you.''
</P>
<P>
   For this, local attorney Stephen Montoya filed a formal
complaint against Richert. An investigation of the director and his
department was ordered by City Manager Frank Fairbanks, who hired
an outside law firm.
</P>
<P>
   From what I read, the law firm's report condemns Richert for the
gruff comment, declares his department ``very White'' and lists the
complaints of a number of minority employees who no longer work
there.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, investigators didn't note the time Richert
contributed $400 toward the funeral of a young Hispanic boy who had
died of cancer. Richert's wife, Diane, a long-time school nurse,
was acquainted with the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how much time and money Dave has poured into
our school,'' Diane says. ``We have about a 66 percent minority
population. You could say a lot of things about Dave. For one
thing, he's not a Cubs fan, which I hold against him. But he is
absolutely not a racist.''
</P>
<P>
   Richert has worked for the city for 28 years. He's taught Sunday
school, coached youth sports. Each year, he works at a
back-to-school clothing drive for kids.
</P>
<P>
   He has apologized directly to one of the men at the meeting and
apologized through the media to any Latino who may have been
offended. Still, the lawyer Montoya tells me it's not enough. He's
``disturbed'' Richert hasn't apologized in person to the other man
at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Richert did not curse at anyone. He didn't use an ethnic slur.
He didn't threaten.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter. These days, being called a racist is as bad
as being one. Worse, if the accusation somehow makes the papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think his career should be derailed,'' Montoya said of
Richert. ``Why? Because I think it was a mistake and I think people
need to forgive others as long as they acknowledge they made a
mistake and don't do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not about forgiveness, though. It's about appearances. It's
about politicians and bureaucrats who can't bear the weight of
controversy because they have no spines.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it would have been nice if the people calling Richert a
racist had first spoken to his daughter, Jenny. She would have told
them her dad paid for an extra year of college so she could learn
Spanish. And how she uses it, now, as a teacher in a bilingual
education program.

<P>
   KEARNY - A health care meltdown in rural Arizona this summer is
forcing elderly residents to go to Mexico for affordable drugs, lie
about their addresses to maintain coverage and take menial jobs to
help pay for their care.
</P>
<P>
   Many retirees in rural communities are cutting back on their
medications because the HMO programs that recently provided
prescription benefits are gone.
</P>
<P>
   More than 54,000 seniors have been dropped from HMOs in rural
Arizona since 1998. And those who have gone back to traditional
Medicare programs say they can't afford to pay for their
medications.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kearny United Drug Store in this eastern Arizona mining
town, there is a bin near the cash register where customers pick up
their orders. Each month, dozens of prescriptions are left behind,
many by sticker-shocked elderly customers who walk away from the
counter, unable to afford their medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In his 50 years as a pharmacist, Luis Mendoza hasn't seen
anything like it.
</P>
<P>
   Some customers tell him that they will just have to go without.
Others say they can get the same drugs in Mexico for less than half
the price.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Stores of Flagstaff says she begs for medical samples
from her doctors or sometimes does without. She has a $636 monthly
income and spends $200 a month on medications. It would be $400 if
she bought everything her doctor says she should be taking.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lindenmayer, 56, a disabled mechanic who lives in the little
southeast Arizona town of Cochise, has a cash flow problem: He
requires a pain prescription that costs him $750 a month. His
income is $593 a month. To get by, he has cut back on the pain
medication and learned to live with nausea. There is a pill he is
supposed to be taking for the nausea, but that would be $150 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough to make you ill,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Worst yet to come
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacists, doctors, elder advocates and seniors throughout
Arizona seem to agree that rural Arizona seniors are victims of a
health care crisis that began three years ago and will reach a
crescendo in January, when the remaining HMOs leave all but one
rural county.
</P>
<P>
   By then, only tiny Santa Cruz County, just north of the Mexican
border at Nogales, will have an HMO Medicare program. That is a
stark change from three years ago, when many seniors in rural
Arizona had a choice of managed health care plans. A state that was
once a model for statewide access to HMOs has totally reversed
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know what people are going to do,'' says
Mayetta Payton, a Kearny drugstore clerk.
</P>
<P>
   Though HMO pullouts in rural areas and high prescription costs
are national issues, rural Arizona is hit harder. Almost all rural
counties in the state have experienced double-digit growth during
the past decade, with much of the growth coming from retirees, some
coming for the peace and quiet and scenery, but many seeking lower
living costs.
</P>
<P>
   Many blame legislators for allowing HMO programs to avoid
serving rural areas, while others blame Congress for not moving
fast enough to provide a prescription benefit for Medicare. The
United States is the only Western nation to not have prescription
drugs included in its elder health care program.
</P>
<P>
   Any blame left over is commonly directed at the drug companies
for charging the world's highest drug prices to the same taxpayers
who subsidized the development of many of the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Although some worry that a forced reduction in prices would
reduce the money available to drug companies for the development of
new drugs, others say the high prices charged in America allow drug
companies to spend huge sums lobbying in Washington and state
capitals to protect their current price structure.
</P>
<P>
   Industry lobbying
</P>
<P>
   According to a study released earlier this month by Public
Citizen, a consumer watchdog group, prescription drug companies
spent $235.7million from 1997 to 1999 to lobby Congress and the
White House, and spent tens of millions more for supportive ads in
the media. On the Medicare drug benefit and drug pricing issue
alone, drug companies hired 297 lobbyists - one for every two
members of Congress, according to the study. The drug industry also
shelled out $33.4million in direct political contributions to
candidates and parties since 1993, according to Public Citizen.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs donated more than $14million to political campaigns since
1995, according to an earlier study by the same group.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Giuliano, 64, of Dripping Springs, near Winkelman, says
she wonders if the lagging access to affordable drugs has anything
to do with an obituary surge she's noticed among those ages 65-70
in (beginitalic)Copper Country News(enditalic). She is organizing
letter writing, petition drives and protests by seniors. Groups
from the Hayden, Globe and Payson areas plan to join her. She hopes
to bombard Congress before this year's election with letters asking
that Medicare have a decent prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliano, with one kidney, heart disease and diabetes, has $800
in prescription drugs to buy each month. From Hayden, she takes a
long bus ride to Mexico, where she now gets her medicine for $350.
Older and sicker people cannot do that, she worries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy to have to go there. The Mexican pharmacies don't
take credit cards or a check, so seniors have to carry hundreds of
dollars in cash, and some shouldn't even be driving or out of their
homes,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Retiree Bob Jones of Kearny says the Legislature should require
HMOs that want to do business in Arizona to serve people regardless
of where they live within the state.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for loopholes
</P>
<P>
   Though some retirees are expected to migrate to urban areas
because of the health crisis, others will look for loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some just lie about where they live,'' says Della Soliz of
Hayden. ``Sons and daughters in Phoenix or Tucson are letting their
parents use their addresses. The situation is forcing many to
become liars.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after her HMO left, she rented a post office box a
mile away, across a county line, to be eligible for coverage. But
she gave up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't live with that lie,'' Soliz says. ``I have lived in
Hayden for 42 years, and that is home.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who lie about their permanent residence are committing
fraud and risk having their claims denied.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Lent, a benefits counselor with the Area Agency on Aging
in northern Arizona counties of Yavapai, Coconino, Navajo and
Apache counties, says that she has been receiving more calls from
potential retirees planning ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before moving here, they now ask about health care along with
housing information,'' Lent says.
</P>
<P>
   That caution could spell an economic change for the state's
growth patterns, says Robert Dubits, who counsels seniors about
Medicare benefits in southern Arizona counties of Graham, Greenlee,
Cochise and Santa Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   He is carefully watching the discussions in Congress, but
believes they have a long way to go. Half of the seniors and
disabled people he counsels are below the poverty line. One of the
congressional plans calls for a $250 premium, with seniors paying
50percent of the cost of their prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the rural people I counsel don't have $30 or $40 extra
in the bank,'' he says.
</P>

   Work for benefits
</P>
<P>
   Many retirees are taking on small jobs for a work-related
prescription benefit, or for the extra cash to buy their medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Waitress Judy Leivas, 68, of Kingman, earns mostly tips, four
days a week, at an Interstate-40 truck stop. But it isn't the money
she's working for; it's the health insurance. Leivas, who has been
a waitress since 1947, says she can't count on Medicare covering
her health costs. A drug she takes for pancreatic problems three
times a day now costs her only $7 a month, compared with $33. When
she came down with bronchitis this winter, all her tests were fully
covered. Under Medicare, she would have had to pay for 20 percent
of the care, not easy on her Social Security income. Retirement
sounds nice, but it isn't an option, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Bullhead City retirees are going over to casinos in Laughlin,
Nev., and washing dishes or busing tables, just enough work to get
health benefits that cover prescriptions. Other former retirees
around rural Arizona are working at drugstores to get prescription
discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Others are too old or ill to work. Dr. Jeff Crawford, one of two
family practice physicians in Kearny, finds himself spending more
time calming down his older patients, who become panicked by costs.
He tells his retirees to consider moving to Apache Junction on the
far edge of the Phoenix area, the only Pinal County ZIP codes where
coverage is offered. He urges them to raise their political voices
to change Medicare and get what they need to survive.
</P>
<P>
   He worries that his advice is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can sense a social depression developing,'' he says. He
worries that fear will harm his older patients' health.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this isn't already a health care crisis, we are getting
there fast,'' says Anne McKinley of Prescott, an expert on rural
health care.
</P>
<P>
   So many small-town hospitals have closed that people now have to
drive great distances for care. Even government facilities such as
the Veterans Affairs hospital in Fort Huachuca have been downgraded
to clinics where surgery is no longer available. As a result,
McKinley says, the elderly are becoming totally dependent on
friends or family members who have cars and time.
</P>
<P>
   From Ash Fork or Seligman, it is a 70-mile drive to a hospital.
From Cordez Junction or Hayden, it is 40 to 50 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasingly,'' she says, ``the medical option available to
many rural elders is to pray for a miracle.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   About 13,000 seniors are getting the boot Jan. 1 from Medicare
HMOs, the latest in a wave of exits that has pushed out 54,200
rural Arizonans from the federal health insurance program since
1998.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves only one rural Arizona county, Santa Cruz, with an
HMO, a stark change from a few years ago, when rural Arizona was a
national model for its numerous choices in health care delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Arizona seniors are scrambling to find new coverage
before the end the year, all in counties where HMOs have bailed,
and the only option is returning to traditional Medicare, which
often comes with higher premiums and fewer benefits, most notably
no prescription co-pays.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs are dropping seniors nationwide. About 700,000 seniors will
be cut from their Medicare+Choice HMOs, according to a survey
released earlier this month by the American Association of Health
Plans, which represents the nation's HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Like other segments of the health care industry, HMOs blame the
Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which cut payments to Medicare HMO
plans. That financial whack, coupled with the meteoric rise of
prescription drug costs, made providing senior health plans much
less profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Edmund Celis of Kearny is among the seniors facing the prospect
of no HMO coverage with the withdrawal of PacifiCare of Arizona
from most of Pinal County.
</P>
<P>
   PacifiCare's exit on Jan. 1 will mark the second time in two
years that Celis, 77, and his wife, Margaret, 74, will change
health plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel betrayed. We thought we'd be with them a few years, and
in six months, they'll be gone,'' said Celis, who a year ago
invited a PacifiCare representative into his home to meet with
friends and neighbors who had been abandoned by Intergroup of
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Both diabetics, the Celises rely on the HMOs' $7 and $15
prescription co-pays, for a total monthly tab of $60 to $75. Under
traditional Medicare, which doesn't include a prescription benefit,
they expect to pay as much as $275 a month, or about $3,300
annually, for insulin, sugar testing strips, syringes and other
medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to cut into our savings,'' Edmund Celis said. He'll
spend the next six months considering a move to the Phoenix area
next year to keep his HMO benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona ranks 3rd
</P>
<P>
   Arizona ranks third behind No. 1 California and No. 2 Oregon for
the percentage of seniors belonging to managed care plans,
according to the U.S. Health Care Financing Administration.
</P>
<P>
   At the peak of the growth period for Arizona HMOs in the late
1990s, nearly 40 percent of the state's 660,919 seniors were
enrolled in health plans serving 13 rural counties.
</P>
<P>
   Today, seniors in four of those counties-Cochise, Gila, Pinal
and Santa Cruz-are served by HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the rural health care market, a number of the critical
components that we look for - the availability of doctors,
specialists, full-service hospitals and future customers - don't
exist,'' said Dr. Ace M. Hodgin Jr., chief executive officer of
PacifiCare of Arizona., which now covers about 95,100 seniors in
three counties. PacifiCare spends $1.10 for every $1 it is paid to
cover medical costs for seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't allow our company to spend more (in rural counties)
than we make,'' Hodgin added.
</P>
<P>
   A September 1999 study by the health care watchdog group
Families USA found that 68 percent of 103,236 rural Arizonans had
access to only one HMO and 32 percent had access to two or more
HMOs. Next year, those numbers will change dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   The mass exodus from Medicare in Arizona and other states comes
as Congress bandies about the political hot potato of rising
prescription drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has called a House proposal, which
would subsidize health insurers that offered prescription drugs to
seniors, a giveaway to drug companies that wouldn't help Medicare
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats want the federal government to help pay drug benefit
premiums for all Medicare recipients. Republicans say only the poor
should get financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
   `Look what it's done'
</P>
<P>
   Still, Republicans would have a tough time convincing rural
Arizonans that HMOs should be the ones responsible for ensuring
seniors get their drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put our faith in HMOs to help our seniors. Look what it's
done for us in Arizona. The system obviously has failed us,'' said
Democratic Rep. Ed Pastor of Phoenix, who suggested lawmakers
consider revisiting the idea of universal health care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton plan would spend $79billion over five years to pay
for 50 percent of seniors' drug costs and cover the full cost once
the annual drug bill exceeded $4,000. It also would provide
financial incentives to entice employers to keep offering retiree
drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. Jim Kolbe of Tucson thinks some HMOs can be
lured back to rural areas if Gov. Jane Hull asks the U.S. Health
Care Financing Administration, which oversees Medicare, to provide
a uniform payment rate for all Arizona counties, eliminating the
disparity between urban and rural counties.
</P>
<P>
   But some HMOs take issue with Kolbe's suggestion because payment
rates in most rural Arizona counties already are the same, and in
some instances higher, than in the metropolitan Maricopa and Pima
counties.
</P>
<P>
   Health plans warn that such a move may inadvertently reduce
payments in urban counties, forcing an all-out exit by HMOs from
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Given that bipartisan support is improbable, lawmakers say an
agreement on a drug benefit for Medicare is unlikely this year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, when a new federal law allowed HMOs to compete for
Medicare business, HMOs saw Medicare as the next frontier for
expanded business opportunities and increased profits. At the time,
government payments for Medicare were extraordinarily high and
didn't take into account the methods HMOs use to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, health plans such as PacifiCare would like to get higher
payments for Medicare that are in line with the 5 to 7 percent
annual cost increases HMOs say they incur.
</P>
<P>
   During the five years before the 1997 law, Medicare raised
annual payments to HMOs by about 8 percent on average.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawals have many rural Arizonans ready to show
lawmakers the way on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were given the authority, I would tell the HMOs they
won't be able to pick and choose which customers they want,'' said
Harold Goodner of Florence, in Pinal County. He is an Intergroup
member who will lose his HMO coverage on Jan. 1. ``They would be
required to cover everybody or get out of our state.''

</P>
<P>
   but is still No. 1 with fans
</P>
<P>
   WNBAWNBA is No. 1 &QC;
</P>
<P>
   - with its fans &QC;
</P>
<P>
   League trails &QL;
</P>
<P>
   men's sports, &QL;
</P>
<P>
   but blazes as &QL;
</P>
<P>
   cultural force &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Someday, WNBA President Val Ackerman wants her women's summer
basketball league to be uttered in the same breath with the ``four
majors'' - men's professional football, hockey, baseball and
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   By the measures of TV deals and sponsorship packages, as well as
player salaries and fan support, the 4-year-old summer league
doesn't come close to the elite ranks of men's professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   But Ackerman insists nobody expected it to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our growth will be incremental,'' she said. ``It's
step-by-step, fan-by-fan, ratings point-by-ratings point, and it
will take a period of years to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even still, as the league readies for its biggest event of the
year, the 2000 WNBA All-Star Game, to be played at America West
Arena on Monday night, there are subtle signs the WNBA is making
its mark in the cluttered iconography of American sports.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for a moment, a 13-year-old boy named Daniel Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   He shows up at Mercury home games wearing a red T-shirt bearing
center Maria Stepanova's name and number.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Thompson why he admires Stepanova, who looks like the WNBA's
answer to tennis cover girl Anna Kournakova, and his politically
correct answer could not have been scripted better by the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like how she plays,'' said the teenager from Amarillo,
Texas, who spends summers in the Valley with relatives. ``She plays
hard and to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   NBA backing a big help
</P>
<P>
   Bankrolled by the NBA, the WNBA was created in 1997 to change
how basketball is experienced - and by whom. In effect, it gave the
NBA a chance to expand its already formidable brand franchise to
millions more T-shirt-buying, TV-viewing, ticket-buying fans who
just happen to be women and children.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened along the way.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA evolved into a cultural phenomenon that's loved by
devotees, who appreciate how hard the women play, and loathed by
critics, mostly men, who call anything less than above-the-rim, Top
Gun-style basketball a big, fat joke.
</P>
<P>
   In the WNBA, the emphasis is on basketball fundamentals -
shooting, passing and ball handling. So far, no player has ever
dunked in a WNBA game, which gives women, especially, a style of
play they can relate to.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look at our games and see it's a predominantly female
audience, which is very different from traditional sports,'' said
Seth Sulka, the Mercury's vice president of operations.
</P>
<P>
   Likely here to stay
</P>
<P>
   And so, unintentionally it seems, the WNBA represents a new
skirmish on the gender-equity battlefront.
</P>
<P>
   As such, if the NBA ever decided to kill its women's league,
regardless of how much scratch it lost, it would be, as one sports
industry consultant put it, ``political suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, NBA Commissioner David Stern describes the NBA's
support for its money-losing women's league in gentler terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WNBA helps keep organized professional basketball in the
minds of fans and would-be fans and new fans 12 months a year,'' he
said. ``That's an extraordinary opportunity for us.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, Stern is right.
</P>
<P>
   Look around the stands at a Mercury game, or in any venue where
the league's 15 other teams play, and you see how the WNBA has made
its mark with its target audiences.
</P>
<P>
   There's the family-filled conga line snaking across the
hardwoods during fourth quarters.
</P>
<P>
   There's a dad and two daughters, the girls decked out in
mini-Mercury uniforms, cozy in their season-ticket seats behind the
basket.
</P>
<P>
   There's the women, everywhere, in pairs, in groups - even garbed
in nun drag, ala the habit-wearing Mercury fans known as the
Sisters of No Mercy.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball purists gripe that the atmosphere at WNBA games is
more like a carnival than a serious athletic competition. And it's
true the NBA does not embrace such WNBA antics as hip-hop dances
and free-throw contests during critical time-outs.
</P>
<P>
   Not the same game
</P>
<P>
   But then again, the NBA doesn't attract many young families, who
are lured to WNBA games by ticket prices that start in the same
range as movie tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Niche-wise, the WNBA positions itself as a ``family-friendly''
experience, which, in the case of the Seattle Storm, one of four
expansion teams this year, meant acknowledging the team's large
lesbian following with a gay pride night two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the notion of gender equality in sports appeals to
women, straight and gay, who are starved for women's professional
athletics.
</P>
<P>
   But lesbian fans have long complained the league downplays their
strong support of the WNBA product, while the league says it leaves
it up to each team to figure out their own promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of who loves the WNBA, the emotional connection that
fans have with teams and players is unique in professional sports,
Mercury center Jennifer Gillom said.
</P>
<P>
   Players, fans are closer
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different than in the NBA,'' she said. ``Fans get
attached to the players because we're out in the community so much.
We have to be in order to get ourselves promoted.''
</P>
<P>
   Witness, for example, the outpouring for Mercury forward Brandy
Reed.
</P>
<P>
   The slight she received from Western Conference coaches, who
overlooked her stellar performance this season when selecting the
reserves for Monday's All Star game, sent fans into a rage that
prompted the league to add Reed to the roster at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   It's this kind of visceral connection that gives the NBA an
opportunity to extend its brand name, even in the face of a
16percent drop in average WNBA game attendance, to 8,545 a game,
compared with last season.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the WNBA brings long-term value to the NBA, which is
why NBA owners are willing to subsidize it, Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA, which has placed a moratorium on expansion, claims
empty pockets, and Ackerman said she can't project when the league
will begin to show a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Teams keep the gate receipts, meaning the league must generate
revenues in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   Despite league TV deals with three networks (NBC, ESPN and
Lifetime) and sponsorship support by 14 blue-chip brands, the WNBA
says operating expenses exceed marketing revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: Unlike established sports leagues, the networks
don't pay the WNBA a broadcast rights fee. On the contrary, the
WNBA shells out a portion of its overall sponsorship revenues to
the networks and, in addition, reimburses them for production
costs.
</P>
<P>
   As for sponsors, the league pays the costs of courtside signage,
player appearances and scorecard ads that come as part of marketing
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in the regular costs of league events (such as the
All-Star Game), referee fees, and domestic and global trademark
registrations, and the well goes dry, Ackerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Players tired of excuses
</P>
<P>
   So far, WNBA players have accepted this explanation as the price
of building a viable women's league. They settled for a collective
bargaining agreement that this year pays rookies $26,500 and top
players $80,000 for a 32-game season. In total, the WNBA says
player salaries will cost the league $11million this season, more
than triple what it spent the first year.
</P>
<P>
   But there are signs that the players feel the league is building
itself up at their expense. And they are growing impatient for
better deals.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Jennifer Azzi, a former Olympian and one of
the WNBA's marquee players, announced she would leave the league
rather than play for $44,000. Azzi was lured back only after the
league agreed to pay her $62,500.
</P>
<P>
   Two other veterans, Andrea Congreaves and Cindy Brown, walked
away, citing low pay as one consideration. At the same time, a
handful of European players opted to stay home and prepare for the
Olympics because the WNBA didn't make it worth their while to cross
the pond and play.
</P>
<P>
   Agents predict it could become an exodus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year, the league will see that players have had it,''
said Bruce Levy, who represents 26 WNBA players, including the
Mercury's Bridget Pettis and Amanda Wilson. ``They'll see they
won't be content to be forced to go overseas, or take coaching jobs
or work at McDonald's just to make a living wage.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say labor issues could be the stumbling block
for the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``As leagues emerge, you see players become emboldened,'' said
David M. Carter, a Los Angeles sports business consultant. ``They
get their bearings and become much more formidable. All of a
sudden, it gets adversarial.''
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Wheeler, operations director for the Women's National
Basketball Players Association, said the union, which is not privy
to league financial information, has reason to believe the WNBA is
an ``excellent position'' based on the number of its national
sponsors and TV partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opens the landscape for sharing that success with the
players,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Success still awaited
</P>
<P>
   But proclamations of success are premature, according to
Ackerman, who is bullish about the league's prospects but careful
not to claim the WNBA is a sure bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NBA has been very patient with us because the sense going
in was the league would be an investment to create something out of
nothing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   National TV broadcasts and intensive marketing are expensive,
but necessary, drains, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women's basketball has never had that strategic emphasis
before, but the sense is there is a business (in) women's ball and,
long term, our revenue streams will develop.''
</P>
<P>
   If it happens, it will be the first time in 15 attempts. Since
1972, at least that many women's professional sports leagues have
tried and failed to carve a niche for themselves. Meanwhile, the
WNBA's perceived staying power helped set the stage for the Women's
United Soccer Association, which is scheduled to launch next spring
with teams in eight cities.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Cavalli, a co-founder of the ABL, a women's professional
basketball league that lasted 21/2 seasons before filing for
bankruptcy in late 1998, believes that if any women's league can
make it, it's the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a better product and concept,'' said Cavalli, a public
relations consultant in Portolo Valley, Calif., who saw many of the
ABL stars take significant pay cuts when they were absorbed by the
WNBA. ``But we didn't have a big brother with the leverage of the
NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the NBA's muscle can't do much about the WNBA's
ultimate challenge: overcoming a strong cultural bias against
women's athletics so that finally, women's professional sports
become a fact of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have girls that (have come to games) for 30 years and
supported it and now they're passing it on to their daughters or
granddaughters or little boys,'' said Nancy Lieberman-Cline, coach
and general manager of the Detroit Shock ``Time is our greatest
ally here.''
</P>
<P>
   And for now, it seems, time is on the WNBA's side.

   CONVENTION _ LOS ANGELES _ When 4,300 party delegates begin
arriving here in about two weeks for the Democratic National
Convention, they'll book their meetings with each other online with
an Internet scheduling program. From the floor of the Democratic
National Convention, they'll be able to talk the their colleagues
on the other side of the massive Staples Center with Internet
phones or by email at kiosks throughout the building. Back home,
folks can submit party platform ideas by email, and watch every
second of the convention with Web cameras connected to the party's
extensive Internet site. Democrats are touting their Aug. 14-17
convention as the most technologically advanced ever, and _ like
the Republicans _ are relying on the Internet like never before to
get their message out. ``It's really all about providing better
access for the American people,'' said convention CEO Lydia
Camarillo. But it's also about reaching out to a new breed of
potential voters that parties can't reach through CSPAN or CNN -
and closely controlling the message they get. (Keefe, Cox News

 &HT;    Politics goes hi-tech By Bob Keefe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the Democratic party's 4,368 delegates arrive
here for their annual convention beginning Aug. 14, they'll plan
meetings with each other online using an Internet scheduling
system.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Staples Center, where the convention will be held,
they'll chat by Internet phones and by e-mail from computer kiosks
throughout the building.
</P>
<P>
   And back home, folks can keep in touch with them and watch every
second of the gathering live with Web cameras linked to the
convention's extensive Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to politics, Y2K style.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to show that they're in tune with today's dot-com world _
and along the way possibly reach potential voters who typically get
their information online instead of CNN _ organizers of this year's
political conventions are touting and tapping into technology like
never before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be the most technologically advanced,
Internet-savvy political gathering in history,'' said Terry
McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Convention
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country in Philadelphia, organizers of the Republican
National Convention are no neophytes either.
</P>
<P>
   When the Republican convention starts July 31, staffers will
send regular e-mail updates to ``Dot- Com Delegates'' who register
with the GOP Web site. Visitors to the site can also take virtual
tours of the convention or order coffee cups and T-shirts
emblazoned with the convention's logos.
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from the first political conventions in the
1830s, when a few hundred delegates gathered in smoky saloons in
Baltimore and Harrisburg, Pa., to draft party platforms and elect
nominees who sometimes didn't even attend.
</P>
<P>
   Today's party organizers say they're using technology _
specifically the Internet _ to reach more people, to get more
opinions and increase involvement in the political process.
</P>
<P>
   But it's about much more than that.
</P>
<P>
   With television networks devoting less time to covering
conventions, party organizers are turning to the Internet to get
their message out 24-hours a day, seven days a week. And _ perhaps
most importantly to them _ they can do it without any media
scrutiny or public comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an outreach possibility much, much better than they've
ever had,'' said Michael Margolis, a professor of political science
at the University of Cincinnati who co-authored the book ``Politics
as Usual: The Cyberspace 'Revolution' '' earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they're all interactive and everything _ but most
people don't realize that anything they see and any of the choices
they make (on a Web site) can be controlled by the Webmaster
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another reason why the political conventions are so
into technology: Because so is much of the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to show that you're dot-com literate,'' Margolis
said. ``You want to show the world that you know this is where
you're supposed to be _ or else it would look like you're out of
step or out of touch.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Staples Center in Los Angeles, Democrats are leaving no
doubt that they know technology.
</P>
<P>
   After chatting with each other on Internet phones and by e-mail,
delegates will cast their votes at interactive kiosks throughout
the convention floor. While doing so, they can watch video feeds on
computers featuring behind-the-podium interviews or the latest
analysis by C-SPAN. Election.com, the private company that managed
the Arizona Democratic presidential primary earlier this year _ the
first legally binding political election held over the Internet _
will tally the votes. Results will be sent to the Democratic
convention's Web site and around the world immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Naz Nageer is the computer whiz who is in charge of making sure
it all goes smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old Nageer, who formally was director of technology
at US Web in Los Angeles and before that worked as a computer
programmer at Time Warner Inc., is the convention's director of
technology.
</P>
<P>
   For the past several months, he has overseen redesign of the
group's Web site (dumping the red-white-and-blue _ ``too stale,''
he said) rounded up the equipment and supervised wiring of
everything to the Staples Center to make sure it all works.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got quite a bit of fiber (optic line) in there, and
we're using just about all of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Nageer has been busy preparing the technology, other
Democratic Convention officials have been busy getting the word
out. Advertisements and other paraphernalia urge Web surfers to
``Participate in America's Democratic eConvention.'' Tuesday, the
group is planning what it claims is the first-ever Internet press
conference for a political convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really all about access,'' said convention Chief
Executive Lydia Camarillo. ``Technology is one of the key ways of
reaching people today.''
</P>
<P>
   But will the Internet and other technology really prompt more
people to get involved with politics and vote?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not, says Margolis, the political science professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are ordinary people who aren't interested in politics in
the real world, who aren't interested in watching this on
television _ why are they suddenly now going to go the Democrats or
the Republican's Web sites and start getting involved?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remain skeptical.''

 &HT;    Comedy camp leaves 'em rolling in the aisles
 &HT;    By Keith Still
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Who says camp can't be a hoot? For 20 metro kids,
summer camp turned out to be a laugh riot as they honed their
comedic skills at Kennesaw State University's Comedy Camp.
</P>
<P>
   The two-week camp, which ended Friday, was a joint effort
between the school's continuing education program and the Alliance
Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   The third- through eighth-graders split their time between two
teachers from the Alliance Theatre: artists Josh Ruben and Koko
Chalfant.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben focused on comedy acting. He used scripts from sitcoms,
commercials and even Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   Chalfant taught the kids to perform improvisational comedy
similar to that in the TV program ``Whose Line Is It Anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   Improv is when actors don't have a script. Instead, they make up
a scene as they go along.
</P>
<P>
   Besides teaching kids how and why comedy works, Ruben and
Chalfant introduced them to the basics of acting.
</P>
<P>
   They also taught them to combine humor with slapstick, physical
comedy, stage fighting and improv to be funny in ``an appropriate
way,'' Ruben said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may laugh at bathroom humor,'' he said. ``But you want
to make everybody laugh in an entertaining way without getting into
trouble _ things where Mom and Dad would not be embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   On the final day, the campers had a chance to shine for their
folks by performing several short comic scenes and a mini version
of ``Whose Line Is It Anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   Think you're funny? Here are some hints from Ruben to help pep
up your stage-fighting performance.
</P>
<P>
   (Remember this is fake fighting. Do not hurt your friends while
practicing. This stuff is meant to be funny!)
</P>
<P>
   1. Choose a fighting technique for your act, then learn to
perform it safely. The photo at left shows the classic hair-pulling
technique.
</P>
<P>
   2. Practice the move until you're comfortable with it.
</P>
<P>
   3. Act out your fight in a heightened way, adding funny facial
expressions or exaggerated movements. These help make the routine
funny instead of violent. Check out instructor Ruben's facial
expression in the photo. He exaggerates his reaction to Nick
Revard's pulling his hair _ and it makes you laugh.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Peace talks between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat took an interesting turn last
week _ the two leaders met alone.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat arrived Tuesday at Camp David, the president's
private retreat in Maryland. They hope to overcome differences that
have prevented peace in their region. Normally, President Clinton
or Secretary of State Madeleine Albright have attended these
meetings to help negotiate sticky issues, such as creating borders
for a future independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, the two leaders met without a U.S. negotiator.
The meeting is being taken as a sign that the men are serious about
coming to a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIAL KIDS LOOKING GOOD
</P>
<P>
   Millennial kids appear to be doing better than children who came
before them, according to a government report. Millennial kids are
defined as those born since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The report says the number of children who live in poverty and
the number who die young have fallen to their lowest levels in 20
years. Teenage pregnancy and juvenile violence also reached their
lowest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Even though rates dropped overall, poor and minority children
were more likely to die young, become pregnant as teenagers and be
involved in violence.
</P>
<P>
   The annual report is compiled by the Federal Interagency Forum
on Child and Family Statistics. Millennials are the largest
generation of children in American history with more than 70
million kids.
</P>
<P>
   BOBBY COX SUSPENDED
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox may have to watch his team play
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on television from home tonight. Cox was
handed a five-game suspension last week after he bumped umpire
Derryl Cousins on July 4 in a second-inning dispute. The manager
argued with Cousins when the umpire gave catcher Fernando Lunar a
warning for not lining up in the catcher's box. During the
argument, Cox seemed to nudge Cousins' elbow. Cox planned to appeal
the suspension.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Researchers at the University of Texas and
Stanford University have taken a first step toward unraveling one
of great mysteries of the universe: how the human brain works.
</P>
<P>
   The team is studying how the brain responds to what the eyes see
and has discovered a relationship that has confounded
neuroscientists. The team, studying monkeys and humans, found that
the amount of blood oxygen in brain cells, or neurons, corresponds
exactly with how active the brain is. As visual images register in
the brain, the blood-oxygen level rises, just as the neural
activity increases.
</P>
<P>
   Making that connection is significant, said UT psychology
professors Wilson Geisler and Duane Albrecht, because it sheds
light on the inner workings of the brain. Understanding how the
brain functions, ultimately, will help doctors diagnose and treat
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the neural activity in the brain that does all the
seeing, hearing, thinking and remembering that humans can do,''
said Geisler, director of UT's Center for Vision &AMP; Image Sciences.
``So, if we want to understand disorders that affect our ability to
see, hear, think and remember, we need to be able to measure the
neural activity that underlies these abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Such measurements also could show whether a particular drug
therapy is effective.
</P>
<P>
   The work of Geisler, Albrecht and Stanford researchers David
Heeger and Alex Huk appears in this month's issue of the British
journal Nature Neuroscience. The four present their own findings
and comment on similar work being done at the California Institute
of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gregg Bennett Wells, a physician and neuropathologist at the
Texas A&AMP;M University System Hea ``It gives us a window on diseases
that are uniquely human,'' Wells said, citing learning disorders,
addictions and Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Brain research is exploding as the tools for studying it grow
more sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   With imaging equipment that has been developed in the last 10
years, researchers can measure oxygen levels in the blood that
nourishes the human brain. The measurements are done with a special
kind of magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, machine called a
functional MRI. While a regular MRI scans a part of the body, such
as the brain, and presents a cross-section of the body part, a
functional MRI shows the oxygen concentration in groups of body
cells.
</P>
<P>
   It cannot, however, measure nerve impulses in human brains.
That's why monkeys are used, Albrecht and Geisler said.
</P>
<P>
   The UT/Stanford team thinks the monkeys they are using _
macaques, or rhesus monkeys commonly found in Asia and Africa _ are
visually wired almost identically to humans.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers make an incision and insert an electrode into
the back of the monkey's head so that neuron measurements can be
taken. The monkey does not feel pain and generally is euthanized
within a few days, said Albrecht, director of the Visual
Neuroscience Lab at UT.
</P>
<P>
   The macaques and humans are shown televised images of patterns
that vary in contrast from very low, or faint, to very high, or
bold. The bolder the pattern, the more neurons that fire in the
brain. Geisler and Albrecht said they were astounded to learn that
the neural responses in monkeys and the functional MRI results were
identical. That was the discovery that made them say, ``Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   But such research is not without controversy. Neuroscientists
don't always agree on how their peers interpret functional MRIs.
Some groups object to using animals, and there is no agreement on
comparing humans and animals.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to misinterpret functional MRI results, Geisler
and Albrecht acknowledged. But the comparison is powerful, they
said, because the macaque is more than 99 percent similar to a
human.
</P>
<P>
   ``This validates a lot of the work that's been going on for the
last 10 years,'' Geisler said.
</P>
<P>
   Wells said he expects the work to encourage more research using
functional MRIs.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect all of the mysteries of the human brain to be
uncovered anytime soon, Geisler and Albrecht said.
</P>
<P>
   The brain is so complicated that what is known is dwarfed by
what remains to be discovered, they said. ``Astronomy is better
understood than the brain,'' Geisler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been studying this for three decades,'' Albrecht added,
``and it's very humbling. . . . I'll be doing this all my life.''

 &HT;    Lifestages Boutique specializes in women's well-being
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ At first glance it looks like a lovely women's
boutique. And it is.
</P>
<P>
   But take a closer look at the items on display and you realize
there's more to each one than meets the eye. All the products are
designed to help women as they move through the stages of their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Lifestages Boutique for Women at Samaritan North Health
Center represents a partnership between Good Samaritan Hospital and
Davue Ob-Gyn. According to Chris Hurak, chief operating officer for
Lifestages, the shop represents a trend _ similar facilities are
cropping up all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural offshoot of our medical and nursing care
education-awareness focus,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   Retail manager Kay Earnhart says the inventory must make clients
``feel good and look good and help them with medical health-care
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   That inventory includes everything from nursing pillows and
support hose to beaded bags and jewelry. There are glass flowers
and music boxes, magnifying mirrors and wigs for chemotherapy or
alopecia patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of a professional woman who doesn't feel very good and
maybe she's had radiation or chemo,'' says Earnhart. ``She's still
going to work and wants to look the best she can.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressing rooms are designed for complete privacy for women being
fitted for a prosthesis, postmastectomy bra, nursing bra or a wig.
</P>
<P>
   Other products:
</P>
<P>
   _ Nursing tops from Prego allow moms to nurse without being
exposed. The baby can be tucked inside a flap that reaches from the
shoulder to below the breast and eliminates the need for a diaper
or blanket ($44).
</P>
<P>
   _ The Pregnancy Survival Kit includes a basic black stretch knit
wardrobe for moms-to-be: a dress, skirt, long-sleeved top and
slacks, all for $177. The shop also stocks maternity dresses,
jumpers and casual wear from Prego, Olian and Rebel ($20-$150).
</P>
<P>
   _ Former cancer patient Maureen Langeman makes sparkly hats and
donates a portion of her earnings to the American Cancer Society
($45). The shop also stocks turbans, and there's a nonmetallic
deodorant for chemotherapy patients.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reading glasses range from rhinestone-studded to hand-painted
(from $8-$22).
</P>
<P>
   _ You can express on the expressway with the shop's breast pump.
It plugs into a cigarette lighter in your car but we're not
advising you to do two things at once!
</P>
<P>
   _ What the display of pretty purses have in common is that they
are all easy-care and lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``This is the big thing right now!'' says Earnhart, showing
off the Prenatal Cradle, a device that supports the baby and takes
pressure off the mother's back ($49.95).
</P>
<P>
   _ The shop also stocks rubber gloves that make it much easier to
put on compression hose ($5.75).
</P>
<P>
   Earnhart says she and her staff are eager to please and will be
happy to gift wrap or mail packages. Gift baskets from $25 also can
be put together.
</P>
<P>
   Scented candles, small fountains, relaxation tapes and pretty
journals are also on display, and the shop stocks the Camille
Beckman line of bath products.
</P>
<P>
   Says Earnhart: ``We want to encourage women to take time for
themselves.''
</P>

   PERU-INNOCENTS (Lima) _ Peruvians call the more than one
thousand people, mostly poor, who were unfairly imprisoned on
charges of terrorism or treason between 1992 and 1995 by special
antiterrorism courts, ``the innocents.'' Most have been pardoned or
absolved of any wrongdoing over the last three years; but their
lives and the lives of their families have been irreparably
tattered. Such injustice was the product of the chaos that gripped
Peru in the early 1990s, when the Shining Path, a brutal terrorist

WEB SITE FOR CARGO RATES LAYS CLAIM TO A BUSINESS METHOD 
</HEADLINE>
   By SABRA CHARTRAND  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The patenting of methods used in e-business has sparked anger
and outrage in the world of Internet commerce, especially in the
case of several high-profile companies that have received broad
patents for widely used retail techniques. The dispute over
Amazon.com's patent for its one-click shopping technology is an
example.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the heat, the Patent and Trademark Office has made clear
that it intends to continue issuing patents on digital business
practices, and entrepreneurs, therefore, will likely continue to
stake out as much as they can of the new markets created as nearly
every industry moves online. Inevitably, the debate over whether
these patents foster innovation, or whether they stifle
competition, will continue.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction could go either way for a patent awarded last month
to two childhood friends: ``Method for Online Display and
Negotiation of Cargo Rates.'' The patent covers a method of pooling
the prices that various freight carriers charge for land, sea and
air cargo shipments, posting them on a central Web site, and
allowing customers to browse and comparison-shop for their shipping
needs.
</P>
<P>
   The patent also allows shippers and customers to negotiate rates
and routes, and to hold interactive auctions to set shipping rates.
The inventors say they won a patent because no one else in cargo
transportation had created a hub to consolidate shipping
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just came out, and I don't know who has seen the news or
is privy to it,'' Daniel Miller, one of the inventors and a lawyer
in Mahopac, N.Y., said of the patent issued in May. ``But we
haven't heard any objections to it from shippers, carriers or
competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, shippers ranging from corporations like
Pepsi-Cola International to an independently-owned antique store
had to contact individual freight carriers to get price quotes.
That usually meant lots of phone calls, faxes and e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Web site, www.cargosphere.com, was launched last
February, the inventors say 500 customers and shippers have
registered.
</P>
<P>
   With hundreds of thousands of trucking, rail, air and ocean
shipping companies in the United States, and millions of potential
customers, the number registered so far is small. Miller said he
and his fellow inventor Neil Barni are promoting their patented
business model and Web site at trade shows, through trade
publications and with individual cargo companies and freight
associations in an effort to add shippers and cargo brokers to
their registry.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the service is free, but by fall the inventors plan to
charge both buyers and sellers a $5 fee for any shipment smaller
than a freight container, or $10 for one or more containers.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the patent started with Barni, who lives in Dallas
and has been friends with Miller since elementary school. Until
recently, Barni worked for Pepsi, where he handled shipping and
often spent a great deal of time on the phone, seeking competitive
cargo prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neil saw a real need for a way to get the best rates,'' said
Miller. ``That was the genesis of the idea. I said it would be nice
if people could negotiate online. We moved pretty quickly to get a
patent application filed because we thought this was a very
innovative, unique idea and there was nothing like it in the cargo
transportation industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The patent, and the Web site, allow customers to anonymously
review posted shipping routes and prices. Customers can negotiate
with shippers, but a carrier's name is revealed only after a price
offer is accepted.
</P>
<P>
   The process is not binding. If either the customer or the
shipper decides they don't want to do business with one another,
they can back out of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason for anonymity is that carriers are very
sensitive about having their rates published,'' Miller said. That
is because prices can change frequently, he said, sometimes even
fluctuating between morning and evening.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals can use the site as well, Miller said. The only
caveat is that the service does not cover the shipping of small
packages. ``We are open to anyone above parcel service,'' Miller
said. ``We can't get into that and don't want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he expected no objections to the patent from the
cargo industry or from large, established shipping companies that
already have their own Web sites. ``If we can help them get rid of
excess capacity or help customers find the best rates for shippers,
then everyone stands to gain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in announcing the patent, CargoSphere.com also stated that
the invention made it ``a front-runner in the competitive area of
Internet shipping platforms,'' and the company's patent attorney
said, ``The patent affords the company the right to exclude or to
license others in that industry with respect to the patented
business model.''
</P>
<P>
   But restricting the patent's umbrella to cargo shipping alone
may not give CargoSphere that exclusivity _ even if it is the first
in its industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they put in the claims that it is limited to
cargo or freight doesn't mean that it can't be challenged by
something broader that was out there before it,'' explained Robert
Perry, a patent attorney with Kenyon &AMP; Kenyon in New York City who
has found himself dealing increasingly with business method
patents.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that Internet business method patents have yet to
be tested in court. Uncertainty over their impact, he said,
prompted Congress to add a new layer of protection to patent law
last year for people who might be accused of infringing a business
method patent. Under the new law, someone who can prove they used
an electronic business method for a year before a patent
application was filed cannot be sued, even if they did not make
public their practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``What will shake down when the courts come into it in five or
six years is that there are a lot of people doing business in-house
that is not the subject of patents, but will certainly be valid
prior art,'' Perry explained, using the term for existing designs
or practices. ``It will require a lot of digging, but that is how
these business method patents will be challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Miller and Neil Barni received patent 6,064,981.
</P>
<P>

 By ROXANA ROBINSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One afternoon I was driving along the narrow dirt road on which
I live. Ahead of me was a small red car with two people in the
front seat. You can't go very fast on a dirt road, so we were
poking along. As we did, I began to watch the car in front of me.
The driver was a middle-aged man wearing glasses, and beside him
sat a woman with long, wavy blond hair.
</P>
<P>
   I could see the man's face because he kept turning and talking
to the woman, but I couldn't see her face because she never turned
to look at him or answer.
</P>
<P>
   As we drove along, the man turned again and again, talking to
the woman. He had thinning hair and a kindly face. Everything about
him, his gestures, the way he spoke, seemed friendly and
affectionate: He leaned toward her, he smiled. But she sat without
movement or response, staring straight ahead. She never once looked
in his direction, and I wondered why.
</P>
<P>
   I supposed of course that they were fighting. The long blond
hair suggested someone who was beautiful, or anyway someone who
invited admiration and was used to it. I thought she might be
arrogant and imperious, coldhearted, the way a beautiful woman,
spoiled by her beauty, can be. I thought that the man might be her
husband, or her lover, and that he was pleading with her. I thought
she was turning cold to him; perhaps she was ending things
completely, and he was trying to win her back. I felt sorry for the
man, who was trying so hard to reach her, to save things.
</P>
<P>
   We both slowed down to cross a little stone bridge, and once
past it, on the straight, he turned again to her. I wondered then
if I'd gotten it wrong. The man was definitely middle-aged, and the
woman's long, thick blond hair suggested youth. Perhaps the man was
not her husband but her father.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he was pleading with her about something else: maybe
about her behavior toward her mother, for example, or her grades or
her attitude in school. Maybe she was sitting sullenly still, not
heartlessly. Or maybe it was something else: maybe she was not
stony-faced and implacable or sullen, but miserable. Maybe she was
weeping and unable to look at her father. Perhaps he was trying to
comfort her for a young man's cruelty or some other terrible
teen-age disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   I watched them closely, trying to decipher the story. The man
turned to her, smiling, tilting his head coaxingly. She still did
not look at him. I felt sympathy for the man, making such a tender
and dedicated effort; and sympathy for the woman, locked in such a
paralyzed and miserable state.
</P>
<P>
   We reached the stop sign at the end of Mount Holly Road, and the
man turned once more to the blond woman. This time, at last, she
turned toward him. She leaned over and licked his nose. She was a
golden retriever.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for this story is to give you some idea of what it's
like to be a writer. How odd an occupation it is, how unpredictable
and how humbling.
</P>
<P>
   I'm often asked when I started writing. But the important
question is not when do writers start, but why.
</P>
<P>
   My own reasons for writing, for setting down the story, are to a
large extent selfish. With each story _ and by story I mean
anything I write _ I am trying simply to work something out for
myself. You, the reader, play no part here: this is a private
matter.
</P>
<P>
   I write about the things that trouble me. I write about the
things that disturb me, the things that won't let me alone, the
things that are eating slowly into my brain at 3 in the morning,
the things that unbalance my world. Sometimes these are things I've
said or done; sometimes they're things I've heard about or seen.
Sometimes they're only sentences, sometimes scenes, sometimes
complete narratives. I carry these things around inside my head
until I'm compelled to write them down to get rid of them. I sit
down and begin.
</P>
<P>
   I know where I'm going: I'm going toward that troubling moment,
the unforgivable statement, the irreversible act that has been
gnawing at me. That's what's coming at the end of the story, and my
task is to write my way to that moment in a way that explains it
completely to me. If I can set down these moments and make them
whole within a context that explains the scene and characters whose
behavior I can forgive, then the moments become comprehensible to
me. When I understand them, they lose their power to disturb. Then
the anxieties subside and let me sleep. I really write to free
myself.
</P>
<P>
   As you can tell from the golden retriever, what I find most
persistently interesting and compelling are stories about families.
The family is at the heart of our emotional lives. It's where the
heat is, the source of our most powerful feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Family connections _ between parent and child, brother and
sister, husband and wife _ form the strongest bonds we will ever
know. These are the people who can make us happier, and angrier,
than anyone else on earth. And these connections are
indestructible: You might reject your family members, you might
refuse to see them ever again, but they will still be your family.
You will always be a part of them, whether you choose to be or not.
The family will always have formed you. That was your childhood, no
matter what you wish.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Your feelings for your family will be powerful ones, even if you
deny them. If you were to decide, at 20, never to speak to your
mother again, and if you didn't see your mother for 40 years, she
would still be your mother. She would still have formed crucial
parts of your sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   When you do see her 40 years later, by accident, as you surely
will, when you catch a glimpse of her at someone's funeral,
standing unevenly on the sloping lawn of the cemetery, grimly
holding her pocketbook in the way you so well remember; or if you
finally steel yourself and deliberately pay her a visit, in that
first moment, as she opens the door and stands motionless in the
doorway, silent, as though she doesn't know you. Then at that
moment all those feelings that made you long ago decide never to
see her again will come boiling up inside you.
</P>
<P>
   You can't escape: those early feelings run at full spate for
your entire lifetime, even if you can't bear to think of them. Even
if you refuse to acknowledge them, they are still there, pulsing
and coursing below the surface, in silence and darkness, like an
underground river. They govern our surface lives more than we
think, and at any moment they may rise up from the darkness into
full view, where they will explode into foam and torrents.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best thing about the family is that all of the
emotions within it depend upon love, which is the most powerful.
All the darker ones _ rage and hatred and resentment _ result from
the absence of love, or its withholding; but love is the prime
mover. And the fact that love is a part of any emotional equation
means that the emotional life is always fluid, always in a state of
flux: 40 years of resentment can be ended, erased completely, if
the love is at last forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Of course if love has been withheld for 40 years, the chances of
its being freely given now are slim. It's just as likely that your
father will turn his face to the wall and die, rather than speak to
you at last. But something transforming might happen. He might
speak. Or you might at last understand why he can't, and forgive
him. You might feel the love you've missed, even if he cannot.
</P>
<P>
   As a subject, the family Is inexhaustible. Tolstoy is mistaken:
All happy families are not alike. In fact no two families are
alike, happy or unhappy. Every family, like every fingerprint, has
its own unique pattern, its own set of conflicts and beliefs and
alliances. They're formed by all sorts of things _ class,
education, language and physical heredity, just for starters; and
growing up within our own family, we assume that our experience and
its behavior is the norm.
</P>
<P>
   We assume that a father always gets up first on Sunday morning
and comes down in his dressing gown to make everyone breakfast. Or
that a mother never takes the animals to the vet because she throws
up at the smell. Or that during fights a mother always retreats
into the bedroom closet and holds the door shut. These things, you
assume, are given, they are fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Larger issues _ America as a democratic institution, whether we
should support capital punishment _ these are in the arena of
public discussion. You know people have a variety of attitudes
toward them. You know how your fiance feels about those things
because you've talked about them. You discover the other, more
important things later. You don't find out about other families'
patterns until you've married into them, and then you find yourself
arguing, indignantly, with utter disbelief about who should cook
breakfast on Sundays, or who should take the dog for his shots, or
whether you should be shouting out these views from inside the
bedroom closet.
</P>
<P>
   All this beauty and fury makes the family a rich literary
source. Much of our greatest fiction comes from conflicts within
it: look at ``Oedipus Rex,'' ``King Lear,'' ``Anna Karenina,''
``The Sound and the Fury,'' ``To the Lighthouse,'' the Rabbit
quartet. These works reveal us to ourselves, and it seems to me
that this is who we are: we're people driven, damaged and tortured;
we're people elated, sustained and nourished, all by the powerful,
devastating, inescapable bonds within the family.
</P>
<P>
   As the golden retriever story reveals, I love all the issues,
large and small, comic and tragic. I love hearing about them, I
love thinking about them, and I even love struggling with the dark
ones, late at night. They are endlessly interesting to me and
endlessly surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking about these endless, intricate, wonderful stories seems
to be the task that's set for me, and I'm grateful for it. The
stories are all around me. All I want is the opportunity to
discover, ponder and absorb them, then to set them down. I want to
get them exactly right. When I think I've succeeded at that, then I
feel I have accomplished something.
</P>
<P>
   And this is where you, the reader, come in. For only you will
know for certain if I have.

   The Washington Post got hold of a persuasive fund-raising letter
for the Clinton Presidential Library in downtown Little Rock, was
 &LR; written by former Sen.  &UR; Dale Bumpers &LR; , D-Ark. The longtime pal of

   ``We shouldn't let our familiarity with  &UR; Bill Clinton &LR;  stop us

   P.S. The Washington Monthly says that  &UR; George W. Bush &LR;  defeated

   &UR; Ellen DeGeneres &LR; , who's about to begin a nationwide tour doing

   ``I needed to express myself again because my sexuality had
overshadowed so much of my life,'' she said. ``I'm not trying to

   Canterbury Cathedral officials have rejected Warner Bros.'
request to shoot some of its Harry Potter movie in the cathedral.
The problem, reports the Daily Mail of London, is that the story
uses pagan  &LR; images of witchcraft and wizardry.

<P>
   ``For ourselves,'' said a spokesman for the Rev.  &UR; John &LR;

   A South Bay reader is wondering about that big Silicon Valley
bash to raise money for education and featuring  &UR; Colin Powell &LR; , at
which the entertainment was provided by a band called was &LR;  the
Cherry Poppin' Daddies. Is the name some kind of message to the
young 'uns?
</P>
<P>
   And a guest at the grand reopening of the Wax Museum is
complaining because the figure of former  &UR; President Bush &LR;  in a
gallery of U.S. presidents is labeled ``George W. Bush.'' Walker is
the former president's middle name, but it's his son who's usually
labeled ``W,'' unless paraffin psychics can see the future.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in response to  &UR; Chelsea Clinton &LR;  having been spotted
smoking at a Washington coffee shop over July Fourth weekend, a
group of young people _ mainly Libertarians, says the Washington
Times _ held a smoke-in in Washington last week. ``We are not
necessarily condoning smoking,'' said one organizer. ``We want to
emphasize that an adult's decisions regarding health and morality
should be left to that person only.''

definitely not a conscious act,'' he said, his words of regret
reported in Us Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturday Night Live'' regular  &UR; Will Ferrell &LR; , on the other

<P>
   ``I was at a  &UR; Versace &LR;  party and ran into a modeling agent who

ashram a week later and did this meditation and hiking thing. While
I was there,  &UR; Steven Spielberg &LR; 's office called my agent and wanted
to know if I act. I was like, `This is a sign from God.' I called
the acting coach and started taking her class. When I did did a
memory exercise, she started crying and told me that I have to use
my instrument, that if I don't do something creative I will hurt
myself or someone else. ... I said, `You're right. You're f_

<P>
   A South Bay reader is wondering about that big Silicon Valley
bash to raise money for education and featuring  &UR; Colin Powell &LR; , at
which the entertainment was provided by a band called was &LR;  the
Cherry Poppin' Daddies. Is the name some kind of message to the
young 'uns?
</P>
<P>
   And a guest at the grand reopening of the Wax Museum is
complaining because the figure of former  &UR; President Bush &LR;  in a
gallery of U.S. presidents is labeled ``George W. Bush.'' Walker is
the former president's middle name, but it's his son who's usually
labeled ``W,'' unless paraffin psychics can see the future.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in response to  &UR; Chelsea Clinton &LR;  having been spotted
smoking at a Washington coffee shop over July Fourth weekend, a
group of young people _ mainly Libertarians, says the Washington
Times _ held a smoke-in in Washington last week. ``We are not
necessarily condoning smoking,'' said one organizer. ``We want to
emphasize that an adult's decisions regarding health and morality
should be left to that person only.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BODILY FUNCTIONS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Prince Ernst  &LR; of Monaco, who is married to  &UR; Princess Caroline &LR; ,
has apologized for urinating publicly in Turkey's pavilion at a
world's fair in Germany. ``Relieving myself during Expo 2000 was
definitely not a conscious act,'' he said, his words of regret
reported in Us Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturday Night Live'' regular  &UR; Will Ferrell &LR; , on the other
hand, told Entertainment Weekly that if he could have one
superpower, he would like ``the power to vomit on people on
command. It would help me get out of tight situations.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at a  &UR; Versace &LR;  party and ran into a modeling agent who
... told me that I should be an actress. ... Then I went to an
ashram a week later and did this meditation and hiking thing. While
I was there,  &UR; Steven Spielberg &LR; 's office called my agent and wanted
to know if I act. I was like, `This is a sign from God.' I called
the acting coach and started taking her class. When I did did a
memory exercise, she started crying and told me that I have to use
my instrument, that if I don't do something creative I will hurt
myself or someone else. ... I said, `You're right. You're f_
right.''

Beneath'' _ on her metamorphosis from supermodel to actress, in

`DRIVING MR. ALBERT': SEARCHING FOR EINSTEIN WITH HIS BRAIN IN
TOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Michael Paterniti happened to mention the urban myth about
Albert Einstein's AWOL brain to his landlord, he was in for a
surprise that would prove useful. Not only had the landlord also
heard stories that Einstein's brain had disappeared after his
death, but the landlord also had a lead on its whereabouts. He
helped point the author toward Dr. Thomas Harvey, the pathologist
who absconded with the brain after he performed a 1955 autopsy on
Einstein in Princeton, N.J. For nearly half a century Harvey had
hung onto this grisly souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   So Paterniti, sensing the makings of the magazine article (for
Harper's) that he has now inflated into book form, made a
pilgrimage to Harvey in Princeton. And when Harvey expressed a
desire to go to Berkeley, Calif., Paterniti offered to take him
there. Along came a high-concept, cutely titled account of a
cross-country road trip involving an eccentric octogenarian
scientist, a pensive young acolyte and a celebrity body part in a
Tupperware container.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that ``simply having Einstein's brain in the trunk
rearranges the way you see everything,'' Paterniti took to the
road. And he began the trip with a handy predilection for finding
whiffs of Einsteinian thinking everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the themes of my earlier life, as I recall it now, is
that I was forever projecting myself forward and backward at the
same time, negating the present moment, changing my mind with
alarming frequency,'' he reports in suitably scientific mode. Thus
equipped, he could find that in a Kansas City vista ``shots of
light glance off the glass windows of skyscrapers, electrons and
quanta firing past us like an invisible hail of bullets.'' Or muse
that ``Pennsylvania is its own kind of in-between, not really east
and not west, the pulse between neurons.''
</P>
<P>
   Because ``Driving Albert'' in fact revolved around a brief,
largely uneventful car trip involving a not very chatty passenger
(``Way-ell, it sure has been a wonderful specimen'' is Harvey at
his most communicative), Paterniti often found himself reaching for
something more. And so he had ample time to recall Einstein's life
and its implications, or to wonder about his girlfriend home in
Maine. Had she hit a moose on the road? Had she run off with the
Federal Express man?
</P>
<P>
   Naturally there was ample time to contemplate the brain itself,
cut into 240-odd fragments, and to endow it with suitably cosmic
implications. After wondering whether it feels like tofu, sea
urchin or bologna, Paterniti reflects, ``I mean, it's not really
Einstein and it's not really a brain, but disconnected pieces of a
brain, just as the passing farms are not really America but parts
of a whole, symbols of the thing itself, which is everything and
nothing at once.'' Everything-and-nothingness serves as the book's
dominant motif.
</P>
<P>
   So Paterniti is ever alert to parallels between Einstein's life
and anyone else's. (Einstein and Harvey each had multiple
marriages; Einstein and a Japanese scientist, whom the author also
visited on a separate jaunt described here, both failed important
exams as students, and both had difficulties with postcollege
employment.) And he likes to imagine what Einstein's thoughts might
have been.
</P>
<P>
   A train goes by in Arizona, prompting the author to write,
``Were this 1931, Einstein might very well have been on that
train,'' and adding, ``Undoubtedly, he would occasionally have
looked up from his equations to see America beyond the window.'' At
another juncture he decides that Einstein would have been horrified
by MTV and Microsoft but amused by tae-bo, Jesse Ventura and penis
augmentations.
</P>
<P>
   Eager for newsworthy encounters Paterniti brings Harvey to visit
William Burroughs, who was the doctor's neighbor in Lawrence, Kan.,
even though the two elderly men had met only once before. And
always alert to the possibility of larger meaning, Paterniti thinks
he glimpses evidence of Burroughs' most notorious exploits in the
famous old author's wrinkles. For his part, Burroughs, the
legendary wild man, downs five Coke-and-vodkas on top of his daily
methadone, smokes a joint and then begins addressing Harvey as
Senegal. This is easily one of the more newsworthy encounters along
the book's otherwise pedestrian journey.
</P>
<P>
   Matters grow desperate. Paterniti is prompted by the offer of
more coffee from a waitress in Lawrence to reflect that she might
have been blown up in the 20-year-old television movie ``The Day
After.'' He and Harvey call Evelyn Einstein, the scientist's
granddaughter, and ask to visit her in Berkeley, to which she
replies: ``I don't know. My house is a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   They stop at carefully chosen places of Einsteinian import, like
Los Alamos, N.M., without prompting more than a ``Way-ell'' or two
out of Harvey. The author dodges a truck bearing the name
``Marianne,'' which is the name of his mother. And he does his
laundry, a process described with typically indiscriminate fervor.
``It feels powerful to drop the dirty stuff of a long week into a
tub of sudsy water,'' he relates, ``and have my pants and shirts
come out clean.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latter stages of the journey, Paterniti takes to
buttonholing strangers for journalistic effect. ``I'm on a trip,''
he says to two tourists in Las Vegas, ``and I was wondering what
you two know about Albert Einstein?'' A blackjack dealer says, ``I
don't know anything about him, but that man over there should be
able to help you.'' The casino manager, asked about Einstein,
curtly answers: ``Haven't seen him in here tonight. Sorry, pal.''
</P>
<P>
   In his search for the real meaning of his experience, which
ultimately includes sleeping with the brain on a pillow in his bed
``just to see,'' Paterniti grasps ambitiously and self-importantly
at every available straw. But the best assessment of his studiously
cerebral journey comes from Independence High School in San Jose,
Calif., where Harvey stops to display his treasure to students
``repulsed and captivated by the man whose fingers are wet with
brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey, ``heady on the perfume of social studies teachers,''
meets one woman who sees what Paterniti works overtime to
aggrandize. ``I'm meeting a footnote here,'' she tells him, and
she's right.

<P>
   STERLING HEIGHTS, Mich. _ As traffic sweeps north on Mound Road,
past the Detroit newspapers' printing plant, the air horns of some
passing semitrailer trucks offer supportive blasts to the cluster
of picketing newspaper workers. Other drivers offer staccato
salutes on their car horns.
</P>
<P>
   But the noise is irregular at best, as most cars and trucks
speed silently by. On its fifth anniversary, the last great
newspaper strike of the 20th century, a ghost with a living
grievance, still haunts Detroit, but the city moves on.
</P>
<P>
   If the strike is a memory, though, its consequences are not.
Since the walkout on July 13, 1995, Detroit's two daily papers have
made do with replacement workers and, eventually, many returning
strikers.
</P>
<P>
   But a union-led boycott has helped erode the daily circulations
of the morning paper, The Detroit Free Press, and the evening
Detroit News, by a third. Between 1995 and 1999, the two newspapers
lost paying customers eight times faster than the industry as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
   The various union chapters, meanwhile, have seen their
memberships dwindle. And on July 7, in a further blow to the
Newspaper Guild of Detroit, a federal appeals panel overturned the
National Labor Relations Board and ruled that the papers' managers
had not engaged in unfair labor practices by adopting a merit-pay
system.
</P>
<P>
   Besides ending expectations that the strikers would receive
millions of dollars in back pay, the ruling stripped the union
loyalists of the judicial support that had seemed to give them the
moral high ground. ``We feel the legal system failed us,'' said
Louis Mleczko, the guild's president.
</P>
<P>
   Given the bitterness, management knows that winning back many
readers will require ending the boycott by settling with the six
striking unions, and by finding ways to manage newsrooms and
mailrooms and printing presses with workers who once cursed each
other across picket lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredibly tragic that the unions and companies couldn't
come to some middle ground,'' said David Crumm, a religion writer
for the Free Press. ``As it is, we've educated a whole generation
of readers that they don't need to read our newspapers. So we all
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Can the mutual antipathy be overcome, allowing the unions to
call off the boycott, before the subscriber erosion is so great
that one newspaper must fold? Will Detroit, like so many other
cities, be left with one major daily? Or will the digital
technology that has streamlined costs _ and helped render the
picket lines impotent _ let the papers find new ways to market
themselves, keeping them healthy?

   The News, owned by the Gannett Co., had daily circulation of
359,000 in 1994, the year the paper won a Pulitzer Prize for
exposing fiscal mismanagement in state government. Now its daily
circulation is about 237,000.
</P>
<P>
   The News' competitor, Knight Ridder's Free Press, ranked ninth
nationally in March 1994, with a daily circulation of 551,000. Six
years later, it sells 361,000 daily copies and ranks 22nd.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if both papers will still exist in five years, Frank J.
Vega, the Gannett executive who is president of the Detroit
Newspaper Agency, which runs the business operations of both
newspapers, confidently predicts they will. ``We need to get
contracts now,'' Vega said. ``We want to get contracts. The unions
want to get contracts. But it's going to be difficult to get it
done. They want to turn the clock back.'' Last week, Vega rescinded
proposals the agency had made in informal bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   His office is filled with strike memorabilia, like the
hate-filled cards he has defiantly framed and a Darth Vader statue,
memorializing the strikers' epithet, ``Darth Vega.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been strikes that were more violent; there have
been strikes that went on longer,'' Vega said. ``But we probably
have a lock on this: This will be the longest, in terms of the time
it's going to take to heal.''
</P>
<P>
   The strike was called in July 1995 a week after management put
in place a merit-pay system over union objections. In the early
days of the strike, both newspapers published under a joint
masthead. A rival paper, The Detroit Journal, was published by the
strikers for four years. By the end of 1995, the News and the Free
Press resumed separate publication, although some advertisers and
many readers shunned them.
</P>
<P>
   The strike lasted formally for 19 months, until the six unions
agreed to return to work. The advertisers, too, have returned. But
no contracts have been signed.
</P>
<P>
   And vivid memories linger: The burning truck. The picketer hit
by a delivery truck. The bruises left from clashes with riot
police. The stalking of replacement delivery workers, the epithets,
the fury, the hatred.
</P>
<P>
   For the strikers, it was a just fight for collective bargaining
and workers' rights. For Vega, it was a just fight against a
bloated payroll and an arrogant union leadership that led more than
2,000 workers into the wilderness for no good reason.
</P>
<P>
   The News and the Free Press are now staffed by replacement
workers and former strikers, with a total of 1,478 full-time jobs _
766 fewer than before the strike. It is a more efficient and more
ethnically diverse work force, Vega said.
</P>
<P>
   All sides agree that Gannett and Knight Ridder, which formed the
Detroit Newspaper Agency under a joint operating agreement in 1989,
together lost more than $100 million in the strike. But the profit
picture improved at the end of 1996. Analysts say the agency's
profits climbed to between $60 million and $70 million in 1999,
surpassing 1994 levels.
</P>
<P>
   The agency took in almost $350 million in advertising revenue
last year, according to the estimates of a Merrill Lynch analyst,
Lauren Rich Fine. That was almost $80 million more than in 1996.
Fine said the strike had not hurt the two companies with investors:
``They did what they had to do. They are happy where they ended
up.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jim St. Louis ended up without his old job as a mailroom
worker. He is now an organizer for the Teamsters' International
Union. Like people on both sides, he clings to memories that seem
to support the justness of his actions, like the visit of Martin
Luther King III in support of the strike.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Different unions had different issues. The Newspaper Guild
objected to the merit-pay plan leaving most annual pay raises to
management's discretion. For the mailers, it was disputes over pay
and the use of subcontractors. For drivers and circulations
workers, job security.
</P>
<P>
   Now union membership is way down. In 1995, Teamsters Local 2040
had 365 full-time workers and 300 part-time workers at the
newspaper agency, according to its president, Al Young. Now he
said, only 165 pay dues and just 68 are back at work.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Newspaper Guild of Detroit had 600 dues-paying
members _ reporters, photographers, copy editors and janitors. Now
there are 235.
</P>
<P>
   Robert G. McGruder, who was the managing editor of the Free
Press at the time of the strike and is now its executive editor,
said he felt vindicated by the panel's ruling. ``But I didn't think
it symbolized a victory or the end of a difficult situation,'' he
said. ``There's a long, long road to go to negotiate fair
contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   And a long road to winning back readers. Yet, even some labor
loyalists, among the first to desert the paper, have begun to
trickle back. Bob Celestini, a retired test driver for Chrysler,
said he had stopped subscribing to the News in late 1995 but
started buying it again last year: ``I threw my hands up. It was a
deadlock.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Silverman, who became publisher of the News in mid-1997,
said that circulation figures did not represent the paper's full
reach. He said a survey in January indicated that the papers may
have a so-called pass-along readership _ people who read papers
purchased by someone else _ 21 percent higher than the official
circulation data. That compares with an 8 percent pass-along
readership before the strike, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin Small, a history professor at Wayne State University, is
part of the pass-along group. He subscribes to The Oakland Press, a
suburban daily. But if he finds the Free Press ``in an airplane
seat, I'll pick it up and read it,'' Small said, although he added,
``my wife won't.''
</P>
<P>
   And a few Democratic politicians like Rep. David E. Bonior,
D-Mich., and some city council members, along with scholars like
Small, some clergymen and union leaders, still will not talk to
reporters from the Free Press or the News.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Giles, the senior vice president of the Freedom Forum who
was the editor and publisher of the News when the strike began, now
finds his candidacy to become curator of Harvard University's
Nieman Foundation under attack by union leaders. His critics
contend that Giles distorted the News' coverage of the strike to
favor management's viewpoint; they recall an article about a group
of four civic honorees, which mentioned three award winners and
omitted the name of a prominent striker.
</P>
<P>
   But Giles has received a letter of support from the current
leaders of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, calling him
``an innovative and ethical journalist.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Giles defended the News' strike coverage as
being fair, considering that ``the union spokespeople would not
speak to our reporters.'' As for the article that omitted the name
of a striker, he said he did not know that had happened and that
the name should have been included.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Giles said: ``The Detroit newspapers were able to
introduce what we consider to be modern newspaper management
practices. That fact alone will be seen years from now as being a
very important part of the survival of two newspapers in Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``the emotional toll was extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Wowk, a suburban reporter at the News, believes the
strike failed because ``they outmuscled us.'' At 53, he is training
to become a schoolteacher, and he said his current managers at the
newspaper accommodated his scheduling needs.
</P>
<P>
   But still, when he thinks of editors and reporters who crossed
the picket line, he said: ``I don't know if everything will ever be
forgiven. But we're professionals. We work together.''

   MICROSOFT-RESEARCH (Redmond, Wash.) _ For decades, Microsoft has
held a reputation in the computer industry as an imitator, not an
innovator. That reputation rankles deeply inside the software
giant, which has gained a Rodney Dangerfield-like complex about the
criticism in recent years. Partly as a result, the company is
spending heavily in research in a range of areas from tablet
computing to voice recognition. By John Markoff.

   DETROIT-STRIKE-MEDIA (Sterling Heights, Mich.) _ On its fifth
anniversary, the last great newspaper strike of the 20th century, a
ghost with a living grievance, still haunts Detroit. If the strike
is a memory, though, its consequences are not. ``It's incredibly
tragic that the unions and companies couldn't come to some middle
ground,'' said David Crumm, a religion writer for The Free Press.

thousand people, mostly poor, who were unfairly imprisoned on
charges of terrorism or treason between 1992 and 1995 by special
antiterrorism courts, ``the innocents.'' Most have been pardoned or
absolved of any wrongdoing over the last three years; but their
lives and the lives of their families have been irreparably
tattered. Such injustice was the product of the chaos that gripped

MICROSOFT SEES SOFTWARE `AGENT' AS WAY TO AVOID DISTRACTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Word in bold should be set in italic, which cannot be
transmitted to some newspapers.) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Attention, please.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to shed its longstanding industry reputation as a mere
imitator, not an innovator, Microsoft is spending heavily on
research in a wide range of software technologies that include
hand-held computing and voice recognition. But the most intriguing
project may be taking place in the cramped office of Eric Horvitz,
a devotee of an obscure, 17-century statistical technique that
plays a key role in his current work.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Horvitz and his team of researchers are trying to
make it possible, in the age of information overload, to reclaim
the right to pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   Using statistical probability and decision-theory techniques
that draw inferences from a user's behavior, the team is developing
software meant to shield people from information overload while
they are working. The new software _ which Microsoft hopes to use
in commercial products within the year _ would act as a combination
secretary and traffic cop to hold back the torrents of electronic
and voice mail, appointment requests and Internet information that
increasingly threaten to overwhelm today's office workers.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of many computer-design experts, restricting
electronic interruptions to only the most urgent ones has become a
pressing necessity in the Internet Age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Internet entrepreneurs treat the users' attention as a
Third World country to be strip-mined,'' said Jakob Nielsen, a
Silicon Valley expert on software usability.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's top executives predict that if Horvitz's software
goals can be reached, the company will be able to reinvent the
personal computer user interface _ the visual and physical controls
that since the mid-1980s have been fixed on the concept of mice,
windows and on-screen menus.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of Horvitz's team, this aging interface has allowed
a deluge of electronic interruptions to cascade upon office workers
with each new generation of technology, to the point that the
telephone and potentially dozens of computer programs are now free
to distract a person with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to write a book,'' Horvitz said in a recent
interview, ``It would be titled `My Battle With Attention.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the new world of the Attentional User Interface, as the
researchers call it, a software program known as a notification
manager would continuously monitor streams of data that include
electronic mail, voice mail, Internet news alerts and so-called
instant messaging notes.
</P>
<P>
   The system would also observe whether the computer user was
typing, talking on the phone or speaking with someone face to face
in the office. Helping keep tabs of the user would be a small
camera that could determine whether the person was present and
looking at the computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   But the Attentional User Interface would not be confined to the
desktop computer. It would be a software cloak enveloping the users
wherever they might be, able to alert them via cell phone,
hand-held computer, pager or other digital means _ whenever and
wherever the software deemed something worthy of their attention.
</P>
<P>
   The notification manager software, which would reside on a
remote computer out on the Internet, would use a continuously
changing web of probabilities to evaluate each new piece of
information in terms of its time value to the user. For the truly
economic minded, the individual decisions could even be assigned
monetary values.
</P>
<P>
   If an e-mail message arrived from a colleague or a supervisor,
for example, the system would try to determine how valuable it
would be for the user to know about the message immediately. An
urgent message from a family member might be assigned a value of
$1, for example, while the colleague's message might be valued at 5
cents and the supervisor's at 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   In weighing the decision on whether to issue an alert, the
notification manager software would take into account dozens of
details _ like the time of day and whether the user was in his
office, in a meeting, on the phone or behind the wheel. Having made
the decision to send an alert, the program would also have enough
information to know whether it should be displayed on the office
computer screen or on the small screen of a cell phone, pager or
other device.
</P>
<P>
   ``The software considers what the value of the information is
and the cost of the disruption,'' Horvitz said.
</P>
<P>
   The software is at the heart of the new post-PC ``.NET
strategy'' that Microsoft announced last month. Even as its lawyers
are intent on resisting a court-ordered breakup of the company, its
technical staff is fixated on the idea of reinventing the
computer-user interface.
</P>
<P>
   They are motivated, in part, by their desire to overcome the
infamy of Bob _ an intrusive, cartoony on-screen valet Microsoft
introduced with great fanfare in 1995, then quickly retired after
it was ridiculed by computer users and reviewers. Despite that
flop, Bill Gates, Microsoft's chief executive, who earlier this
year also assumed the title of chief software architect, remains
committed to the idea of software as an ``agent'' with human
attributes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout all those futuristic demos you've seen over the
last few decades, there was always this concept of an agent,
something working on your behalf,'' Gates said at a June 22
briefing where he introduced the company's .NET strategy. ``Well,
we now have what it takes to really build an information agent. We
have rich decision software called Bayesian Inference Software that
we can build down into the system that can track your usage and
adjust in an automatic fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bayesian  &UR; what &LR; , you say? The reference is to Bayesian
statistical techniques _so named for Thomas Bayes, a 17th-century
English minister and polymath who described them in a posthumously
published essay.
</P>
<P>
   The Bayesian approach centers on a formula for updating the
probabilities of events based on repeated observations. The
formula, referred to as the Bayes rule, describes how to transform
a current assumption about an event into a revised, more accurate
assumption after observing further evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, artificial intelligence researchers seized on
Bayesian techniques in part because more powerful computers were
able to compute large networks of many variables quickly.
</P>
<P>
   For Horvitz, the Bayesian approach came naturally. ``I was a
Bayesian before I knew what it meant,'' he said. ``I was the kind
of person who would look at events in the world and automatically
consider the probability of certain events happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Horvitz's Microsoft Web site
(www.research.microsoft.com/users/horvitz) makes his commitment to
the Bayesian perspective clear. Along with the lists of dozens of
academic papers on decision theory and Bayesian methods is a photo
of Horvitz and his young son on a visit to the Bayes tomb in
London.
</P>
<P>
   Horvitz, who has a PhD in computer science and a medical degree
from Stanford University, is an intense man who incessantly taps
his foot during an interview. As a self-described entrepreneur, he
started an artificial-intelligence company _ Knowledge Industries _
while he was still in medical school, sometimes unsuccessfully
juggling the two pursuits. Once, as he assisted in the operating
room, the chief surgeon ordered a nurse to remove Horvitz's pager,
which was buzzing impatiently.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft acquired the company in 1993, after it was discovered
by Nathan Myhrvold, who was Gates' chief technologist at the time
and who persuaded Horvitz and his researchers that their work could
make a bigger impact within Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the Horvitz team saw its first commercial
program become part of Microsoft's Office software. The program,
based on Bayesian techniques, was a relatively simple tool known as
the Answer Wizard, which tried to anticipate the needs of users
looking up topics in the software's electronic documentation.
</P>
<P>
   The Bayesian techniques have been widely adopted in Microsoft's
products _ including the Paper Clip help wizard that pops up
frequently to offer advice in the company's Office program. Many
users, however, have criticized Paper Clip as an irritant, popping
up too often with unwanted help.
</P>
<P>
   Horvitz, who speaks apologetically about the Paper Clip program,
said its shortcomings were the result of Microsoft's failure to
implement all of his team's ideas.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other missteps indicating that Bayesian
techniques must be added to software with great care. In December
1998, for example, Blue Mountain Arts, the Internet greeting card
company, filed suit after it discovered that a preliminary version
of Microsoft's electronic mail software mistakenly filtered Blue
Mountain's e-mail greeting cards into users' trash cans. The
filter, which had been based on software developed by Horvitz's
researchers, was repaired in the final release of the program. It
was an important lesson, he said, in the risk of artificial
intelligence making poor judgments.
</P>
<P>
   The new Attentional User Interface is already employed in
several experimental systems being tested In Horvitz's office. One,
called Lookout, automatically reads electronic mail messages and
attempts to schedule requests for appointments and meetings.
Another system, Priorities, performs the calculus of deciding when
and where to interrupt the user.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the few computer users who has experienced such a
software agent, Horvitz concedes that it has had a startling effect
on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a definite sense of a continuous, cross-device
`presence' that understands me and my life in a way that I had not
been accustomed to _ and that people have not been accustomed to
yet,'' he wrote in a recent e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some computer scientists familiar with Horvitz's work
worry that the Attentional User Interface may be too disorienting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a system changes in ways that are not predictable, it may
be upsetting to the user,'' said Ben Schneiderman, a computer
scientist at the University of Maryland. ``The designers of these
systems tend to create elaborate models, which can cause both users
and designers to lose track of what's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   And Horvitz and his researchers themselves acknowledge that the
information collected by the notification manager software _
potentially, information on the personal activities and movements
of millions of people that would be stored on the Internet _ raises
privacy and security issues that have yet to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   But Horvitz said he was confident that adequate security and
privacy safeguards would be created. And he sees a vast array of
other applications for his Bayesian approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come back in six months,'' he said. His researchers are now
working on a conversational system they plan to use experimentally
in the research group's reception area. He expects that the system
will be able to greet and converse with new visitors. The
conversation, he says, will be on par with speaking to a person who
is hard-of-hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Not perfect, but within shouting distance of the future world of
software agents.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When JDS Uniphase announced last week that it was buying a
competitor, SDL, for an astounding $41 billion in stock, many on
Wall Street wondered, who  &UR; are &LR;  these guys?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, JDS was one of the hottest companies of 1999, its stock
price soaring more than 900 percent. But its business _ making
components for fiber-optic networks _ was hardly the most glamorous
angle of the telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   It has been only a year since JDS Fitel, a Canadian
telecommunications equipment maker, merged with the Silicon Valley
company Uniphase to become JDS Uniphase. At that point, the company
had a market capitalization of only $14 billion. But in the last
year, JDS has been on an acquisition tear, agreeing to buy 10
companies _ including SDL _ for more than $63 billion in stock or
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, JDS Uniphase is a behemoth with a stock market value
of $100 billion, raising the eyebrows of not only investors but
antitrust regulators as well.
</P>
<P>
   Why? JDS Uniphase makes fiber optic equipment like receivers and
amplifiers that generate and direct pulses of light and distribute
bits of information at eye-blink speed over optical networks.
Demand for such components is sizzling: Customers like Nortel
Networks and Lucent Technologies need those pieces to build the
Internet superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   As such, JDS' acquisition strategy has been to buy component
suppliers that can fill the gaps in its product line, providing it
a more complete catalog of fittings and fixtures to offer its
telecommunications company customers.
</P>
<P>
   This is a time-honored strategy in technology circles, similar
to the way Texas Instruments acquires hardware specialists or
Computer Associates buys up software boutiques. Yet, although the
strategy makes sense in a hot market, it can also be risky.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the products gained through the nine acquisitions
finalized, about half of JDS' 17,000 employees are also new to the
fold. Operations are spread far and wide _ from China to Canada,
and scattered on the East and West Coasts of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And acquiring and making products to meet demand in the booming
fiber optics network market is more than a full-time job. So,
really, who has time to pay attention to the minutiae of
integrating all those new members of the JDS Uniphase family?
</P>
<P>
   Possibly no one. And that is what worries some money managers,
analysts and industry consultants who wonder if JDS Uniphase's
reach is fast exceeding its grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've gotten used to a certain size of deal, you have a
process in place,'' said Mark Sirower, a merger adviser at the
Boston Consulting Group. ``When you go to multibillion-dollar
deals, it's a much bigger management challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors punished JDS' stock price last Monday, knocking it
down 13 percent upon the announcement of its merger with SDL.
Though the shares had recovered most of the lost ground by Friday,
analysts are concerned that the SDL deal comes too fast on the
heels of the $18 billion agreement in January to acquire E-Tek
Dynamics, a merger completed on June 30 after months of scrutiny by
the Department of Justice. Only now is E-Tek beginning to be
combined with JDS.
</P>
<P>
   Leery that the fiber optics industry may be consolidating too
quickly, the Justice Department demanded concessions of JDS, the
industry leader for several products, before approving the
acquisition of E-Tek, one of the largest makers and buyers of
optical thin-film filters, which divide beams of light so they can
transmit more information. E-Tek had deals with some other makers
to be the exclusive buyer of their filters, and the Justice
Department forced E-Tek to give up those exclusive deals before
allowing the JDS merger to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department could require various concessions in the
SDL acquisition, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the regulatory approval process will be somewhat
involved and could add volatility to the two stocks over the next
six months,'' Tom Astle, Merrill Lynch's senior optics analyst,
wrote in an assessment of the SDL deal last week.
</P>
<P>
   Charles J. Abbe, the president of JDS Uniphase, who himself came
aboard only in February after JDS bought Optical Coding Laboratory
Inc., acknowledges that the expanding company is still very much a
work in progress. But rather than a liability, he sees the
company's structure as a new-economy paradigm. ``We are forging a
geographically diverse model,'' he said. ``We are a virtual
management team.''
</P>
<P>
   With each acquisition, Abbe said, the first group to be
integrated is the sales force, which reports to him. But he
acknowledged that senior managers of most departments could meet
only by videoconferencing because they were too farflung to gather
in person. Rather than being concentrated at JDS' headquarters in
San Jose, Calif., or Ottawa, managers who head business units are
situated at whichever acquired company has the relevant area of
expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Take JDS Uniphase's operations in optical thin-film coating.
Because Abbe's old company, called OCLI, has a particular expertise
in that specialty, he said, the operations of other acquired
companies in that sector report to a manager in Santa Rosa, Calif.,
OCLI's former base.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, executives at two other companies acquired last year
_ AFC Technologies, formerly of Hull, Quebec, and Oprel
Technologies, whose previous address was Nepean, Ontario _ report
to executives in Freehold, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Confusing? Only to the uninitiated, Abbe said. ``Whatever we do
is tested against the idea of serving the customer effectively,''
he added. Because demand for networking products is booming, the
acquired companies have a common goal of getting product out the
door fast. That, he said, is the tie that binds; anything more
would seem too constraining.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we bring them into the fold is that the strategies are
very clear and the charter is understood,'' he said. ``Beyond that,
we aren't going to bring them into the fold.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Astle, the Merrill analyst, said that despite the risks, the
purchase of the San Jose-based SDL would be positive for both
companies if they delivered as promised. He points to the
primordial merger of JDS Fitel and Uniphase as the template for
what the management team can do well. Jozef Straus, now chief
executive of JDS Uniphase, was chief executive at JDS Fitel.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, executives remained focused on what customers
wanted, he said, freed from the corporate jockeying that distracts
even the best managers during a merger. And the company continued
to foster its own in-house research and development instead of
relying solely on the companies they bought.
</P>
<P>
   But as with any investment, past performance is no guarantee of
future results. ``Just because you put a bunch of products together
doesn't mean they will be better off,'' said Sirower of Boston
Consulting. In other words, a merger can make sense on paper but
not succeed unless it is executed well. ``It's separate to the
economies of why you are doing a deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Straus said JDS Uniphase had an advantage in these fast-changing
times: The fiber optics component field is such a close community
that the senior management teams at many of the companies JDS has
acquired have known one another for some time. JDS Fitel, for
instance, once had a joint venture with OCLI.
</P>
<P>
   Straus said he had known Donald Scifres, chief executive of SDL,
for nearly a decade. ``We share the same passion,'' he said. ``That
is the essence of this merger.''

 &HT;    'I survived for a reason. We can't let people forget.'
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is a measure of Ben Hirsch's enduring, and
perverse, humor that he can describe the Dachau concentration camp
with a wry smile: The place now has a handicapped ramp, for its
mostly elderly Jewish tourists. And a sign out front reads ``No
Smoking,'' only yards from the crematoria where thousands were
burned to ashes.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes such a twisted observation or gesture is the only way
to deal with horrors such as the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   On a 1995 pilgrimage to the Auschwitz death camp, where his
mother, father and two youngest siblings were killed, Hirsch found
himself standing on a set of railroad tracks. He urinated on them.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch's droll humor softens, but doesn't fully mask, the anger
and pain that has shaped his life and work since he was 6 years
old, when he escaped from Hitler's Germany. Through his
architecture, he has strived to enlighten others about man's
capacity to brutalize his fellow man, reflecting despair, but also
undaunted hope and meaning. He has become a prolific designer of
churches, synagogues and Holocaust memorials, including the
Holocaust gallery of Atlanta's William Bremen Jewish Heritage
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Now Hirsch has written a poignant memoir, ``Hearing a Different
Drummer: A Holocaust Survivor's Search for Identity'' (Mercer
University Press, $24.95). In his perversely funny way, ``Drummer''
delves into his life, psyche and dreams. It also attempts to trace
the long roots of European anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to get a feel for why it is, and how, that
civilized people can become vicious murderers,'' he says. His
answer: The capacity to hate is a universal trait. ``I'm hoping
there are a lot of subtle lessons here about human behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   He plans a second book, about oppression of Jews in Georgia. ``I
survived for a reason,'' he says. ``We can't let people forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch has designed dozens of synagogues and churches, including
Brookhaven Christian Church and the Or Vey Shalom and Etz Chaim
synagogues in Atlanta. His trademarks are low, wooden ceilings
leading into towering sanctuaries, with skylights for natural
light.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted a building that would reflect the African-American
experience, and he listened very carefully,'' says the Rev. A.
Knighton Stanley, pastor of the Peoples Congregational United
Church of Christ in Washington. ``We talked about how
African-Americans and Jews had been persecuted, oppressed, for
centuries, and he was able to draw upon his own experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The church's low ceiling represents Africans' sea journey to
America, Stanley explains. ``Then it rises about three floors, with
skylights that are semicircular. This represents the new freedom we
enjoy. You go from an area of despair into another representing
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch's own season of despair began in November 1938, when he
was 6. His father, Hermann Hirsch, a dentist, was arrested by the
Gestapo during Krystallnacht, a pogrom against Jews.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Mathilda, decided to send young Ben and his four
elder siblings to France, where they hid out for several years
before escaping to America. She felt that Ben's younger brother
Werner and sister Roselene were too small to travel.
</P>
<P>
   The mother and her two young children were arrested in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch settled with a foster family in Atlanta. In the chaos of
the war and its aftermath, he couldn't learn the fate of his
family. But when he enlisted in the Army _ a patriotic gesture to
the nation that had helped liberate the camps _ he was sent to his
native Germany, where he found out what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't believe it,'' Hirsch says. ``Who kills babies?
I had always hoped they might still be alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Touring the Bremen's Holocaust gallery one recent morning,
Hirsch pointed to a huge black-and-white photograph of a German
soldier murdering a Jewish woman and her tightly clutched infant
with a single rifle shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people don't see anything else, I want them to see this,''
he said. ``The soldier was so proud of that, he sent it home to his
parents. How could that be? What was he thinking?''
</P>
<P>
   Such images and questions have made Hirsch into a man who
comprehends Dachau with a grim joke _ with despair and hope.
William B. Helmreich, now a professor at the City University of New
York, met him 30 years ago. He says, ``Beneath this very pleasant,
seemingly gentle demeanor lies a man of steely determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``These experiences during the war have given him a heightened
level of consciousness, both vis-a-vis Jews and vis-a-vis people in
general. Yet he can be the most casual man in the world. He'll
challenge you to a game of basketball and beat you with a smile. He
shows us the remarkable ability of human beings to learn to live,
laugh and love again.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Hirsch's designs is the fortresslike Memorial to the Six
Million at Atlanta's Greenwood Cemetery, America's second Holocaust
memorial, erected in 1965. Every year after Passover, hundreds
gather there for a service of remembrance. ``Anybody can share in
it,'' Hirsch says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the site serves as more than just a symbol.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Hirsch received a frantic call from a rabbi at
Congregation Beth Jacob. A member of the synagogue had found four
bars of soap from a Nazi death camp, each stamped ``RJF,'' for
``Rein Juden Fett'' _ ``Pure Jewish Fat.'' Hirsch helped arrange to
inter the soap by the Greenwood Cemetery memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Some historians deny that the Nazis made soap from their
concentration camp victims. But Hirsch, when he was searching for
information about his family members, read the diary of an uncle, a
chemist who had survived the Holocaust. The uncle said he knew the
Nazis made soap from people _ because he was forced to participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who in his right mind would talk about making soap from human
remains if he didn't do it, in a memoir he never expected to be
read?''
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch worries that such horrors will be revised out of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attack on memory always bothers me. You can't discount
memories of people.''
</P>
<P>
   So he trys to spread the truth as he finds it. The harrowing
gallery at the Bremen Museum is packed with anti-Semitic posters
dating to 1475 and relics from the 20th century Holocaust. As
visitors proceed through the building, windows decrease in size to
illustrate the diminishing hope of Jews; lighting becomes dimmer,
the images more violent. But the exhibit also shows courage,
telling stories, many on video by Atlanta Holocaust survivors, of
resistance and rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes it work is what makes him tick _ a sense of 'I
survived for a reason; I want to discover that reason; I want to
make sure I honor what was left behind and what was destroyed,'''
says Rabbi Ilan Feldman of Congregation Beth Jacob.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Leavey, the Bremen's director, says she can gauge the
effectiveness of the exhibit by watching the startled eyes of
thousands of Atlanta kids who visit it every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last month, on a school tour, an eighth-grade boy said, 'My
grandfather is a member of the Ku Klux Klan and he didn't want me
to come here. My mother said, ``That's exactly why I should
come.'''
</P>
<P>
   That sums up what Hirsch hopes to do _ change closed minds.
Including those who stopped believing in God after the Holocaust.
His own experiences made Hirsch a more devout Jew, long active in
his congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I believe in God,'' Hirsch says.
</P>
<P>
   He winks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But sometimes, I feel that he owes me one.''

U.N. OFFICIAL IN KOSOVO LOOKS BACK ON TURBULENT YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Bernard Kouchner, the chief of the U.N.
administration in Kosovo, has made it through a tumultuous year.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, as the province's water and power were almost
nonexistent, the West was not providing the money or personnel it
had promised and the cold was as profound and bitter as the ethnic
hatred, Kouchner was in a depression so deep that his staff thought
he might quit.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke darkly then of ``how hard it is to change the human
soul,'' of the quick fatigue of Western leaders who prosecuted the
war with Serbia over Kosovo and had no interest in hearing about
its problematic aftermath, of the impenetrability of the local
Serbs and Albanians with their tribal, feudal passions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard an Albanian joke,'' he said sadly, looking
around his dreary office, the former seat of Serbian power here.
``Do they have a sense of humor?''
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a blistering summer, Kouchner's mood has improved. A
French physician who founded Doctors Without Borders because he
became frustrated with international bureaucracy, he is now an
international bureaucrat, sometimes uneasy in his skin.
</P>
<P>
   He still goes up and down with the vagaries of this broken
province, with its ramshackle infrastructure, chaotic traffic and
lack of real law or justice. And without question, he admits, some
of those problems can be laid at his door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I'm not the perfect model of a bureaucrat and an
administrator,'' he said. ``But we have succeeded in the main
thing'' _ stopping the oppression of Kosovo's Albanians by
Belgrade, bringing them home and letting them restart their lives
in freedom.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, he said, ``I have not succeeded in human terms'' with a
traumatized population. ``They still hate one another deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, and added: ``Here I discovered hatred deeper than
anywhere in the world, more than in Cambodia or Vietnam or Bosnia.
Usually someone, a doctor or a journalist, will say, `I know
someone on the other side.' But here, no. They had no real
relationship with the other community.''
</P>
<P>
   The hatred, he suggested, can be daunting and has plunged him
and his colleagues into despair. ``Sometimes we got tired and
exhausted, and we didn't want a reward, not like that, but just a
little smile,'' he said wanly. ``I'm looking for moments of real
happiness, but you know just now I'm a bit dry.'' But he is proud
that everyone has persisted nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   As for himself, he said, ``My only real success is to set up
this administration,'' persuading Albanian and some Serbian leaders
to cooperate with foreign officials and begin to share some
executive responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   When the head of the local Serbian Orthodox Church, Bishop Kyr
Artemije, and the leaders of perhaps half of Kosovo's Serbs decided
to join as observers, ``we were very happy then,'' he said. ``We
were jumping in the air. We believed then that we were reaching the
point of no return.''
</P>
<P>
   But even those Serbs left the executive council set up by
Kouchner, only to return after securing written promises for better
security that have prompted Hashim Thaci, the Albanian former
leader of the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army, to suspend his own
participation.
</P>
<P>
   Artemije's chief aide, the Rev. Sava Janjic, said carefully:
``Kouchner has not been serious in his promises, and the efforts to
demilitarize the Kosovo Liberation Army are very inefficient. But
he is sincere, and this written document is important on its own.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Albanian politician who insisted on anonymity said
Kouchner was ``the wrong man for the job,'' which he said required
more forcefulness and less empathy. ``After a year, you still can't
talk of the rule of law,'' he said. Still, he added, ``Kouchner's
instincts are good _ he knew he had to co-opt the Albanians, that
the U.N. couldn't run the place alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Less successful, most officials and analysts here think, is
Kouchner's sometimes flighty, sometimes secretive management of the
clumsy international bureaucracy itself.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside are the 45,000 troops of the NATO-led Kosovo Force,
known here as KFOR. They are responsible to their home governments,
not to Kouchner or even to KFOR's commander. And while Kouchner was
able to convince former KFOR commander Klaus Reinhardt, a German
general, to do more to help the civilian side, they were both
rather less successful with Washington, Paris, Bonn, Rome and
London.
</P>
<P>
   The affliction known here as ``Bosnian disease'' _ with
well-armed troops unwilling to take risks that might cause any harm
to themselves _ has settled into Kosovo in earnest, say Kouchner's
aides and even some senior KFOR officers.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, some serious problems _ like the division of the
northern town of Mitrovica into Serbian and Albanian halves that
actually markthe informal partition of Kosovo _ are not going to
be solved, but simply ``managed,'' no matter how much they embolden
Belgrade or undermine the confidence of Kosovo Albanians in the
good will of their saviors.
</P>
<P>
   It was on the bridge dividing Mitrovica _ not in Paris _ that
Kouchner chose to spend his millennial New Year's Eve, offering a
hopeful toast, so far in vain, to reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will the peacekeeping troops do much to stop organized crime
or confront, in a serious fashion, organized Albanian efforts to
drive the remaining Serbs out of Kosovo and prevent the return of
those who fled, the officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery last month of some 70 tons of arms, hidden by the
former Kosovo Liberation Army and not handed over, as promised, to
the peacekeepers, took no one here by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a success,'' Kouchner said, ``not a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, senior U.N. and NATO officials say, the existence of
the arms cache was known; the timing of the discovery itself was a
message to the former Kosovo fighters, who had recently used some
of the weapons, to stop their organized attacks on Serbs and
moderate Albanian politicians.
</P>
<P>
   But few here expect the arrest of former KLA commanders who are
widely suspected of involvement in corruption or political
violence. The reaction may be volatile, officials say; troops could
be attacked and the shaky political cooperation with the Albanians
undermined.
</P>
<P>
   Is KFOR too timid? Kouchner paused and shrugged. ``Of course,''
he finally said. ``But what can we do? Everything in the
international community works by compromise.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Foreign police are also timid, and their investigations never
seem to finish. But at least now, Kouchner says, more than 3,100 of
the 4,800 international police he has been promised (even if not
the 6,000 he wanted) are here, and a Kosovo police academy is
producing graduates.
</P>
<P>
   One of Kouchner's biggest regrets is the slow arrival of the
police, which bred a culture of impunity. There have been more than
500 murders in the year since KFOR took complete control of the
province, and no one has yet been convicted.
</P>
<P>
   There are still only four international judges and prosecutors
in a province where violence and intimidation mean that neither
Serbs nor Albanians can administer justice fairly.
</P>
<P>
   What Kouchner says depresses him most is the persistence of
ethnic violence even against the innocent and the care givers. One
of his worst moments came last winter, he said, when a Serbian
obstetrician who cared for women of all races was murdered by
Albanians in Gnjilane, in the American sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a doctor!'' Kouchner exclaimed, still appalled. ``It
was the reverse of everything we did with Doctors Without
Borders.''
</P>
<P>
   While Kouchner says he has put himself alongside ``the new
victims,'' the minority Serbs, he carries with him his visits to
the mass graves of murdered Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm angry that world opinion has changed so quickly,'' he
said. ``They were aware before of the beatings and the killings of
Albanians, but now they say, `There is ethnic cleansing of the
Serbs.' But it is not the same _ it's revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   He does savor the international military intervention on moral
and humanitarian grounds. ``I don't know if we will succeed in
Kosovo,'' he said. ``But already we've won _ we stopped the
oppression of the Albanians of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner paused, lost in thought and memory. ``It was my
dream,'' he said softly. ``My grandparents died in Auschwitz,'' he
said, opening a normally closed door. ``If only the international
community was brave enough just to bomb the railways there,'' which
funneled the cattle cars to the death camp. ``But all the
opportunities were missed.''
</P>
<P>
   This, he said, is why he became involved, early on, in Biafra,
in the Nigerian civil war of 1966-70 in which perhaps 1 million
people died. And it is what drives him in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner, now 60, holds to the healing power of time. He points
to the reconciliation now of Germany and Israel, and of France and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working with Klaus Reinhardt is a good memory,'' he said. ``He
called me his twin brother.'' They both came of age in the Europe
of 1968. ``I'm a Frenchman and he's a German,'' and 50 years ago,
Kouchner said, ``no one could imagine this,'' that together they
would run Europe's biggest project after NATO's only war.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much easier to make war than peace,'' Kouchner said. ``To
make peace takes generations, a deep movement and a change of the
spirit.'' He smiled and looked away. ``It's why I sometimes want to
believe in God.''

PERU RELEASES HUNDREDS JAILED FOR YEARS FALSELY FOR TERRORISM 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ Outside his powder-blue shack, Antonio Alejo waits
quietly for customers in need of an oil change or a brake job. He
smiles faintly as his youngest child plays with his two
stepchildren, running around some burning trash on the sand dune
that is his front yard. With business slow, he tends a few
geraniums and sunflowers and occasionally fixes a bowl of rice.
</P>
<P>
   Alejo is slowly picking up the shards of his life.
</P>
<P>
   For five years, he sat in jail serving time on a 30-year jail
sentence on charges that he was a Maoist terrorist _ a phony case
cobbled together with a forged confession and the false testimony
of a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Pardoned two years ago by President Alberto Fujimori, Alejo
walked out of prison, his life in ruins. His wife had presumed him
dead and was living with another man. His wrists were dislocated,
his teeth were broken and his intestines so badly damaged by kicks
from torture sessions that he needed two operations.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he looks much older than his 43 years. His sleep is
interrupted by strange dreams, no doubt linked to the screaming,
all-night arguments between the two terrorist groups who shared his
cell block.
</P>
<P>
   Peruvians call Alejo and more than 1,000 people like him ``the
innocents,'' mostly poor people who were unfairly imprisoned on
charges of terrorism or treason between 1992 and 1995 by special
anti-terrorism courts. Most have been pardoned or absolved of any
wrongdoing during the last three years, but their lives and the
lives of their families have been irreparably tattered.
</P>
<P>
   Such injustice was the product of the chaos that gripped Peru in
the early 1990s, when the Shining Path, a brutal terrorist group
bent on creating a radical Maoist state, was in the final throes of
a rampage of bombings and massacres. They threatened and paid off
prosecutors and judges to avert imprisonment of their own
associates, and their efforts to dominate Peru by coercion appeared
close to fruition.
</P>
<P>
   In a draconian 1992 crackdown, Fujimori disbanded Congress and
the Supreme Court and established the special anti-terrorism
courts, which convicted thousands of people of aiding rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
   The fates of those who had allegedly cooperated with the
guerrillas were decided by masked judges and prosecutors
anonymously working behind one-way mirrors. Sometimes the trials in
these ``faceless courts'' did not last more than 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   There were no juries and no cross examination, lawyers and
suspects said.
</P>
<P>
   Sentences were often based on phony evidence, say the office of
the ombudsman and a government-sponsored commission. Suspects were
arrested, tortured _ hung by their wrists in Alejo's case _ and
forced to sign pieces of paper that were turned into confessions of
aiding terrorists. Some convictions were based on testimony
provided by rebels, who implicated others rather than give up a
fellow guerrilla.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was war justice applied to civilians,'' said Jorge
Santistevan, the congressionally appointed ombudsman who has
investigated the plight of the innocents. ``These people have done
nothing. Nothing. Nothing. And their suffering has been
boundless.''
</P>
<P>
   As Peru's struggle against terrorism has wound down, 1,089 of
the innocents have been freed, authorities said, either by pardon
or reversals of their sentences. Under international pressure,
Fujimori set up a review commission to examine individual cases.
</P>
<P>
   But 54 more prisoners deemed innocent by the panel remain in
jail as petitions for their release have sat on Fujimori's desk for
more than six months. And at least 227 others that also have
credible claims of innocence are still sitting in Peru's dank
prisons: Those cases had not been reviewed before Fujimori allowed
the commission's term to expire last year.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, who did not respond to requests for an interview, has
turned the commission's work over to the Justice Ministry, saying
Peru had to be careful not to let guilty people go free. His
personal representative on the commission, the Rev. Hubert
Lanssiers, said, ``I have no idea how many more innocent people
remain in jail. It is a tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   As he sits at home, Alejo nearly always folds his arms tightly
across his chest as if to ward off a blow or a kick. His few words
come in an expressionless monotone: ``Justice is not justice in
this country,'' he said. ``Only God can explain what happened to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Alejo's imprisonment left his family destitute, forcing them to
wander Peru in search of work and shelter. Taking him for dead,
Alejo's common-law wife took up with another man, a violent
alcoholic, with whom she had two children. She finally ran from the
violence and back to Alejo last April, but the relationship is not
the same, they both say.
</P>
<P>
   Still he is a determined survivor. In prison, Alejo learned to
read and write, and he has begun a business with rudimentary
mechanic skills he learned from another former prisoner.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   COMPATRIOTS OF INJUSTICE
</P>
<P>
   If there was any small comfort in Alejo's story it is that he
was not alone. Based on human rights and government reports:
</P>
<P>
   _ Alicia Zamalloa Caceres, an impoverished widow, was imprisoned
after police found a raffle ticket she sold in the house of a
terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   _ Juan Mallea Tomailla, a taxi driver, was imprisoned after he
dropped off a customer at a house once used to edit the newspaper
for the Shining Path guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   _ Juana Quispe Rojas, a housekeeper, was mistakenly arrested on
a warrant for a suspected terrorist who happened to have the same
name. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   All were eventually released. But Genaro Caceres Camones, a day
laborer, is still serving a 10-year sentence for treason. According
to a 1995 report by Human Rights Watch, Caceres was ``tricked into
carrying the supplies of a Shining Path band, and escaped by giving
himself up to an army patrol after an armed clash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevertheless, he was tried for treason and sentenced.''
</P>
<P>
   Mass arrests were made by soldiers and police who earned extra
cash based on the number of people they rounded up. In court, the
suspects were railroaded into a conviction and a prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Alfredo Marquez, a 36-year-old artist pardoned in 1998 after
serving three years in jail, remembers his 1994 hearing in a court
in which he was not allowed to talk to his lawyer. The judge and
prosecutor sat behind the one-way mirror speaking to him through
microphones outfitted with special equipment to distort their
voices beyond recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like listening to Darth Vader,'' said Marquez, who was
sentenced to 20 years, accused of being a member of Shining Path
after he produced a silk-screen Pop Art-style print of Mao
Tse-tung. He confessed in exchange for the release of his
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The courtroom was so surreal it made Kafka look like child's
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a single military or police officer, prosecutor or judge has
been disciplined for their actions.
</P>
<P>
   Once in jail, the prisoners say, they bunked in threes or fours
in tiny, windowless cells outfitted with a hole for a toilet and
concrete slabs for beds. Most were denied anything to read, and the
only recreation allowed was a half hour of daily exercise. Visiting
privileges were limited to two adults for 30 minutes per month, and
children could visit only for 30 minutes every three months.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoners were not allowed to touch their visitors. They
could only see the outlines of their loved ones through curtains
and chicken wire that were so tightly woven they were barely
translucent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were savage years for these people,'' said Susana
Gonzalez, a social worker who worked for the review commission.
``It was an experience that destroyed the most intimate corners of
a person's psyche.'' The result, psychologists say, has been severe
depression and lasting rage among most of the people who have been
released. To this day not one has received a penny in reparations
from the government.
</P>
<P>
   A TRAGEDY OF WORDS
</P>
<P>
   All of Alejo's suffering hinged on a simple mistake made on
December 10, 1992, he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He had ridden his mule down from the mountains to the market
town of Paucartambo to sell oranges and bananas, and to have a bowl
of soup at a local restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   A group of six soldiers came into the restaurant while on
patrol, searching for Shining Path rebels who were at the time
terrorizing the central highlands.
</P>
<P>
   One soldier asked Alejo, a simple question: ``Have you seen any
tucos?''
</P>
<P>
   Unaware that ``tucos'' is a slang word for terrorists, the shy,
illiterate jungle farmer said that he had. For Alejo, ``tucos''
were the little gray birds that fly in the jungle at night, waking
up the peasants with their wild screeches. The soldiers then asked
for his papers and became more suspicious when they noticed that he
had failed to vote in the most recent municipal election _ a
technical violation of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like a game,'' he recalled. ``Somebody had to be
kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   But for this simple misunderstanding, the soldiers hauled Alejo
away. For three days, he said, he was tied up in an outhouse
without food or water, and left to gag on the odor. Then over eight
more days of torture army personnel hung him from a ceiling by his
wrists, dislocating them, and applied electric currents to his
penis.
</P>
<P>
   One night during his capture, he said, he was forced to sleep
beside the mutilated remains of a woman who had been the girlfriend
of a terrorist. When he cried in horror, the soldiers accused him
of sympathizing with her.
</P>
<P>
   Alejo said his military torturers grilled him for information
about the Shining Path guerrillas, who had recently begun operating
in the area.
</P>
<P>
   But Alejo said he had no information to give. ``They said. `All
your neighbors say you are a terrorist and you won't talk because
you are a terrorist,''' Alejo said, mixing his flat rendition of
events with an occasional tear.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer assigned by the review commission to study Alejo's case
said that a neighbor of his, who was picked up by the army in the
Paucartambo restaurant the same day the same soldiers questioned
Alejo, had signed a statement implicating him and others to avoid
torture.
</P>
<P>
   The torturers told Alejo he could end the torture sessions by
signing a confession, he said. When he said he could not read or
write, they had him sign a blank piece of paper. Someone later
filled in the blanks _ with a confession by Alejo that he
participated in six terrorist activities, including two murders.
</P>
<P>
   According to the pardon request filed by the review commission,
which was eventually approved by Fujimori, that confession was the
basis for his conviction during a military court trial.
</P>
<P>
   At his trial, Alejo said, his defense lawyer told him the only
way he could defend him was if he provided names of other
terrorists _ and then requested a $30 fee.
</P>
<P>
   Alejo repeatedly tried to tell someone that he could not have
possibly written or understood the confession he supposedly signed
because he was illiterate. But he said his pleas were ignored.
</P>
<P>
   FINDING A LOST LIFE
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori allowed Alejo and 27 other pardoned prisoners to leave
Lima's Castro Castro prison on November 28, 1998. Most cheered
wildly as they walked through the gates to freedom. A throng of
television and radio reporters recorded the occasion and noticed
that Alejo was sobbing.
</P>
<P>
   Alejo explained that he was all alone. In his five years in
prison, he had not seen or heard from his wife and four children,
the youngest of whom was only 3 months old at the time he was
arrested. He had heard that they had left their village, but the
Red Cross could not find them.
</P>
<P>
   Alejo's wife, Teresa Pareja Gonzalez, a simple peasant woman
with long braided hair, had heard about his capture but was too
frightened to investigate. As the years passed, she took him for
dead. Hungry and scared of the terrorist violence swelling through
the highlands near the farm she shared with her parents, she and
her children first moved to the nearby town of Huanta and finally
to the Apurimac valley, where she found work picking coca plants
for drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   While she struggled to make ends meet, earning $3 a day in the
coca fields, her three-year-old daughter, Sonia, suddenly fell ill.
A traditional healer could not help, and Sonia died. Then, after
Fujimori began shooting down the planes of cocaine traffickers in
1995, the price of coca dropped and Pareja Gonzalez was out of
work.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate for food, she accepted the advances of a part-time
farm hand who turned out to have a ferocious temper. ``He was a bad
man,'' Pareja Gonzalez said, ``and when he drank with his friends
he came home and kicked me and the children.'' Still, she had two
sons by him.
</P>
<P>
   Alejo did not know any of this when he was released, but one of
Pareja Gonzalez's sisters heard him interviewed on the radio when
he left the prison. She called her sister and finally reached Alejo
through a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Alejo waited a year to visit his family, who had moved back to
Huanta. He needed time to get his papers in order, he explained,
and until he did he feared that he would be seized again. At the
fateful reunion, Pareja Gonzalez said she was happy with her new
man. But she let Alejo return to Lima with their two eldest
children.
</P>
<P>
   Finally she left her abusing mate this past spring, and pleaded
with Alejo to take her back along with the two sons she had while
he was prison.
</P>
<P>
   The reunited family now live in the Villa El Salvador shantytown
in a cramped shack of thatched bamboo, concrete and plastic sheets.
Alejo said he and his wife are struggling to rebuild their old
intimacy. There are plenty of disagreements between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I went to jail I accepted things I won't accept
anymore,'' he said. ``I express myself more readily now, and she
doesn't always understand.''
</P>
<P>
   All of Alejo's surviving three children are having trouble
coping after their father's long absence and the beatings of their
stepfather.
</P>
<P>
   The whole family are squatters who can be thrown off the land
they live on at any time. But Alejo said he cannot return to his
old jungle farm because ``the memories are just too painful.'' A
tear begins to roll from an eye before he regains his control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do the best we can,'' said Alejo. ``I still have a life to
live.''

ADVERTISING: BETTING CORRECTLY TO STAY `ON THE ISLAND'

 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Madison Avenue these days, you're either on the island or off
the island.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive summer, couch potatoes have
unexpectedly switched from traditional fare like sitcoms, news
magazines and dramas to offbeat offerings like reality series and
prime-time quiz shows. With the breakout of sudden hits like
``Survivor'' and ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' ad agencies are
scrambling to adapt to these abrupt shifts in viewing patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think it's harder,'' said Bob Igiel, president for the
broadcast division of the Media Edge in New York, part of Young &AMP;
Rubicam. ``We have to be smarter and more innovative than ever
before.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the executives at agencies who try to determine in
advance which television shows will succeed, then try to buy
commercial time on those programs at the lowest possible prices,
have always been playing poker for high stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard to predict a hit, and anybody who tells you
they can is lying,'' said Laura Caraccioli, vice president and
director at Starcom Entertainment in Chicago, part of the Starcom
Worldwide media agency owned by the B Com3 Group.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the poker game is to get in on the opening hand
before a series becomes must-see TV, but avoid wasting precious ad
dollars on shows that turn into must-skip TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be involved in the next `water cooler show' everyone is
talking about is great,'' said Stacey Lynn Koerner, vice president
for broadcast research at TN Media in New York, owned by True North
Communications. ``But nobody thought `Millionaire' would be what it
was until we saw the first two weeks and said, `Hmmmmmm,'''
recalling the program's debut as a summer fill-in last year.
</P>
<P>
   The big danger that agencies confront, then, is failing to help
clients keep pace with rapidly changing consumer habits. That's a
fate worse than being voted off the island on ``Survivor,'' or
missing an easy $100 or $200 question on ``Millionaire.'' So
agencies are stepping up efforts to clamber aboard band wagons
before they begin rolling _ or at least jump aboard before they
gain much momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a calculated risk when you're considering an
unproven program,'' said Bret Itskowitch, vice president and
account director at Mediacom in New York, part of the Grey Global
Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now there's a different way of looking at things,'' he
added. ``There's greater opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Mediacom executives were early fans of ``Survivor,'' Itskowitch
said, and ``we did everything we could'' to persuade one client,
Reebok International, to become a sponsor of the unusual series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reebok had not been a huge network advertiser,'' Itskowitch
said, referring to the company's recent reluctance to advertise
during prime time on broadcast TV when prices are highest.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this was an obvious fit,'' he added, ``and it's worked out
perfectly for us.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the sponsorship package Mediacom bought for Reebok,
one of nine sold by CBS, the 16 contestants wear Reebok apparel and
footwear, which are continually seen during each episode. And the
Reebok creative agency, Berlin Cameron &AMP; Partners in New York, was
permitted to use contestants already voted off the island in
commercials that run during subsequent episodes of the show.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a spot that ran last week featured Stacey Stillman,
an early deportee, jogging through a jungle as a ``Survivor''-like
explorer plucks lagoon leeches from his skin. Other sponsors like
Anheuser-Busch are also running commercials with desert-island
themes.
</P>
<P>
   Another ``Survivor'' sponsor, the Pontiac division of General
Motors, followed a recommendation by its media agency, GM
Mediaworks, to promote a new product _ in this instance, a sport
utility vehicle named Aztek _ during the new series. That was a
risk because ``Survivor'' was still an unproven show when the
decision was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, my first thought was that we'd rather go with
something more established,'' said Don Butler, Aztek brand manager
at Pontiac in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the more I thought about it,'' he added, ``the more I
thought: `It's risky, it's on the edge. But it might make sense.'''
The last ``Survivor'' contestant not voted off the island will win
prizes including an Aztek.
</P>
<P>
   The Media Edge bought sponsorships in ``Survivor'' for two
clients, Ericsson and the U.S. Army. The agency hooked up another
client, AT&AMP;T, with ``Millionaire'' on ABC, sponsoring the
contestant aid known as the ``phone a friend'' lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``A producer of `Millionaire,' Michael Davies, came to me before
the show ever went on the air'' in August 1999, Igiel recalled.
``He showed me some of the footage from the original version in
England and I came out of my chair like a landed tuna.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you I thought it would be the mammoth hit here
that it is, but I thought it had potential,'' he added. ``And with
the lifeline, where in a stressful situation, dependability is
wonderful, AT&AMP;T could really showcase itself.'' The sponsorship
includes mentions of AT&AMP;T by the host, Regis Philbin, when a
lifeline call is placed as well as superimposing AT&AMP;T logos on
screen.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Sure things' are too often, I hate to say it, sure
failures,'' said John Mattimore, senior vice president and
associate media director at BBDO New York, part of the BBDO
Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group. ``You're better off going the
other way once in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattimore and his colleagues bought a ``Survivor'' sponsorship
for Visa because, he said, ``I've been doing this for 25 years and
we keep telling the networks: `Take chances. Don't keep doing the
same things. We don't need 10 ``Friends'' wannabes.' So if we say
it, we should be able to support it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, that is music to the ears of the top sales
executives at the broadcast networks. They have been stung by
complaints from agencies about having to pay higher prices each
year for commercial time despite declining ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought `Survivor' would be fairly successful,'' said Joseph
Abruzzese, CBS sales president in New York, a unit of Viacom Inc.
``But it's been wildly successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The reality series is attracting viewers far younger than those
usually watching the network, he added, as well as advertisers that
don't typically buy prime-time spots on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   The last episode of ``Survivor,'' on Aug. 23, will run 2 hours,
twice as long as the first 12. And commercial time will be
``double'' the $275,000 to $350,000 that NBC charged for each
30-second spot during the baseball All-Star Game last week,
Abruzzese said. That's also about double what CBS has charged for a
30-second spot on ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard about `Survivor,' I said, `You've got to be
kidding me,''' said Marv Goldsmith, president for network sales and
marketing at ABC in New York, part of the Walt Disney Co. ``But I
give CBS credit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were talking about `Survivor' two years ago, to get a feel
for it from advertisers,'' he added, ``and Coca-Cola said, `Can
they drink Coca-Cola?' We said: `It's a desert island. You don't
have a vending machine on a desert island.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But ABC is consoling itself with ``Millionaire,'' which
initially also ``had trouble getting advertisers,'' Goldsmith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first show,'' he added dryly, ``it was slightly
easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Agencies continue to worry when gauging the odds for or against
sponsoring programs before their potential can be determined, as
evident in the mixed reception for another CBS reality series,
``Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Starcom has not bought commercials during ``Big
Brother,'' Caraccioli said, but some clients may get so-called
make-good spots on the show to compensate for ratings shortfalls
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, TN has bought time during ``Big Brother'' for
clients like Schering-Plough, a ``Survivor'' sponsor, and S.C.
Johnson, Koerner said, adding: ``You can't write it off. It's still
outperforming what CBS would have had on in its place.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Fox Broadcasting unit of the News Corp. is just starting
to sell commercial time during ``American High,'' a documentary
reality series to begin on Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience is not accepting the same-old, same-old,'' said
Jon Nesvig, president for sales at Fox in New York. ``We have to
try new things, and the advertisers have to take chances also.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new TV landscape, the highs can be higher, as the record
summer viewership for ``Survivor'' has proved. But the lows can be
lower, too, as Fox learned from the fiasco surrounding a reality
special in February, ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   ``God knows they're lower,'' Nesvig said, laughing.

   Snapshot Diplomacy
</P>
<P>
   By Bob Deans
</P>
<P>
   Cox Newspapers
</P>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. Every picture tells a story, or so the saying
goes.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, pictures were the only story as Mideast peace talks at
nearby Camp David lurched through day six on Sunday amid a strictly
enforced news blackout.
</P>
<P>
   Like sheep at a trough, an international press corps, accustomed
to news gathering in the digital age, has been reduced to gathering
at bulletin boards in the temporary media headquarters at Thurmont
Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   There, in a classroom with dull wooden floors the honey color of
faded shellac, White House press officers have pinned two dozen
photographs, each one a carefully chosen 8X10 glossy glimpse into
diplomacy behind closed doors at the presidential retreat five
miles down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Here, for instance, is President Clinton, a grey shirttail
trailing from behind a pair of faded blue jeans, strolling through
the Catoctin Mountain woods early on in the talks. Shuffling along
at his side is Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, in his trademark
olive military dress and black and white keffiyeh, the traditional
Arab headdress.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another shot of Clinton seated, with Arafat to his left
and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak at Clinton's right, eating
dinner with negotiators Saturday night in the pale green clapboard
Laurel lodge.
</P>
<P>
   And beside that is a black and white picture of Clinton's
National Security Adviser, Samuel Berger, and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright presumably pursuing peace in a golf cart that
looks like Fred Flintstone's stone-mobile.
</P>
<P>
   In an exercise that gives new meaning to the term interpretive
reporting, White House and State Department correspondents camped
out here from their Washington posts have been left to scrutinize
these photos for some hint of summit atmospherics.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear, for instance, that Clinton is drinking a lot of Diet
Coke, and that Arafat isn't wasting much time shaving.
</P>
<P>
   If Barak is using the Camp David pool or gym, the exercise
hasn't taken a serious toll on his waistline - if the bulges in his
collarless black shirts are any indication.
</P>
<P>
   We know these are high-stakes talks. Why else would Clinton and
Arafat be chatting in one shot in front of a World War II era
poster of Winston Churchill the first foreign leader ever to visit
Camp David, in a 1943 meeting with President Franklin D. Roosevelt
in Clinton's informal office at the presidential compound.
</P>
<P>
   While the prints show the leaders and negotiators amiably if
intently engaged in what look like serious talks, White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart, not to mention common sense, insists that
the pictures tell only part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to create the false impression that because they
come together each evening for a meal in a positive atmosphere that
that permeates all the discussions,'' Lockhart told reporters
Sunday. ``These issues are difficult. The atmosphere can be
tense.''
</P>
<P>
   That's about as precise as Lockhart gets in his daily press
briefings here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to try to provide a progress report,'' he said.
``I'll give you the bare minimum of what the schedule is and let
those who are in these sessions at Camp David concentrate on the
difficult issues that face them, and spend a minimum amount of time
worrying about what's getting written in the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the ground rules of the talks, all information to the
press comes from Lockhart or one of his deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters have no access to the people who are actually
negotiating, much less the leaders themselves. And Lockhart won't
say anything about the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to prevent negotiators from using the press to try
to drive public opinion while the talks are underway and to prevent
bargaining positions from leaking out and becoming cemented in
place.
</P>
<P>
   For Arafat and Barak, there's no point in having the world know
how far they were willing to bend unless and until a deal can be
made public that comes with at least the possibility that the agony
of painful compromise might be at least partly offset by the
promise of peace.
</P>
<P>
   All of which leaves reporters - and the public - largely in the
dark.

CROSSFIRE OVER MARTHA GRAHAM'S LEGACY CATCHES UNIVERSITY DANCE
PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)   By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hosts of a long-scheduled retreat at Frostburg State
University that was to be focused on the work of Martha Graham had
hoped their campus in the Allegheny Mountains of western Maryland
could be the Camp David of modern dance.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of settling the bitter war over the Graham company
and its legendary founder's contributions, the university itself
was swept up last week in the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Frostburg University abruptly eliminated all of Graham's dances
from a three-week educational retreat that began Sunday, after
Graham's legal heir, Ron Protas, demanded the dismissal of several
teachers who were scheduled to participate. His lawyer also sought
a ban on readings from any of Graham's writings on the basis that
Protas had inherited the rights to her works, including books and
letters. They also sought a ban on the discussion of the spiraling
dispute that has pitted Protas against dancers from the foundering
Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance.
</P>
<P>
   The dancers are urging other dance companies not to license
Graham's choreography from the trust that Protas controls.
</P>
<P>
   The university refused Protas' conditions and instead stripped
the retreat of Graham's name, replacing it with the muted title
``Dance Legends.'' Students will no longer perform Graham's 1934
``Panorama,'' but a work donated last week by another modern dance
pioneer, ``Harmonica Breakdown'' by Jane Dudley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has got to put their egos on a shelf and figure what
this is all about,'' said Barry Fischer, an associate professor of
dance at the university who organized the retreat and offered to
play the role of mediator.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about Graham's legacy,'' he said. ``This is about
sharing what Graham has contributed to the 20th century. This is
about healing and demonstrating her virtuosity. And this is a
horrific global arts tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The university is caught up in the crossfire over Graham's more
than 180 works, which constitute a cornerstone of modern dance. The
rights to those works belong to Protas, who earlier this year was
dismissed as artistic director of the company amid tensions with
the board of the Graham Center, the company's parent organization.
The board has temporarily suspended operations of its 500-student
school, the company and the junior troupe because of its financial
turmoil, blaming Protas for alienating donors.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, he complains that the board and company have turned him
into a scapegoat for their own mistakes, arguing that much of the
resentment toward him is based on petty envy over his rights to
Graham's works.
</P>
<P>
   Last week dancers from the company started circulating a boycott
letter, urging other companies not to license and perform Graham's
dances until Protas and the board strike a new licensing agreement
that would allow the Graham company to use her dances, something
that Protas is prohibiting.
</P>
<P>
   It was that boycott letter, university officials said, that
prompted Protas and his representatives to ask for the dismissals
of three of the retreat's dance teachers who had signed the letter:
Janet Eilber, Elizabeth Auclair and Christophe Jeannot. The trust
was not aware at the time that each of the five visiting teachers
had signed the letter, including the choreographer Pearl Lang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's personal and antagonistic,'' Fischer said.
``They told us that we cannot do the repertoire for any
performances unless these people are dismissed.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30 dancers enrolled in the retreat _ who range in age from
13 to 27 _ were initially promised that their lessons would
culminate in a campus performance of Graham's ``Panorama.'' Fischer
said the audience would have consisted largely of the family and
friends of the dancers. In addition some of the retreat's teachers
were scheduled to perform in two community events.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Quinn, the lawyer representing Protas, said that the
Martha Graham Trust had offered to let the university use the
licensed works without charge for teaching lessons. But he said the
trust took issue with allowing supporters of the boycott letter to
choreograph and perform Graham works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would we give these individuals the opportunity to
participate in any Martha Graham performance?'' Quinn asked. ``It's
unfortunate they took this tack, and they have to realize they're
responsible for these reactions. They are completely to blame for
this fallout.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that he considered the dancers' call for a licensing
boycott by other companies ``wrong, both legally and morally,'' and
said that the trust was exploring legal options. ``I'm not saying
there will be a lawsuit,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Protas, who initially asked to lecture at the dance retreat,
declined to comment, referring questions to his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week the university sent a letter to Protas' lawyer,
barring his client from attending the retreat, but as of Friday the
trust was seeking permission to send a nonparticipating observer to
monitor the classes to make sure there is no teaching of Graham.
Fischer said Protas' lawyer had also asked the university for any
videotapes of the dance classes and performances for later review,
along with a pledge that the teachers would not read any of
Graham's writings aloud to students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have all these dancers coming to teach, and they have fear
and trepidation about Ron confronting them on campus,'' Fischer
said. He added that he had tried to persuade the various factions
to use the retreat to discuss reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had offered to be a mediator, hands across the water,'' said
Fischer, who wrote his doctoral dissertation based on the early
Graham work ``Steps in the Street.'' ``I thought they could come
here to speak and start the healing. The Graham Center board was
open to that, but I got very little response from the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   With the loss of Graham's repertory, Frostburg University
scrambled to obtain the rights to other dances. Lang offered three
of hers, and other choreographers also offered theirs, Fischer
said. Then he contacted Dudley, who had danced with Graham
beginning in the 1930s and was later dispatched by her to London to
build the modern dance movement there. Dudley granted permission
for ``Harmonica Breakdown.''
</P>
<P>
   At 88, Dudley uses a wheelchair, but Fischer said that she
considered going to Frostburg with an attendant to watch the
performance. But late last week she decided that she was not well
enough to attend to show her support. So she added her name to the
list of dancers signing the boycott letter.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Bernard Kouchner, the chief of the U.N.
administration in Kosovo, has made it through a tumultuous year.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, as the province's water and power were almost
nonexistent, the West was not providing the money or personnel it
had promised and the cold was as profound and bitter as the ethnic
hatred, Kouchner was in a depression so deep that his staff thought
he might quit.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke darkly then of ``how hard it is to change the human
soul,'' of the quick fatigue of Western leaders who prosecuted the
war with Serbia over Kosovo and had no interest in hearing about
its problematic aftermath, of the impenetrability of the local
Serbs and Albanians with their tribal, feudal passions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard an Albanian joke,'' he said sadly, looking
around his dreary office, the former seat of Serbian power here.
``Do they have a sense of humor?''
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a blistering summer, Kouchner's mood has improved. A
French physician who founded Doctors Without Borders because he
became frustrated with international bureaucracy, he is now an
international bureaucrat, sometimes uneasy in his skin.
</P>
<P>
   He still goes up and down with the vagaries of this broken
province, with its ramshackle infrastructure, chaotic traffic and
lack of real law or justice. And without question, he admits, some
of those problems can be laid at his door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I'm not the perfect model of a bureaucrat and an
administrator,'' he said. ``But we have succeeded in the main
thing'' _ stopping the oppression of Kosovo's Albanians by
Belgrade, bringing them home and letting them restart their lives
in freedom.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, he said, ``I have not succeeded in human terms'' with a
traumatized population. ``They still hate one another deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, and added: ``Here I discovered hatred deeper than
anywhere in the world, more than in Cambodia or Vietnam or Bosnia.
Usually someone, a doctor or a journalist, will say, `I know
someone on the other side.' But here, no. They had no real
relationship with the other community.''
</P>
<P>
   The hatred, he suggested, can be daunting and has plunged him
and his colleagues into despair. ``Sometimes we got tired and
exhausted, and we didn't want a reward, not like that, but just a
little smile,'' he said wanly. ``I'm looking for moments of real
happiness, but you know just now I'm a bit dry.'' But he is proud
that everyone has persisted nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   As for himself, he said, ``My only real success is to set up
this administration,'' persuading Albanian and some Serbian leaders
to cooperate with foreign officials and begin to share some
executive responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   When the head of the local Serbian Orthodox Church, Bishop Kyr
Artemije, and the leaders of perhaps half of Kosovo's Serbs decided
to join as observers, ``we were very happy then,'' he said. ``We
were jumping in the air. We believed then that we were reaching the
point of no return.''
</P>
<P>
   But even those Serbs left the executive council set up by
Kouchner, only to return after securing written promises for better
security that have prompted Hashim Thaci, the Albanian former
leader of the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army, to suspend his own
participation.
</P>
<P>
   Artemije's chief aide, the Rev. Sava Janjic, said carefully:
``Kouchner has not been serious in his promises, and the efforts to
demilitarize the Kosovo Liberation Army are very inefficient. But
he is sincere, and this written document is important on its own.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Albanian politician who insisted on anonymity said
Kouchner was ``the wrong man for the job,'' which he said required
more forcefulness and less empathy. ``After a year, you still can't
talk of the rule of law,'' he said. Still, he added, ``Kouchner's
instincts are good _ he knew he had to co-opt the Albanians, that
the U.N. couldn't run the place alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Less successful, most officials and analysts here think, is
Kouchner's sometimes flighty, sometimes secretive management of the
clumsy international bureaucracy itself.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside are the 45,000 troops of the NATO-led Kosovo Force,
known here as KFOR. They are responsible to their home governments,
not to Kouchner or even to KFOR's commander. And while Kouchner was
able to convince former KFOR commander Klaus Reinhardt, a German
general, to do more to help the civilian side, they were both
rather less successful with Washington, Paris, Bonn, Rome and
London.
</P>
<P>
   The affliction known here as ``Bosnian disease'' _ with
well-armed troops unwilling to take risks that might cause any harm
to themselves _ has settled into Kosovo in earnest, say Kouchner's
aides and even some senior KFOR officers.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, some serious problems _ like the division of the
northern town of Mitrovica into Serbian and Albanian halves that
actually mark the informal partition of Kosovo _ are not going to
be solved, but simply ``managed,'' no matter how much they embolden
Belgrade or undermine the confidence of Kosovo Albanians in the
good will of their saviors.
</P>
<P>
   It was on the bridge dividing Mitrovica _ not in Paris _ that
Kouchner chose to spend his millennial New Year's Eve, offering a
hopeful toast, so far in vain, to reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will the peacekeeping troops do much to stop organized crime
or confront, in a serious fashion, organized Albanian efforts to
drive the remaining Serbs out of Kosovo and prevent the return of
those who fled, the officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery last month of some 70 tons of arms, hidden by the
former Kosovo Liberation Army and not handed over, as promised, to
the peacekeepers, took no one here by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a success,'' Kouchner said, ``not a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, senior U.N. and NATO officials say, the existence of
the arms cache was known; the timing of the discovery itself was a
message to the former Kosovo fighters, who had recently used some
of the weapons, to stop their organized attacks on Serbs and
moderate Albanian politicians.
</P>
<P>
   But few here expect the arrest of former KLA commanders who are
widely suspected of involvement in corruption or political
violence. The reaction may be volatile, officials say; troops could
be attacked and the shaky political cooperation with the Albanians
undermined.
</P>
<P>
   Is KFOR too timid? Kouchner paused and shrugged. ``Of course,''
he finally said. ``But what can we do? Everything in the
international community works by compromise.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Foreign police are also timid, and their investigations never
seem to finish. But at least now, Kouchner says, more than 3,100 of
the 4,800 international police he has been promised (even if not
the 6,000 he wanted) are here, and a Kosovo police academy is
producing graduates.
</P>
<P>
   One of Kouchner's biggest regrets is the slow arrival of the
police, which bred a culture of impunity. There have been more than
500 murders in the year since KFOR took complete control of the
province, and no one has yet been convicted.
</P>
<P>
   There are still only four international judges and prosecutors
in a province where violence and intimidation mean that neither
Serbs nor Albanians can administer justice fairly.
</P>
<P>
   What Kouchner says depresses him most is the persistence of
ethnic violence even against the innocent and the care givers. One
of his worst moments came last winter, he said, when a Serbian
obstetrician who cared for women of all races was murdered by
Albanians in Gnjilane, in the American sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a doctor!'' Kouchner exclaimed, still appalled. ``It
was the reverse of everything we did with Doctors Without
Borders.''
</P>
<P>
   While Kouchner says he has put himself alongside ``the new
victims,'' the minority Serbs, he carries with him his visits to
the mass graves of murdered Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm angry that world opinion has changed so quickly,'' he
said. ``They were aware before of the beatings and the killings of
Albanians, but now they say, `There is ethnic cleansing of the
Serbs.' But it is not the same _ it's revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   He does savor the international military intervention on moral
and humanitarian grounds. ``I don't know if we will succeed in
Kosovo,'' he said. ``But already we've won _ we stopped the
oppression of the Albanians of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner paused, lost in thought and memory. ``It was my
dream,'' he said softly. ``My grandparents died in Auschwitz,'' he
said, opening a normally closed door. ``If only the international
community was brave enough just to bomb the railways there,'' which
funneled the cattle cars to the death camp. ``But all the
opportunities were missed.''
</P>
<P>
   This, he said, is why he became involved, early on, in Biafra,
in the Nigerian civil war of 1966-70 in which perhaps 1 million
people died. And it is what drives him in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner, now 60, holds to the healing power of time. He points
to the reconciliation now of Germany and Israel, and of France and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working with Klaus Reinhardt is a good memory,'' he said. ``He
called me his twin brother.'' They both came of age in the Europe
of 1968. ``I'm a Frenchman and he's a German,'' and 50 years ago,
Kouchner said, ``no one could imagine this,'' that together they
would run Europe's biggest project after NATO's only war.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much easier to make war than peace,'' Kouchner said. ``To
make peace takes generations, a deep movement and a change of the
spirit.'' He smiled and looked away. ``It's why I sometimes want to
believe in God.''

TWO DIFFERENT FRONTS OF GROWTH IN SATELLITE RADIO INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not every day that the trailblazer of a
multibillion-dollar niche of the satellite industry is an
entrepreneur betting on the commercial potential of Africa. No
wonder Noah Samara is smiling at the irony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental difference between one person and another,
rich or poor, is access to information,'' said Samara, who was born
in Ethiopia, raised in Tanzania and educated at the University of
California at Berkeley. ``It is kind of funny that our basic
approach of profiting from providing that access is ahead of what
is happening in the developed world.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, Samara's company, the WorldSpace Corp., based in
Washington, initiated satellite radio-broadcasting service in a
region stretching from Cairo to Cape Town, providing Africa with 25
audio channels of news, music, entertainment and educational
programming.
</P>
<P>
   WorldSpace's foray into Africa was a milestone for the budding
satellite radio industry. In various regions, including North
America, the idea is that an array of high-quality radio channels
will prove more attractive to many listeners than their local radio
stations _ like the way that cable television and satellite
television changed broadcast television.
</P>
<P>
   WorldSpace's digital audio broadcast system, which depends on a
solar-powered satellite beamed into space from a launch site in
French Guiana, is a harbinger of things to come. So far, the
company has showed promise in urban areas with large expatriate
communities wanting regional news, such as Indian merchants in
Kenya or Nigerians living in other African countries.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be far from Africa, on the dashboards of automobiles
in the United States, where the development of the industry is
expected to be played out with fervor.
</P>
<P>
   In four years, satellite radio is expected to grow from
virtually nothing into a $2.4 billion global industry, according to
C.E. Unterberg Towbin, a brokerage firm that focuses on the
satellite industry. In this country, the two companies seen fueling
the growth are Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Satellite Radio, which
have received the only two licenses from the Federal Communications
Commission to offer satellite radio.
</P>
<P>
   By this time next year, both companies hope to be able to
deliver 100 audio channels throughout the United States, for a
monthly charge of about $10. The service is to be available to
either fixed or mobile locations. Test versions of the receiving
antenna are small domes only a few inches in diameter that could be
attached externally to the rear windows of automobiles. Each of the
channels will be devoted to a specific theme, like jazz or
classical or salsa music, with much of the programming produced at
Sirius' studio in New York and XM's in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Sirius went public in 1994; its shares closed at $49.25 on
Friday, more than double last fall's price. XM went public in
October and announced last week that it had completed a final round
of financing with the private placement of $235 million in
convertible stock, raising its total funds to $1.26 billion. Its
publicly traded shares, which spent last fall in the low teens,
closed Friday at $40.875.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in the companies, which include major car
manufacturers and satellite companies, are wagering that consumers
in the United States will be eager to pay for CD-quality radio in
their automobiles _ on the assumption that radio is as essential to
the car as television is to the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business model foresees us becoming profitable if we
capture just 1 percent of the market,'' said David Margolese, the
president of Sirius. ``It's premised on the idea that a lot of
people in a prosperous, large country like this one will be willing
to spend a little extra to get top-quality radio programming when
they're in traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Sirius has distribution agreements with Ford Motor,
DaimlerChrysler and BMW, while XM has an agreement with General
Motors and is in talks to form a similar agreement with the Honda
Motor Co. When Sirius successfully launched the first of three
satellites it plans to send into space, from the Baikonur
Cosmodrome site in Kazakhstan earlier this month, its shares rose
10 percent in one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a chance to buy into something that could profoundly
change the way Americans consume their music,'' said Peter J.
Eichler, the president of Aletheia Research and Management, a $150
million money management firm in Santa Monica, Calif. ``It's easy;
you just have to choose between two companies because the industry
is controlled by a duopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are obstacles to overcome before service is rolled
out by next year. Sirius needs to launch two more satellites, while
XM Satellite Radio also needs to launch both of its two planned
satellites, which it intends to do from a mobile launching site in
the Pacific Ocean _ the first later this year. Analysts say there
is about a 10 percent chance of a failure for each of the
companies' launches, and such a failure could mean delays in the
initiation of consumer service.
</P>
<P>
   There is also concern over the quality of reception, even though
both companies say that tests indicate listeners will have
virtually static-free coast-to-coast reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality should be fine, but this might depend on the
construction of some line-of-sight apparatus on the ground to
ensure seamless transmission, and that deployment could get
expensive,'' said William Kidd, who covers the satellite radio
industry for Unterberg.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what happens, analysts don't expect either company
to show a profit before 2004. In the time being, some people are
pondering the effect satellite radio will have on the conventional
radio broadcasting industry, which has not been shaken by a major
technical innovation since the introduction of the FM band. (Of
course, there is Internet radio broadcasting. But that requires a
computer and Internet access, and it may be years before wireless
versions are viable.)
</P>
<P>
   Since the rules regarding ownership of multiple radio stations
were loosened under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the
broadcast industry has been through extensive consolidation, with
large media companies like Clear Channel Communications and Viacom
acquiring small radio stations throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Two large satellite radio companies could further concentrate
power in the radio industry, critics say. ``Radio will become more
of a wasteland because satellite radio won't offer much space for
localism,'' said Robert McChesney, a mass media professor at the
University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. ``Remember the
mom-and-pop radio stations? They will all be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   With their large production studios, though, satellite radio
companies say that they could produce content unparalleled by small
radio stations. ``We can surpass radio's golden age,'' said Hugh
Panero, the president of XM. ``We'll be able to tailor content in
ways people wouldn't dream of.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these are rich-country problems. WorldSpace, which is
backed by investors from Saudi Arabia and from several African
countries, plans to expand into Asia, and then into South America,
with two additional satellites.
</P>
<P>
   With a substantially different business model from those of
Sirius and XM, WorldSpace will concentrate on providing satellite
radio service to people who are stationary, and perhaps not yet
prosperous enough to buy a car. The company hopes to make money
from advertising aimed at regions with a combined population of
more than four billion people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing,'' Samara said, ``can cross the geographic and
cultural divides like radio can.''

 &HT;    Bored no more! Game board book thrills on long rides
 &HT;    By Theresa Walsh Giarrusso
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Even though I'm not a kid, I still get bored on long
car trips. So during a recent ride to Florida, I tested out ``The
Amazing Game Board Book,'' by Shereen Gertel Rutman and illustrated
by John Clementson.
</P>
<P>
   This 36-page hardback ``book,'' published by Innovative Kids,
features more than 50 games and activities. When you unhook the
magnetic cover, you'll find a foam Chinese checker board on the
left, along with other peg board games. Underneath is a compartment
to store the pegs, an erasable felt-tip pen, magnetic checkers and
magnetic puzzle pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Flip through the colorful book on the right side and you'll
find: crosswords, a puzzle, geography games about the United
States, coded messages, brain teasers, math puzzles, labyrinths,
Dominoes, a solar system game and an erasable drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   Whew! Plenty to do for an eight-hour car ride!
</P>
<P>
   For some of the games, you need two people to play, so it's
perfect if you're stuck in the backseat with a brother or sister.
Or get the whole family involved and multiply your fun.
</P>
<P>
   Tell your parents the durable ``Amazing Game Board Book'' is
well worth the $19.99 price tag. You'll be so engaged by the book's
challenges, you'll finally stop asking ``Are we there yet?''

A STARRING ROLE FOR IBM SERVERS 
 TRIAL MAY BE SHORT FOR DVD SOFTWARE  
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who cares that most consumers wouldn't know a midrange Unix
server from a refrigerator?
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't stopped IBM from embarking on a big advertising
campaign this week to proclaim the superiority of its Unix server
computers over those made by its rival, Sun Microsystems. The
campaign will play out on television spots, Web banner ads, highway
billboards and guerrilla-style sidewalk posters. The ads began
appearing earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Departing from IBM's traditionally restrained approach to
advertising, the ads proclaim that ``It's easy to eclipse a Sun,''
then go on to offer side-by-side comparisons of IBM and Sun
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a leapfrog game and we want to seize this
opportunity,'' said Lauren Flaherty, IBM's vice president for
integrated advertising. Unix servers, machines that run the Unix
operating system and enable many users share data on a network, are
in particularly hot demand these days by Internet companies
involved in e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   What gives IBM bragging rights? The company's confidence got a
huge boost in April, when the Internet domain-name registration
company Network Solutions announced it was replacing its aging Sun
servers with IBM Unix servers. Since then, IBM has racked up
several other high-profile corporate customers at Sun's expense,
including FedEx, Budget Rent-a-Car and Credit Suisse.
</P>
<P>
   An IBM spokesman attributed the gains in part to delays in
shipments of Sun's next-generation Unix processor.
</P>
<P>
   Sun still has a big lead in the $30 billion market for Unix
servers of all sizes, and Hewlett-Packard is in second place. But
in the midrange market, where systems sell for $100,000 to $1
million, Sun is in third place behind Hewlett and IBM, according to
the market research firm IDC.
</P>
<P>
   A Sun spokeswoman said IBM routinely disregarded Hewlett's
leadership in the midrange segment and was ``mixing apples and
oranges'' in comparing the IBM machines to Sun's.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TRIAL MAY BE SHORT FOR DVD SOFTWARE
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An important Internet case _ one that pits Hollywood's right to
control access to its digital wares against consumers' rights to
fair use of copyrighted material _ is scheduled to get under way in
U.S. District Court in New York City on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves an underground computer program, DeCSS, which,
Hollywood executives say, allows users to bypass the security
system of DVD movie disks, thus paving the way to unauthorized
viewing, copying and online transmission of movies.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs are eight leading Hollywood movie studios. They
are suing Eric Corley, editor and publisher of a print and Web
publication, 2600: The Hacker Quarterly, for posting the DeCSS
software on his Web site and linking to other Web sites that post
it.
</P>
<P>
   The studios say Corley's distribution of the software violates a
federal law, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998. A
section of that law makes it illegal for anyone to offer to the
public a device intended to circumvent a technological barrie to a
copyright-protected work.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Corley, who also uses the name Emmanuel Goldstein,
have argued that DeCSS is merely a way to help fans of the Linux
operating system watch, on their computers, DVD movies they already
own.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs want the court to ban Corley from posting,
linking to or otherwise ``trafficking'' in the DeCSS code. Two
other defendants have settled with the movie studios, agreeing not
to post the software.
</P>
<P>
   The studios filed their suit in January, and so far the defense,
led by Martin Garbus, has had a difficult time. Early on, Judge
Lewis A. Kaplan sided with the movie studios and granted a
preliminary injunction barring Corley from posting the code.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Kaplan called the issues in the trial ``narrow and
well-defined.''
</P>
<P>
   Garbus conceded that it might be difficult for him to prevail at
trial. Already, he said, he is mentally preparing for an appeal. If
Kaplan continues to take a narrow view of the issues in the case,
then ``it's going to be a three-minute trial,'' Garbus said.

   PERU-INNOCENTS (Lima) _ Peruvians call the more than one
thousand people, mostly poor, who were unfairly imprisoned on
charges of terrorism or treason between 1992 and 1995 by special
antiterrorism courts, ``the innocents.'' Most have been pardoned or
absolved of any wrongdoing over the last three years; but their
lives and the lives of their families have been irreparably
tattered. Such injustice was the product of the chaos that gripped
Peru in the early 1990s, when the Shining Path, a brutal terrorist
group bent on creating a radical Maoist state, was in the final
throes of a rampage of bombings and massacres. By Clifford Krauss.

   KOSOVO-HATE (Pristina, Yugoslavia) _ Bernard Kouchner, the

Serbs and Albanians who are divided by the deepest hatred this
world-traveled man says he has ever encountered. By Steven

<P>
   MARKET-VALUE-ENERGY (Washington) _ With millions of air
conditioners humming this summer, and dire warnings of electricity
running short, a growing number of utilities are using novel
tactics to avoid blackouts and other disasters. Some are offering
cash to companies willing to reduce energy consumption at certain
hours, figuring the payments are less than the cost of providing
power at peak times. Other utilities are paying residential
customers for the right to shut off their air conditioners when
power usage is high, or to set them at higher temperatures.
Electricity has long been sold under a system under which a
kilowatt hour has a fixed price, and you can have as much as you
want until the supply runs out and there is none for anybody. But
now, utilities are pricing power the way almost everything else in
America is priced: by market value. By Matthew L. Wald.

<P>
   AUTO-PSYCHOLOGY (Detroit) _ Of all the mysteries facing auto
industry marketers in recent years, few have been so puzzling as
how families choose between minivans and sport utility vehicles. To
look at median income, by age, by occupation, by family size, by
where they live, people who buy minivans and people who buy sport
utilities look fairly similar, the auto makers' research has found.
Yet a growing body of research in the auto industry suggests that
buyers of these two kinds of vehicles are very different
psychologically. Sport utility buyers tend to be more restless,
more sybaritic, less social people who are ``self-oriented,'' to
use the auto makers' jargon, while minivan buyers tend to be more
``other-oriented'' _ more involved with family, friends and their
communities. By Keith Bradsher.
</P>
<P>
   CAMDEN-TAKEOVER (Camden, N.J.) _ This city, with a population of
83,000, has been functionally bankrupt for more than a decade, kept
afloat with cash from Trenton that now pays for 70 percent of the
municipal and public school budget. Not one residential street has
been repaved for years, and 16 percent of the city's buildings are
abandoned. So last week Gov. Christie Whitman handed the
legislature her Municipal Rehabilitation and Economic
Revitalization Act, which would strip all local power in Camden
away from the mayor, City Council and regulatory and licensing
agencies and put it all in the hands of one person, a chief
management officer appointed by the state. There have been other
takeovers of bankrupt cities and incompetent or corrupt city
administrations in recent years, but Camden's is the biggest of
them all. By Iver Peterson.

ANALYSIS: FRONT-RUNNER BUSH KEEPING TO A CONSERVATIVE CAMPAIGN
STYLE
</HEADLINE>
  By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Out on the campaign trail, Gov. George W. Bush
appears to be barely be breaking a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Town hall meetings where large audiences are free to ask
questions vanished months ago when Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the
master of spontaneity, disappeared from the presidential race. Now
audiences rarely get to ask Bush anything.
</P>
<P>
   On many days he makes no more than one or two public
appearances, and occasionally they last no more than 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's signature campaign events are small panel
discussions that more resemble seminars on social services.
Ostensibly the sessions are about new policy proposals. But Bush's
aides say they are just as much about mood, emotion and image. As
panelists tell Bush how they have overcome hardship, he responds
with emotive language, words and phrases like ``love'' or ``loving
family'' or ``willing heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The style and schedule that Bush is keeping is deliberate,
reflecting the campaign's strategic confidence that he can mold the
image he wants by creating carefully choreographed television
images in battleground states. In an era in which voters are more
and more turned off by partisanship, the events make him seem to be
governing rather than campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost as if he's running on the Rose Garden strategy,
only with the Rose Garden situated not at the White House but in a
handful of swing states across the country.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that Bush is not working hard. His days are
filled with fund-raisers, policy meetings and interviews with the
news media. He is putting the last touches on his convention
speech, and is in the final phase of choosing a running mate.
Still, Bush's style these days could not be more different from
that of his opponent, Vice President Al Gore, who is generally
running behind in the polls and has longer, more event-packed
campaign days. Gore takes question after question from larger
audiences, showing off a detailed knowledge of everything from
immigration law to the history of the Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   But while the presidential race is only now moving into the
critical convention period, Bush and his aides believe his method
of campaigning has produced good results and put him ahead in many
critical states and made him competitive in states that the
Democrats had counted on winning.
</P>
<P>
   At Bush headquarters in Austin, Texas, the governor's staff
monitors an array of polls and keeps a blue and red color-coded
electoral map that shows which way each state is leaning. Bush's
aides right now have a panorama showing Bush leading in states with
345 electoral college votes, Gore leading in states with 92
electoral votes and 101 votes up for grabs. A candidate needs 270
votes to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is I'm leading some of the polls,'' Bush told
state Republican officials gathered in Austin last week. ``The bad
news is the election isn't tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   So confident are the Republicans that after running about $5
million in ads promoting Bush's Social Security proposals, they sat
back and let the Democrats spend about $14 million on commercials
in key states promoting Gore and Democratic issues, without
responding. ``The race stayed the same,'' said one Bush adviser.
The GOP is now readying a new ad campaign to lead into the
Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides attribute the state of the presidential race partly
to a series of missteps by Gore over a rocky spring. But they also
point to Bush's turn to a policy-oriented campaign style right
after the Republican primaries ended, when he needed to erase the
bitterness of his fight with McCain and soften the hard
conservative edges he had created for himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor says he knew from the start that he wanted to
campaign in this softer style, much as he did in his first
governor's race in Texas in 1994. At that time he stuck to four
issues with relentless repetition: juvenile crime, welfare
overhaul, education and an overhaul of the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candidates tend to repeat the successes of the past,'' Bush
said. ``I found that ideas do drive campaigns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is still using the same phrases that he did more than a
year ago, that he is a ``compassionate conservative,'' that he
wants to fight the ``soft bigotry of low expectations'' for
minority students in public schools, that he wants to rally ``the
armies of compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he does not get bored by the repetition. ``I view it as
an opportunity,'' he says. ``What a good candidate has to
understand is every minute is an opportunity to convey a message.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has used policy proposals to give himself and his themes
more definition, showing how he is a traditional Republican and how
he is not.
</P>
<P>
   The groundwork for the policy offensive was set more than a year
ago when Bush named three senior advisers: Lawrence Lindsey for
economic policy, Stephen Goldsmith for domestic policy and
Condoleezza Rice for international affairs. He also assembled a
large think tank inside his campaign under the leadership of Josh
Bolten, who had worked in the administration of Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   But the final plan for a spring of policy proposals leading into
the convention was put together by campaign staff at a country club
retreat just as the Republican primaries were coming to a close in
early March.
</P>
<P>
   The first speeches on education and health care and the
environment put Bush squarely on Democratic turf with reading
programs for the inner city and tax credits to help people who lack
health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Then came broad proposals to reshape Social Security and rethink
nuclear policy. They skipped all of the devilish details. But
Bush's aides say they showed voters that Bush was willing to take
risks and challenge the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Bush seems to be unveiling policies for every line item
of the federal budget _ an additional $75 million across five years
for veterans mentoring, or $400 million for after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem small, but aides say that Bush is using these ideas
to shape his own image. In an election year in which no issue is
dominating, a Bush adviser said, ``Issues are important but they
are important as reflections of broader values and keys into a
candidate's leadership.'' He said, ``The independent swing voters
are not taking their stands on individual issues but their feelings
about what values the candidate reflects.''

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And the campaign is making strategic decisions about where and
how often to appear to talk to those swing voters. ``Why not three
or four events in the same media market?'' Bush said on his
campaign plane last week. ``We're trying to have a consistent
message.'' He added, ``There's no need to be stepping on my own
lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally the technique works and in swing state after swing
state, evening news programs usually show Bush surrounded by
winsome minority children or troubled teen-agers or
poor-but-determined single mothers talking of hopes for building a
better life. Only rarely is the script interrupted the way it was
on Friday in New Jersey when a minister challenged Bush about the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamics of the presidential race could well change by the
fall. Gore's aides say that a vice president traditionally does not
come out from under the shadow of the president until his party's
nominating convention. And they argue that the public still favors
Democratic positions on issues, that Gore is better under pressure
and that he will shine when the two candidates meet in debates.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Bush has had the Republican Party solidified behind
him since the Republican primaries ended. His aides say they expect
that Gore will unify his own base and that will cause the race to
tighten after the Democratic National Convention in August. The
governor promised Sunday that he will not lie back and let Gore
criticize his positions and his Texas record. ``I'm a good
counterpuncher,'' he said in an appearance on the ABC program
``This Week.'' ``I am.''

 &HT;    Sleazy `Big Brother' makes `Survivor' look like a class act
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Big Brother,'' meet your daddy. His name is Jerry
Springer.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS series _ which has experienced ratings mood swings as
volatile as some of the people it has trapped in a house _ is
looking more and more like Springer's much-maligned creep show.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, we've been treated to Jordan the stripper sobbing in
the bathroom and Karen and Tom's troubled marriage melting down.
America, are you having fun yet?
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that with ``Survivor,'' the other CBS series that's
been heating up the summer. To many, the two shows, ``Big Brother''
and ``Survivor,'' have been crammed under the same umbrella of
Voyeur-Vision TV _ two European imports that basically say it's OK
to be Peeping Toms so long as we pretend we're analyzing
psychological dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   As they've played out, though, the shows have diverged
considerably. ``Survivor'' seems more like grown-ups at summer
camp. Sure, they had to eat a little roasted rat, but basically
they've bonded, played games, worked on their tans and _ in the
case of Colleen and Greg _ gotten a little summer lovin'. Even with
Richard's shark-like strategizing and Susan's bite-me commentaries,
the folks on Pulau Tiga seem to be having a blast.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the competitive nature of ``Survivor,'' there is a
joyousness to the show. That could explain why its Nielsen ratings
started strong, took off like a bottle rocket and now have settled
at about 25 million viewers a week, a staggering number for the
summer doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Los Angeles, ``Big Brother'' seems increasingly
degrading. Thursday's hourlong show was where the series' inner
Springer really came out. Karen, a wife and mother of four from
Columbus, Ind., previously had trashed her husband and her marriage
on the show. In case you missed it, CBS replayed her comments.
Then, just as Springer always keeps the aggrieved partner offstage,
waiting to come on, they cut to an interview with Tom, her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't want to discuss such things publicly,'' he
said, but of course he did, while 11 million people watched. (The
ratings, which had been diving, rebounded on Thursday as ``Big
Brother'' won its time slot; the series looks as if it will swing
wildly in the Nielsens for the rest of its three-month run.)
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that Tom and Karen have children who also are
watching, as are the kids' friends. ``Big Brother'' may not have
the ``Springer'' trademark catfights (yet), but we're being served
the same basic dish: the sad, sordid details of someone's life,
with no nutritional value whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   Also like ``Springer,'' ``Big Brother'' likes to pretend it's
higher-minded than it is. Host Julie Chen, who works for CBS News,
interviews loved ones and analysts. On Thursday, Dr. Drew Pinsky of
MTV's ``Loveline'' noted that Jamie, the beauty queen, had put on
her application that she felt rejected by her parents, so voting to
eject housemates would be difficult for her. Apparently, if you
don't bare enough, ``Big Brother'' will bare it for you.
</P>
<P>
   (Chen, by the way, is having a terrible time of it; she keeps
knocking off her journalist's hat with her cheerleader pompoms.)
</P>
<P>
   Now ``Big Brother'' is poised to boot one of its two most
interesting characters. The housemates have nominated Jordan the
stripper and William the black guy (who's either confrontational or
keepin' it real, depending on where you sit), and viewers call
1-900-740-1000 (99 cents a call) to vote on which one goes next
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny. When ``Survivor'' debuted, it was compared to ``Lord
of the Flies.'' But it has been ``Big Brother'' that's stripping
its participants (and not just Jordan) of their dignity.

   HANDICAPPING `SURVIVOR' ON THE WEB
</P>
<P>
   Can't wait for Wednesday's ``Survivor'' to see who gets the
boot? Then sample www.survivorsucks.com, a Web site that has
correctly predicted the last four castaway castoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Operated by Planet Sucks, the site is dedicated to those who
hate the show. Operators agonized before making last week's
prediction that Gretchen _ rumored to be the ultimate survivor and
million-dollar prize-winner _ would douse her torch. But they were
right.
</P>
<P>
   Site operators credit ``our spies,'' ``our eyes'' (images from
show teasers), ``credible insiders,'' message board speculation and
other media.
</P>
<P>
   Check the site Tuesday for this week's guess.

EBONY ENDS PUBLICATION IN SOUTH AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
  By HENRI E. CAUVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ The South African edition of Ebony
magazine, introduced nearly five years ago in the afterglow of the
country's triumph over apartheid, has shut down after failing to
find profits or many readers.
</P>
<P>
   On newsstands around the country, a few left-over copies of last
month's issue are all that remains of Ebony South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Leaping aboard the post-apartheid bandwagon, Ebony's American
publisher, Johnson Publishing, had hoped to bring an institution of
African-American culture to the coffee tables of South Africa, a
country with enormous economic promise but still wrestling with the
legacy of white domination and the struggle for black equality.
</P>
<P>
   But prosperity has been slower than expected in reaching the
black majority. For Ebony South Africa, that meant a retail market
with still too little interest in advertising to black consumers
and a magazine industry with little room for a publication
celebrating a level of success that few black people here can yet
conceive, let alone achieve.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, blacks number about 34.6 million out of a total
population of 44.7 million, according to the University of South
Africa's mid-year estimate. But millions of them are unemployed and
the majority of them are poor, a problem that has worsened in
recent years as job losses in government and industry have
increased.
</P>
<P>
   Circulation peaked at 23,880 during the first half of 1999
before dropping to 22,477 during the second half of the year,
according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Even at its highest circulation, the magazine never pulled in
enough advertising, said Christopher D. Benson, a vice president of
Johnson Publishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't see that it was going to improve, and we just had to
make the hard decision,'' Benson said in a telephone interview from
Chicago. ``I think it's a function of the commitment that we had to
the project that we held on as long as we did in the face of
mounting losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, according to some industry observers here, the
magazine never quite found the necessary balance of American and
African content.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they were turning out was more of an American Ebony with
a touch of South Africa rather than a South African Ebony with a
touch of America,'' said Fraser Mtshali, the editor in chief of
Bona. Based in Durban, Bona is aimed at black readers and is the
nation's best-selling lifestyle magazine. ``They were seeing South
Africa through American eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebony South Africa's final cover story, on the soccer star Lucas
Radebe, was a revealing example, Mtshali said. Despite his
popularity, Radebe is old news, Mtshali said, and without some
tantalizing new tale about the well-known athlete, there was little
to attract the average South African reader.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the last issue of Ebony South Africa were stories about
the American singer Toni Braxton, the American jazz great Louis
Armstrong and American athletes running into trouble with the law.
There was also a feature on Nelson Mandela and his wife, short
profiles of South African musical greats and a mix of health and
romance items.
</P>
<P>
   Benson, the Johnson Publishing executive, said Ebony South
Africa, which had a local staff directed by an American editor and
took some of its articles from the American edition, tried to
capture the interests and nuances of the South African audience.
``We were constantly evaluating it, through readership surveys, to
find out what readers were looking for,'' he said. ``I think the
magazine reflected that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bona, which is published in English as well as in three
indigenous languages, is looking for the same successful,
free-spending black people in their late 20s and early 30s that
Ebony South Africa was aimed at. But Mtshali said his magazine also
tried to embrace younger and older readers as well.
</P>
<P>
   The cover of the July issue of Bona advertises stories on
``Soccer's New Heroes,'' a ``Wake-up Call From God'' for a South
African singer and a ``Baby That Took Five Years to Be Born.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our market is broader,'' Mtshali said. ``We're more family
oriented.'' And yet, even Bona, which has been around for more than
four decades, has watched its circulation fall to just under
178,000 during the second half of last year, compared with 271,230
four years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy growing only modestly here, the media sector is
struggling to hold onto what share of the market it already has.
</P>
<P>
   Tribute, a 13-year-old glossy that aims for the same affluent
audience that Ebony South Africa was going for, has seen its
circulation drop from just over 16,000 in 1994 to slightly more
than 10,000 during the second half of last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's been the kind of black aspirational
success that had been hoped, and that has to have had an effect on
publishing,'' said Kerry Swift, who in the late 1970s was an
executive editor of Drum, a magazine that made its name as the
literary conscience of the struggle against apartheid.
Subsequently, Drum became a more conventional lifestyle magazine
that now has a weekly circulation of about 137,000 _ down several
thousand from its heyday 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market really hurts,'' said Swift, who is now a director
for Core Media Holdings, a South African company that publishes the
local editions of publications like PC, an American computer
magazine owned by Ziff-Davis. ``But I think there are much deeper
cultural factors at work, too.''

UTILITIES LOOK FOR SMARTER WAYS TO GET POWER TO THE PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>

 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With millions of air-conditioners humming this
summer, and dire warnings of electricity running short at hours of
peak demand, a growing number of utilities say there is plenty of
power around if only they can allocate it properly.
</P>
<P>
   These utilities are using some decidedly novel tactics _
particularly new methods of pricing energy _ to do so. In the
process, they are inducing companies and individual consumers to
change how they use electricity and think harder about how much
power they really need at different times.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin Electric Power is one of the utilities with a new
approach to pricing power. The company usually has no trouble
meeting demand when temperatures rise in the summer. But in the
second week of May, usually the slack season for power use, between
the winter and summer peaks, the utility had closed many generating
stations for maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   So when the temperature in Milwaukee hit an unseasonable 90
degrees, Wisconsin Electric saw a power shortage looming. One
possibility was buying electricity from another company on the open
market, but because other utilities were also caught short, that
would have cost 10 to 20 times the usual price.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the utility called one of its biggest customers, the
Cleveland Cliffs iron ore mine, in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. How
would the mine feel, dispatchers asked, about taking the afternoon
off _ and being paid for it?
</P>
<P>
   At first the answer was no. But then plant managers looked at
the pile of crushed ore coming out of the milling machines, and
realized that if the machines shut down for the rest of the day, no
shipments would be delayed. After some quick negotiations, a deal
was struck: Wisconsin Electric would pay the mine $82,000 to shut
down its ore crushers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a heck of a good deal,'' said Richard A. Abdoo, the
chairman, president and chief executive of Wisconsin Electric. His
company would be paying Cleveland Cliffs about 30 cents a
kilowatt-hour not to use electricity, or about six times what
Wisconsin Electric usually charges industrial customers for a
kilowatt hour. But it was a lot cheaper than buying electricity on
the open market.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin has gotten more sophisticated since May, gathering the
beeper and fax numbers of 80 of its biggest customers. On hot
afternoons, it can alert them to log on to its Web page, where it
offers them cash _ the amount varies, much like the price of a
restaurant's lobster special _ to reduce consumption at certain
hours.
</P>
<P>
   There are no statistics on the number of utilities using new
methods to manage energy demand, but more and more companies seem
to be doing it. In Connecticut, Northeast Utilities is installing
Internet-controlled thermostats in 50 houses, which it can use to
bump air conditioner settings up by 4 degrees when it needs the
power, in exchange for a $200 payment to each homeowner for the
summer. And around the country, utilities are installing
radio-controlled switches on central air conditioners and swimming
pool pumps to turn them off at peak hours.
</P>
<P>
   For years, electricity has been sold under a system that is
worthy of the old Soviet Union: a kilowatt-hour has a fixed price,
and you can have as much as you want until it runs out; then there
isn't any for anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Schurr, vice president of Silicon Energy, which writes
software for the Internet-controlled thermostats, compared the
traditional system to an airline that keeps a flock of planes by
the gate in case a crowd suddenly wants to fly somewhere. ``We
don't have a reservation system,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Not troubling customers with the fluctuations of price worked
fairly well under the old regulated system. A kilowatt-hour, which
the utility typically sold for 8 to 10 cents, often cost 2 cents
but hardly ever more than 12. Now, electricity is often bought and
sold wholesale, with no regulation, and the cost can temporarily
soar to $6 a kilowatt-hour. Some utilities can pass those costs
through and spread them among their customers, but everyone's costs
would be much lower if customers had a choice to cut consumption
when prices became exorbitant.
</P>
<P>
   The new pricing structure, with rates varying by the hour, will
take some getting used to. ``A lot of people are going to say, I
don't want to face this,'' said Eric Hirst, a consultant on
electric industry restructuring. ``But others are going to say, I
can make money by cutting consumption here and increasing
consumption there.''
</P>
<P>
   Pricing by the hour has no impact on energy efficiency _ the
amount of work done per kilowatt-hour _ but it does improve
reliability, he said, because it will minimize power failures.
</P>
<P>
   Some utilities are reluctant to let customers know they do not
have enough power on hand to handle every contingency, preferring
to sell as much power as possible and pass along occasionally
extraordinary prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, there are not a lot of production operations that
keep a lot of inventory around these days,'' said William T.
McCormick Jr., chairman and chief executive of CMS Energy, the
parent of Consumers Power, of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   And customers can be reluctant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like to take a plant up and down if we don't have
to,'' said David L. Gardner, a spokesman for Cleveland Cliffs. But
on that day in May, it worked out that a shutdown entailed little
waste of manpower. ``It was a win-win situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland Cliffs is one of many Wisconsin Electric customers on
an ``interruptible'' contract, which allows the utility to pull the
plug in an emergency. But this wasn't an emergency, just a time
when the economics favored rewarding the mine to shut down.
</P>
<P>
   The utility has signed up 81 major customers this spring, with a
total demand of 40 megawatts (enough to power 1,000 homes), who are
prepared to bid for power interruptions. It hopes to sign up
customers using an added 30 megawatts, though it is not yet sure
how much of that will be volunteered when it needs relief.
</P>
<P>
   In a blunt, low-tech way, utilities have tried for years to cut
peaks in demand for power, which they call peak load. Potomac
Electric Power, which serves the District of Columbia and some
Maryland suburbs, has persuaded about a third of its 600,000
residential customers to join a ``kilowatchers club.'' In exchange
for a monthly credit of $9 on their bill, the utility has installed
a second electric meter for their air conditioners. It can shut off
the air conditioners by radio control for 13 minutes every
half-hour. Some customers, in exchange for a $22 monthly payment,
have meters that can shut off their appliances altogether. Last
year, peak load was 5,927 megawatts, but the kilowatchers can shave
271 megawatts if necessary. Potomac Electric typically uses the
radio control five to 10 days a year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, utilities are getting more sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of June, David and Elizabeth Yu, of Unionville,
Conn., accepted a $50 payment from their utility, Northeast
Utilities, to let Northeast replace the thermostat that runs their
air conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   Central air conditioners in houses like the Yus' _ a
16-year-old, four-bedroom Cape _ draw about 3 kilowatts; raising
the thermostat 4 degrees cuts the number of minutes they run each
hour by about 30 percent, said Michael W. Townsley, a Northeast
manager who oversees conservation. If the family had the thermostat
set at 74, for example, the utility could re-set it to 78.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the year, the power saved is not worth much; if the air
conditioner ran for an hour, Northeast would charge the Yus less
than 15 cents. But now that Northeast buys its electricity on the
open market at peak hours, the price can change fast. Hence the
value of fiddling with the Yus' thermostat from a central office.
</P>
<P>
   ``When supply and demand are very tight, you're going to see
tremendous swings,'' Townsley said. ``In the morning the price
might be down around 2 cents, later, $1 a kilowatt-hour. What that
says is, there are some potential economic opportunities there.''
</P>
<P>
   Many companies offer radio-controlled switches that will turn
off an air conditioner or a pool pump. But the thermostat,
developed with the Carrier Corp., has a more subtle impact on the
household.
</P>
<P>
   The Yus' new thermostat calls in four times a day for
instructions. If the family lets the utility control the
temperature, Northeast will pay them another $150 on Oct. 1. But if
Elizabeth Yu finds the house uncomfortably warm, she can override
the setting. Each time she does so, though, Northeast will deduct
$15 from that bounty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The financial incentive is not that much,'' David Yu said.
``It'll just get absorbed into the budget.'' But, being a
gadget-lover, he is attracted by the device itself.
</P>
<P>
   David Yu is at work during the hours that Northeast is most
likely to adjust their thermostat. But Elizabeth Yu, who is at home
with the couple's three children, said, ``It'll be interesting to
see how it changes our lives during the peak hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all utilities, Northeast already has precise historical
data on how much power customers will demand at any given level of
temperature and humidity; now it wants to know what that demand
curve looks like when price is a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our interest is primarily reliability, when supply and demand
tend to be outside of equilibrium,'' Townsley said. ``But that's
also at the time when the economics come in.''

MINIVANS AND SUVS APPEAL TO DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES 
</HEADLINE>

or 888-346-9867.) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Of all the mysteries facing automakers in recent
years, few have been as engrossing as the way families choose
between minivans and sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   In median income, age, occupation, family size, and place of
residence, people who buy minivans and those who buy sport
utilities look fairly similar, the automakers' research has found.
</P>
<P>
   The typical minivan or sport utility buyers are fairly affluent
married couples in their 40s with children. And while minivans are
sometimes labeled ``mom-mobiles,'' the principal drivers of
minivans, as of sport utility vehicles, are a little more likely to
be men than women.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a growing body of research by automakers is finding that
buyers of these two kinds of vehicles are very different
psychologically. Sport utility buyers tend to be more restless,
more sybaritic, less social people who are ``self-oriented,'' to
use the automakers' words, and who have strong conscious or
subconscious fears of crime. Minivan buyers tend to be more
self-confident and more ``other-oriented'' _ more involved with
family, friends and communities.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers have spent lavishly over the last several years to
examine these customers' deeper urges. The automakers find the
research persuasive enough that it is affecting the way automobiles
are designed and advertised.
</P>
<P>
   While the psychological research is closely guarded by the
automakers, executives are willing to discuss some details. For
example, minivan buyers tend to be more comfortable than sport
utility buyers with being married; sport utility buyers are more
commonly concerned with still feeling sexy, and they like the idea
that they could use their vehicles to start dating again, said
David P. Bostwick, DaimlerChrysler's director of market research.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a basic resistance in our society to admitting that we
are parents, and no longer able to go out and find another mate,''
Bostwick said. ``If you have a sport utility, you can have the
smoked windows, put the children in the back and pretend you're
still single.''
</P>
<P>
   Minivan buyers also are less likely than sport utility buyers to
have reservations about being parents. ``Sport utility people say,
`I already have two kids, I don't need 20,''' Bostwick said. ``Then
we talk to the people who have minivans and they say, `I don't have
two kids, I have 20 _ all the kids in the neighborhood.'''
</P>
<P>
   Such psychological factors play a bigger role in the dividing
line between minivan and sport utility customers than in the
division between any other segments of the auto market, he added.
</P>

   Since last autumn, General Motors has held seminars with
customers, some lasting as long as two days, and reached many of
the same conclusions as DaimlerChrysler, said Fred J. Schaafsma, a
top GM vehicle development engineer. Both groups of buyers say they
want to be ``in control'' in a vehicle, yet mean completely
different things by this, the research found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minivan people want to be in control in terms of safety, being
able to park and maneuver in traffic, being able to get elderly
people in and out,'' Schaafsma said. ``SUV owners want to be more
like `I'm in control of the people around me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   This is an important reason why seats are mounted higher in
sport utilities than in minivans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sport utility buyers are much more concerned with their
vehicles' external appearance, while minivan buyers are more
interested in the vehicles' interiors and practicality, said Thomas
Elliott, Honda's executive vice president for North American auto
operations. ``The people who buy SUVs are in many cases buying the
outside first and then the inside,'' he said. ``They are buying the
image of the SUV first, and then the functionality.''
</P>
<P>
   Strategic Vision, a market research company in San Diego that
does a lot of work for the auto industry, has found that a greater
percentage of minivan buyers than of sport utility buyers are
involved in their communities and families.
</P>
<P>
   Minivan buyers are more likely than buyers of any other kind of
vehicle to attend religious services and to engage in volunteer
work, while sport utility buyers rank with pickup truck buyers and
sports car buyers as the least likely to do either, the company
found in a survey this spring of 19,600 recent buyers, including
5,400 minivan and sport utility buyers.
</P>
<P>
   A greater percentage of sport utility buyers dine at fine
restaurants, go to nightclubs and sporting events, and work out.
</P>
<P>
   Auto Pacific Inc., an auto market research company in Santa Ana,
Calif., found in another large survey this spring that sport
utility buyers placed a lower value than minivan buyers on showing
courtesy on the road. Sport utility buyers were more likely to
agree with the statement ``I'm a great driver'' and to say that
they drove faster than the average motorist.
</P>
<P>
   Bostwick said that while some sport utility buyers mention that
the vehicles' sturdy appearance looks safe to them, safety during
traffic accidents tends not to be the reason they buy a vehicle.
``It's not safety as the issue; it's aggressiveness, it's the
ability to go off the road,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sport utility occupants and car drivers have similar death rates
in crashes, while minivans have slightly lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's research on buyer psychology has already
influenced the designs of minivans and sport utilities.
DaimlerChrysler has chosen high-riding designs even for the
two-wheel-drive versions of its sport utilities, even though they
are unlikely to be driven over rough terrain and are therefore
unlikely to need to ride higher, said David C. McKinnon,
DaimlerChrysler's director of vehicle exterior design.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon said the company's highest executives had told him
repeatedly to ``get them up in the air and make them husky.''
</P>
<P>
   For the minivan, he said, the goal was an attractive interior
that would make buyers feel as if they were once again ``in the
womb.''
</P>

<P>
</P>
<P>
   The market research is also reflected in advertising. Ford
currently has television and print ads showing a dozen mothers with
their children arranged around a Windstar minivan. The ads explain
that the mothers, all Ford employees, worked together on a recent
redesign of the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, a recent television ad for the Jeep Grand Cherokee
Limited showed a driver who had to scale a pile of rocks that had
blocked the driveway to his mansion, in a scene intended to show
that a sport utility owner can overcome a threat. Similar themes
have been found in ads for the Lincoln Navigator, promoting it as
an ``Urban Assault Luxury Vehicle'' or urging customers to ``Ditch
the Joneses.''
</P>
<P>
   Bostwick of DaimlerChrysler and other auto market researchers
said they had been greatly influenced by Dr. Clotaire Rapaille, a
French-born medical anthropologist who has worked as a consultant
to DaimlerChrysler, Ford and General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Rapaille looks at the intellectual, emotional and ``reptilian,''
or instinctual, reasons that people buy consumer products. He said
sport utilities are designed to be masculine and assertive, often
with hoods that resemble those on 18-wheel trucks, vertical metal
slats across the grilles to give the appearance of a jungle cat's
teeth, and flared wheel wells and fenders that suggest bulging
muscles in a clenched jaw.
</P>
<P>
   Sport utilities are designed to appeal to Americans' deepest
fears of violence and crime, Rapaille said. People's earliest
associations with sport utilities are wartime Jeeps with machine
guns mounted on the back, he explained. Sport utilities are
``weapons'' and ``armored cars for the battlefield,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit advertising agencies have looked at buying the rights to
make television commercials from the ``Mad Max'' series of movies,
and inserting footage of sport utilities into movie scenes showing
combat in the Australian desert by bloodthirsty, leather-clad biker
gangs in masks, Rapaille said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big, powerful SUVs with a message of `Don't mess with me'
are going to be around for some time, because American culture is
not going to change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, he said, sedans and station wagons have open
grilles that look toothless. Sport utilities come in a wider range
of designs than minivans do, and the range of buyers' ages and
incomes is therefore wider for sport utility buyers. But automakers
say their psychological research confirms that the differences
between sport utility buyers and minivan buyers hold true even
among couples in their 40s with children.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively little research has been done on buyers of station
wagons, because the wagon market is only a fifth of the size of the
minivan market and a tenth of the size of the sport utility market.
Large cars are another choice for families, but they are shunned by
many middle-aged buyers as vehicles for old people. And while the
midsize car market still attracts many families, it too has been
dwindling.

RADIO WARNED OF STORM MINUTES BEFORE DEADLY TORNADO STRUCK 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta _ A tornado on Friday that hit a lakeside
trailer campground 125 miles south of here was probably so deadly
because the campers did not hear storm warnings and could not see
the storm coming, Canadian officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado at dinnertime Friday obliterated the campground with
winds of almost 200 mph. The death toll was raised to 10 Sunday
with the death of one camper who had been hospitalized. The dead
included a 2-year-old child.
</P>
<P>
   ``A trailer park like this offers absolutely no protection in
the winds of a tornado, set down in a valley where it is difficult
to see the storm approaching, and the trailers are very weak
protection,'' Dennis Dudley, an official of Environment Canada's
Calgary office, said at a news conference Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Dudley happened to be driving north from Calgary on vacation
with his family Friday evening when he spotted the threatening
weather formation and called in a warning.
</P>
<P>
   Divers searched Pine Lake on Sunday, looking for the bodies of
fishermen who may been tossed from their boats when the storm hit.
The search was complicated by low visibility. Military and police
divers also searched 60 trailers that were blown into the lake by
the storm.
</P>
<P>
   The storm injured at least half of the 300 people who were in
the private campground, sending 132 to local hospitals for
treatment, many for broken bones.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado was Canada's deadliest since July 1987, when a
tornado struck Edmonton, killing 27 people, injuring 300, and
causing $230 million in property damage. Alberta usually
experiences 16 to 20 tornadoes a year, but most are relatively
weak.
</P>
<P>
   Although a severe thunderstorm warning, with a potential for
tornados, had been issued about 40 minutes earlier, the campers
apparently had not heard the warnings on the radio, officials said
Sunday. Most were sitting down for their evening meal when the
storm suddenly roared over a hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hailstones started falling,'' Harold English, a camper, told a
local reporter. ``The wind came up and trees started breaking _
some 8 inches thick _ near our trailer. Within two minutes it was
all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Lapreirie, who was camping Friday with his wife, had
stitches on his face and his arm in a sling on Sunday. ``After this
thing hit, I jumped into my trailer as it was going by,'' he said.
``It was moving when I got in _ I knew my wife was in there. I
happened to get inside, and the next thing you know it's upside
down, around, then we hit the dirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Some campers were blown into the lake. Searchers believe that
most of them were able to swim ashore, but the search of the lake
is to continue through Monday.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived at the campground and saw the destruction,
Dudley, the environmental official, said his first thoughts were of
his father-in-law, who almost died in the 1987 Edmonton tornado.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't hit me until I saw a little girl's shoe in the
sand,'' he said. ``I wish I could turn the clocks back and tap
everyone on the shoulder and say, `Get out, leave this area, this
is not safe.'''

COMPANIES ARE SEEKING RECIPROCAL DEALS TO ATTRACT CUSTOMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before the fat lady began singing for Internet retailers in
nearly every category, the term ``customer acquisition costs''
meant little to most Web merchants. It was common to spend $100 or
more chasing down a customer, even though that person might never
buy enough in a lifetime to return the $100.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, e-tailers recognize customer acquisition numbers as
one of the vital signs they will have to monitor with the
watchfulness of an intensive care nurse if they are to survive
their brushes with fiscal mortality.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows what customer acquisition number will ultimately
work for most Internet merchants, but it is safe to say that the
figure is a lot closer to zero than the current industry level of
about $80. Fortunately, a marketing technique that is not widely
practiced in the bricks-and-mortar retail world is providing hope.
Known as reciprocal marketing, it allows companies to offer their
paying customers discounts at other online retailers. Despite
potential pitfalls, many of the merchants involved in these
programs say they have been able to attract new customers at little
expense.
</P>
<P>
   To the consumer, these efforts look a bit like chain-letter
e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Spend $40 at eToys, for instance, and get a gift certificate for
$10 at Gap.com. Spend $40 at Gap.com and get a $10 gift certificate
at ProFlowers.com. And so on. The number of Internet merchants
using reciprocal marketing is not yet large enough to link a broad
array of e-tailers together. But the increasing consolidation of
the e-tailing market and the growing popularity of the reciprocal
programs could eventually make them pervasive.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, ProFlowers.com, an online florist, will probably
expand its reciprocal marketing program to include companies other
than Gap.com, said Steven Bellach, the company's chief marketing
officer. ``These kinds of deals are the way the Internet will be
working, going forward,'' Bellach said. ``The beauty of it is that
no cash changes hands'' between the merchants, he said. ``And you
get people when their wallets are still open.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ProFlowers and Gap.com program, customers who made a
purchase of any size from ProFlowers this spring received $10 off
of any purchase at Gap.com. Customers of Gap.com who spent $40 or
more received a discount of $10 from ProFlowers. As with many other
companies engaged in such programs, ProFlowers and Gap sent
follow-up e-mails to their customers, including a coupon number for
redemption at the other site.
</P>
<P>
   ProFlowers saw the effort as a way to increase sales _ in that
case, Mother's Day sales. But the company had other uses for the
program. Because flower orders for Mother's Day typically come in
on the Friday before the holiday, and because a flood of 11th-hour
orders would cripple the delivery system, Bellach said, the company
gave the Gap.com discount only to customers who ordered from the
ProFlowers.com site in time for a delivery no later than the
Thursday before Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Bellach declined to share specifics about the number of
deliveries diverted to Thursday or before, ``but the program was
very successful for us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   E-tailers who engage in reciprocal marketing deals said choosing
a partner was the most difficult part. Merchants said they
typically searched for companies outside their category, of course,
but with well-known and highly regarded brands, with extensive
customer-service capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are trying to build as many relationships with
retailers as they can, but there's a very fine line,'' said Lloyd
Cheu, vice president for strategic planning at VitaminShoppe.com,
an online seller of health supplies, which has a reciprocal
marketing program with BarnesandNoble.com (www.bn.com). ``You have
to be very careful about how you share the customer with other
people,'' Cheu said, ``and what happens to them on that other
site.''
</P>
<P>
   Cluttering the home page of a site with discounts to a dozen
other retailers could also be risky, executives said, as customers
could begin confusing the company with an online mall. Cheu said
his site would soon be able to tailor the offers of other companies
to a customer's buying habits on his site.
</P>
<P>
   Such tailored offers will enable reciprocal marketing agreements
to become much more useful to consumers, said Carrie Johnson, an
analyst with Forrester Research, an Internet consulting firm.
``What will be neat is if you buy a book about gardening at
BarnesandNoble.com, and get a link to ProFlowers.com to buy the
kind of flowers you bought the book about,'' she said. ``At that
point, these companies will be serving a complete need, not just
dumping off the consumer to other retailers.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Rosendorf, senior vice president of BarnesandNoble.com,
said the company could not yet aim its offers with such precision.
But he said the reciprocal marketing effort, which began in
January, was evolving in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   BarnesandNoble.com actually has two separate programs _ one on
its Internet site, and one on its bookselling service on America
Online. In both cases, customers who complete their orders are
greeted with a page showing discounts available at eight Internet
merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants on the BarnesandNoble.com Web site pay nothing for the
privilege, but must deliver an agreed-upon number of their own
customers to the BarnesandNoble site. Under the AOL arrangement, by
contrast, BarnesandNoble charges participating merchants $55 for
every 1,000 customers who see the offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been an absolute grand slam home run for us,''
Rosendorf said. ``There's a waiting list of companies that want to
get on with us.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the company would begin using the pay-per-thousand
approach on its own Web site this fall.
</P>
<P>
   With a few exceptions, reciprocal marketing agreements have made
little headway among traditional retailers. One reason, executives
said, is that it would be difficult to monitor a co-marketing
program in 1,000 stores around the nation, with store managers who
might not be thrilled to take up valuable counter space with offers
from other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Online retailers say they were not eager to pursue agreements
with off-line merchants for the same reason. But at least one such
relationship, between eToys and Gap stores, has paid off. The
companies have completed two such programs since November, with the
eToys.com site featuring offers to Gap and Gap.com, and Gap.com and
Gap stores returning the favor.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, the Gap stores displayed signs in key store locations,
including the cash register. Janine Bousquette, the chief marketing
officer for eToys, said there were few problems in conducting the
program. ``One of the reasons we chose them was that they run a
high-quality, disciplined in-store operation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A Gap spokeswoman declined to comment on its co-marketing deals.
And Bousquette would not disclose statistics about the effort,
which she said tracked traffic, customer acquisition and the rate
at which visitors made purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both felt that it was a very efficient way to drive
business,'' Bousquette said.

SPORTS COLUMN: HIS NAME IS LEWIS, NOT LOUIS (OR ALI)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Even before Lennox Lewis' second-round demolition of
Frans Botha, the heavyweight champion was spreading the gospel of
his greatness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am head and shoulders above everyone else,'' Lewis told
anyone who would listen. ``In the past people like Muhammad Ali and
Joe Louis have reigned in the same way. I have served my time and I
deserve to be up there with Louis and Ali.''
</P>
<P>
   Up there, in other words, with the best heavyweight champions
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, champ, but you've rushed to judgment _ your own judgment.
Your name is Lewis, not Louis (or Ali). You're good, you're the
undisputed heavyweight champion, but you're hardly up there with
Joe Louis and Muhammad Ali just yet. Or up there with Rocky
Marciano, Jack Dempsey and Jack Johnson. Or even up there with Joe
Frazier and Larry Holmes .
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Ali began shouting, ``I am the greatest of all
times'' nearly four decades ago, it's been fashionable for boxers
to proclaim their greatness, no matter what their weight division.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Lewis is just talking the way boxers talk
now, but he doesn't have the resume to justify it. His 37-1-1
record includes a conquest of only one undisputed heavyweight
champion, Evander Holyfield, although many credit him with another
triumph over Holyfield instead of their debatable draw at Madison
Square Garden early last year.
</P>
<P>
   But other than Holyfield, who has Lewis beaten? Up to now, he's
just the best of a bad lot.
</P>
<P>
   Botha was a typical foe. Staggered by Lewis' overhand right in
the first round, the South African crumpled through the ropes when
battered by a lethal left jab-right hand-left uppercut-right hand
combination near the end of Saturday night's second round. He
crawled back into the ring but the referee, Larry O'Connell, wisely
waved his arms.
</P>
<P>
   The World Boxing Council and International Boxing Federation
champion's other title victims include such forgettable names as
Michael Grant, Zeijko Mavrovic, Shannon Briggs, Andrew Golota,
Henry Akinwande, Ray Mercer, Tommy Morrison and Oliver McCall
(reversing Lewis' only loss, a second-round knockout by McCall in
1994 in London).
</P>
<P>
   For Lewis to put himself on a pedestal next to Joe Louis and
Muhammad Ali shows that he hasn't studied the names on the dance
card of either champion, especially Ali's card. Ali stopped Sonny
Liston twice, tortured Floyd Patterson and Ernie Terrell, lost a
15-round decision to Frazier but later beat Frazier twice, and
knocked out George Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   The young Joe Louis lost to Max Schmeling, just as the young
Lennox Lewis lost to McCall, but Joe Louis later wrecked Schmeling
in a first-round knockout. Louis fought everybody and anybody on
what was known as his ``Bum of the Month'' tour. In a friendly
conversation with Louis years later, Ali teasingly asked him to
talk about that ``Bum of the Month'' tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'da been on it,'' Louis said.
</P>
<P>
   For all of Ali's dazzle, most boxing old-timers who saw both
Louis and Ali at their best believe that Louis was better with a
better punch, that if Louis and Ali had ever fought at their best,
Louis would have knocked out Ali.
</P>
<P>
   And as inconsequential as most of the names on Lennox Lewis'
dance card have been, the names aren't about to get any better.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' next opponent, in a mandatory IBF title defense, will be
the world-renowned David Tua in November, possibly in Toronto.
Lewis' promoter, Panos Eliades, also is talking about another
London title bout next year with Wladimir Klitschko, the
6-foot-7-inch Russian heavyweight who battered Monte Barrett in a
seventh-round knockout on the undercard Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   And with Eliades professing to offer Mike Tyson $30 million to
challenge Lewis, who surely would earn as much if not more, there's
too much money involved for that fight not to materialize sooner or
later _ as long as Tyson is at large. Even if he's banned in both
Britain and the United States, he'll get a license somewhere in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look on Tyson as a disease,'' Lewis said, ``and I'm the
cure.''
</P>
<P>
   After Tyson's recent 38-second knockout of Lou Savarese, he
challenged Lewis in a snarling harangue but then backtracked,
saying he wasn't ready for a title bout. He is expected to fight
Golota next but Botha, who dominated Tyson for four rounds before
Tyson's one-punch knockout early last year in Las Vegas, compared
Lewis' power with Tyson's power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyson hit me with a punch I didn't see,'' Botha said. ``Lennox
has that long reach; if he can keep Tyson on the outside, he can be
victorious.''
</P>
<P>
   But even a quick knockout of a tempestuous Tyson wouldn't put
Lennox Lewis on a pedestal next to those where Joe Louis and
Muhammad Ali are perched. He needs to do a lot more. And say a lot
less.

GORE PLANS POST-CONVENTION CRUISE TO VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ohio, Mich., Wis., Ill., Mo., Calif.)   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore plans to ply the Mississippi
River and the Great Lakes in a boat after the Democratic convention
in Los Angeles next month, campaign officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The water route will take Gore on a political showboat through
the industrial Midwest and some of the most contested states in the
November election. It is not clear where the boat tour would start,
but Gore and his floating entourage are expected to make stops in
Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to try to take advantage of the momentum _ or
``bounce'' _ that presidential candidates traditionally gain after
their conventions and a week of trumpeting their own horns without
interruption. The formula was a huge success for Bill Clinton and
Al Gore after the 1992 convention, when they hopped on a bus
together with their wives and roared across small-town America _
and secondary media markets _ where presidential candidates seldom
visit in the heat of a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Democratic convention runs from Aug. 14 though Aug.
17, putting the boat trip in one of the deadest news cycles of the
year. That means that Gore will probably not face much competition
from other news events for attention, but it also means that many
voters will be on vacation and tuned out of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers said that in any case, they expected the trip to
yield upbeat pictures of a relaxed candidate talking with real
people in the heartland. Such events can generate enormous and
generally positive local media coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides said it was unclear whether Gore's vice presidential
nominee would accompany him on the boat trip. If that person has a
connection to any of those Midwest battleground states, a joint
appearance would be likely. But Gore has remained mum on whom he
may pick or when he may announce the name.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gore camp is looking to the next several weeks as its
chance to try to catch Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in the polls.
There is talk, officials said, of Gore's announcing his vice
presidential selection in early August in an attempt to cut into
the bounce that Bush is expected to receive from the Philadelphia
convention, which starts July 31.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will try to build on the stir after his announcement of a
running mate with a pre-convention swing that takes him into Los
Angeles, but the details of that have yet to be worked out and will
depend heavily on whom he names as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign has been looking to this period as a time for
Gore to seize the attention, energize his supporters and establish
himself as his own person. Because Gore has had difficulty
establishing his own identity apart from President Clinton, the
Gore team has scheduled Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton to speak
on the convention's opening night. It then intends to devote the
remaining days to Gore and his personal biography.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Gore camp intended to get the Clintons, who are
perceived as the party's biggest celebrities, out of the way in one
fell swoop Monday night, a Gore aide said: ``The convention's
purpose is to focus on Al Gore's agenda.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine will be more plentiful across the interior Northeast as
the low pressure system that has held steady over the region
departs into the Atlantic. Afternoon thunderstorms will still occur
in a few spots, especially near the Catskill and New England
mountains. The Southeast will stay partly sunny and hot with
isolated afternoon thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   A cluster of thunderstorms will dampen the central Plains Monday
morning as a flow of sultry air intercepts a stationary front.
These storms will then march southeastward, bringing heavy rain to
eastern Kansas and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: WORD GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Weather forecasts across the Northeast this past weekend gave
considerable mention to two words: showers and thunderstorms. The
computer guidance that forecasters used to make their predictions
for the upcoming weekend had indicated that an unusually cool low
pressure system aloft would move over the region. High-altitude
chill in the summertime renders the atmosphere unstable, and thus
increases the risk for heavy thunderstorms. While portions of the
Northeast did receive copious rainfall on Saturday and Sunday, most
places actually had long stretches of rain-free weather. For those
who experienced a long rain-free period, the forecast, which called
for ``showers and thunderstorms,'' appeared to be faulty. Perhaps a
better-worded forecast would have read ``scattered showers and
thunderstorms but dry for much of the time.'' &QL;

   CONVENTION _ LOS ANGELES _ When 4,300 party delegates begin
arriving here in about two weeks for the Democratic National
Convention, they'll book their meetings with each other online with
an Internet scheduling program. From the floor of the Democratic
National Convention, they'll be able to talk the their colleagues
on the other side of the massive Staples Center with Internet
phones or by email at kiosks throughout the building. Back home,
folks can submit party platform ideas by email, and watch every
second of the convention with Web cameras connected to the party's
extensive Internet site. Democrats are touting their Aug. 14-17
convention as the most technologically advanced ever, and _ like
the Republicans _ are relying on the Internet like never before to
get their message out. ``It's really all about providing better
access for the American people,'' said convention CEO Lydia
Camarillo. But it's also about reaching out to a new breed of
potential voters that parties can't reach through CSPAN or CNN -

   ALLIANCE _ As trial lawyers across the country pour money from
the tobacco settlement into election efforts against Gov. George W.
Bush and other Republicans, Florida's leading pro-business lobby is
mounting a unique campaign to stop the tobacco-rich trial lawyers
here from unseating its allies in the state House and Senate. The
influential lobbying group, Associated Industries of Florida, isn't
relying on the state Republican Party for help. Instead, it has
created a for-profit corporation that can sidestep campaign finance
laws, raising as much money as it wants and spending as much it
wants and all in secret. (Palm Beach Post) 25

   CHOOSE-PLATES _ The ``Choose Life'' license plate campaign
signed into law by Gov. Jeb Bush last year but tied up in the
courts since December, has quietly been picked up by anti-abortion
activist groups in 35 states and passed into law in one. Randy
Harris, the Marion County Commissioner who came up with the idea
for the specialty plate in 1996, said the national media attention
focused on the protests and lawsuit surrounding the plate triggered
hundreds of calls from anti-abortion activists from around the
country and motivated dozens to launch campaigns of their own.

   HAITI-CANDIDATE _ Bonivert Claude is running for president of
Haiti. Forget that few Haitian political observers have heard of
him and that most predict Jean Bertrand Aristide will steamroll his
way back into office. And ignore that his campaign consultant, who
lives in West Palm Beach, has never been to Haiti and has never run
a candidate for office larger than state senate (of Florida). Those
potential setbacks pale in comparison with his biggest obstacle to
leading the Caribbean nation: He lives in Aventura, a Miami suburb.
So why does Claude think 6.8 million Haitians want him to lead
them? ``Haiti has been betrayed by its dictators and greed and
theft,'' he told a California audience of African expatriates.
``Given the opportunity to lead Haiti I will restore a sound
economic basis for growth.'' (Palm Beach Post) 40.

Court records show 27 people were injured in mosh pits in 1996 and
1997, when the concerts were staged. Most of the injuries appear
minor although one teenager was hospitalized with a dislocated
shoulder. We also ask, in light of 8 deaths at a recent Pearl Jam
concert in Denmark, if Coral Sky is safe for

 &HT;    Tensions Increase as Mideast Peace Talks Continue

<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. President Clinton met into the night Sunday with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, as Mideast peace talks at Camp
David lumbered through their sixth inconclusive day.
</P>
<P>
   In a reminder of the issues and passions at stake, more than
100,000 Israeli demonstrators rallied in Tel Aviv to protest
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's approach to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   And in Washington, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
warned that the Republican-led Congress would not give Clinton a
blank check to pay for pledges he might make to secure a Mideast
peace accord.

   `` I think we have to be open to look at whatever they come up
with,'' Lott said during an interview on the Fox television
network.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Lott, ``there are some items that they would ask for
that clearly I don't think the Senate would be inclined to go along
with. For instance, paying for Palestinian resettlement would be of
some concern to Senators.''
</P>
<P>
   While no hard numbers have been discussed, Clinton and his
national security aides have advised Lott and other Congressional
leaders of the likelihood that any Camp David peace agreement would
require substantial U.S. military and economic aid.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have generally agreed that something in excess of $15
billion, over some
</P>
<P>
   period of time, would be expected from the United States, along
with at least that much
</P>
<P>
   from the oil rich states near the Persian Gulf as well as U.S.
allies in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want Middle East peace,'' said Lott. ``But we'd better be
very careful with how those dollars are used.''
</P>
<P>
   After attending church services at Camp David's Evergreen Chapel
with his daughter, Chelsea, Clinton spent much of Sunday afternoon
huddling with senior Israeli and Palestinian negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart insisted that Clinton still
plans to leave Wednesday for Japan to attend the annual summit of
leaders from the Group of Eight, which takes in the world's seven
wealthiest democracies and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   While it's possible to defer Clinton's departure, the G-8
meeting has imposed something of a deadline on the Camp David
talks. The urgency, said Lockhart, has increased the tensions at
the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody understands the calendar,'' Lockhart told reporters
gathered in this town of 4,400 five miles from the Camp David
presidential retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody understands what the issues are and what the
schedule is,'' said Lockhart. ``So I think they understand that an
intense effort is needed.''
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, Clinton and Arafat were meeting one on one, in the
expectation that they would be joined by Barak later for a working
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to pound out an agreement to end 52 years of bloodshed
between Israelis and Palestinians, Barak and Arafat are focused on
the most difficult areas of dispute between them, including the
question of Palestinian statehood, territory and security, the
future of Jerusalem, Jewish settlers and the issue of Palestinian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Both face strident political opposition at home from quarters
that fear the concessions their side would be asked to make in
order to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the difficulties Barak could face selling a peace
accord back home, more than 100,000 Israelis gathered Sunday in Tel
Aviv to protest what many expect will be Israeli concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Centered in Rabin Square, the large plaza where Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin was killed in 1995 by an opponent of the
peace process, the rally was primarily organized by Jewish settlers
from the occupied areas of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Israel captured the territories in the 1967 Israeli-Arab war and
has been handing over land there to Palestinians bit by bit under
the terms of a 1993 peace accord. Many of the settlers may have to
move if Barak yields more land at Camp David, as is widely
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to influence him to change his plans,'' said
Haya Ledaber(cq), a 26-year-old resident of the Bet El settlement
in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Like other demonstrators, Ledaber fears Barak might go too far
in his efforts to grant Arafat the territory he is demanding to
build the foundations of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole country will be given away to the Arabs,'' said
Ledaber. ``The settlements will be left under the Arabs without the
protection of the army and the Jews will be pushed into the
ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak has vowed to put any peace accord directly to the Israeli
people in a public referendum, should he strike a deal with Arafat
at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 210,000 settlers in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, areas populated by more than 2. 5 million Palestinians. The
Israelis were encouraged to move there by the government in order
to stake a claim to the land. Barak vows not to move more than
50,000, though even that could face stiff resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday in the West Bank, Israeli police forced about 30 young
settlers to give up a new hilltop they had staked out without
government permission.

 &HT;    Tensions Increase as Mideast Peace Talks Continue
 &HT;    By Bob Deans and Larry Kaplow

<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. President Clinton met into the night Sunday with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, as Mideast peace talks at Camp
David lumbered through their sixth inconclusive day.
</P>
<P>
   In a reminder of the issues and passions at stake, more than
100,000 Israeli demonstrators rallied in Tel Aviv to protest
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's approach to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   And in Washington, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
warned that the Republican-led Congress would not give Clinton a
blank check to pay for pledges he might make to secure a Mideast
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   `` I think we have to be open to look at whatever they come up
with,'' Lott said during an interview on the Fox television
network.

NEW JERSEY TO TAKE OVER A FLOUNDERING TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   By IVER PETERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. _ The sewers were backed up at Seventh and Elm
streets again, and pools of scummy liquid had collected in the
collapsing gutters and rutted street in front of the Bible
Tabernacle Church.
</P>
<P>
   It stank.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Heyward Wiggins of Bible Tabernacle was there, talking
about his hopes for his stricken city, now that the state has given
up on Camden's local government and is set to begin the first city
takeover in the state's history, amounting to the imposition of a
benign but absolute dictator. It is also to be the biggest city
takeover in the United States since the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask people what they want, they would say they want
Camden to be comfortable to live in again,'' Wiggins said. ``They
would say they just want to sit on their front porch without
someone harassing them or sneaking in the back door. They want the
streets cleaned and the sewers fixed. They don't want big things.
They want little things.''
</P>
<P>
   But delivering services, little or big, is just what Camden's
city government has been unable to do. It has been functionally
bankrupt for over a decade, kept afloat with cash from Trenton,
which now pays for 70 percent of the municipal and public school
budget.
</P>
<P>
   In this city across the Delaware River from the chiseled,
historic skyline of Philadelphia, not one residential street has
been repaved for years, and 16 percent of the buildings are
abandoned. The high school dropout rate is 50, 70 or 80 percent,
depending on whom you ask, and the infant mortality rate is three
times that of the suburbs whose borders lie less than a mile from
where Wiggins stood.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 open-air drug bazaars are in operation, but there
are only 80 city police officers on duty at one time. In March,
Milton Milan became the third Camden mayor in 20 years to be
indicted on corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman toured Camden in 1996 and looked around in
despair. ``I thought to myself, `There's no way you can raise a
child here,''' she said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   So last week, Whitman handed the Legislature her Municipal
Rehabilitation and Economic Revitalization Act, which would strip
power from the mayor, City Council and regulatory and licensing
agencies in Camden and put it all in the hands of one person, a
chief management officer appointed by the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature is out of session now, but is expected to pass
the bill with minor changes when it reconvenes in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The manager would have the power to break contracts, ignore
Civil Service rules in hiring and firing, issue or revoke licenses
and direct all appointments and spending decisions. The manager's
only obligation to the public would be to consult with a
state-selected board of local citizens and to hold two public
hearings a year.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, said Ulrich H. ``Al'' Steinberg, director of the
division of local government services, is that Camden's city
government has simply ceased to function.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like quicksand,'' Steinberg said in an interview. ``You
look in the books for something and you find there's no solid
footing. There is paper and there are words, but they are empty.
There's no basis for what they say.'' These days, state agencies
bypass the city government and deal directly with a shadow
government of nonprofit social and housing groups to bring
everything from new housing to day care to health care to Camden's
83,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   There have been three other takeovers of bankrupt cities and
incompetent or corrupt city administrations in recent years, but
Camden's is the biggest of them all. Michigan took over the tiny
Detroit suburb of Ecorse in 1986; Massachusetts took over the
Boston suburb of Chelsea, population 35,000, in 1992; and Illinois
has been operating East St. Louis, population 39,000, since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Camden is mostly black and Hispanic. The idea of a white
governor like Whitman and a Republican administration in Trenton
abolishing self-government in a mostly minority city resonates in
threatening ways among city leaders. This racial disparity gave
state officials their most delicate task of alliance building
inside the city before they could let the hammer fall.
</P>
<P>
   Gwendolyn A. Faison, president of the Camden City Council and a
black woman, practically levitated out of her seat with anger when
word came, during a recent council session, that the takeover bill
had been introduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was beaten off the courthouse steps in Clinton,
North Carolina, just for asking to register to vote,'' Faison
declared. ``To register! Do they think we are going to give up the
right that my people fought for and died for?''
</P>
<P>
   But it is a measure of Camden's desperation, and of the state's
careful cultivation of local allies, that the city's grass roots
leaders, including black leaders, think exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   On June 13, two major church groups, Camden Churches Organized
for People _ a mixed group of Roman Catholic Hispanic and black
congregations _ and the all-black Concerned Black Clergy filled St.
Joseph's Cathedral with 1,500 city residents to invite the state to
take over their city.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the grass-roots support, the state agreed to a
manifesto presented by the church leaders that describes the city's
ills and lists timetables for solutions _ such as demolishing 362
condemned buildings within a year, shutting down 200 drug markets
within three years, and working to raise the graduation rate from
Camden high schools to 70 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Helen Austin was late for work the other day,
something that almost never happens. She spent the morning at the
beauty shop, crying and praying with her hairdresser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her only son was killed going to work three months ago,''
Austin said. ``She's having a very hard time. She's lost 30
pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin's eyes were still red and puffy an hour later. In her
hand she held a crushed ball of tissue and a poster announcing a
reward for the young man's killer.
</P>
<P>
   But Austin wasn't just crying for her friend. She was also
crying for her own family _ two of her grandchildren had been
killed over the years. And she was crying for her community of
South Los Angeles, which in the last several months has been
bloodied, along with many other parts of the city, by a new wave of
violence and killing, a scourge that many here thought was fading
fast into the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're starting to see the start of another epidemic,''
said Billie Weiss, executive director of the Violence Prevention
Coalition of Greater Los Angeles. ``It's starting to look like the
early '90s again.''
</P>
<P>
   In more than two dozen interviews recently with teen-agers,
middle-aged ex-gang members, mothers of murdered children, social
workers, elected officials, neighborhood advocates, police officers
and a woman whose disabled brother was shot to death the day before
the interview, people here said they were afraid and baffled by the
rise in violence and just as determined to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no quick fix,'' said Gary Honroe, who speaks to youth
groups about the perils of the streets and has buried a daughter, a
brother and a sister who were all slain in the last decade. ``But
if we don't start today, there won't be a tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of dropping crime rates across the city and the
county, there have been 266 homicides in Los Angeles so far this
year, a 30 percent increase from a year ago. About 42 percent of
the killings have been gang-related, according to the police
department. But no one knows for sure what is causing the surge,
beyond the usual suspects of drugs, gang disputes and too many
bored and desperate young men _ and women _ able to get their hands
on too many powerful weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I know is that it has got to stop,'' said a Los Angeles
City Council member, Mark Ridley-Thomas, whose district has been
hard hit by the violence. ``It seems to be coming on rather
ferociously.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridley-Thomas is pushing the City Council to allocate $5 million
in emergency money to create additional summer jobs and violence
prevention programs, which have been struggling because of lack of
money, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had as many as 13,000 summer jobs in the past,'' he
said. ``Now, it's down to 3,500.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in this booming economy, teen-agers and ex-cons like Melvin
Farmer, 43, say it is hard to find jobs in the inner city, despite
being so crucial in stopping the violence, many people here said.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer has spent nearly half of his life of gang membership and
street crime in and out of prison. The last time was three years
ago. He came out determined never to return and today is vice
president of the National Alliance for Positive Action, a
neighborhood and youth advocate group, headed by the author and
radio talk show host, Earl Ofari Hutchinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been out three years and I can't find a job because of my
record,'' Farmer said. ``I might go two or three days without
eating. There are a lot of temptations out here, but I'm never
going back to that life. It would kill my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   At one of at least three anti-violence meetings held last week
across the city, Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite
Burke said finding jobs for ex-cons should be a priority because so
many are beginning to return to the streets after years behind
bars.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days later, another anti-violence meeting was held
here, this time in the City Council chambers. As dozens of people
filed in last Thursday morning, Anthony Wingate, 46, was being
helped to his chair in front of his building in South Central Los
Angeles. Wingate was partially paralyzed 12 years ago after being
shot in a robbery, his sister, Natalie, said. He liked to sit in
the chair every morning, greeting passersby.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 9 a.m., a man walked up to Wingate's neighbor,
Clifton Adams, 24, and shot him to death. Then he turned on the
only witness in sight, the crippled man in the chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother couldn't run,'' Wingate's sister said. ``He was
handicapped. He had to be carried to the bathroom. He didn't
deserve to be killed like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, a red candle left on the stoop as a memorial to
Wingate had melted over the sidewalk like blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``That ain't his blood,'' a relative said. ``But that's some of
his brains in the grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Such stories don't faze lanky Kenneth, a 17-year-old who attends
an after-school program for troubled teen-agers called People Who
Care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always more killing when it's hot,'' Kenneth said. ``I
might get killed myself. Three days back my friend got shot in the
hip. I just know it's a possibility every time I wake up.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth is about the same age as the slain sons of the three
friends who founded Justice for Murdered Children, LaWanda Hawkins,
Vicky Lindsey and Rita Norwood. They founded the group four years
ago because they felt left out of the system and because the
killers of their children were never caught. The group tries to
pressure local police departments to investigate inner city
homicides more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are therapy groups we could have joined,'' Hawkins said.
``But we wanted something else. We wanted justice for our
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin wants justice for her friend's son. She got some tape to
put the poster up at Save Our Future, a neighborhood life-skills
and employment training center in South Los Angeles where she does
volunteer work. The center was founded by her stepdaughter,
Charlotte Austin Jordan, to honor her murdered children.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's 13-year-old daughter, Jamee, was killed in 1988, a
victim of mistaken identity. She was shot 15 times. ``That started
my crusade,'' Jordan said. In 1996, her 25-year-old son, Corey, was
shot and killed by a 41-year-old gang member. ``Corey had two
children and one on the way,'' Jordan said. ``The baby was born two
days after we buried my son.''
</P>
<P>
   The men who killed her children had been in and out prison since
they were young teen-agers. ``Nothing in prison happens to help
them change,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has a 15-year-old son who asked her, ``Am I going to die
like that, too?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't just say no,'' Jordan said. ``All I could say was
that I will do everything I can to make our community safe for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, she moved her family to the suburbs, ``so my
son could have his childhood back.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As she talked, a former gang member named Hakeem, 29, and his
brother Mookie, 14, came in. Hakeem is the same age as Jordan's son
would be if he were alive and she has practically adopted Hakeem.
He calls her Mom. His own mother was killed in a drive-by shooting
several years ago while he was locked up for a murder, committed
when he was 13.
</P>
<P>
   Mookie is dressed in baggy pants and is wearing a black bandanna
on his head. ``In order to stay out of trouble, you have to change
the way you dress,'' Jordan said to him.
</P>
<P>
   Mookie looked at the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just like my little cousin who got shot in his neck and
his back,'' Hakeem said. ``Now he's paralyzed. He's just 15.''
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem sounded angry and sad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shot and killed someone,'' he said. ``I know violence ain't
the answer. I don't want my little brother to be like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mookie likes to go swimming, but the neighborhood pool is
controlled by rival gang members. ``First we fight,'' he said.
``Then we swim.''
</P>
<P>
   When his cousin was shot by one of the boys who claim the pool,
Mookie immediately thought revenge. It is the easiest thing in the
world to get a gun in his neighborhood. But he didn't.
</P>

   MARKET-VALUE-ENERGY (Washington) _ With millions of air
conditioners humming this summer, and dire warnings of electricity
running short, a growing number of utilities are using novel
tactics to avoid blackouts and other disasters. Some are offering
cash to companies willing to reduce energy consumption at certain
hours, figuring the payments are less than the cost of providing
power at peak times. Other utilities are paying residential
customers for the right to shut off their air conditioners when
power usage is high, or to set them at higher temperatures.
Electricity has long been sold under a system under which a
kilowatt hour has a fixed price, and you can have as much as you
want until the supply runs out and there is none for anybody. But
now, utilities are pricing power the way almost everything else in
America is priced: by market value. By Matthew L. Wald.

   PERU-INNOCENTS (Lima) _ Peruvians call the more than one
thousand people, mostly poor, who were unfairly imprisoned on
charges of terrorism or treason between 1992 and 1995 by special
antiterrorism courts, ``the innocents.'' Most have been pardoned or
absolved of any wrongdoing over the last three years; but their
lives and the lives of their families have been irreparably
tattered. Such injustice was the product of the chaos that gripped
Peru in the early 1990s, when the Shining Path, a brutal terrorist
group bent on creating a radical Maoist state, was in the final
throes of a rampage of bombings and massacres. By Clifford Krauss.

   CAMDEN-TAKEOVER (Camden, N.J.) _ This city, with a population of
83,000, has been functionally bankrupt for more than a decade, kept
afloat with cash from Trenton that now pays for 70 percent of the
municipal and public school budget. Not one residential street has
been repaved for years, and 16 percent of the city's buildings are
abandoned. So last week Gov. Christie Whitman handed the
legislature her Municipal Rehabilitation and Economic
Revitalization Act, which would strip all local power in Camden
away from the mayor, City Council and regulatory and licensing
agencies and put it all in the hands of one person, a chief
management officer appointed by the state. There have been other
takeovers of bankrupt cities and incompetent or corrupt city
administrations in recent years, but Camden's is the biggest of
them all. By Iver Peterson.

   AUTO-PSYCHOLOGY (Detroit) _ Of all the mysteries facing auto
industry marketers in recent years, few have been so puzzling as
how families choose between minivans and sport utility vehicles. To
look at median income, by age, by occupation, by family size, by
where they live, people who buy minivans and people who buy sport
utilities look fairly similar, the auto makers' research has found.
Yet a growing body of research in the auto industry suggests that
buyers of these two kinds of vehicles are very different
psychologically. Sport utility buyers tend to be more restless,
more sybaritic, less social people who are ``self-oriented,'' to
use the auto makers' jargon, while minivan buyers tend to be more
``other-oriented'' _ more involved with family, friends and their
communities. By Keith Bradsher.

ANALYSIS: FRONT-RUNNER BUSH KEEPING TO A CONSERVATIVE CAMPAIGN
STYLE
</HEADLINE>
  (REMOVES 2nd ``be'' from lede)  
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Out on the campaign trail, Gov. George W. Bush
appears to be barely breaking a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Town hall meetings where large audiences are free to ask
questions vanished months ago when Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the
master of spontaneity, disappeared from the presidential race. Now
audiences rarely get to ask Bush anything.
</P>
<P>
   On many days he makes no more than one or two public
appearances, and occasionally they last no more than 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's signature campaign events are small panel
discussions that more resemble seminars on social services.
Ostensibly the sessions are about new policy proposals. But Bush's
aides say they are just as much about mood, emotion and image. As
panelists tell Bush how they have overcome hardship, he responds
with emotive language, words and phrases like ``love'' or ``loving
family'' or ``willing heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The style and schedule that Bush is keeping is deliberate,
reflecting the campaign's strategic confidence that he can mold the
image he wants by creating carefully choreographed television
images in battleground states. In an era in which voters are more
and more turned off by partisanship, the events make him seem to be
governing rather than campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost as if he's running on the Rose Garden strategy,
only with the Rose Garden situated not at the White House but in a
handful of swing states across the country.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that Bush is not working hard. His days are
filled with fund-raisers, policy meetings and interviews with the
news media. He is putting the last touches on his convention
speech, and is in the final phase of choosing a running mate.
Still, Bush's style these days could not be more different from
that of his opponent, Vice President Al Gore, who is generally
running behind in the polls and has longer, more event-packed
campaign days. Gore takes question after question from larger
audiences, showing off a detailed knowledge of everything from
immigration law to the history of the Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   But while the presidential race is only now moving into the
critical convention period, Bush and his aides believe his method
of campaigning has produced good results and put him ahead in many
critical states and made him competitive in states that the
Democrats had counted on winning.
</P>
<P>
   At Bush headquarters in Austin, Texas, the governor's staff
monitors an array of polls and keeps a blue and red color-coded
electoral map that shows which way each state is leaning. Bush's
aides right now have a panorama showing Bush leading in states with
345 electoral college votes, Gore leading in states with 92
electoral votes and 101 votes up for grabs. A candidate needs 270
votes to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is I'm leading some of the polls,'' Bush told
state Republican officials gathered in Austin last week. ``The bad
news is the election isn't tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   So confident are the Republicans that after running about $5
million in ads promoting Bush's Social Security proposals, they sat
back and let the Democrats spend about $14 million on commercials
in key states promoting Gore and Democratic issues, without
responding. ``The race stayed the same,'' said one Bush adviser.
The GOP is now readying a new ad campaign to lead into the
Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides attribute the state of the presidential race partly
to a series of missteps by Gore over a rocky spring. But they also
point to Bush's turn to a policy-oriented campaign style right
after the Republican primaries ended, when he needed to erase the
bitterness of his fight with McCain and soften the hard
conservative edges he had created for himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor says he knew from the start that he wanted to
campaign in this softer style, much as he did in his first
governor's race in Texas in 1994. At that time he stuck to four
issues with relentless repetition: juvenile crime, welfare
overhaul, education and an overhaul of the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candidates tend to repeat the successes of the past,'' Bush
said. ``I found that ideas do drive campaigns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is still using the same phrases that he did more than a
year ago, that he is a ``compassionate conservative,'' that he
wants to fight the ``soft bigotry of low expectations'' for
minority students in public schools, that he wants to rally ``the
armies of compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he does not get bored by the repetition. ``I view it as
an opportunity,'' he says. ``What a good candidate has to
understand is every minute is an opportunity to convey a message.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has used policy proposals to give himself and his themes
more definition, showing how he is a traditional Republican and how
he is not.
</P>
<P>
   The groundwork for the policy offensive was set more than a year
ago when Bush named three senior advisers: Lawrence Lindsey for
economic policy, Stephen Goldsmith for domestic policy and
Condoleezza Rice for international affairs. He also assembled a
large think tank inside his campaign under the leadership of Josh
Bolten, who had worked in the administration of Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   But the final plan for a spring of policy proposals leading into
the convention was put together by campaign staff at a country club
retreat just as the Republican primaries were coming to a close in
early March.
</P>
<P>
   The first speeches on education and health care and the
environment put Bush squarely on Democratic turf with reading
programs for the inner city and tax credits to help people who lack
health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Then came broad proposals to reshape Social Security and rethink
nuclear policy. They skipped all of the devilish details. But
Bush's aides say they showed voters that Bush was willing to take
risks and challenge the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Bush seems to be unveiling policies for every line item
of the federal budget _ an additional $75 million across five years
for veterans mentoring, or $400 million for after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem small, but aides say that Bush is using these ideas
to shape his own image. In an election year in which no issue is
dominating, a Bush adviser said, ``Issues are important but they
are important as reflections of broader values and keys into a
candidate's leadership.'' He said, ``The independent swing voters
are not taking their stands on individual issues but their feelings
about what values the candidate reflects.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And the campaign is making strategic decisions about where and
how often to appear to talk to those swing voters. ``Why not three
or four events in the same media market?'' Bush said on his
campaign plane last week. ``We're trying to have a consistent
message.'' He added, ``There's no need to be stepping on my own
lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally the technique works and in swing state after swing
state, evening news programs usually show Bush surrounded by
winsome minority children or troubled teen-agers or
poor-but-determined single mothers talking of hopes for building a
better life. Only rarely is the script interrupted the way it was
on Friday in New Jersey when a minister challenged Bush about the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamics of the presidential race could well change by the
fall. Gore's aides say that a vice president traditionally does not
come out from under the shadow of the president until his party's
nominating convention. And they argue that the public still favors
Democratic positions on issues, that Gore is better under pressure
and that he will shine when the two candidates meet in debates.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Bush has had the Republican Party solidified behind
him since the Republican primaries ended. His aides say they expect
that Gore will unify his own base and that will cause the race to
tighten after the Democratic National Convention in August. The
governor promised Sunday that he will not lie back and let Gore
criticize his positions and his Texas record. ``I'm a good
counterpuncher,'' he said in an appearance on the ABC program
``This Week.'' ``I am.''

GREEN CANDIDATE POSES CHALLENGE FOR BOULDER'S DEMOCRATIC
CONGRESSMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. _ The residents here proudly recognize themselves
as citizens of ``The Peoples Republic of Boulder,'' a smart-alecky
tip of the hat to Colorado's quirkiest metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   Here, people who own pets are not pet owners, they are pet
guardians. The city council issues proclamations on foreign policy.
Buildings have height restrictions so mountain views remain
unobstructed.
</P>
<P>
   With so many freethinkers, environmentalists and cappuccino
drinkers, all of whom are likely to be wearing Birkenstocks,
Boulder was always considered a last bastion of liberalism and the
center of a congressional district that has sent a Democrat to
Washington in every election since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the streak may be in jeopardy, and in many respects,
the challenge facing Rep. Mark Udall, who is seeking a second term,
mirrors a problem that Vice President Al Gore has encountered in
his quest for the presidency: Both could lose the election because
of a Green Party candidate siphoning off Democratic votes.
</P>
<P>
   In Gore's case, a strong showing by Ralph Nader, the consumer
advocate, who draws strong support from the left, could swing an
otherwise close presidential election to Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, the all-but-named Republican nominee. Nader is especially
popular in California, a state Gore could ill-afford to lose and
still win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But here in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, where many
Democratic voters feel the party has abandoned them in its
presidential year shift to the center, Ron Forthofer not only
expects to deny Udall re-election in a year Democrats need a shift
of only six seats to regain control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am running to win,'' he said, forecasting a result that
would make him the first Green party member to win a seat in
Congress. ``I'm concerned about Udall taking votes away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   In another district, such boasting might be dismissed as
political pipe-dreaming. But here, a steady influx of high-tech
companies has leavened the electorate in recent years, to the point
there are now more unaffiliated voters than those registered as
either Democrat or Republican. Even though President Clinton won
the district with big percentages _ 55 in 1992 and 61 in 1996 _
Udall only squeaked by in 1998 with 50 percent of the vote to 47
percent for his Republican challenger, Bob Greenlee, the Boulder
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Republican candidate will be chosen in a primary on
Aug. 14. David Baker of the Libertarian party is also running for
the seat.
</P>
<P>
   Forthofer, 56, a retired professor of biological statistics, has
never run for office before. As a longtime advocate of issues like
health care and food safety, and as one of 131 Greens running this
year for municipal, state and federal offices _ including 31 House
candidates from 13 states _ he is echoing themes that Nader has
raised, criticizing corporate welfare, military spending and the
widespread influence corporations have over Republicans and
Democrats through campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   And he is doing it on a shoestring budget. While Udall's latest
report to the Federal Election Commission show that he has raised
more than $315,000 in the first half of the year and has more than
$500,000 in the bank, Forthofer said his campaign expects to spend
no more than $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   For Udall, 49, whose father, Morris, served as an Arizona
congressman for 30 years and whose uncle, Stewart, was Secretary of
Interior under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, the challenge from
Forthofer has been jarring.
</P>
<P>
   Udall's voting record suggests that they agree on most issues,
and some time ago, he said he pursued Forthofer as an ally, to work
together and galvanize support against the Republican nominee in
the district: For now, two have declared themselves candidates _
Carolyn Cox, a retired businesswoman, and Larry Johnson a perennial
candidate. A third, Sandy Hume, the Boulder city treasurer, could
emerge as a strong write-in choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at my record,'' Udall said. ``Nobody has been better
on the issues, and I asked him to work with me and told him that in
a two-party system, a third party often elects the greater evil.
But it was to no avail.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Nader said upon accepting the Green's presidential
nomination three weeks ago, Forthofer dismissed the argument that
Greens only pave the way for Republican victories, insisting that
the time was right for all Greens to make their move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make our own way now,'' he said. ``We've been told
that for how many years, that this isn't the right time. That only
prevents us from finding out how much progress we've made. But as
long as people vote only Democrat or Republican, voices will never
be tallied, and we will never know how strong we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Udall, a tireless campaigner, said that the changing nature of
the district is forcing him to regard no challenge lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking his campaign seriously, and I take the Republicans
seriously,'' he said. ``I'm confident, but I'm not going to take
anything for granted.''

 &HT;    Faldo swings back into picture
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ A few months ago it would have seemed
foolish to mention his name before the British Open. Just forget
all the victories in majors, including a masterful title at St.
Andrews a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Nick Faldo, who went from mechanical to maniacal in the
last three years, would be fidgeting too much to hit enough good
shots this week at the Old Course.
</P>
<P>
   And now there's reason to think he might be in the mix at this
week's British Open.
</P>
<P>
   Despite how things deteriorated for Faldo on Saturday at Loch
Lomond, there's reason to believe his confidence is returning.
Consecutive back-to-back top-10 finishes haven't hurt. He finished
in a tie for seventh at the U.S. Open last month, before tying for
ninth at Lomond.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a remarkable turnaround for a golfer, who for the
past three years, wasn't certain he could order dinner error-free,
let alone handle the pressures of a major championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next five years, there are 20 majors, and I've got to
believe there's one in there for me,'' Faldo said. ``Everything's
coming back. It's getting better and I feel it's going to happen.
I've just got to be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Faldo, 43, is a work in progress, but he's not as bad
as Gary Player described last year. ``The guy can't play at all
now,'' Player said.
</P>
<P>
   The words hurt Faldo more than you might imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Faldo started the final 18 holes at Lomond a stroke off the
lead. Then he fizzled. After bogeying the first hole, he
double-bogeyed the second after driving into a gunch, hacking out,
then duffing a wedge from the fairway. That Faldo regrouped well
enough to shoot 73 and a tie for ninth became something of a mental
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how one bad putt and one bad drive can all of a
sudden change the whole atmosphere,'' said Faldo, who has won six
majors. ``It was painful, but all part of the learning curve I'm
on, and there were tons of positives to come out of the week. It
suddenly put the pressure on, but that's what I needed to see. . .
. There seems to be life in the old dog yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Say what you will about Faldo's strange personality _ he can be
either delightfully flippant or rudely cold _ he has never avoided
hard work. He hit 1,500 balls a day and swam laps during his
81-week stretch as the world's No. 1-ranked player. Last year he
finished 151st on the PGA Tour money list; 163rd the year before.
His last victory on the PGA Tour came at the 1997 Nissan Open.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has changed everything but his fingerprints. He
has a new teacher, Mitchell Spearman, and a psychologist, Kjell
Enhager, who will caddie for him this week.
</P>
<P>
   Although the British tabloids insist otherwise, Faldo says his
recent resurgence has nothing to do with a recent feud with Mark
James, the Ryder Cup vice-captain, whom Faldo wanted tossed off the
team for things revealed in his book on the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not fired up because of that,'' Faldo said. ``I'm fired up
because I've got a free run at these guys and maybe for one last
time, for however long, whether it's two months or two years, I'm
back in there and I can scare them and be considered. That's what I
want, to be considered again.''
</P>
<P>
   The low point might have been last year at Carnoustie, when
Faldo missed the cut of a British Open for the first time in his
career with rounds of 78 and 79.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no control and no plan,'' he said, ``and I was
contemplating whether a decision would have to be taken on whether
to go on playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Faldo just worked harder, trying to justify his own
goals and the commitment made by clubmaker Barney Adams, who signed
Faldo precisely as his career crumbled. Already one of golf's
better conditioned players, Faldo stepped up the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to kill myself on the treadmill at home and
secretly I've been watching Tiger and a few of the exercises he's
been doing,'' Faldo joked. ``What are they? They're secret. You've
got to peer through the curtains when he's in the guy and see which
way he does his sit-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: Georgia Tech's Matt Kuchar shot a 68 Sunday in the first
round of qualifying at Leven Links, one of four sites, and is tied
for 18th. About 10 players will make it from each site by the end
of today's second round. . . Brad Faxon is tied for third at the
Lundin qualifier on a 67. Gary Nicklaus had a 74.

ANYTHING TO SPARK A CONVERSATION

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A recent survey among members of SportsDating.com,
a Web site that tries to match boy with girl based on their
interests in athletic endeavors, tried to determine what sporting
event women preferred to go to on a first date.
</P>
<P>
   Think about this before you answer.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 men were asked what game or event they believed their
female dates would most like to attend. Obviously trying to meet
their date's desires, they figured that women's figure skating (32
percent), women's tennis (22 percent), a WNBA game (12 percent) or
women's soccer (9 percent) would do it.
</P>
<P>
   Think again.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 women polled voted 41 percent for a baseball game and
32 percent for a football game.
</P>
<P>
   Is the answer clear enough yet?
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the females responding to the survey stated that they
preferred a spot where they could converse with their date and
still follow the action,'' said Joel Benson, one of the founders of
the site. ``Baseball and football are two spectator sports where
there are enough breaks in the action to permit that.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk among yourselves.
</P>
<P>
   -With L.A.'s official entry into the XFL, might as well reveal
that the best way to inquire about actually playing for this Vince
McMahon-created league is by filling out a questionnaire on the
official Web site (www.xfl.com or go straight to
www.xfl.teamworkonline.com/playerform /).
</P>
<P>
   Be prepared to divulge such information as your nickname, Social
Security number, date of birth, high school and college experience,
medical problems, preference on special teams and the real toughie:
``Rate your true speed: Great, Good, Average, Slow.''
</P>
<P>
   That's your speed, not IQ.
</P>
<P>
   -The International Olympic Committee, U.S. Olympic Committee and
Salt Lake Olympic Committee have targeted more than 1,800
registered Internet domain names that illegally use the phrase
``Olympic'' or ``Olympiad'' or claim to represent associations with
those organizations.
</P>

UNDER A DOMED ROTUNDA, `AURAL ARCHITECTURE' FOR MUSICAL PROTOCOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One goal of the Lincoln Center Festival's Electronic
Evolution series is to demonstrate the enormous diversity of
sound-producing technologies available to composers today:
synthesizers, digital keyboards, sophisticated computer software
and whatnot.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday night's program at the Low Library Rotunda at
Columbia University, the third of five concerts, was devoted to
what could be called the original instrument of electronic music:
the tape recorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Masterpieces of 20th-Century Multichannel Tape Music,'' as the
program was called, offered six works written between 1956 and
1990, each created by cutting and splicing segments of tape. And
true to the historically accurate protocols from the early decades
of electronic music, the audience at this concert sat passively in
the darkened space listening to works played through loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   For this purpose the enormous rotunda, with its domed ceiling
and echoing stone walls, was an ideal performance space: The
audience sat in the middle of the floor encircled by speakers. The
one modern innovation was that each work was introduced with
``electronic program notes'' and accompanied by computerized visual
representations of the sounds being heard.
</P>
<P>
   The program began with one of the first acknowledged
masterpieces of electronic music, Edgard Varese's ``Poeme
Electronique'' (1958). It's interesting that composers during this
period who were most fascinated by the possibilities that the new
electronic technology offered for exploring sound were mostly those
also drawn to the 12-tone aesthetic. So, though Varese's work can
in no way be called a 12-tone composition, its montage of sounds
assiduously avoids tonal references and even regular pulse.
</P>
<P>
   What gives it shape is Varese's keen sense of aural
architecture. Also, unlike so many works that came in its wake,
long episodes of ``Poeme Electronique are strikingly quiet,
restrained and gentle.
</P>
<P>
   Karlheinz Stockhausen's ``Gesang der Juenglinge'' (``Song of the
Youths''), from 1956, combines electronically produced sounds with
the recorded fragments of boy sopranos, representing the youths in
the Book of Daniel who were thrown into a furnace by King
Nebuchadnezzar for refusing to worship an idol. And whenever a
faint, intact snippet of a sung melodic line comes through the
rustling collage of sounds, the effect is deeply touching.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Lansky's ``Night Traffic'' (1990) could not have been more
different. Lansky relishes tonality and consonance. So here the
recorded sound of whooshing cars passing by on highways is
presented against a backdrop of sustained, sweetly angelic tonal
chords. Though pretty, it sounds like some tape of New Age music
for a group meditation class.
</P>
<P>
   After a while pieces for multichannel tape recorder start to
sound alike. For all the ingenuity involved in creating strange
sounds, Jean-Baptiste Barriere's ``Chreode'' (1983) and Denis
Smalley's ``Vortex'' (1982), the next two works on this program,
just ran on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Smalley, who cares intensely about musical form, has written of
using ``attacking events'' to demarcate structural points in his
tape pieces. Such talk seems like so much technobabble. Haven't all
composers, from Bach to Little Richard, used attacking events like
downbeats and accents to indicate new phrases and musical
structure?
</P>
<P>
   At 23 minutes, Iannis Xenakis' ``Bohor'' (1962) also has a
run-on quality to it. But the fascinating sources he drew from to
create this sound montage include a Laotian mouth organ, Iraqi
bell-trimmed jewelry and Hindu chant. Somehow the waves of sound
that flow by, crackling with static and buzz, seem organic. Still,
it must be said that seeing the passing sounds represented in
intricate, multicolored, up-to-date computer imagery certainly made
the listening experience more engaging.

 &HT;    Women could suffer in British Open shadow's open
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In any other year, the U.S. Women's Open golf
tournament would be the marquee event of the week. It would have
the highest stakes, summon the most history and attract the
nation's top golf writers.
</P>
<P>
   But this year it begins on the same day as a tournament that
could knock it off the green. The British Open features the hottest
name in golf, Tiger Woods, at the place where golf was born, St.
Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things kind of conspiring against the
Women's Open on this one,'' said Dave Seanor, editorial director of
Golfweek magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Whether bumping heads with the British causes a headache for the
women's event remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's such a bad thing,'' said Atlanta's Rosie
Jones, who will be playing her 19th Women's Open this week at the
Merit Club, about 45 minutes north of Chicago. ``The British Open
is being played over in Scotland; nobody's actually going there.
They're going to be watching us. It's probably a good warmup for
watching us in the afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said she wasn't aware of the scheduling situation until
last week I think people are going to watch women's golf regardless
of if the British Open is on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   TOP GOLF WRITERS OVERSEAS
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the U.S. Golf Association, which puts on the
event, and the LPGA are taking a wait-and-see attitude. They point
out that because the Women's Open airs on NBC an hour after ABC
ends its coverage of the British, the women will have the afternoon
to themselves. Usually, the Women's Open competes against a PGA
Tour event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that it's probably not going to hurt us and could in
fact help us,'' said Rob Neal, the LPGA's vice president of
tournament business affairs. ``The British Open will finish before
we even hit the airwaves, and people will be sort of pumped up for
golf on that day.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the women still have to compete against the men for
attention in the print media. Golfweek's Seanor is sending two _
instead of the usual three _ writers to the Women's Open this year.
He'll send five to the British, with one staffer already in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how it can't have a negative effect,'' he said.
``So many of the primary golf writers will be overseas. I know they
think that with people watching the British in the morning, that
may prime them to watch the women in the afternoon, but people may
be golfed out by then, or even mowing their lawns.''
</P>
<P>
   Most golf beat writers are going to Scotland, although major
newspapers are sending staff writers to the Women's Open. The two
tournaments will vie for a finite amount of space, especially with
football training camps and the U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials
added to the mix this week, too.
</P>
<P>
   THE WOODS FACTOR
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Hamilton, the director of women's championships for the
USGA, said organizers were concerned about the low number of print
credential applications until a couple of weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our numbers are looking better, but I have a feeling in some
cases we may have lost a few people,'' Hamilton said. ``Last year
after the Women's Open, Golfweek was able to do a huge, huge
spread, along with the front cover. I doubt that we'll get that
this year. Hopefully, we'll get half of it.''
</P>
<P>
   And Hamilton allows that coverage could depend on who's leading
the British. ``If Tiger's in the lead, that could be possibly a
negative for us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The major golf magazines agree that if Woods wins, the cover is
his. But otherwise, they're making no promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Women's Open will get the same coverage it has in bygone
years,'' said Terry Galvin, editor of Golf World. ``Our big
question will be which would be the better story come Monday
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, what if Nancy Lopez wins? Or 14-year-old Naree Song
Wongluekiet, whose twin didn't qualify.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had a run-of-the-mill winner of the British Open, and
Julie Inkster, Karrie Webb or Annika Sorenstam won the Women's Open
in a much more compelling event,'' Galvin said, ``we wouldn't
hesitate to put that one on the cover.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he noted that the British Open would probably have
three or four more pages than the women.
</P>
<P>
   In Sports Illustrated, the Women's Open probably will appear
only in the Golf Plus section, which goes to one-fifth of the
magazine's readers, instead of the main magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take a back seat, no question,'' said SI managing
editor Bill Colson, who is sending most of his top golf writers and
photographers to Scotland. ``When there are two big events in the
same sport going on in the same week, one of them has to suffer.
Unless something extraordinary happens at the Women's Open, it's
going to be the one to suffer.''

WRITER OFFERS BACKING FOR SIRICA CHARGES  
 A NEW PATRON SAINT OF BOOK PUBLISHING  
 USA MUTTERS `OUCH' TO WWF'S SLAM  
 

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In January, Simon &AMP; Schuster published ``Gone: The Last Days of
The New Yorker,'' by Renata Adler, a former New Yorker critic. In
the book, Adler wrote that Judge John J. Sirica, who supervised the
Watergate trial and who died in 1992, had ties to organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had found that, contrary to what he wrote, and contrary to
his reputation as a hero, Sirica was in fact a corrupt,
incompetent, and dishonest figure, with a close connection to Sen.
Joseph McCarthy and clear ties to organized crime,'' Adler wrote on
page 125, in explaining why she declined to review the judge's
autobiography, published in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   John J. Sirica Jr., the judge's son, requested that Simon &AMP;
Schuster retract the organized crime charge. Simon &AMP; Schuster
declined. A media column and an editorial in The New York Times
raised questions about why Adler did not provide evidence
supporting the accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Adler said she would present proof at a time of her choosing. In
the August issue of Harper's magazine, which arrives on newsstands
on July 24, Adler presents her argument in a 12-page article that
is critical of The Times' coverage of the accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Adler points to the judge's career as a professional boxer and
promoter of boxing events in the 1920s, before he became an
attorney. Adler asserts that professional boxing in this country
``was at the time, and had been since at least 1903, controlled by
organized crime.'' At the time, boxing was illegal in the District
of Columbia, where Sirica was doing some of his boxing. Because
illegal boxing at the time required a large criminal network, Adler
writes, Sirica therefore knowingly had ties to organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Adler also cites the ownership by Sirica's father of a
barbershop at which the barbers sold liquor to clients during
Prohibition and suggests that Sirica, who was then serving in the
U.S. attorney's office, must have known of his father's criminal
dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Without citing a direct source, Adler writes that the police in
the barber shop's precinct were ``paid off _ and there was whatever
protection was implied'' by Sirica's service in the U.S. attorney's
office at the time. She also raises questions about why the judge,
while still a law student, formed what she described as implausibly
close friendships with powerful Washington figures like the real
estate mogul Morris Cafritz and Milton Kronheim, a liquor
distributor.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the younger Sirica said that Adler had not presented
adequate proof.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take the issue of saying that he had ties to organized crime
very seriously,'' he said. ``To me, that means someone is either a
member of the Mafia or is benefiting financially from their
endeavors. To me, this is a lot of innuendo strung together in an
effort to salvage her reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Adler could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Lapham, the editor in chief of Harper's, issued a one-line
statement: ``It is a fine essay and a fine piece of reporting.''

   A NEW PATRON SAINT OF BOOK PUBLISHING
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Time Warner Trade Publishing acquired a book proposal
by Jack Welch, the chairman of General Electric and one of the most
widely admired businessmen, for a record advance of $7.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is just the beginning of what the publisher
offered. It also promised a record-breaking marketing campaign,
capitalizing heavily on its ties to Time Warner's Internet,
broadcasting and magazine businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This goes way beyond anything that we have ever done before,''
said Laurence Kirshbaum, chairman of Time Warner Trade Publishing
and himself an avid fan of Welch. Fifteen executives spent a full
day preparing a 10-page, single-spaced marketing plan to show
Welch. About a third of it was devoted to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner plans an onslaught of online promotion, including
advertisements on America Online Inc., which is acquiring Time
Warner, but extending far beyond AOL. The Internet allows narrow
focusing of advertising, which is well suited to the modest size of
the book market, Kirshbaum said, and Time Warner knows books like
Welch's sell fast online _ Bill Gates' recent book became a best
seller on Amazon.com the day it appeared. Time Warner also plans
special promotional campaigns to sell electronic versions online
and ads on Web sites aimed at human resources managers.
</P>
<P>
   Kirshbaum has plans to take advantage of his parent company's
other media outlets, too. He envisions Welch filming a half-hour
segment in CNN's studios for broadcast over the Web and over
in-store TV networks proliferating at bookstore chains and other
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's magazine distribution sales force will help stock
copies of the book in nontraditional outlets like Home Depot, and
push for premier placement near the front of the stores. Time
Warner magazines like Fortune may also help promote Welch's book by
holding conferences and seminars featuring Welch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack Welch is our patron saint,'' Kirshbaum said confidently.

   USA MUTTERS `OUCH' TO WWF'S SLAM
</P>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Stephen Chao, the USA Cable president, just
can't get a break when it comes to the World Wrestling Federation,
which, after a prolonged court battle, won the right last month to
pull its top-rated wrestling programs from the USA network and take
them to Viacom's TNN and MTV networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I had WWF, I spent time defending the show,'' Chao said
after a meeting with reporters gathered at the Ritz-Carlton here.
``Now, I have to defend the fact that it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   That defense seems to becoming a full-time job for Chao. Ever
since USA lost the WWF, he and his fellow USA executives have been
denying that losing the franchise would have any real effect on the
network.
</P>
<P>
   Their public optimism has often seemed Orwellian. USA's WWF
editions are regularly the top-rated programs in prime time on
cable, drawing audiences upward of 7 million viewers. Monday
night's ``Raw Is War'' program is the highest-rated show in all of
cable television. No other show does nearly as well for USA, which
is the No. 1 cable network in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   The USA executives have insisted that losing WWF will not be a
problem because: a) they had a backup plan; and b) the show was not
all that valuable anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Chao revealed that back-up plan: Instead of the
immensely popular Monday night program, the cable channel will run
movies. But could they possibly draw anywhere near the same
audiences as wrestling?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, Chao admitted, but that does not matter. First of
all, he said, USA did not make a large amount of money on wrestling
because it had to split the profits with the WWF. Secondly, he
said, the audience that watches wrestling does not necessarily
watch USA's other shows, so promotional possibilities were limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really an oddball fit for us in the first place,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chao said network research showed that USA still came in first
place in prime time, even without wrestling, though its leadership
position was ``diminished.''

MEXICAN ARRESTED IN 1994 KILLING OF U.S. DRUG AGENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz.)   By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For nearly six years, Agustin Vasquez Mendoza was
the perfect fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   Sought by federal authorities in the United States and Mexico in
one of their biggest joint manhunts ever, the man suspected of
ordering the 1994 killing of an American narcotics agent vanished
into the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   He shunned cell phones and other modern communications, said
U.S. law-enforcement officials. He severed ties to relatives and
began a new family under a stolen name. He lived simply in some of
Mexico's most remote corners, shielded from the police by ruthless
neighbors, dense vegetation and terrain best managed on burro or
horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was living the life of a Mexican bandit from the last
century,'' said Michael G. Garland, the Drug Enforcement
Administration official who led U.S. efforts in Mexico to find the
killer of a Phoenix undercover agent, Richard Fass.
</P>
<P>
   The longer Vasquez eluded authorities, the more his legend grew.
He made the FBI's 10-most-wanted list. When a $250,000 reward
offered by the FBI and the drug agency failed to get results, the
State Department sweetened the pot, for a total of $2.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   On July 9, the Mexican police finally seized Vasquez and flew
him to Mexico City under the control of two generals and
machine-gun-toting guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw him, he was terrified,'' Garland said in a
telephone interview from Mexico. ``His hands and feet were
shaking.'' The prize of a manhunt that had cost millions of dollars
and tested the often bitter relations between Mexican and U.S.
law-enforcement agents was all of 5 feet 3 inches and 110 pounds.
``He looks like a teen-ager,'' Garland said.
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez, 30, is being held on charges of ordering the June 30,
1994, killing of Fass, who tried to buy 22 pounds of
methamphetamine from three associates of Vasquez in Glendale, Ariz.
The associates, all of whom have been sentenced to prison, shot
Fass seven times, including twice in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Fass, 37, was killed on what was to have been his last
undercover mission before a transfer to a desk job. In his
dangerous work, he had repeatedly changed his appearance, worn
earrings and fake tattoos, and plucked hair from his nostrils to
give himself an addict's sniffle, his brother, Guillermo, said.
</P>
<P>
   His death was ``shattering for all of us,'' Guillermo Fass said.
</P>
<P>
   For his colleagues, avenging that killing was personal, said Tom
Raffanello, the Phoenix special agent in charge. His agents asked
to be rotated into Mexico City _ two or three at a time _ to join a
team of 45 narcotics agents whose top priority was to help the
Mexican police find Vasquez, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   For the next several years, Vasquez was believed to be
continually on the run, moving among rural hideouts _ inaccessible
by car _ in mountainous Michoacan, his home state, the steamy
Campeche region, and Puebla, southeast of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   In such areas the Mexican police were often thwarted by the
locals' deep distrust of federal authorities. Vasquez encouraged
the complicity of his neighbors by taking on the last name of
Cornejo, a feared drug-trafficking family, Raffanello said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd compare it to the John Gotti people in certain areas of
Queens or Brooklyn,'' said Raffanello, who was one of the original
investigators in the slaying of another drug enforcement agent,
Enrique Camarena, in Mexico in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Based on their own leads and U.S. intelligence, Mexican
authorities arrested a dozen Vasquez look-alikes over the years. An
important break came when Vasquez married in Campeche. The
thumbprint on his marriage certificate matched a print held by the
U.S. immigration service, which had previously arrested him,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   They said Vasquez, who fancies himself a ladies' man, according
to his FBI wanted poster, was done in by the simplest of errands
for his wife, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Through telephone intercepts, authorities discovered that his
electronic silence had slipped. On Sundays he was placing regular
phone calls to the relatives of his wife, with whom he has a
2-year-old son and an 11-month-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the pay phone was not easily traced, because it had a
fixed cellular connection. U.S. agents were enlisted in the
painstaking process of homing in on it through ground surveillance
and high technology _ a ``burros and satellite'' operation, as one
official called it. Other clues were provided by the street noise
in the background as Vasquez chatted, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested while talking on the phone in Tehuacan, Puebla.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   U.S. officials praised the Mexican federal judicial police for
the arrest. The cooperation marked a bright point in a frequently
troubled relationship. Events from the Camarena killing to the 1997
arrest of Mexico's top anti-drug official have fueled suspicions in
both countries.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. agents acknowledge withholding information on the ground
that their Mexican counterparts are corrupt, and Mexican
authorities have sought to curb what they see as vigilantism and
meddling by U.S. agents beyond U.S. borders.
</P>
<P>
   Cooperation between the two nations has improved since Mexico
undertook a comprehensive overhaul of its justice system, said Jose
Antonio Zabalgoitia, a spokesman for the Mexican Embassy here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship in the law-enforcement area has become more
mature,'' he said. ``We both are aware of what is important and
sensitive to the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, one highly sensitive matter remains. The United States
has requested the extradition of Vasquez. It is gathering evidence
to submit to Mexico within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexico's courts are divided over the constitutionality of
extradition, and the Supreme Court is currently reviewing the
issue. Mexican law, moreover, bars extradition in cases of capital
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to give assurances that we will not seek the death
penalty, which we are prepared to do,'' said John Russell, a
Justice Department spokesman. Asked about the prospects for
extradition, he added, ``We are hopeful.''

A CYBERSENATOR SEARCHING FOR THE FREEDOMS OF THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Patrick J. Leahy admits it can all become a
little obsessive. When he stumbles out of bed in the morning, his
first destination is not the kitchen for a cup of coffee or the
doorstep for the morning paper. It's to turn on his home computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first thing I do before anything, I flip on the
computer,'' says the man known to his colleagues as the
cybersenator. As the computer warms up, he gets the cup of coffee.
``And then I come back with the coffee, in my pajamas, and I see
what's come in,'' Leahy says.
</P>
<P>
   What comes in? E-mails from staff members in Washington and
constituents in Vermont. Petitions from colleagues in the
international campaign to ban land mines, one of Leahy's favorite
causes. Family photographs that have been scanned into cyberspace
by his three grown children.
</P>
<P>
   He will surf the Internet for breaking news. His bookmarks on
the World Wide Web include sites for the Supreme Court (as ranking
Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, he needs to monitor the
court's rulings), The Irish Times (he has an abiding interest in
the land of his ancestors), and the music group the Grateful Dead
(www.dead.net).
</P>
<P>
   A white-haired 60-year-old grandfather and a 25-year veteran of
the Senate, Leahy is a proud Deadhead, as the cultlike followers of
the band are known. He takes pride in having introduced Jerry
Garcia, the band's founder who died in 1995, to Strom Thurmond,
R-S.C., the Senate's oldest member _ and the senator perhaps least
likely to have heard of Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy's twin passions for the Dead and for cyberspace came
together last week in a Senate hearing room, as he sat with a
laptop computer and tried to download a copy of a favorite Dead
anthem, ``Touch of Grey,'' as his colleagues on the judiciary
committee watched with amusement.
</P>
<P>
   The download from the Internet site Napster was taking a long
time. ``It went from `Touch of Grey' to `Touch of White' by the
time it downloaded,'' Leahy said, drawing laughter from a packed
audience.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was called to consider whether Congress needs to
intervene to control Napster, Gnutella, MP3 and other Internet
sites that allow music to be shared freely among millions of fans,
without copyright payments to artists and recording companies.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing's star witness was Lars Ulrich, drummer of the
heavy-metal band Metallica, who complained that his work was being
stolen off the Web. The band has sued Napster for copyright
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy doesn't know how Congress should respond to the issue. ``I
don't know what the solution will be,'' he said after the hearing,
taking a seat in the small office just off the Senate chambers that
he is granted by virtue of his seniority; it has a magnificent view
toward the Washington Monument. ``Obviously artists deserve to be
paid,'' he said. ``But our responsibility in the Congress is not to
stifle innovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not like U.S. Steel evolving over decades. This could
be a brilliant 19-year-old in a college dorm figuring out Gnutella
or some like it. You can't stop it. You couldn't stop it even if
you wanted to. What we need to do, I think, is make sure copyrights
and patent laws actually reflect the new reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Leahy draws a comparison between the arrival of Napster and its
cyberspace kin, and the advent of the videocassette recorder in the
1970s, which was initially described by the Hollywood studios as a
threat to their survival because of copyright violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you can't make a movie without figuring videos into the
whole equation,'' he said. ``Some movies that are real turkeys in
the theaters recoup their money in video.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, Leahy knows how passionately some fans
feel about their ability to grab music off the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   An e-mail campaign organized by music-sharing Internet companies
jammed his electronic mailbox in the Senate with more than 17,000
messages last week, so many that he had to shut it down
temporarily. ``I got more on this subject than I got on
impeachment,'' the senator said. ``We turned it off because I don't
want to crash the rest of my system.''
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley and the other outposts of the Internet
industry, Leahy is seen as one of the champions of cyberspace
freedom. But the senator knows that his work on the issue carries a
political cost, especially after he led opposition to the 1996
Communications Decency Act and other popular legislation designed
to block access by children to sexually explicit Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   His critics _ mostly outside Vermont, where he remains so
popular that he won the 1998 election with 72 percent of the vote _
have charged that Senator Leahy is siding with pornographers and
pedophiles.
</P>
<P>
   But he is unrepentant, especially about the Communications
Decency Act, and his opposition on the law on free-speech grounds
was vindicated in 1997 by the Supreme Court, which agreed
unanimously that the law was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy noted that as a state prosecutor in Vermont, ``I sent
child molesters to prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I yield to nobody in the Senate on the First Amendment,''
he said. ``I am not going to vote for a law that is so broadening
that you could finish up closing down just about every library.''
</P>
<P>
   The responsibility for policing the Internet, Leahy says, has to
rest largely with parents, who can purchase software that restricts
access to Internet sites that feature pornography or that promote
racism and other forms of intolerance. ``Maybe parents need to
spend some time with their kids on the computer, figuring out what
they're looking at,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean it is much fun for a politician to stand up
for the rights of those who use the Internet to distribute graphic
sexual images or messages of hate. The fight for free speech and
other freedoms on the Internet can be a lonely one, Leahy says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is in favor of the First Amendment,'' he said. ``But
we'd have a hell of a time ratifying it today.''

ALTEON PLANS TO OFFER NEW SYSTEM FOR NET 
</HEADLINE>
   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alteon Websystems, a player in a fiercely contested segment of
the Internet industry, is expected to raise the competitive heat
with the announcement Monday of new technology for managing data
traffic on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Alteon, headquartered in San Jose, Calif., will offer a system
called an integrated service director, which is designed to enable
companies conducting electronic commerce to build the efficiency
and speed of their transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Among the benefits, the company says, will be making encryption
and decryption of online transactions faster, a capability in huge
demand as e-business becomes more commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   A part of the new equipment will be the so-called Akamaizer,
which prepares content to be used on networks assembled by Akamai
Technologies of Cambridge, Mass. Akamai has a worldwide network
that allows companies to distribute material efficiently over the
Internet to farflung users.
</P>
<P>
   When yoked to other Web-switching equipment, Alteon's new
technology is expected to allow companies to process secure
transactions about 10 times faster than other systems, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
   With the announcement, the company will be stoking the
competition in an industry that pits start-ups like Alteon and
Foundry Networks against established networking companies like
Cisco Systems. In May, the industry was rocked by Cisco's $6
billion acquisition of ArrowPoint Communications, the top
competitor to four-year-old Alteon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that allows you to make your online transactions more
efficient will provide your company with the opportunity to have
sales that are greater and more varied,'' said Eric Thompson, an
analyst in the enterprise networking group at Gartner
Group/DataQuest, a research and consulting firm. ``It looks like
Alteon will breathe more energy into e-commerce transactions with
this new technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipation of the new technology, combined with favorable
forecasts on its financial performance, have also breathed life
into Alteon's stock recently. In the last month, the company's
shares have climbed more than 50 percent to close at $112 on
Friday. Alteon said last week that it would surpass analysts'
revenue and earnings expectations for its second-quarter results,
scheduled for this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet would not become what dot-com dreamers want it to
be without a company like Alteon,'' said Paul Johnson, a managing
director at Robertson, Stephens covering the networking and
telecommunications industries. ``With Alteon the type of advice I
provide is, if you own a house, sell the house and buy this
stock.''

GLOBAL CROSSING-EXODUS DEAL SAID TO COLLAPSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURA M. HOLSON and SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A deal between the telecommunications company Global Crossing
and Exodus Communications collapsed over the weekend as the two
companies failed to agree on a price, people close to the companies
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Executives for Global Crossing had been in talks in recent days
to sell its Web site-hosting unit, Global Center, to Exodus in a
stock swap valued at $7 billion. For Exodus, the transaction would
have allowed it to enlarge its leading role in the hosting
industry, in which companies provide services like security and
high-speed connections for other companies' Web sites. Recently,
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone of Japan entered the market through
its $5.5 billion acquisition of Verio Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Early last week, the two companies agreed on several issues,
including that Global and Exodus would form a joint venture in Asia
and that Global would receive about 151 million shares of Exodus
stock in exchange for Global Center, people close to the talks
said. But as shares of Exodus soared after rumors of the talks
leaked _ up 39 percent for the week _ executives for Exodus wanted
to revise the number of shares. The final offer from Exodus, said
the people close to the talks, was for $6.6 billion in stock, or
about 120 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Both boards met on Friday, and the deal was not approved.
Executives for Global Crossing, one person said, were concerned
that as quickly as Exodus' stock price had risen it could fall and
were asking for some kind of price protection if that happened.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Global Crossing will most likely proceed with plans to
sell shares of Global Center in a public offering. Global Center
filed documents last month with the Securities and Exchange
Commission to issue tracking stock in the company.
</P>
<P>
   For Global Crossing, which is based in Hamilton, Bermuda, the
possible sale of its Web site-hosting business would have
represented a departure from its earlier strategy of providing a
wide array of telecommunications services to its clients. Global
Crossing, founded in 1997, sells time on its global undersea fiber
optic network, in addition to other activities.
</P>
<P>
   According to analysts, Global Crossing could be preparing to
enter the fray of big telecommunications mergers by shifting the
focus of its operations to make itself more attractive for a
possible suitor. Large European companies like Deutsche Telekom
have shown eagerness recently to expand in the United States, where
Global Crossing is strongest.
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing reportedly entered into, and then broke off,
negotiations with Deutsche Telekom, Europe's largest telephone
company, in March. And in its own effort to expand through
acquisitions, Global Crossing tried to buy Equant NV of the
Netherlands, a deal which would have given it access to the world's
largest data network. But talks with Equant ended last month after
a series of disagreements between the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of Leo J. Hindery Jr., the chief executive
who recently joined the company, Global Crossing could also be
trying to concentrate better on the niche of providing
international data and voice services over its worldwide network.
Last week, for example, the company sold its slow-growing local
telephone unit to Citizens Communications of Stamford, Conn., in a
$3.65 billion transaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're obviously putting a new coat of paint on the house,''
said Jeffrey Kagan, an independent telecommunications analyst.
``It's another example showing that the sharks are circling the
U.S. telecom industry.''

JOHN PASTORE, PROMINENT RHODE ISLAND POLITIAN FOR THREE DECADES,
DIES AT 93 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John O. Pastore, the first Italian-American to be elected as a
governor and sit in the U.S. Senate, and a dominant figure in Rhode
Island politics for three decades, died on Saturday at a nursing
home in North Kingstown, R.I. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rhode Island is the smallest state in the union, and I am the
smallest governor in the United States,'' the 5-foot-4-inch Pastore
once told a group of German editors visiting the Statehouse in
Providence. When he went to Washington, he became the smallest
senator. But in his 26 years in the Senate, he established himself
as a formidable presence, a liberal Democrat regarded as a fierce
debater with a booming voice and a firm grasp on the issues of his
day.
</P>
<P>
   He staked out a specialty in nuclear power matters as chairman
of the powerful Joint Committee on Atomic Energy and in 1963
provided important backing for the Kennedy administration's
controversial treaty with the Soviet Union barring nuclear tests in
the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   In waging a successful fight for ratification, Pastore displayed
his flair for the dramatic. During the debate he flung open his
jacket and struck the left side of his chest. ``I say to those who
have doubts about this treaty that I want them to open their heart
and look into their consciences,'' he implored fellow senators. ``I
want them to realize what they might be doing. If by their vote
they destroy and kill the treaty, God help us! God help us!''
</P>
<P>
   His son, John Pastore Jr., a cardiologist, of Winchester, Mass.,
was secretary of the International Physicians for the Prevention of
Nuclear War when the Boston-based organization, jointly founded by
American and Soviet physicians, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize
in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Pastore, who retired from the Senate in 1976, is survived by his
wife, Elena, and son; two daughters, Francesca Pastore and Louise
Harbourt, both of Springfield, Va.; two sisters, Elena Valente of
North Providence, R.I., and Michelina Mentasti of Florida; seven
grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Pastore gained national recognition for his oratory while
serving as keynote speaker at the 1964 Democratic National
Convention, a choice that reflected President Lyndon B. Johnson's
bid for support from the industrial states of the East, but also a
tribute to his ability to rouse an audience.
</P>
<P>
   His voice rising and falling to great dramatic effect, his fists
pounding, Pastore drew roars from the more than 5,000 Democrats at
the Atlantic City Convention Hall as he denounced Sen. Barry
Goldwater, the Republican nominee, as a captive of ``reactionaries
and extremists.'' The delegates' response to Pastore's speech was
so enthusiastic that he enjoyed a brief consideration for the vice
presidential nomination that eventually went to Sen. Hubert
Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to serving as chairman of the Joint Committee on
Atomic Energy, Pastore held posts on the Commerce and
Appropriations Committees, as well as the Senate Democratic Policy
Committee, making him one of the Senate's most influential members.
</P>
<P>
   He led a bitter but losing battle to block the politically
restrictive McCarran-Walter Immigration Act, which passed over
President Harry S. Truman's veto and played an important role in
passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act barring discrimination in
public accommodations and cutting off federal financing of
discriminatory programs.
</P>
<P>
   Pastore was floor manager of legislation suspending equal-time
provisions of the Federal Communications Act to bring about the
televised Kennedy-Nixon Presidential debates in 1960. As chairman
of the Senate's communications subcommittee, he sometimes took a
conservative stance on social issues. In the late 1960s and '70s,
he denounced what he viewed as excessive violence and sexual
content in television programming.
</P>
<P>
   The son of an immigrant tailor and left fatherless at age 9,
Pastore epitomized the self-made man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt there were two strikes against me, and to
succeed I had to do a better job than anyone else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pastore, who served as governor of Rhode Island from 1945 to
1950 and who never lost an election, entered statewide politics
when Italian-Americans were voting in increasingly significant
numbers in urban areas and using their growing economic strength to
provide financial backing for political candidates they favored.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For a man whose rise reflected inroads by Italian-Americans on
political gains made by Irish-Americans, John Orlando Pastore had
an intriguing birthday. He was born in the largely Italian Federal
Hill section of Providence on St. Patrick's Day _ March 17, 1907.
</P>
<P>
   Pastore's father, Michele, a native of Potenza in southern
Italy, supported his wife, Erminia, and their four children with
his tailor shop. But Michele Pastore died suddenly in May 1916
while his wife was pregnant with their fifth child. Pastore's
mother went to work as a seamstress in a department store while
John cared for the three younger children.
</P>
<P>
   Pastore made sure her children were well-dressed and
well-mannered, and young John developed a penchant for
fastidiousness. ``When he cleaned house, he moved every stick of
furniture,'' his mother would remember. His impeccable dress would
become a hallmark in his public life _ he changed his shirts in the
middle of the day if they bore the slightest signs of wear.
</P>
<P>
   In 1927, while working as a $15-a-week claims adjuster for an
electric utility company, Pastore enrolled in evening law school
classes offered by Northeastern University of Boston at a
Providence YMCA. In 1932 he set up a law office in the basement of
the family home, but with the Depression in full force, he
attracted few clients.
</P>
<P>
   One Sunday in 1933, Pastore waited outside St. Bartholomew's
Church until Tommy Testa, an important local politician, came out.
``I'd like to go into politics,'' Pastore told him. Testa, who
would recall how ``I liked Johnny's manner,'' helped him obtain the
Democratic nomination for the Rhode Island General Assembly, and he
was elected to two-year terms in 1934 and 1936.
</P>
<P>
   Pastore then gained an appointment as an assistant state
attorney general, and by the early 1940s his oratorical skill was
winning over juries in criminal cases. One day a young woman named
Elena Caito was passing by a courthouse while Pastore was
prosecuting a case. As Pastore's son told the story long afterward:
``The transom over the door was open. She could hear this booming
voice coming out, and she asked one of her brothers, `Who is that?'
So they got introduced.'' In July 1941, they were married.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, Pastore was asked to run for lieutenant governor, a
part-time position, on the statewide Democratic ticket headed by
Gov. J. Howard McGrath. The Democrats won, and then Pastore got a
huge break, succeeding to the governor's chair in October 1945 when
McGrath was appointed solicitor general in the Truman
administration. Pastore was narrowly elected to the Statehouse in
November 1946, but two years later he gained a second term with
ease.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was the first person of Italian descent to be
elected governor, he was not the first to serve in a statehouse.
Charles Poletti, a son of Italian immigrants who had been
lieutenant governor of New York state, served as governor in
December 1942 to complete the term of Gov. Herbert Lehman, who
resigned to direct American war-relief efforts in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A liberal on social-welfare matters, Pastore, as governor,
worked with business interests, pushing through a sales tax, rather
than relying solely on corporate income taxes, to pay for public
improvements neglected during World War II. He maintained a popular
touch, eating lunch with Statehouse employees in their cafeteria,
and he was adept at cultivating the press.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1950, Pastore was elected to the U.S. Senate to fill
the unexpired term of McGrath, who had moved from the solicitor
general's post to the Senate and then resigned to become Truman's
attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, Pastore was elected to the first of his four full terms
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing his points on the Senate floor, Pastore was not averse
to wagging a finger under another senator's nose, and he impressed
his Senate colleagues mightily when he got the better of the
bearish senator from Oklahoma, Robert Kerr, a fierce debater, in an
encounter on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Although his oratory could be flamboyant, his personal
appearance was conservative _ his grooming meticulous, his black
hair slicked back, his salt-and-pepper mustache kept trim.
</P>
<P>
   Through his Senate years, Pastore earnestly pursued weighty
issues. But he could also poke fun at himself.
</P>
<P>
   He once observed that nuclear fallout might bring bizarre
changes. ``Mutations!'' he thundered. ``Perhaps they'll make
Pastore 6 feet tall.''
</P>
<P>
   And he expressed gratitude that his parents had Anglicized his
first name. ``If they had called me Giovanni,'' he said, ``my
initials would be G.O.P.'' &QL;

NEW JERSEY TO TAKE OVER A FLOUNDERING TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Expands 5th graf. Changes ``83,000'' to ``85,000'' in graf
that begins ``It's like ...'') 
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. _ The sewers were backed up at Seventh and Elm
streets again, and pools of scummy liquid had collected in the
collapsing gutters and rutted street in front of the Bible
Tabernacle Church.
</P>
<P>
   It stank.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Heyward Wiggins of Bible Tabernacle was there, talking
about his hopes for his stricken city, now that the state has given
up on Camden's local government and is set to begin the first city
takeover in the state's history, amounting to the imposition of a
benign but absolute dictator. It is also to be the biggest city
takeover in the United States since the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask people what they want, they would say they want
Camden to be comfortable to live in again,'' Wiggins said. ``They
would say they just want to sit on their front porch without
someone harassing them or sneaking in the back door. They want the
streets cleaned and the sewers fixed. They don't want big things.
They want little things.''
</P>
<P>
   But delivering services, little or big, is just what Camden's
city government has been unable to do. Done in by government
corruption, poverty and the flight of manufacturing industries, it
has been functionally bankrupt for over a decade, kept afloat with
cash from Trenton, which now pays for 70 percent of the municipal
and public school budget.
</P>
<P>
   In this city across the Delaware River from the chiseled,
historic skyline of Philadelphia, not one residential street has
been repaved for years, and 16 percent of the buildings are
abandoned. The high school dropout rate is 50, 70 or 80 percent,
depending on whom you ask, and the infant mortality rate is three
times that of the suburbs whose borders lie less than a mile from
where Wiggins stood.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 open-air drug bazaars are in operation, but there
are only 80 city police officers on duty at one time. In March,
Milton Milan became the third Camden mayor in 20 years to be
indicted on corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman toured Camden in 1996 and looked around in
despair. ``I thought to myself, `There's no way you can raise a
child here,''' she said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   So last week, Whitman handed the Legislature her Municipal
Rehabilitation and Economic Revitalization Act, which would strip
power from the mayor, City Council and regulatory and licensing
agencies in Camden and put it all in the hands of one person, a
chief management officer appointed by the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature is out of session now, but is expected to pass
the bill with minor changes when it reconvenes in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The manager would have the power to break contracts, ignore
Civil Service rules in hiring and firing, issue or revoke licenses
and direct all appointments and spending decisions. The manager's
only obligation to the public would be to consult with a
state-selected board of local citizens and to hold two public
hearings a year.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, said Ulrich H. ``Al'' Steinberg, director of the
division of local government services, is that Camden's city
government has simply ceased to function.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like quicksand,'' Steinberg said in an interview. ``You
look in the books for something and you find there's no solid
footing. There is paper and there are words, but they are empty.
There's no basis for what they say.'' These days, state agencies
bypass the city government and deal directly with a shadow
government of nonprofit social and housing groups to bring
everything from new housing to day care to health care to Camden's
85,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   There have been three other takeovers of bankrupt cities and
incompetent or corrupt city administrations in recent years, but
Camden's is the biggest of them all. Michigan took over the tiny
Detroit suburb of Ecorse in 1986; Massachusetts took over the
Boston suburb of Chelsea, population 35,000, in 1992; and Illinois
has been operating East St. Louis, population 39,000, since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Camden is mostly black and Hispanic. The idea of a white
governor like Whitman and a Republican administration in Trenton
abolishing self-government in a mostly minority city resonates in
threatening ways among city leaders. This racial disparity gave
state officials their most delicate task of alliance building
inside the city before they could let the hammer fall.
</P>
<P>
   Gwendolyn A. Faison, president of the Camden City Council and a
black woman, practically levitated out of her seat with anger when
word came, during a recent council session, that the takeover bill
had been introduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was beaten off the courthouse steps in Clinton,
North Carolina, just for asking to register to vote,'' Faison
declared. ``To register! Do they think we are going to give up the
right that my people fought for and died for?''
</P>
<P>
   But it is a measure of Camden's desperation, and of the state's
careful cultivation of local allies, that the city's grass roots
leaders, including black leaders, think exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   On June 13, two major church groups, Camden Churches Organized
for People _ a mixed group of Roman Catholic Hispanic and black
congregations _ and the all-black Concerned Black Clergy filled St.
Joseph's Cathedral with 1,500 city residents to invite the state to
take over their city.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the grass-roots support, the state agreed to a
manifesto presented by the church leaders that describes the city's
ills and lists timetables for solutions _ such as demolishing 362
condemned buildings within a year, shutting down 200 drug markets
within three years, and working to raise the graduation rate from
Camden high schools to 70 percent.

HEZBOLLAH COMMANDER SAYS IMPROVED TACTICS DROVE ISRAEL FROM
SOUTHERN LEBANON

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TYRE, Lebanon _ Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim guerrillas who
forced Israel from the slice of southern Lebanon it had occupied
for 22 years, grew from a small band of amateurish gunmen to a
highly sophisticated tactical operation savvy enough to exploit a
new weapon of modern warfare _ television.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of media as a weapon had an effect parallel to a
battle,'' the top Hezbollah commander in southern Lebanon, Sheik
Nabil Quok, said in a rare interview with a Western journalist in
which he discussed not only how Hezbollah learned to improve its
effectiveness, strategy and weaponry, but also to videotape its
successes for distribution to the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the use of these films, we were able to control from a long
distance the morale of a lot of Israelis,'' he said, underscoring
how demoralization as much as defeat helped to drive the Israelis
from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   From once relying on teen-age suicide bombers to crash cars into
Israeli installations in the mid-1980s, Hezbollah tactics _
primarily ambushes, assassinations and roadside bombs _ became
increasingly well planned and executed, military observers in the
region say.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, it ambushed a helicopter-borne raid by elite
Israeli commandos, killing 13, and assassinated the Israeli general
who was the head liaison officer to the South Lebanese Army and
that proxy militia's second in command.
</P>
<P>
   But the impact of these strikes was amplified by the fact that
they were videotaped by hidden Hezbollah cameramen, and that the
footage quickly found its way onto Israeli television, sometimes
even as the Israeli Defense Forces spokesman denied the incident
had taken place.
</P>
<P>
   The effect was what the military calls a ``force multiplier,''
greatly undermining Israeli will.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy-five percent of Hezbollah's war was the videotapes,''
said an experienced official with the U.N. peacekeeping troops in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Quok explained how, after first being screened on Hezbollah's
own television, the videotapes were rushed to Beirut, where copies
were delivered to Lebanese Television and Western wire services
like The Associated Press and Reuters, which made them widely
available.
</P>
<P>
   The videos were often shown on the nightly television news in
Israel, helping bring home the cost of the occupation. They were a
stark contrast to the standard fare served up by Israeli military
reporters, whose coverage was severely restricted and censored by
the army. Blurred and grainy as they sometimes were, the Hezbollah
videos contributed to the rising public pressure in Israel to bring
the troops home.
</P>
<P>
   But the footage would not have been taken at all without the
improved intelligence gathering and combat skills Hezbollah
developed over the years. ``When they first started, they thought
they could do it with a bunch of people on a hill yelling `Allahu
akbar,' a U.N. official in the area said of the Hezbollah fighters.
``They would loose 40 in an operation. Now they are very
sophisticated, very disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
   Quok said the guerrillas were able to improve their
effectiveness by studying each operation, learning from their
mistakes, and developing new uses for weaponry. He also outlined
the guerrillas' reliance on sometimes stunningly low-tech methods
to thwart Israel's more numerous and more sophisticated forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resistance always focused on the weak points of the
enemy,'' he said as he outlined a classic theory and practice of
guerrilla warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Military experts say that at any one time Hezbollah maintained
only about 500 full-time fighters, although it could mobilize many
more supporters. The Israeli troops in southern Lebanon usually
numbered about 1,500, backed up by some 2,500 more troops in their
proxy militia, which collapsed and fled when the Israelis abruptly
pulled out of Southern Lebanon on May 24.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah officials say they lost some 1,200 fighters over the
years, and yellow roadside markers are being put up at the spots
where they fell. Hundreds of Israeli soldiers were killed.
</P>
<P>
   There were two kinds of wars, Quok said, guerrilla war and
conventional war. By alternating tactics between the two, he went
on, Hezbollah was able to maintain the initiative and, after a
clash, melt away into a largely sympathetic populace.
</P>
<P>
   ``By limiting the firing, we were able to keep the cards in our
hands,'' the sheik said. ``We were able to do small, little battles
where we had the advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the rockets the resistance used had to be used
intelligently,'' he added. ``We would do an action only in the time
and place where it had an impact.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The sheik and other military experts cited a number of Hezbollah
innovations. These ranged from roadside bombs made of fake plastic
rocks, which could be bought in Beirut garden stores for $15, to
running farm animals across areas monitored by Israeli motion
sensors. At the same time, Hezbollah had the ability to jam Israeli
radar and closed-circuit television monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was never driven and did not show up on Israeli heat
sensors, an old Soviet T-55 tank hidden in a cave and firing
sporadically took the Israelis months to find, the sheik said.
Hezbollah fighters discovered that remote-controlled anti-tank
rockets, which can, in effect, be steered in flight, could be
directed into small openings in concrete bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the man who invented these rockets did not know this,''
Quok bragged.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, he said, he and his fighters, ``were always ready for
martyrdom,'' but the Israeli soldier ``probably wasn't ready to die
for this.
</P>
<P>
   ``More important than everything,'' he said, ``is that the
Israeli soldier didn't believe in the war.''
</P>
<P>
   He also stressed the importance of a good intelligence network.
The effectiveness of that network was demonstrated with the
assassination on Feb. 28 last year of Brig. Gen. Eretz Gerstien,
the top Israeli army liaison officer to the South Lebanese Army, by
a roadside bomb as his car passed in a military convoy. He was the
highest ranking Israeli officer killed during the occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, on Jan. 30, the second-ranking commander of the South
Lebanese Army, Col. Akl Hashem, was killed by a bomb at his house
in Marjyoun, a mainly Christian center. His death was the first in
a series of attacks early this year that left seven Israeli
soldiers dead and helped set the Israelis on a course for an early
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the incidents on Feb. 6, an Israeli medic was killed
as he tended wounded comrades. That particularly gory videotape was
shown over and over the next day on Israeli television.

   COURCHEVEL, France _ He is a slight man, one who wears a neon
pink uniform when he cycles. He is known for his shaved head and
his bandanas. And he is a terror in the mountain stages, attacking
at random, leaving strong riders cringing when they see him fly by.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian press refer to him as ``Il Pirata.'' And until last
year, everyone called Marco Pantani the top cyclist in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Then Lance Armstrong took that title from him by winning the
Tour de France. And Armstrong, especially after his performance
Sunday, likely will win cycling's most prestigious race again when
it ends in Paris in six days.
</P>
<P>
   But Pantani, the 1998 Tour de France champion, has something to
prove this year. Armstrong may take the eventual glory ride on the
Champs Elysees, but Pantani is stealing the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   The charasmatic Italian won stage 15 Sunday with a powerful trek
over 107.5 miles. The route, lined by thousands of rabid fans,
featured two climbs that were so difficult they were beyond
classification. Pantani made his last attack on the longest ascent
of the Tour, riding 13.7 miles uphill into Courchevel, a ritzy ski
town high in the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   While most cyclists wave wildly and blow kisses to heaven when
they cross the finish line for a career-making Tour stage win,
Pantani gave only a slight wave Sunday afternoon when he finished
his ride. It was his second stage win in the past four days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more satisfying to finish alone,'' Pantani said.
``There's a different taste to victory when you leave everyone
behind. It's the taste of triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the best Pantani today, but I'm not far away.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, meanwhile, remained zero for 15 in stage wins, but
his fourth-place finish Sunday allowed him to pick up valuable time
over Jan Ullrich, the German rider who basically has the only
chance of catching him.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong picked up 2 minutes and 32 seconds on Ullrich to give
him a commanding 7:26 lead over his nearest competitior coming into
today, the Tour's final rest day. To put that lead in perspective,
Armstrong won last year's event by 7:21 over Alex Zulle, and that
margin of victory was the fourth-largest in the past 20 Tours.
``There's still one week left to race,'' Armstrong said. ``I refuse
to say that I've won until I arrive in Paris. To say here and now
that I've won wouldn't be fair to the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Pantani, who didn't fare well in the Tour's earlier, flatter
stages, moved into seventh place Sunday, when he finished the stage
in 5 hours, 34:46 minutes. He still was 9:57 behind Armstrong,
although he has come from 25th to seventh place in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Pantani finished 41 seconds ahead of Jose Maria Jimenez on
Sunday, with Roberto Heras and Armstrong finishing third and
fourth, although each was 50 seconds behind Pantani.
</P>
<P>
   Pantani's career has been clouded by drug allegations. He faces
charges of sports fraud in his home country, based on two blood
tests that showed his percentage of red blood cells to be
abnormally high, suggesting the use of EPO, a banned blood booster.
In 1999, Pantani was suspended from the Giro d'Italia a day before
the race concluded. At the time of his suspension, he was
dominating the competition. He then announced that he would not be
competing in the 1999 Tour de France because it's route was too
flat.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Pantani returned to competitive cycling.
</P>
<P>
   Ullrich, who has been in second place in the Tour standings for
the past week, was 15th Sunday, 3:21 behind Pantani. Ullrich's
disappointing effort allowed Spain's Joseba Beloki to close to
within two seconds of the German, who won the 1997 Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Pantani and Armstrong seemingly have formed a bond in the past
week, with the American and the Italian riding together in key
stretches in the mountains. The same happened Sunday, but Pantani
left Armstrong with about nine miles remaining in the stage.
Pantani then made up ground on Jimenez, passing the Spainard with
just under two miles remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armstrong is very difficult to drop,'' Pantani said. ``But
today I did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hold Armstrong in very high regard. I'm not saying that to
flatter him because that's not my way.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fifty-five years after the last gun fell silent, a
national monument to those who fought in World War II is
approaching a decisive point.
</P>
<P>
   The design for the monument, which is planned for a site on the
Mall and would cost an estimated $100 million, will go before the
Commission of Fine Arts on Thursday. The commission has the last
word on the architectural appearance of official structures in the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the monument, like Bob Dole, the Republican
presidential candidate in 1996, who was gravely wounded in the war,
and Hugh L. Carey, the former governor of New York and a war
veteran, say they are optimistic that the commission will approve
the plans, while opponents are preparing to argue that the memorial
should be moved to a different site or be scaled down.
</P>
<P>
   If the plans are approved, the next and final hurdle comes on
Aug. 3, when it goes before the National Capital Planning
Commission, which provides planning guidance for federal land and
buildings in the region. This body generally defers to the fine
arts commission on design questions, so Thursday's decision is
likely to be critical.
</P>
<P>
   The monument, first proposed in legislation introduced in
Congress in 1987 by Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, has been under
discussion and wending its way through the bureaucracy for four
years. Recently it was approved by the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   If the two commissions approve, ground should be broken on
Veterans Day this fall with completion scheduled for 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Carey _ who fought in France, the Netherlands and Germany _ was
vice chairman of the American Battle Monuments Commission, the
federal agency designated by Congress to establish the monument. He
has expressed some reservations about the design of the monument,
but he nonetheless backs approval.
</P>
<P>
   The Battle Monuments Commission selected a Rhode Island
architect, Friedrich St. Florian, to design the monument after a
national competition in 1996. The last four years have been taken
up by completion of the plan, fund-raising, the slow wheels of the
federal bureaucracy and addressing objections of opponents who
criticize its design and placement on the Mall between the
Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   St. Florian's design calls for an oval pool that would replace
the existing and slightly larger Reflecting Pool on the Mall. Two
semicircles of 56 pillars (one for each American state and
territory during the war) and two arches (one named Atlantic and
the other Pacific for the two main theaters of war) would flank the
pool to the north and south.
</P>
<P>
   On the east side St. Florian has placed a broad entrance ramp
from 17th Street NW, and on the west a waterfall that is adjacent
to the Reflecting Pool, the long expanse of water that points
toward the Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intention was to be timeless,'' St. Florian said in an
interview, standing before a model of his work. ``It goes back to
Jefferson and the founders of our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   To Judy Scott Feldman, chairwoman of the National Coalition to
Save Our Mall, the design goes back further; too far, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The St. Florian design is dehumanizing,'' said Feldman, an art
and architectural historian who has taught at the University of
Dallas and Texas Christian University and now teaches at American
University. ``Triumphal arches and pillars are military triumphal
scenes used as long ago as the Roman Empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``World War II was all of America coming together. It was not a
war of conquest but a war of liberation. The American way of making
memorials has not been to use conquest imagery.'' That kind of
imagery, she said, went out of style in the United States a century
ago, with the Washington Arch in Manhattan, built in 1895.
</P>
<P>
   St. Florian, who teaches architecture at the Rhode Island School
of Design, defends his work against such criticism. ``There is
absolutely nothing imperial about this design,'' he said. ``The
architecture is most appropriate, in the classical language. We did
not want to go back and copy but to be interpreters.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Florian said that the arch design was timeless but that his
had its own character. Besides being open on all four sides, he
said, each arch will have an oculus to let in light to illuminate
the sculptures inside.
</P>
<P>
   The two sculptures by Ray Kaskey each depict four eagles holding
a victory laurel in their beaks, forming a baldacchino, or canopy.
F. Haydn Williams, who headed the selection process for the
American Battle Monuments Commission and is a Navy veteran of World
War II, said the floors under the arches would pay tribute to all
the armed services with the words ``Victory on Land, Victory on
Sea, Victory in the Air.''
</P>
<P>
   To critics like Feldman, the monument is not only the wrong
design but also in the wrong place.
</P>
<P>
   It will block the grand open vista between the Washington
Monument and the Lincoln Memorial, she said, destroying the impact
designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, who called for long lines of
elms. St. Florian disputes this, saying that the World War II
memorial will be barely visible to someone looking at the
Washington Monument from the Lincoln Memorial and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Feldman said, the nation will lose a good portion
of its traditional rallying place because the memorial will be sunk
six feet below street level, and its waterfall will block passage
down the middle of the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no more marches on Washington because there will
be no more open spaces between the trees,'' she said, calling the
Mall ``the most important gathering spot in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the St. Florian plan insist that there will remain
plenty of room for passage through the paths between the elms,
which will not be disturbed, and that the old Rainbow Pool and the
retained Reflecting Pool barred that kind of direct passage in any
event.
</P>
<P>
   With the support of people like Dole; Frederick W. Smith,
chairman of Federal Express; and the actor Tom Hanks, who starred
in the World War II epic ``Saving Private Ryan,'' the campaign to
raise $100 million for the work is nearly complete.
</P>
<P>
   Michael G. Conley, an official of the monument campaign, said
that $93 million had been received in gifts and pledges. Of this
$14.5 million came from Wal-Mart ($5 million from the company's
foundation and the rest from employees and customers), $7.5 million
from the Veterans of Foreign Wars and $3 million from the American
Legion.
</P>
<P>
   St. Florian, whose design won in a competition against 400
others, expressed confidence in its success. ``In 20 years,'' he
said, ``it will be part of this family of great memorials, and
nobody will have any arguments about it.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Carey said he was eager for things to go forward, although he
would have preferred a monument of the understated elegance of Maya
Lin's Vietnam Memorial. ``I'm not going to derogate it,'' he said
of the St. Florian design, ``but something's missing: the actual
sense of the level of bravery and dedication.''
</P>
<P>
   But now that it has gone this far, Carey said, it is important
to complete the monument while many World War II veterans are still
alive.
</P>
<P>
   About 16.3 million Americans served in the war, and more than
400,000 died. The Department of Veterans Services said this year
that 5.7 million veterans were still living. They are dying at a
rate of 1,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get together for the reunions of the 104th Division,'' said
Carey, ``but every year the number of hotel reservations goes
down.''

WOODS PREPARES IN COOL AND QUIET SOLITUDE FOR HIS GRAND SLAM
QUEST  
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tiger Woods knows golf history. He knows golf has been played at
St. Andrews, Scotland, for centuries. He knows he could make
history at St. Andrews, becoming the first person to win all four
major tournaments _ the career Grand Slam _ by age 24. He knows
that nobody has won the U.S. Open and the British Open in the same
year since 1982, when Tom Watson did it.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing all that, and knowing he annihilated the field last
month at the United States Open, Woods will begin Thursday's
opening round of the British Open with huge motivation, not only to
win, but also to add to his legacy. And there is no better place to
make history than the Old Course at St. Andrews, often referred to
as the home of golf, where great champions like Bobby Jones, Sam
Snead, Peter Thomson, Jack Nicklaus, Seve Ballesteros and Nick
Faldo have prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   In golf, Woods is used to getting what he wants. And because the
British Open is the one major he does not have, it has become the
major he covets most.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Andrews is very special,'' Woods said last week before
leaving for Europe. ``To have a chance to complete the career Grand
Slam at the course where it all started is very symbolic. I'd love
to win there. Any golfer would.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody would be shocked to see Woods win at St. Andrews. In
fact, it would be more shocking if he did not contend. Coming off
his record-setting 15-stroke victory at the U.S. Open, Woods enters
the tournament as a huge favorite. And based on his stunning
performance at Pebble Beach, the pressure of being the favorite is
hardly unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the favorite heading into the Masters, he was the
favorite heading into the U.S. Open, he's the favorite heading into
the British, and no matter what happens, he'll be the favorite
heading into the PGA,'' said Mark Steinberg, Woods' agent. ``Think
about it. When isn't he the favorite? It's part of the deal. He can
handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Old Course at St. Andrews seems to fit Woods' game like a
tailored suit. Depending upon the direction and strength of the
wind, Woods may be able to reach the green off the tee on two or
three of the par-4 holes. He can also fly past many of the bunkers
that come into play for other golfers. Shot-making around the
greens will be crucial, and who has a more creative short game than
Woods?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the weather plays a significant role at St. Andrews,
particularly the wind, which can change directions whimsically.
Yet, with his penetrating ball flight, coupled with his ability to
work the ball right-to-left or left-to right, Woods welcomes the
wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it howls, all four days,'' Woods said, smiling. ``In
any golf tournament, the wind separates guys who are striking the
ball really well from those who aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   What does Woods think when he hears people say St. Andrews suits
his game? He smiled again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any course suits my game when I'm playing well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, even great players have difficulty winning majors on a
regular basis. Jack Nicklaus won the first of his 18 professional
major championships at the 1962 U.S. Open, and he won his last
major at the 1986 Masters. During that span, Nicklaus won 18 of 96
majors, a winning percentage of 18.7. Starting with his victory at
the 1997 Masters, Woods has won three of the last 14 majors, a
winning percentage of 21.4. And Woods has yet to win two majors in
the same year, which Nicklaus did six times.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus also completed the career Grand Slam at a British Open
in Scotland, winning at Muirfield in 1966, at the age of 26.
Nicklaus had already won the U.S. Open (1962) the Masters (1963 and
'65) and the PGA Championship (1963).
</P>
<P>
   It took Nicklaus five attempts to win his first British; Woods
has already played the British five times. Woods' first British was
at St. Andrews in 1995, where he tied for 68th as a 19-year-old
amateur. His performance at the British has improved as his game
has become more complete. In 1998 Woods tied for third at Royal
Birkdale and last year at Carnoustie tied for seventh.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To increase his chances of playing well this week, Woods
followed his normal pre-British routine, spending last week in
Ireland, golfing, fishing, relaxing, getting adjusted to the time
change and cooler temperatures. Be wary of Woods after a rest; he
has entered seven tournaments this year after taking at least a
week off, four of those times, he has won.
</P>
<P>
   Since last month's dominant performance at Pebble Beach, Woods
has been working on shots he will need at St. Andrews _
low-trajectory shots, bump-and-run shots, long lag putts that could
be crucial on the spacious greens. Practicing can be almost as
enjoyable for Woods as competing, and he hopes his preparation for
the British Open will yield the same results as his practice before
the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons why I play better after I take time off is
because I can prepare in solitude and peace,'' Woods said. ``When
you're at a tournament practicing, you can't practice the same way.
It's impossible. You can't go out with a cart, play a quick five
holes, test out what you did, then come back to the range.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his worst showing of the year last week, a tie for 23rd
at the Western Open, Woods saw encouraging signs. He drove the ball
well, and his iron play was excellent. John Daly proved how
important length is at St. Andrews by winning the last British Open
played there in 1995. Control is also important at St. Andrews,
however, as evidenced by Faldo's victory in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But even Woods could be hindered by some of the quirks that make
St. Andrews distinctive. The weather changes so quickly and so
dramatically that golfers are often at its mercy. Calm mornings can
turn into nasty afternoons, and on those days, players with early
tee times have a huge advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'll be some luck of the draw involved if the weather
fluctuates,'' Woods said. ``That's one of the variables of the
British Open. You just have to deal with whatever you face, don't
let it get to you.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1995 British, Woods shot 74-71-72 but ended with a
final-round 78 in blustery conditions. He is a far better player
now, yet if he draws bad-weather tee times, it will be difficult to
break 70.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played a practice round at St. Andrews where I played 18
straight holes into the wind, just because the tide changed,''
Woods said. ``The tide was going out, then it was coming back in
when we were finishing. That's the way that golf course can play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we got a chance to play links courses more often. It's
so much different than the golf we play here in the States, target
golf, where you're trying to hit the ball an exact distance all the
time. One day at St. Andrews, I hit 2-iron, sand wedge on the first
hole. The next day, on the same hole into the wind, I hit driver,
4-iron. That's one of the reasons why we love that course.''
</P>
<P>
   Scottish golf fans are eagerly awaiting Woods, who appreciates
the astuteness of European fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The galleries over there are so knowledgeable,'' he said.
``Over here, if you get the ball airborne, everyone goes crazy.
Over there, if you have an easy wedge, and you land it on the green
30 feet from the hole, you won't hear anything. But if you have a
long iron into a difficult wind, and you play an approach shot that
lands anywhere near the hole, they'll give you loud applause. They
know how difficult certain shots are, and they have an appreciation
for good golf. It's a great atmosphere. I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods will love the atmosphere even more should he win. He has a
history of rising to special occasions. And in golf, having a
chance to complete the career Grand Slam at St. Andrews, is about
as special as it gets. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ Please, Jerry West, don't go.
</P>
<P>
   Please, the Lakers need you.
</P>
<P>
   Please, you can't leave.
</P>
<P>
   (Ahem ... pause for effect) ...
</P>
<P>
   Please, Jerry, stay around another season.
</P>
<P>
   Please, keep making those big deals to keep the Lakers on that
championship run.
</P>
<P>
   Please, please, (begin ital)puuulll(end ital)eeeezzzz ...
</P>
<P>
   (Is this convincing enough yet? How much longer do we have to
keep this up?) ...
</P>
<P>
   So please ... stop making us beg you to stay year after year.
It's getting embarrassing, as much as you seem to need to hear it
every summer.
</P>
<P>
   If you're gonna quit, then quit. We understand.
</P>
<P>
   If you're gonna stay, stay.
</P>
<P>
   Now take this paper, wrap up the fish you just brought back from
Alaska, and get back in your office. ...
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if Jerry Buss can't afford West's $4 mil executive
salary next year. Along with the ticket raises in all sections of
Staples Center next year, the Lakers are hitting courtsiders up for
$1,350, which is a $200 increase. ...
</P>
<P>
   Just to clear things up, Tracy McGrady says he'll be playing for
``some team in Florida'' next season. ...
</P>
<P>
   If Davey won't go, at least insert Orel as the pitching coach
... starting yesterday ...
</P>
<P>
   Our nonblue-ribbon task force gives an A-OK for nixing the Expos
and dicing up the Devil Rays. ...
</P>
<P>
   Since the WNBA created another roster spot so that Phoenix could
have a player on the West team for tonight's All-Star Game, why not
just let her score the first basket, too. ...
</P>
<P>
   A week before he makes his ``MNF'' debut on the Hall of Fame
game, Dennis Miller is scheduled to play with Andre Agassi in a
doubles match against Gustavo Kuerten and Dustin Hoffman at UCLA's
L.A. Tennis Center, an exhibition that jump-starts the
Mercedes-Benz Cup men's tournament. ...
</P>
<P>
   Can't be 100 percent that Agassi will show. He's already skipped
this week's Davis Cup, claiming a back injury suffered when his car
was rear-ended in Las Vegas the day he got back from Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of damage, not just to my car but apparently
to my back,'' Agassi told Jim Rome on his radio show Friday.
</P>
<P>
   So why didn't he fill out a police report? Agassi said: ``I
actually know the person, and it wasn't my intention to take this
any further.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, what does Brooke Shields' car look like these days?
...
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza says he has a very meaningful, serious relationship
with 23-year-old Playboy playmate Darlene Bernaola (she was co-Miss
January, with her twin sister, Carol), and he intends to keep it
low-key.
</P>
<P>
   Just like every other guy in America would do if he was dating a
freak'n centerfold. ...
</P>
<P>
   And if you happen to read the text that goes with the Miss
August spread in the Darva Conger issue of Playboy, you'll discover
that 5-foot-10 Summer Altice was a decent enough high school
volleyball player at Fountain Valley that she earned an athletic
scholarship to San Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for some crazy reason, she transferred to UCLA 'cause she
wanted to start ``a lucrative modeling and acting career'' (that,
taken verbatim from her Playmate data sheet).
</P>
<P>
   So volleyball's loss is ... well, ya know ...

GORE AND BUSH GIVE VOTERS A SIDE-BY-SIDE COMPARISON 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush have
yet to meet face-to-face in a debate, but Sunday they gave voters a
chance for the first time to make a side-by-side comparison as the
two sat for hourlong interviews on network television.
</P>
<P>
   Gore faced aggressive questioning from Tim Russert of NBC's
``Meet the Press'' on his record and past statements, while Bush
was asked questions of a more political nature by Sam Donaldson and
Cokie Roberts on ABC's ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither candidate revealed anything about his vice-presidential
selection process. Bush said that while retired Gen. Colin Powell
was not interested in the vice presidency, he might accept another
post. Speculation has centered on secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   The questioning highlighted some stark differences between the
candidates, for example on Social Security, the death penalty and
abortion. The side-by-side comparison also showed that Gore's 25
years in public office have left him not only with a deep
familiarity with issues but also with a lengthy record that can be
examined for its consistency.
</P>
<P>
   The interviews also underscored the political needs of each
candidate as the campaign heads toward the conventions. Bush, who
leads in the polls, seemed content to keep the conversation vague,
a posture that allows voters to read what they want into him. Gore,
on the other hand, has been eager for direct debates with Bush. His
advisers believe that once voters can compare Gore's grasp of
policy and his center-left positions with what they say is Bush's
right-wing bent, Gore will win the election.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the third-party candidates, Ralph Nader and
Pat Buchanan, also appeared on talk programs. Nader said on CBS'
``Face the Nation'' that he was not worried about siphoning votes
from Gore, even if it could cost Gore the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be running if I were worried about taking votes
away from Al Gore or George W. Bush,'' Nader said. ``Nobody is
entitled to votes. They have to earn them.''
</P>
<P>
   On the same program, Buchanan was asked whether Bush might
choose a running mate who favored abortion rights. ``Mr. Bush is
blowing smoke,'' Buchanan said. ``He would have an explosion at his
convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore underwent scrutiny of his Social Security plan. Russert
said repeatedly that Gore's proposal was based on a rosy scenario
that anticipated budget surpluses for the next 40 years. Gore said
that his plan would keep the Social Security trust fund sacrosanct
and, by eliminating the national debt by 2012, would help extend
the life of the entitlement program.
</P>
<P>
   Russert noted that the Clinton-Gore budget for 2000 had proposed
increasing the money for Social Security by investing some of the
budget surplus set aside for Social Security ``in corporate
equities or other private financial instruments.'' Russert
described the difference between the two candidates' approaches
this way: ``You want the government to invest in the market; George
Bush wants individuals to invest.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that he did not support that proposal, even though it
was in the administration's budget, and he called it a trial
balloon. The vice president said that Bush's plan for privatizing
part of Social Security would be a ``catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What he wants to do is to divert 16 percent of the money
that's going into the trust fund and put it into the stock market
now,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bush has not specified an amount that he would allow
individuals to invest in the market from their Social Security
payroll tax.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seemed deliberately vague and refused to answer whether
under his plan the government would protect individuals against any
losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``A safe return _ the safest of all investment vehicles _ yields
about twice what the Social Security Trust is getting today,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Governor,'' Donaldson said, ``if this were 1929, we'd
probably make the same statement and then those awful years came
forward and people would have lost money.'' Donaldson then
reiterated his question about ``whether you think the government
should make good any losses for retirees.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said, ``There's going to be a lot of discussions about the
particulars of the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he agreed with the details of one of the proposals
on Capitol Hill to overhaul Medicare, Bush said, ``I believe the
next president must put Republicans and Democrats in a room and
say, `Let's reform Medicare.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also took a pass on whether the Republican Congress should
accept a deal with President Clinton to cut the marriage penalty in
exchange for funding Medicare to cover prescription drugs. ``That's
up to this current Congress and this current president,'' Bush
said. ``What the people need to know about me is that this is where
I'm going to lead the Congress when I become the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Russert also highlighted some of the changes that Gore has made
on various issues over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who favors abortion rights, was asked if he believed that
life began at conception. ``No,'' he said. Asked when life did
begin, Gore said: ``There is a developmental process during which
the burden kind of shifts over time,'' citing the first trimester
of a pregnancy as being different from the third, but not
pinpointing a time when he thought life began.

   Russert pointed out that in 1987, Gore had opposed federal
funding for abortions for poor women and had called abortion
``arguably the taking of a human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore acknowledged that he had changed his position, saying he
did so about 15 years ago. ``I talked to a lot of women who taught
me about the kinds of circumstances that can come up and the kinds
of dilemmas that women can face,'' he said. ``I've come to the very
deep conviction that a woman's right to choose must be protected
regardless of the woman's income.''
</P>
<P>
   Of a vote that he had cast that would define the term ``person''
to include the unborn, Gore said, ``That was a very odd procedural
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested, without saying directly, that he would not require
parental permission for a minor to have an abortion. He said that
such requirements have tended to be used as a back-door way to try
to eliminate abortion altogether.

<P>
   On the death penalty, Gore said he did not support a national
moratorium on it for the 21 federal prisoners who are on death row.
But he said he did support the moratorium on the death penalty in
Illinois ``based on the extraordinary number of errors'' found in
those cases.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had been quoted as saying that with the death penalty,
``there are always going to be some small numbers of errors.''
Sunday Gore said he wanted zero errors but sometimes because of
human imperfection, even jury verdicts ``sometimes produce a
mistake.'' But he said he was unaware of any involving the trials
of the 21 federal death-row inmates.
</P>
<P>
   He also hinted that any state with questionable executions would
do well to consider a moratorium. Bush has said that he was certain
that every execution in Texas had been warranted, that the inmates
had been guilty and had had full access to the appeals process.
Bush said: ``If you ask me whether or not I think we've ever
executed an innocent person, my answer to you is no, I don't
believe so. And I've reviewed every single case.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was also asked about a recent Supreme Court decision that
said the Boy Scouts could exclude gay members. Gore said he had not
read the opinion and offered none of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Russert posed a series of questions on the investigations into
Gore's financial activities in the 1996 campaign. Gore said that
Russert was ``beating a dead horse.'' Asked if his visit to a
Buddhist temple in 1996 was a fund-raising event, Gore said: ``I
believe it was not,'' adding, ``There was no request for funds, no
money changed hands.''

JEWISH SETTLERS PROTEST ISRAEL'S PRESENCE AT CAMP DAVID PEACE
TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel _ Tens of thousands of Jewish settlers
demonstrated here Sunday night against the Israeli government's
peace negotiations, capping days of rightist protests against
leaked proposals to cede small Israeli settlements deep in the West
Bank and Gaza to eventual Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   The predominately religious crowd chanted slogans of resistance
to any relocation of Jews from the occupied territories. Many wore
blue-and-white lapel stickers saying, ``We are the majority.'' Yet
the gathering barely filled Rabin Square, falling far short of
organizers' expressed hopes for 200,000 or more protesters. The
police gave no crowd estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers had vowed to make the rally a nonpartisan appeal for
mainstream Israeli support. But it soon became vigorously and
unabashedly partisan, with the opposition leader, Ariel Sharon, and
other Likud Party officials demanding that Prime Minister Ehud
Barak quit the Camp David negotiations and return home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call on the prime minister: do not sign a letter of
capitulation,'' Sharon shouted to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the speakers were political professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone understands that giving everything and receiving
nothing is not peace,'' declared Yehuda Sender, an 8-year-old from
a Gaza Strip settlement, in a speech he told television
interviewers had been written by the leader of the settlers'
council.
</P>
<P>
   The rally reinforced the impression that the right wing has been
more energetic in organizing opposition to a peace deal than the
left has been in mobilizing potential backing.
</P>
<P>
   In the Palestinian territories, Yasser Arafat's supporters have
been holding marches of support almost daily, most recently this
morning in Nablus.
</P>
<P>
   Still, leftist organizers of a peace demonstration planned for
Barak's return said they were heartened that Sunday's rally failed
to attract many secular supporters from within Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel and Chaim Guirtzman were typical of the protesters. They
are observant Jews who moved with 30 other families 15 years ago
into a new West Bank settlement _ Dolev, outside Ramallah. The site
was barren land, Guirtzman said.
</P>
<P>
   Dolev is now a modern town of 150 families surrounded by five
newer settler communities.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Guirtzman said she read reports that sovereignty in
settlements may be transferred to a Palestinian state. ``We didn't
build our settlements to live in a foreign country,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between the two Israels was starkly visible in the
demonstrators' modest dress and covered heads. Many came from West
Bank and Gaza towns that are as little as an hour away by road, but
a world away culturally. Local residents in this zealously secular
downtown district either ignored the out-of-towners, or eyed them
with disdain.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think like Khomeini and people like that,'' muttered
Motti Shanma, a contrast in his straw cowboy hat and muscle shirt,
his tattooed arms flexing as he diced vegetables behind a lunch
counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cannot imagine the possibility of peace in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Some protesters agreed with that assertion. ``Barak is giving
away our land, peace by peace,'' proclaimed a placard in English
hoisted aloft by Millie Fried, from Brooklyn, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Fried acknowledged her residence defensively _ ``My heart is
here,'' she said _ but claimed solid personal credentials for her
protest. In 1970, as a 15-year-old, she said, she was a passengers
on a TWA flight from Tel Aviv to New York that was hijacked by
Palestinian terrorists and diverted to Amman. A week on board as a
hostage, she said, convinced her that Israel is under threat and
should keep the territory it conquered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel belongs to the Jews, every inch of it,'' she said,
``and we are not going to let it go.''

COMMENTARY: STEPS TOWARD GLOBAL COOLING 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   So what can we do about global warming?
</P>
<P>
   First, keep in mind the goal, which is to bring the potentially
catastrophic warming under control by curtailing the release of
carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary people can help immediately by becoming more energy
efficient. Stop using the familiar incandescent light bulbs and
replace them with compact fluorescent bulbs, which last much longer
and use only a quarter of the energy consumed by conventional
bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   Compact fluorescent bulbs are significantly more expensive, but
because they last so long (up to 10 times the life of a standard
bulb) and use so little electricity, they are substantially cheaper
in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Next, when shopping for an appliance _ a refrigerator, a
dishwasher, an air-conditioner _ select the one with the highest
energy efficiency rating. There will be a sticker on the appliance,
telling you how much energy it uses. Pay attention. There can be a
difference of 30 percent to 40 percent or more in the amount of
energy consumed by appliances with comparable features.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important is the choice you make in the car or truck
you buy. Motor vehicles are responsible for about a third of the
carbon dioxide emissions in the United States. The vehicles that
are the most fuel efficient emit the least carbon dioxide. (Fuel
economy and carbon dioxide emissions are inversely proportional. If
you double fuel economy, you cut carbon dioxide emissions in half.)
</P>
<P>
   According to the research and advocacy group Environmental
Defense, if you buy a new car that gets 10 more miles per gallon
than your old car, the amount of carbon dioxide reduction realized
in one year will be about 2,500 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   So buying a car or truck that suits your needs AND is fuel
efficient is a big help.
</P>
<P>
   Honda and Toyota are bringing so-called hybrid vehicles onto the
market in the United States. Hybrids are cars that combine an
internal combustion engine and a battery-powered electric motor.
They are mid-sized cars that are achieving twice the fuel economy
of conventional cars.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Epstein, associate director of the Center for Health
and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School, summed the
matter up as follows: ``The issue is not so much what we are doing,
but how we power what we are doing. That's the first step.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the long term, the requirements are far more ambitious.
Ideally, over the course of the next 100 or so years, a
transformation will take place and most energy will end up coming
not from fossil fuels like coal and oil, but from clean energy
sources _ the sun, the wind, hydrogen and non-polluting fuel cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get there at a cost that's affordable will require
substantial technological development,'' said Dr. Michael
Oppenheimer, the chief scientist of Environmental Defense.
</P>
<P>
   To move from our pollution-choked present to a future in which
climate change is not a mortal threat will take more than that
all-important first step of an enlightened citizenry buying cleaner
cars and more efficient appliances. Tough action by Congress and
the president is needed, and soon. And international cooperation,
with enforceable agreements covering both industrialized and,
ultimately, developing nations, will be crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the federal government can offer subsidies
and other incentives to reduce the cost and foster the use of
existing clean-energy technology, and to encourage the development
of ever more efficient new technologies. And the government can _
and should _ develop more sophisticated strategies like emissions
trading and more stringent requirements for reducing carbon dioxide
emissions everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Global warming is the most serious problem we face in the 21st
century. Last week an intensive analysis by a respected geologist
at Texas A&AMP;M University, suggested _ as most scientists have been
saying for some time now _ that human activity, not natural
factors, is the primary cause of the warming.
</P>
<P>
   We caused the problem and we have within our grasp a variety of
potential solutions. To ignore those solutions, to be aware of them
but not make use of them, is not just profoundly destructive, it's
suicidal.

SRI LANKA'S TAMIL REBELS CONSCRIPTING TEENS FOR JAFFNA CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Tamil rebels preparing for a showdown with the
Sri Lankan Army for control of the island's most important Tamil
town have been invading schoolrooms and rounding up boys and girls
in their early teens to send into battle, a Tamil rights
organization said this week.
</P>
<P>
   In a report issued Tuesday, the University Teachers for Human
Rights in Jaffna, the focus of the impending battle in Sri Lanka's
north, describe a reign of terror in the region. They say rebels of
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam intimidate teachers and public
officials, pull the biggest children out of classes, raid
orphanages and go to homes to demand that families turn over
teen-age sons and daughters. Rough estimates indicate that hundreds
of children, some as young as 9 or 10, are being conscripted.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials here and in Colombo, Sri Lanka's capital, have
condemned the rebels' recent increasing use of child soldiers.
Olara Otunnu, the U.N. official responsible for trying to end the
military use of children, confirmed in an interview that since the
Tamil Tigers began a campaign late last year to recapture the
Jaffna peninsula, the recruitment of children has soared.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Tigers promised Otunnu to stop recruiting
children under 17 and to stop sending anyone under 18 into battle.
</P>
<P>
   Otunnu said the situation in Sri Lanka showed how difficult it
was to translate international agreements against child soldiers
into action, particularly when irregular forces are involved.
</P>
<P>
   Otunnu said the practice of recruiting child soldiers is
confined in Sri Lanka to the Tigers. He said there had never been
any evidence of recruitment of children by the government army.
</P>
<P>
   Otunnu added that the report from the Jaffna Tamil rights group
was supported by independent information he has collected from
other private organizations and U.N. officials in Sri Lanka. Colin
Glennie, Unicef's representative in Colombo, said, ``We don't have
figures, but we know it's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than a quarter of a century, Tamil rebels have been
fighting for a separate Tamil homeland in northern and eastern Sri
Lanka, an island dominated by ethnic Sinhalese.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1980s, the Tigers _ secretive, ultranationalistic
and radically leftist _ have eliminated all moderate rivals and
raised the level of violence nationwide with suicide bombings and
assassinations. These have decimated a generation of Sri Lankan
leaders from both ethnic groups and cost them some support even
among Tamils.
</P>
<P>
   In December, President Chandrika Kumaratunga survived a bomb
attack that cost her sight in one eye. Under her administration,
the army pushed the Tigers out of Jaffna five years ago, inflicting
bombing raids and retaliatory ground attacks on Tamil civilians,
human rights groups say. The Tigers recaptured the crucial pass
connecting the Jaffna peninsula to the rest of Sri Lanka in May.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have suffered considerable losses in recent months _
as many as 1,500 dead of a core army of 7,000, the Tamil human
rights group said. They are seeking replacements for the assault on
Jaffna, the group said, and meanwhile feed themselves by by seizing
food aid intended for civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which is on the U.S. list
of terrorist organizations, raises money to buy arms, often
coercively, from a Tamil diaspora in Southeast Asia, Canada and
Britain, among other places. But, if attempted, the overseas
recruitment of fighters has apparently not been so easy. The Tigers
``needed considerably more recruits to make another attempt at
taking Jaffna. This comes out clearly in its propaganda meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Teachers who try to protect the children from recruiters are
marked,'' the University Teachers said.
</P>
<P>
   The group has operated underground since the assassination in
1988 of its founder, Dr. Rajani Thiranagama of Jaffna University's
medical faculty.
</P>
<P>
   The report mentioned torture, public and secret executions and
the chaining of young prisoners to bunkers when they try to leave
the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls have been in a large majority in the current round of
recruitment in schools,'' said the report, which told of a
15-year-old girl who escaped from the rebels and ran home, where
her desperate father hid her and armed himself to prevent her
recapture with the only weapon he could find, a shark jawbone. The
daughter was apparently left alone.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on children recently has been greatest in a region
known as the Vanni, south of the Jaffna peninsula and north of the
town of Vavuniya. It is the base of the Tigers' leader, Velupillai
Prabhakaran, a reclusive strategist who, the Jaffna group says, has
begun referring to himself as the Sun God. In April last year, he
ordered compulsory military training for schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The report told of one school where only four children in the
14-15 age group were recruited before April 1999. From then until
early this year, 15 children were recruited. The number jumped to
24 in seven weeks from early May until late June. The pattern in
other schools was similar, the report said. The report figures that
only about 5 percent of child soldiers volunteer; the rest are
taken with varying degrees of coercion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the 15 who joined between April 1999 and early 2000, the
bodies of six were brought to their school for display before being
laid to rest,'' the report said of the school it profiled. ``This
ceremony is intended to give the dead an aura of heroism and to
make others guilty about not joining.''

ZOO HELPS KEEP DOWNTOWN INDIANAPOLIS OPEN BEYOND 5 O'CLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL H. LAVIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Lesley Mackie, an elephant keeper at the
Indianapolis Zoo, nudged the 400-pound baby aside with her hip. The
baby, Amali, made elephant history with her birth March 6, the
first African elephant ever conceived through artificial
insemination. But on this summer afternoon, she was grabbing a
visitor's shirt with her trunk and chewing on the seam.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a toddler,'' Mackie said. ``Everything goes in the
mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Amali's birth has captured an unusual amount of attention at the
zoo and around town. A name-the-baby contest drew 6,000 entries.
(Amali, an Arabic word meaning hope, was submitted by a local
librarian.) Crowds packed the viewing area for weeks as soon as the
baby made her first public appearance with her mother, Kubwa.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the zoo held a contest for visitors, to guess the
combined weight of four female elephants. After the elephants
trundled around a small ring, and took turns on a scale (together,
they were just over 29,000 pounds), each strode to the side for
children and grownups to touch the smooth, hard tusks, the supple
leathery ears, and the bristly tufts on the wrinkled gray skin.
</P>
<P>
   These days a world-class zoological achievement is just one more
item on a list of new downtown attractions that are helping
Indianapolis shine. Public and private investment downtown totaled
$3 billion during the 1990s and another $1.5 billion worth of
projects will open over the next two years. Much of the activity
including a minor league baseball park, a new stadium for the
Pacers basketball team, a $14.5 million botanical garden next to
the zoo and a new 165,000-square-foot headquarters for the Indiana
Historical Society came during the tenure of Mayor Stephen
Goldsmith, now a top domestic policy adviser to the presidential
campaign of Gov. George Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decade ago, there wasn't a lot of there there,'' said Tamara
Zahn, president of Indianapolis Downtown, a not-for-profit group
that promotes development. ``Downtown kind of rolled up around 5
o'clock.''
</P>
<P>
   The men's basketball Final Four brought the spotlight to town in
the spring, and will return in 2006. A steadier measure of growth
is the number of hotel rooms downtown. In five years it is
increasing from 3,677 to 4,558. Promoters like Zahn like to brag
also about last year's move of the National Collegiate Athletic
Association's headquarters here from Kansas City, Mo. This spring
the NCAA opened a museum on the west side, also near the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The zoo has been an anchor on the west side since they opened
and have done an excellent job of adding attractions and being a
national model,'' Ms Zahn said. ``Amali its one more unique thing
that Indianapolis has to offer. For example, Shaq when he was in
town made a point of visiting Amali.'' Shaquille O'Neal, the
Laker's star player, and other zoo visitors saw an unquestionably
cute baby. They may not have realized that Amali was the result of
more than a decade of scientific work aimed at improving elephant
birth rates in captivity. As the wild populations have dropped
sharply to 500,000 African elephants and to 50,000 Asians, exports
from those regions have grown more and more difficult. The fewer
than 500 elephants of both species in North America have produced
four or five births a year, a rate that will lead to a population
crash in a few decades, according to. Robert J. Wiese, a population
biologist at the Fort Worth Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Elephant bulls can be belligerent during certain times in their
mating season and many zoos hold only females. Transporting
elephants for mating is tricky enough. Theoretically, it is easier
to transfer semen.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the routines of human fertility clinics are touchstones
of elephant artificial insemination trays of blood samples, charts
of hormone levels, files of ultrasound images, worry about the age
and physical condition of the mothers-to-be. Each attempt cost from
$10,000 to $20,000 and depended on precise timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are not getting your animals bred by the time they are
30 you've sort of missed the boat,'' said Dr. Janine Brown, a
Smithsonian researcher who is an expert on elephant hormones. Her
work, together with advances from other researchers, have made it
possible for scientists to use fluctuations in hormone levels and
new ultrasound techniques to predict ovulation.
</P>
<P>
   After birth, elephants still face many dangers, from indifferent
mothers, to fast-moving viral infections to aggressive acts from
adult elephants that do not know how to act around babies. Ivory, a
three-ton teen-ager at the Indianapolis Zoo, knocked into little
Amali once, sending the baby into shock.
</P>
<P>
   The first conceptions using artificial insemination were two
years ago. The first birth, of an Asian male named Haji, was in
November, at the Dickerson Park Zoo in Springfield, Mo. Amali was
born three months later.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ivory, has herself been artificially inseminated. Zoo
keepers say she will give birth next month. ``We are very convinced
that she will be a good mother, once the hormones kick in and she
has a baby of her own,'' said Deborah Olson, an Indianapolis zoo
official. Two other pregnancies from artificial inseminations have
been confirmed of an African elephant in Austria, and of an Asian
elephant at the National Zoo in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   This baby boomlet is meant to supplement, not replace, natural
breeding, explained Dr. Dennis Schmitt, an associate professor of
veterinary medicine at Southwest Missouri State University, who
attended the births of Amali, and 13 other elephants since 1985 and
who developed many of the techniques used in the artificial
inseminations.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo elephants pose special reproductive problems, Schmitt said.
``We tend to like elephants in captivity that are round and fat,''
he added. ``That's not what you want; you want an elephant that's
not overweight. We want them to be physically fit.''
</P>
<P>
   In Indianapolis, Amali's mother was on a rigorous exercise
program that included leg lifts and daily walks. Now Ivory is on
the same regimen. Soon another regimen will begin, one that is
likely to bring more throngs of tourists downtown, where officials
hope the zoo will be just one of many stops they will make in
Indianapolis. This regimen is the birth watch, a 24-hour-a-day
vigil for several weeks using video cameras, volunteers and zoo
workers. They will look for rocking, unusual pacing or other signs
that Ivory is about to go into labor.
</P>
<P>
   Ivory's relative youth is a plus, and so is the recent
experience zoo workers gained when Amali was born. But in elephant
reproduction nothing can be taken for granted, especially for
African elephants, which over the years have reproduced more poorly
than the Asians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now getting Africans on the ground is a phenomenal
thing,'' said Brown, the Smithsonian endocrinologist who will be
testing Ivory's blood to help determine when labor is about to
begin. ``To have two is absolutely outstanding.''

that I was unhappy before, but this is certainly the happiest I've
ever been in life, period. I don't know if I have everything, but I
have everything I need. I don't know what everything is, but I have
enough. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The money thing is relative. I have enough to not have to do
this, but I love this, this makes me happy. The bike, the training,
the sport, the atmosphere. Even the travel, the training camps,
everything that goes with it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He paused in his litany of euphoria. ``Not this hotel,'' added
the native of Austin, Texas. Lounging on his bed after a 45-minute
massage, Armstrong gestured around the tacky room with water stains
showing through the plush on the walls. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Especially when he is feeling feisty, the 28-year-old leader of
the U.S. Postal Service team is famous for complaining about the
sometimes dreadful hotels that race organizers assign. There is no
doubting his feistiness now. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a lot of racing to go,'' he said cautiously
before the start of three stages in the Alps. ``I'm surprised at my
fitness. I focused totally on this event and wanted this result,
but I didn't expect to be entering the Alps with a five-minute
lead. That really surprises me. Five minutes is a lot.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He brushed aside his three second-place finishes so far in the
87th Tour. ``It's not important to win stages,'' he said. ``What's
important is to win in Paris'' where the three-week race ends next
Sunday. The best comparison of a bicycle tour race is to a golf
match. In golf, victory on individual holes does not matter
compared to the overall stroke total. In the Tour, stage victories
do not determine the winner, the least overall elapsed time does. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Propping the pillow more comfortably behind his head, Armstrong
was equally uninterested in judging whether he is the best climber
in the race. His power in the mountains he ascribes to his loss of
weight _ he weighed 180 pounds in 1996, when he dropped out of the
Tour a few months before his testicular cancer was diagnosed, to
160 pounds now _ and his use of a smaller gear and increased pedal
strokes as he moves uphill.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care to be called a climber,'' he said. ``I don't care
to be called a time trialist'' another discipline in which he
excels. ``It's important to be a complete rider. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm the second-best climber and the second-best time
trialist and that wins the Tour de France, perfect. Perfect.'' He
turned to a saying from golf, a hobby that he likes to think he
shows talent: ``Short game _ drive for show, putt for dough.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said his motivation to repeat as Tour champion was his
continuing inspiration to other cancer survivors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not as big a story as it was last year, but it's still
my main purpose,'' he said. ``It's still a big part of my
motivation. This race is about surviving and survival. To do it, at
least to participate, to try to win again, hopefully win again, is
survival. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Cancer people survive now. People live the rest of their lives
normally.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is another side to his motivation, and that is Armstrong's
quiet rage against the people he thinks showed him no respect after
his victory last year. These include the news media who suggested
that he used illegal drugs and the rivals who he said implied that
he would not have won if they had been in the race. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives me drive,'' he said, speaking of the criticism.
``Absolutely. Absolutely. You've got to get motivated by
something.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What about the positive influences? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a package,'' he said. ``There's the good energy, family
stuff, my place in the cancer world, all the right reasons. Then
there are the other things that just make me mad. Like somebody
having no respect for me in the race. That I use as well. You need
both.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time for the team dinner was nearing and Armstrong rose from his
bed and edged around his open suitcase that was on a table. ``Not
much room to move in this room,'' he said, straightening the
clothing in the suitcase, including his latest yellow jersey.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite his grumblings, Armstrong said he tried to be a good
person.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an obligation to be good people,'' he said. ``I can be
mean, I can yell and scream and cuss and be seemingly a bad person.
But at the end of the day, I'm going to do whatever it takes _ if I
was checking out that night _ to prove that I was a good guy.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it was giving back to the world of cancer, giving back
to the world in general, giving back to my family, giving back to
the sport _ whether it's financially or your time, whether it's
that yellow jersey in the suitcase, if it's just giving it away,
that's what you've got to do.'' &QL;

POLLSTERS IN MEXICO SAY PREDICTIONS OF FOX'S LEAD FOR PRESIDENT
WERE STIFLED 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM DILLON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Rafael Gimenez predicted the outcome of Mexico's
presidential elections with great accuracy, but few Mexicans knew
because his newspaper refused to publish his polls indicating that
Vicente Fox was leading the race.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo de la Pena was accused by a colleague of violating
professional ethics after he produced a survey showing Fox with a
healthy lead over the candidate from the party that governed Mexico
for 71 years.
</P>
<P>
   And Maria de las Heras, a third Mexican pollster, received phone
threats after her nationwide poll two weeks before the July 2 vote
showed Fox winning by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
   Before the elections, officials of the Institutional Revolution
Party, the governing party, known as the PRI, pressured editors and
producers not to publish or broadcast surveys showing Fox in the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Gimenez and at least one other pollster were sidelined at
newspapers after producing such surveys. And most of the polls
published just before a final deadline two weeks ahead of the vote
showed Francisco Labastida, the governing party candidate, leading
by a three- to four-point margin.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Fox's victory by seven percentage points stunned
nearly everyone, even Labastida, who had hired a well-known
Washington pollster, Stanley Greenberg, to produce his campaign
surveys. Several of Greenberg's polls, which were given wide
publicity here, showed Labastida with a sweeping lead, and none
ever showed Fox ahead.
</P>
<P>
   According to the official returns, Fox received 44 percent of
the votes and Labastida 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Now a debate is under way here about whether many respected
pollsters erred or whether millions of voters changed their minds
at the last minute. Some, including Greenberg, said that most of
the millions of Mexican voters who were counted as undecided chose
Fox once in the polling booth. Others said that fear of the
governing party prevented voters from confiding their real
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   The July 2 exit polls by the newspaper Reforma accurately
predicted the result, but its influential polls over the previous
months never showed Fox in the lead. Alejandro Moreno, Reforma's
chief pollster, said many of the governing party's hard-core
supporters, disciplined voters in previous balloting, had stayed
home on election day.
</P>
<P>
   De las Heras, who over a decade has conducted many polls on
contract to the governing party, said its tactic of giving away
washing machines and other items to supporters distorted surveys
because many voters told pollsters they intended to vote for the
party in hopes of receiving a gift.
</P>
<P>
   De las Heras' survey in mid-June, which was privately financed,
showed Fox with 44 percent and Labastida with 34 percent. It was
not published in Mexico, but The Dallas Morning News reported its
findings in an article on June 21. She was interviewed that morning
by Mexican talk show hosts astonished over her conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then suddenly my phone went silent,'' she recalled. ``The PRI
put out the order to the radio and TV stations: bury that witch!''
</P>
<P>
   Over the following days, she received several anonymous letters
and calls accusing her of being a traitor, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every poll published in Mexico that showed Fox in the
lead provoked a stir. The first, by De la Pena, was financed by a
consortium of parties _ including the PRI. He caused an uproar when
he reported in February that Fox was leading _ with almost exactly
the percentages that emerged in the election.
</P>
<P>
   Governing party officials criticized De la Pena's techniques to
his face and ridiculed him behind his back.
</P>
<P>
   Gimenez, who has a master's degree in survey research techniques
from the University of Connecticut, was treated more harshly. In
January, February and March, his polls in the newspaper Milenio
showed Fox running strong, and Gimenez told associates in April
that a new survey would show Fox taking the lead. But those results
were never published; instead, Milenio announced that he had been
replaced, and its new survey showing Labastida ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Gimenez was later hired to do surveys for Fox's center-right
party, and his final poll in late June showed Fox with 43 percent,
Labastida with 38 and the third major candidate, Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, with 17. Those results turned out to be more accurate
even than some exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us who concluded that Fox was going to win were made to
suffer,'' Gimenez said. ``The PRI discredited all of us, saying we
were careless, inept or sold out. So the election took the PRI by
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Labastida said in a television interview last week that he never
dreamed he could lose until election day exit polls announced Fox's
victory.

 &HT;    States 'Choose Life' license plates
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In Louisiana, ``Choose Life'' license plates
will be on cars this fall. In Virginia, the legislature will debate
them for the second time next year and in Ohio a contest is under
way to come up with a tag design to be voted on as early as
September.
</P>
<P>
   Each campaign has one thing in common: It was inspired by
Florida's anti-abortion movement.
</P>
<P>
   A bill allowing a ``Choose Life'' license plate in Florida was
signed into law in June by Gov. Jeb Bush but is currently tied up
in court. Inquiries from anti-abortion groups eager to try the same
tactics in their states are still trickling into the campaign's
Ocala headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Harris, the Marion County commissioner who came up with
the idea for the specialty plate in 1996 while stuck in traffic,
said national media coverage of the protests and lawsuit
surrounding the Florida campaign triggered hundreds of calls from
anti-abortion activists across the land and helped lead individuals
and organizations in 35 states to launch campaigns of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Bills authorizing ``Choose Life'' license plates have been
proposed in at least 10 states, said Russ Amerling, vice president
of the organization. Louisiana and Florida are the only states that
have passed the law.
</P>
<P>
   To promote their cause and germinate the idea, Harris said he
and his organization offered advice and waived copyright
restrictions for the bright yellow license plate logo, which shows
a crayon drawing of a boy and girl above the words ``Choose Life.''
(www.choose-life.org).
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute it hit the national news, we started getting
inquiries from around the country, and as a matter of fact, I need
to send Barry Silver a thank-you card for helping us get so much
more attention than we could have paid for,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Silver is a Boca Raton attorney and former Democratic state
representative who filed a suit saying the tags violated separation
of church and state. The suit was filed on behalf of the National
Organization for Women and Congregation L'Dor Va-Dor in Boynton
Beach, where Silver's father is the rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   If the plates ever hit the streets in Florida, proceeds from the
$22 fee will be funneled back to groups aiding expectant mothers.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of the money will go toward diapers, formula,
medicine and clothing. The remaining 30 percent would train
counselors for women who plan to give their children up for
adoption and to defray the cost of advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 16,000 plates were manufactured last fall at the state
prison in Raiford at a cost of between $21,000 and $35,000. They
will sit in a stockroom in Tallahassee until the courts decide
whether they can be used, said Tom Joyce, the director of the
Division of Motor Vehicles. If the courts ultimately decide to ban
them, they will be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Silver, who is again running for state representative, has
argued the tags amount to government support of the anti-abortion
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The license plate is a clear and present danger to the people
of Florida,'' Silver said. ``It has been the rallying cry
responsible for murders and vandalism, and it would give the green
light to would-be terrorists. When the state of Florida gives its
seal of approval upon a people who have no regard for the law or
human life, then that is very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislature first passed the bill creating the plates in
1998, but it was vetoed by Gov. Lawton Chiles, who said the plates
sent a divisive political message. Legislative supporters lobbied
for the tags again last year saying they were simply a tool to
support adoption. Bush signed the bill into law in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Since Harris came up with the idea of the plates, similar
campaigns have been tried unsuccessfully in California, Kentucky,
Indiana, Texas, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. In
Louisiana, the plates were approved in August but a design has not
been selected and the plates are not yet available, according to
Joann Rushing, Supervisor of the Special Plates Unit of the
Louisiana Department of Motor Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to get these things done in Louisiana because we
have a very pro-life legislature here,'' said Peg Kenny, who helped
organize the campaign after the idea was imported from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing said there has been little contention surrounding the
plates in her state. ``Personally, I don't think it's been
publicized,'' she said. ``People don't really know about them
yet.'' The state's largest newspaper, the New Orleans
Times-Picayune, has not run a story on the plate.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, State Delegate Richard Black sponsored a bill using
Florida's ``Choose Life'' design. The bill passed both the House
and Senate but stalled when the two chambers couldn't agree on
different versions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senate didn't like the word life, and they didn't like the
word choose,'' Black said. ``They changed it to something like
family friendly, so I had it stricken.''
</P>
<P>
   Black said he introduced the bill after hearing about Florida's
effort in 1998. ``We have 50 specialty license plates supporting
everything from the AFL-CIO to the NRA to encouraging people to
neuter their dogs and cats, and we just thought having a gentle
message of encouragement to expectant mothers was very
appropriate.'' Black said he intends to propose the bill again next
year.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, the plate was attached to a bill approving veterans
of foreign wars plates but was killed when plates supporting the
AFL-CIO and United Auto Workers were added to the bill, said Roger
Tennyson, the executive vice president of Indiana's Right To Life
organization. Tennyson also said he would attempt to push the bill
through again.
</P>
<P>
   Though Silver was not aware the campaign had been taken
nationwide, he said he wasn't surprised to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a concerted effort by the anti-choice movement
nationwide to try and chip away at church and state,'' Silver said.
``This is not a Florida issue; it's a national movement.''

WHY THOSE IRISH EYES ARE SMILING NOW

 By WARREN HOGE

<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ Ireland's economy has been growing faster than
any other in the Western world, and the country whose master
playwright, Sean O'Casey, once said, ``I'd rather be inspired by
idleness than bullied by `busyness' '' now has some of the
hardest-working citizens in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in its history, Ireland has a problem with
too much money, not too little _ with too few people living here,
not too many.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of what to keep, what to shed and what to adapt for
modern times is on lots of Irish minds as the country _ a proven
force in developing sustaining myths to overcome failure, poverty
and melancholy _ turns to coping with the novelty of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have tourists giving out about us that we've lost our
courtesy, that we don't have time to talk to one another anymore,
that our Irish identity is slipping away,'' said Maureen Gaffney,
head of The National Economic and Social Forum, a consultative
group partly financed by the government. ``We're very disturbed by
that, and I'm not a Cassandra, but I think we have the vibrancy
here to handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   From the cranes that lumber across the Dublin skyline to the
traffic jams that pile up along the Liffey as early as 6:30 a.m.,
progress is intruding. With so many opportunities at home,
Ireland's young professionals no longer leave and those that did a
generation ago have now come back. But one disruptive consequence
of this happy turnaround is a 20 percent-a-year spiral in the cost
of housing that is pricing the middle class out of city living.
</P>
<P>
   The look of new Dublin pubs seems to have more to do with the
East Coast of the United States than the West Coast of Ireland.
Typifying the trend, a former flower stand just off the landmark
Ha'penny Bridge has been turned into a minimalist cafe called
Pravda with Cyrillic lettering design features and a menu featuring
Thai wraps, tortillas and spicy chicken wings.
</P>
<P>
   There are 20,000 job openings, and an estimated 200,000 more
coming up in the next five years that will have to be filled by
foreigners. Executives are often out of town on recruitment trips,
and businesses have dropped their earlier insistence that
applicants speak English.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in a development that is bringing shame to Ireland, the
country that sent millions of people abroad as poor immigrants is
proving inhospitable to needy outsiders who are arriving here.
Despite the jobs in Dublin going wanting, asylum seekers, who now
number 1,000 a month, are being dispersed around the country and
barred from working. ``We thrived on tales of the Boston Brahmins
and `no Irish need apply,' '' said Maurice Hayes, a member of the
Irish Senate and chairman of the Ireland Funds, the country's
largest charity. ``Now we think the only immigrants we want are
people who otherwise would have gone directly to Silicon Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Car sales are up 40 percent this year over 1999, and traffic
congestion projected for the year 2010 has already arrived, but
highway construction to accommodate all the new vehicles lags.
Rural areas even 40 miles out of Dublin are becoming bedroom
communities, with country lanes pressed into service to handle the
new commuting class. ``Nobody thought ahead about this, and you
can't just go out and buy a mile of road down at Woolworth's,''
said Colm McCarthy of DKM Economic Consultants Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Public services in particular are suffering from underfinancing
and a lack of planning, and their downtroddenness stands out
starkly against the shine and efficiency of the booming private
sector. Last year, nurses went on strike for higher wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nurses were working so hard they were really and truly
bent,'' said Mary Tynan, 48, the head emergency room nurse at
Beaumont Hospital. Describing the nurses' desperation, she said the
value of the house she bought for $12,000 in 1979 was now $265,000,
and people on public salaries could not afford to buy homes
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Inflation is running at 5.2 percent, three times the average of
the other 10 countries that have adopted the euro currency and
therefore a centralized interest rate. That rate now is 4.25
percent, at least four points lower than where analysts say the
Irish central bank would peg it if it were still operating
independently. While participation in Europe over all has been
enormously beneficial to Ireland, bringing subsidies that helped
spur the boom, the government finds its hands tied in coping with
inflation without the customary rate-increase mechanism at its
disposal. ``It's like playing tennis without a racket,'' McCarthy
said.
</P>
<P>
   With inflation threatening to overtake negotiated wage increases
of 5.5 percent, union leaders are questioning the national
business-labor agreement that since 1987 has brought wage restraint
in exchange for job growth.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   An emphasis on computer literacy and information technologies is
creating a permanent underclass as it spreads affluence, and the
abundance of things is spawning what Hayes called relative
deprivation. ``People who were poor now have more to eat,'' he
said, ``but they don't have a television, and everyone down at the
pub is talking about what they saw on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Social habits are changing, breaking down traditional patterns
of association. ``You used to be part of an extended family or a
village,'' said Brendan Keenan, 55, business editor of The
Independent. ``Even after you came to Dublin, you were a Corkman or
a Galwayman, and that's who you socialized and drank with. Now you
might have one set of friends at work and another at home, and home
isn't around the corner, it might be in a suburb.''

<P>
   The government has attracted admiration for its success in
steering the process that has brought the promise of an end to a
century's sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland, but it is
squandering its reputation through revelations from tribunals of
cronyism and corruption that still permeate Ireland's public life.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Madden, 38, of Ballsbridge Motors in one of Dublin's
upscale neighborhoods, is a salesman with a prospering clientele
who want to swan around in eye-catching cars and stock their
garages with extra ones from the sports and convertible lines.
``When I began in this business, people bought cars as a
necessity,'' he said. ``Now they buy them as indulgences.''
</P>
<P>
   Madden is making more money than he ever dreamed possible, and
his company will move 6,000 Mercedes-Benzes off its jammed lots
this year. ``Ten years ago,'' he said, ``we'd have had a
celebration if we sold 600.''
</P>
<P>
   But seated in his busy showroom, he was not in a party mood.
``I'm here from 8 in the morning to 8 at night, and I can genuinely
say it's not healthy for me or my family. I cannot be the husband
and father I want to be at night after days like these, and I hear
my colleagues around the floor say the same thing. We don't feel
self-rewarded by the good times we're in.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a consensus that the two biggest changes in Ireland are
the fall of the Roman Catholic Church as social arbiter and the
rise of women as active participants in society.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Kennelly, a leading poet and professor of modern
literature at Trinity College, Dublin, said the most important
development in Irish letters was the emergence of talented women
among writers. ``From being adored symbols on pedestals, women have
come down to become articulate voices, no longer passive receivers
of homage but expressive of their own problems and the problems in
the culture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ireland's new generation of outspoken women is Ivana
Bacik, 32, who as the Reid professor of criminal law at Trinity
occupies the same post once held by the current president of
Ireland, Mary McAleese, and by her predecessor, Mary Robinson. ``I
grew up in Cork in the 1970s, and Ireland was a horrible place to
be,'' she said. ``People are misconceiving the past. There has
always been huge poverty and huge hypocrisy, but now you can talk
openly about them. When I was a student here in the early 1990s, it
was radical to be in favor of even giving information to women.''
</P>
<P>
   The boom has happened so speedily that some people are not yet
convinced that it is here to stay. ``Irish history has been one of
uninterrupted failure since the beginning of the 19th century, and
this has impinged on our psychology,'' Keenan said. ``The big
question for many people now is when is it going to end, because
they remember that everything else eventually went wrong. The
question for them is not what are the consequences but where's the
catch?''
</P>
<P>
   Keenan believes it will last. ``It's simple,'' he said. ``In the
euro zone, having a young, well-educated population is like having
oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason Ireland seems to be weathering the rapid and
profound cultural shock of the past decade reasonably well is the
solidarity built up over centuries from being small, compact,
homogeneous and deprived. ``Say what you will about the Catholic
Church,'' Hayes said, ``there was something important for us in
having been told over and over of being all together and equal
before God.''
</P>
<P>
   Fintan O'Toole, a columnist and author who travels to New York
once a month to do theater reviews for The Daily News, credited
Ireland's particular ease with America. ``Ireland is a culture
besotted with American images,'' he said. ``What's happened with
all this American investment is that you have come to us, and
instead of making us change, it gives us a way to continue with our
old life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ireland was not as comfortable with its stereotype as it
pretended to be for its own survival, he said, and there is little
nostalgia for the misty past.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan said: ``No one wants dear old Ireland back. Dear old
Ireland was nice for the tourists, but not for us.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also little gloating at how well things seem to have
worked out. ``There is real pleasure in the fact that economists
and politicians now come over here to find out how we did it and in
the realization that we are world class because we were always
considered second rate,'' Keenan said.
</P>
<P>
   Gaffney said she thought that the Irish today drew strength from
the unity gained, paradoxically, from having been dispersed around
the globe. ``We were supposed to represent our country as well as
ourselves and not just competently but with skill and confidence,''
she said. ``There was a tremendous emphasis on the presentation of
ourselves to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ireland got through hard times on this ability to compose its
own narrative, and that same talent may keep it secure and distinct
through the good times. ``You know, in Gaelic, when you greet
someone, the actual words mean, `What's your news?' '' Kennelly
said. ``We live on stories. I always think of that phrase, `I am
the way, the truth and the light.' You see, the truth comes second;
it's the way that matters. It's how you tell things. And that is
the oldest Irish tradition.''

TALK ABOUNDS ON CAMP DAVID TALKS _ BUT NOT FROM PARTICIPANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ As the scheduled departure of President Clinton
for an overseas trip begins to crowd in on the Camp David summit
talks, the stream of chatter by Israelis and Palestinians on the
outside who say they know what is going on inside rose steadily
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And what they say _ some of it gloomy, some of it upbeat and all
of it calculated to influence opinion back home in the Middle East
_ is that it is still too early to tell whether there will be an
agreement at all or, if there is one, what kind of agreement it
will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it is impossible to know where it is heading,'' said
an official who has spoken to summit participants by telephone.
``That's the good news.''
</P>
<P>
   A common assumption is that it will not be clear until Tuesday,
the eve of Clinton's scheduled departure for Japan, whether the
talks are ``going in the right direction or not,'' the official
added.
</P>
<P>
   Only then would the White House decide whether the talks were
ripe enough to warrant keeping Clinton at Camp David and sending
Vice President Al Gore to the meeting in Okinawa of the leaders of
the world's major industrial nations, known as the Group of Seven.
Clinton is scheduled to leave on Wednesday to join other leaders
there and meet the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has been saying since the opening of the summit
meeting that Clinton would go to Okinawa. But in the lead up to
Camp David, and in private, Clinton administration officials have
said that, for the president, the Okinawa trip was not necessarily
written in stone.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that it was premature to assess whether there would
be any kind of accord was that, so far, there has been no real test
of wills, according to those who have spoken to participants. The
Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, and the Israeli prime minister,
Ehud Barak, have not yet been through a major blow-up on the
substance of the issues, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues are the most nettlesome separating the two sides,
including borders, water rights, the fate of Palestinian refugees
and what to do about Jerusalem, which both Israelis and
Palestinians claim as their capital.
</P>
<P>
   Only once a ``big crisis'' occurs _ a threat to walk out, a
defiant refusal to compromise on an issue _ will it be known
whether there is going to be a breakdown or a breakthrough, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, there was what one official called a ``small
crisis'' involving Arafat when he was presented with some proposals
on resolving the status of Jerusalem. The Palestinians let it be
known that Arafat threatened to leave because the proposals,
apparently presented by the Americans, were too close to the
Israeli public position.
</P>
<P>
   But one Palestinian official said the flareup appeared to be
tactical. If he is to compromise, Arafat, who has insisted for
decades that East Jerusalem must be the capital of a Palestinian
state, could not afford to stay hidden at Camp David and then
emerge having deviated significantly from his stance, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel Sunday, where tens of thousands demonstrators marched
in Rabin Square in Tel Aviv against proposals that would allow some
settlements to remain inside a Palestinian state, there was a flow
of gloomy talk &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister David Levy, who refused to come to the summit
meeting with Barak, said that the gaps between the parties remained
as wide as ever. Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, who tends to be
less harsh in his judgments, told Israeli Radio: ``It is hard at
this point to give some kind of impression of optimism more than
yesterday, or the day before yesterday, because there has been no
breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, Mayor Ehud Olmert held a meeting at City Hall to
express concern about the future of the city. Eli Yishair, the
leader of the Shas party, which quit Barak's government just before
the prime minister's departure for Camp David, told the gathering:
``The president of the United States has to understand that here,
the people of Israel are mostly united. Most of the people are
against dividing Jerusalem. Most of the people are for a untied
Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   A cabinet minister, Haim Ramon, again spoke out about Jerusalem
on Sunday, sending a warning that concessions on the city were
impossible and that, as he has often stated, the future status of
Jerusalem should be decided at another time.
</P>
<P>
   And in keeping with this fairly stern line from the home front,
Israel Radio reported from the summit meeting that the Israeli
delegation at Camp David believed Palestinian officials were
spreading upbeat interpretations about the talks in order to avoid
being blamed for a breakdown.

 &HT;    Alliance dodges laws for election
 &HT;    By Marcia Gelbart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ As trial lawyers nationwide pour money from
the tobacco settlement into election efforts against Republicans,
Florida's leading pro-business lobby is quietly mobilizing to
protect its business-friendly allies in the state legislature.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual twist, the influential lobbying group, Associated
Industries of Florida, isn't relying on the state Republican Party
for help. Instead, it has created a for-profit corporation that can
side-step campaign finance laws, raising as much money as it wants
from whomever it wants and spending any or all of it on any
candidate _ all in secret. This is the result of a December court
ruling that allows corporations and political committees to operate
unchecked in influencing elections.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Alliance for Florida's Economy, the corporation
illustrates how the business community in Florida and across the
nation is increasingly intervening to elect candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now you have got 11 law firms in Florida that have just
become the recipients of $300 million apiece,'' said Tom Slade,
former chairman of the Republican Party of Florida. ``To think they
would not try to change the philosophical makeup of the
legislature, you'd be naive.''
</P>
<P>
   Slade is president of the Tallahassee firm Tidewater Consulting,
which jointly owns the for-profit corporation with Associated
Industries of Florida. AIF will continue to donate money through
its own political committee.
</P>
<P>
   Their goal _ detailed in a 12-page plan that reads like a
marketing strategy _ is to raise $2.75 million from up to 20
companies before the Sept. 5 primary. The money will be used for
direct mail, phone polls, commercials and advertisements to elect
pro-business candidates in 16 House races and four Senate races
(neither races nor companies are identified in the plan). Excluding
dollars set aside for salaries and other costs, that amounts to
$75,000 per House race and $300,000 per Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because political parties at the state level do not get
involved in primary elections, it is possible that business dollars
contributed to the state parties will be used to support
anti-business candidates in the general election,'' states the
plan, mailed anonymously to several Florida newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is not to compete with the Republican Party for
contributions but to augment what they get, Slade said.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes this election year are high, with more than a third
of the legislature guaranteed to turn over in November because of
term limits and the redistricting decisions that the victors will
make in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Formed in February before the start of the annual lawmaking
session, the corporation is the first known group to take advantage
of a new campaign finance loophole that eliminates all reporting
rules about campaign disclosures. Legislators knew throughout the
session that the loophole existed and maintain they wanted to mend
it. But that never happened because of a last-minute bill change on
the last day of session; time simply ran out, GOP leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the corporation's existence gains more notice, some
political observers aren't so sure failure to close the loophole
was an accident. ``It raises suspicions in my mind,'' said Ben
Wilcox of the nonprofit watchdog group Common Cause.
</P>
<P>
   Slade said he lobbied nobody about keeping the loophole open.
``There's nothing secret about the fact that there is an
organization called the Alliance,'' he said. ``But we're not
required legally to disclose, and unapologetically, again, we are
not going to disclose.''
</P>
<P>
   One near-certain beneficiary of the corporation's goodwill is
Republican Rep. Art Argenio, a Stuart chiropractor who faces a
primary rematch against attorney Joe Negron, also a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he needs some help, he will get it,'' Slade said Friday,
calling the race ``a clear example of our purpose.'' He described
Negron as ``an anti-business, pro-trial-lawyer candidate,'' while
noting that Argenio scored first among his 119 House colleagues in
an end-of-the-year scorecard by the Associated Industries of
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   To Slade and others, the corporation is the business community's
response to the trial lawyers' nasty campaign attacks two years
ago. That's when the Academy of Florida Trial Lawyers, through a
front group called the Coalition for Family Safety, dumped almost
$400,000 into campaigns against five legislators who each voted for
lawsuit reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The business community sat back, stunned when two of those
legislators lost, Sen. Charles Williams, D-Tallahassee, and Rep.
Ralph Livingston, R-Fort Myers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no such thing (in 1998) as what we are attempting to
put together, to step in and defend Williams against the economic
onslaught of the trial lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said his group doesn't intend to launch the first attack
in any race, only to react if and when the Coalition for Family
Safety or another trial lawyer-backed group fires first. It's like
this, Slade said: ``You build a military force if you are a nation
and hope you never have to use it. We hope we don't have to
deploy.''
</P>
<P>
   But raising all the money _ less than half has so far been
collected, Slade said _ could prove tough, especially from GOP
donors. With Republicans already in control of the executive and
legislative branches, the challenge will be to convince
contributors of the urgency to give money.
</P>
<P>
   The corporation's written plan addresses that urgency by
highlighting the need to ``effectively counter the Academy of
Florida Trial Lawyers and other anti-business forces in their
efforts to upset the pro-business climate in the Florida
Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   Lance Block, the academy's president and a West Palm Beach
attorney, is far from surprised. ``We're the face on the dartboard
every two years when they want to raise money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the political agenda of the trial attorneys has been
stymied by the Republican-dominated legislature, the business
community has had tremendous successes in capping civil lawsuit
awards. ``What is it that they didn't get in 1999? Do they want to
close the courthouse down?'' Block said.
</P>
<P>
   As to the trial lawyers' own political intentions this campaign
season, Block said no decisions have been made.
</P>
<P>
   Barney Bishop, who once helped run the political wing at the
Academy of Trial Lawyers, said the corporation is doing little
different from what other organizations have done in the past, in
terms of candidate assistance and campaign involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop _ a former executive director of the Florida Democratic
Party and the corporation's only Democrat on its board of directors
_ said the corporation, with its for-profit status, is an example
of taking that involvement to the next step.
</P>
<P>
   And, noting the surprise losses of 1998 campaigns, he said:
``It's the legacy of those elections.''

JONES JUMPS PAST HER CONCERNS, BUT JOYNER-KERSEE FALLS SHORT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The warning signs for failure had been
there all season. And when Marion Jones looked to see whether her
second long jump Sunday had been fair or foul, she saw the official
raise a red flag. Foul. She had stepped beyond the takeoff board.
One more foul, or a jump shorter than 20 feet 11\ inches, and she
would be out of the Olympic trials. Any hopes of winning five gold
medals at the 2000 Summer Games would be gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a blink of any eye, I said, `OK, I've got one more. If I
don't get into it, this dream will be over,''' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Then she looked into the stands and saw her coach, Trevor
Graham, and her husband, C.J. Hunter, making encouraging gestures.
No problem, she thought. If she got a legal jump, it would be far.
She had to make the top eight to qualify for the final three jumps,
and she comfortably sailed into fourth place with a leap of 22-1},
puffing her cheeks and exhaling in relief afterward.
</P>
<P>
   But she was not finished. Before the competition was over, Jones
had jumped 23-0{. It was the fourth-longest jump in the world this
year and clear evidence that she could compete for a gold medal in
the event at the Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Burrell, who defeated Jones at the 1999 national
championships, was second at 22-10{, and Shana Williams was third
at 22-6{.
</P>
<P>
   The comeback of Jackie Joyner-Kersee, however, fell short. The
greatest female athlete of her generation finished sixth at 21-10},
never seeming comfortable on the runway, chopping her steps and
never making a serious threat to qualify for her fifth Olympic
team.
</P>
<P>
   However, Joyner-Kersee, 38, is a friend and idol to Jones, and
she spoke some assuring words before Jones took her pressure-filled
third jump. ``Just get a fair jump and you'll be easily into the
finals,'' Joyner-Kersee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was quite concerned,'' Jones said. But if she was, she did
not show that to her competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marion's a great competitor, but what I admire is that she
knew exactly what to do,'' Joyner-Kersee said. ``If you're going to
be the best in the world, you can't be worried about what's
happening, only about what you have to do to execute. I didn't feel
any concern in her voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Her winning jump was nearly a foot short of her career best of
23-11}, but it was within a few inches of the year's best of 23-3\
set by Fiona May of Italy. As significant as the distance of
Jones's victory was her grace under pressure and the fierceness of
her desire to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   She had won the 100 meters on Saturday in 10.88 seconds, the
second-fastest time in the world this year, and she needed three
jumps Sunday to adjust her searing speed to the runway. She also
needed time to acclimate herself to a strong tailwind that pushed
her toward the takeoff board, forcing her to chop her steps on her
first two jumps, both fouls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was aware of the wind,'' Jones said of her third jump. ``I
stayed on the runway until I had a nice gust and it worked out
perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, facing much criticism about her clumsy technique,
Jones decided to simplify her style, dropping any pretense at
technical expertise and relying on her speed to jump far. ``I tried
to change too much, to turn her into a power jumper,'' said Trevor
Graham, her coach. ``Last year, she tried to get a big hop on the
takeoff board, but she didn't go anywhere. She went up and right
back down. This year, we're forgetting all about that and we'll use
her speed.''
</P>
<P>
   She began the season with a disappointing jump of 20-7 in May in
Japan, then leaped 22-10{ on June24 at the Prefontaine Classic in
Eugene, Ore., but her jumping remained erratic. She qualified only
fifth on Friday night at the trials with a mediocre jump of 21-6},
and seemed to wince in the pit after one ungraceful landing.
Several jumping experts, including the world-record holder Mike
Powell, have offered to help Jones, but each time they have been
rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She might do something right and the world record could
happen,'' Powell said. ``But it's better to know for sure `I can do
this,' as opposed to rolling the dice. She needs to know how to run
the runway and jump instead of just sprinting.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham said that others were just seeking news media attention
and Jones said she would never abandon the coach who had nurtured
her career to such dominance in the sprints. She did, after all,
win three national titles and a bronze medal at the 1999 world
championships with Graham as her coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to criticize regardless,'' Jones said.
``We've decided we're going to focus on what Marion has to do. I
knew I still had a long jump in me and I was able to carry
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee, however, did not have a long jump in her, and she
could only match a distance that she had jumped back in her college
days at UCLA. She retired in 1998 and, in her comeback, did not
show any of the form that won her an Olympic gold medal in the long
jump in 1988 and bronzes in 1992 and 1996. She said she felt some
discomfort in her left leg, passed on her fifth jump, then ran
through the pit on her sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't there,'' she said, adding that she had no regrets
about attempting a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was a long shot,'' Joyner-Kersee said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said that this would in no way diminish the
accomplishments of her idol.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't take anything away from Jackie,'' Jones said.
``In my opinion, she's the greatest ever. Nothing will take away
from that.'' &QL;

NOCHE FLAMENCA: HOT AND GETTING HOTTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Noche Flamenca has acquired a large and enthusiastic
following since its founding in 1993. The company knows how to put
on a stylish show. And it did that on Saturday night at the
Connelly Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Soledad Barrio, the company's lead dancer, has grown immensely
as an artist. Always fiery, she seemed possessed by smoldering,
do-or-die flamenco passion in the solea, her one solo on the
program. The dance built, too, to a fever pitch of intensity.
</P>
<P>
   There was none of the elegance of the traditional long flamenco
back here either, but rather a carved arch, in a short and sturdy
body that had all the earthy urgency of the program's impressive
singing. Barrio's hard-working, articulate feet had the same rough
beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Santangelo, the company's founder and director, achieves
a remarkable balance between the new and the old in his savvy
staging of the program. His new piece, ``La Plaza,'' places chairs
and shifting performers about the entire stage space to achieve the
sense of a crowded place and then magically proceeds to create a
separate and solitary world as one by one each dancer rises and
moves among the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Mark London's lighting designs are a fugue of hard, glistening
daylight and dense shadow. The coolness and somewhat distanced
virtuosity of the program's other dancers provide a welcome respite
from Barrio's scorching fire. An entire evening of her dancing
would probably fill the city's coronary wards.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno Argento was the group's shimmering lead pyrotechnician,
but conciseness would have made his solo more powerful. Alejandra
Ramirez's slightly teasing minimalist approach to flamenco was
charming, in a fine company completed by Ana Romero, Eva Marin and
the boyish Noe Barroso.
</P>
<P>
   The exuberant, impressive musicians were Silverio Heredia and
Antonio Vizarraga, both singers; the guitarists Arcadio Marin and
Jose Valle, and the percussionist Jose Antonio Galicia, whose
opening number was a soul-stirring tour de force of theater.
</P>
<P>
   Noche Flamenca performs through Aug. 13 at the Connelly (220 E.
4th St.) and will appear Aug. 22 to 27 at the Jacob's Pillow Dance
Festival in Becket, Mass.

TUA WOULD BE TRUE TEST FOR LEWIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ OK, with that out of the way, it gets interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Lennox Lewis, who disposed of overmatched Francois Botha in less
than two rounds on Saturday in London, is expected to face the No.1
contender and his most legitimate challenger - David Tua - in
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Tua is the next fight,'' said Panos Eliades, Lewis'
promoter. ``We're negotiating.''
</P>
<P>
   Tua, a Samoan who fights out of New Zealand, is much like Mike
Tyson but younger and better at this point. And he doesn't seem to
be the type who would be overwhelmed by the moment, as Michael
Grant was against Lewis in April.
</P>
<P>
   Like Tyson, Tua is relatively small, about 5-foot-10, probably
too small for the 6-5 and immensely strong Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   However, he's legit. He has the ferocity and power to take
anyone out - no one who has seen him fight would dispute that - and
can hold his own in terms of boxing skills. In other words, he
probably won't beat Lewis - but it's a realistic possibility.
</P>
<P>
   And that's all we can ask: A big, strong, talented heavyweight
champion against a hungry challenger bent on taking his head off
and the ability to do it.
</P>
<P>
   No fight fan will want to miss it.
</P>
<P>
   And then comes Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Lewis beats Tua, it'll be tricky to make a match with
the former champion: Lewis is an HBO fighter, and Tyson has a
contract with Showtime and neither network will be eager to allow
its fighter to perform on the rival network.
</P>
<P>
   A comment made by Seth Abraham, head of sports at HBO,
illustrates the potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the heavyweight champion, they've got the
challenger.... We've got the jewels,'' he told Reuters but failed
to mention that Tyson is the much bigger draw.
</P>
<P>
   However, one has to think they'll find a way for all parties to
make gobs of money and make the fight.
</P>
<P>
   And although Tyson probably wouldn't beat Lewis, he has nearly
the same puncher's chance as Tua to win the championship for a
third time.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Tyson would bring his star power and intrigue to
what would be a huge money maker. Eliades said Tyson could earn as
much as $30 million in a fight with Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, boxing fans will buy into it in a big way even if Tyson
has little chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Tua and Tyson, there is a wasteland. For example, Lewis'
handlers have mentioned Vladimir Klitschko as a potential opponent
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, enjoy this period of heavyweight boxing. It
might not be as competitive as we would like, but it's hard to turn
away when Tua and Tyson are fighting, particularly when they're
fighting Lewis - or, perhaps, each other.
</P>
<P>
   If Tua beats Lewis, a fight with Tyson would be very easy to
make. Tua also is a Showtime fighter and both have the same
promoter.
</P>
<P>
   Step aside? Tua, who faces Robert Daniels on Friday in Las
Vegas, was asked during an interview on ESPN2 whether he'd accept a
significant amount of money to step aside and allow Lewis to fight
Tyson in his next bout.
</P>
<P>
   His response: No way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to step down for nobody,'' he said. `` ...My
destiny will not be unfulfilled. Not Tyson, not Evander Holyfield,
not even the networks will stop me from fulfilling my dreams and
from fulfilling my destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way Lennox Lewis will not face David Tua come
November is if his wife tells him to retire. There's only one
problem with that: Lennox isn't married.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker watch: Lance ``Mount'' Whitaker (20-1, 17 KOs) faces
David Dixon (21-3-2, 19 KOs) on the Tua-Daniels undercard - his
second fight after returning from knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley product is normally very quiet but unloaded on Dixon
verbally at a news conference when Dixon said he knocked Whitaker
down with a jab during a sparring session a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Whitaker said, he pounded Dixon for two rounds and
Dixon never returned. The two sparred before Dixon became a
replacement opponent for Whitaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him he's dead meat (at the news conference),'' Whitaker
said. `` ... He said he knocked me down with a jab. He could have
at least said he knocked me down with a right hand. Geez.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker said the year off from boxing did him good.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole mental state has changed,'' he said. ``I'm more
serious now than I've ever been. I'm stronger in every way. And I
think I know what it takes now to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I can do. I'm confident. I've found myself a
little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitaker hopes to fight for a world title next year.
</P>
<P>
   New beginning: Jeremy Williams, the talented heavyweight from
Long Beach with the questionable chin, said he's moving down to
cruiserweight (190 pounds) and hopes to fight as early as next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who is 6-foot-2 but fought at a relatively slight
215-220 pounds, has always had ability but couldn't handle big
heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a toll on my body and my spirit,'' Williams said of
fighting bigger men. ``I'm already down to 205. A little
dedication, a little dieting and I'll be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban Ramon Garbey is one possible opponent for Williams, who
doesn't want to ease into the division.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: Former champ Michael Nunn missed a big
opportunity when he canceled his bout with Clinton Woods on the
Lewis-Botha undercard.
</P>
<P>
   Nunn, who said he injured his hand in sparring, would have been
in line to face Roy Jones Jr. had he won.
</P>
<P>
   The fight still could take place when Nunn recovers, but he
missed out on valuable exposure and, at 37, he has no time to
waste....
</P>
<P>
   Julio Cesar Chavez, 38, reportedly has trained hard and long for
his July 29 challenge of WBC super lightweight champ Kostya Tszyu
and promises a knockout.
</P>
<P>
   He reportedly was a few pounds above the 140-pound limit a month
before the fight. However, even if that were true, don't expect
much from him: He's simply not the fighter he once was. Let's just
hope one of the great champions of our time doesn't embarrass
himself or get hurt....
</P>
<P>
   The Aug. 12 Evander Holyfield-John Ruiz fight on Showtime will
be available on pay-per-view to those who don't subscribe to the
cable station.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield and Ruiz are fighting for the WBA heavyweight belt,
which was unrightfully stripped from Lewis....
</P>
<P>
   Showtime has an interesting card set for Aug. 5 in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Zab Judah, one of the better fighters pound-for-pound in the
world, defends his IBF junior welterweight title against former
champ Terronn Millett and rising lightweight contender Juan Lazcano
faces another former champ, Jesse ``James'' Leija.
</P>
<P>
   Millett was stripped of the IBF championship and Judah knocked
out Jan Bergman to win the vacant title.
</P>
<P>
   Lazcano, of Sacramento, has won nine consecutive fights, eight
by knockout....
</P>

Johnson on Aug. 11 in New York, also on Showtime....

MARK MORRIS DANCE GROUP: STAYING COOL AND IN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK ANDERSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ As a maker of dances, Mark Morris is
unpredictable. Sometimes his choreography is wonderfully inventive.
At other times it is merely facile. It was both on the night of
July 13 when the Mark Morris Dance Group performed as an attraction
of the American Dance Festival in Page Auditorium on the Duke
University campus here.
</P>
<P>
   One thing about Morris remains predictable. He loves to have his
dances accompanied by live music. On this occasion a chamber
ensemble of instrumentalists and singers was in the pit under the
direction of Ethan Iverson. They did much to make the program
theatrically exciting.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately ``Sang-Froid,'' Morris' premiere, did not show him
at his choreographic best. The production was commissioned by the
festival through the Doris Duke Awards for New Work. Much of the
choreography to Chopin piano music played by Iverson fit the title
by being determinedly controlled. Although it initially attracted
attention because of its unruffled composure, it ultimately proved
as drab as the simple black costumes Elizabeth Kurtzman designed
for the dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Feet pattered. Dancers slapped the floor with their hands,
collapsed and straightened up again. In one effective sequence, to
the so-called ``Minute Waltz,'' some dancers kept trying to hurry
past other dancers who stood in their way like turnstiles or
roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   There was a deliberate lack of energy to much of the
proceedings. One episode was to a mazurka that Michel Fokine early
in the 20th century used in ``Les Sylphides,'' his great ballet to
Chopin. Fokine created exultant leaps to this music. Morris also
devised leaps. But these were low ones.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Chopin's music was always emotionally juicy, Morris'
choreography stayed dry. One wondered what his reasons were for
showing so much sang-froid at such great length.
</P>
<P>
   It was also hard to care much about ``The Argument,'' even
though this work to Schumann depicted quarreling couples. These
squabblers moved brusquely and stamped their feet a lot, yet with a
surprising lack of commitment. At this performance ``The Argument''
lost its sting.
</P>
<P>
   Both ``The Argument'' and ``Sang-froid'' were offered before the
intermission. After the intermission the choreography and the
dancing steadily improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bedtime'' was accompanied by Schubert songs about the night.
At first night seemed a quiet time. Dancers moved gently, as if to
solace other people who were curled up like sleepers on the floor.
Dancers also darted lightly, as if symbolizing pleasant dreams.
Then dreams turned into nightmares, as dancers rushed wildly to
``The Erl-king,'' a song about a little boy abducted by an evil
spirit. Some passages of hopping, which possibly were intended to
be grotesque, looked comic instead. But the choreography as a whole
was appropriately feverish.
</P>
<P>
   Bouncy piano pieces by Richard Cumming, played by Iverson,
inspired Morris to create bouncy choreography for Joe Bowie and
Matthew Rose in ``Silhouettes.'' This was a duet. Yet it was one in
which the two dancers never touched. Nevertheless they always
appeared to sense each other's presence. They stayed emotionally
together even when the dance steps drew them apart.
</P>
<P>
   The evening came to a warmhearted conclusion with ``Dancing
Honeymoon,'' a work of 1998 that is one of Morris' most felicitous
creations in recent years. People cavorted in a breezy nonchalant
manner to a suite of old pop songs sung by Eileen Clark. The
dancers also kept shifting, standing on and climbing over a set of
folding chairs. Eventually they tossed the chairs back and forth
through the air in an eccentric game of catch. ``Dancing
Honeymoon'' was a buoyant choreographic excursion.

NEW WEB SITES COVER POLITICAL RACES AND WORK WITH PARTIES
</HEADLINE>
  By REBECCA FAIRLEY RANEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the experimental environment of political information on the
Net, two commercial Web sites, including one whose news operation
is directed by the prominent journalist Carl Bernstein, are
covering the elections and political conventions while maintaining
partnerships under contract with the political parties.
</P>
<P>
   One company, SpeakOut.com, is providing technical tools at no
charge to both parties to create systems to manage the online
presentation of their party platforms. In exchange, the parties
promote the company's Web site, through linking and other means.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, Voter.com, is charging campaigns to post
information in its candidate sections as well as maintaining
contracts with the major political parties in which party
representatives ``advise Voter.com on ways to maintain `balanced
partisanship' in the way the Voter.com Web site presents
candidates, issues, and procedures,'' according to a press release
on the site. The parties, under the contract, also agree to promote
the site.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies present news coverage of the parties and
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein, executive editor for Voter.com, said that the news
operation and the political division, which handles contracts with
campaigns and parties, maintained ``an absolute separation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The news operation is absolutely sacrosanct,'' Bernstein said.
He also said that ``one of the reasons I am here is to ensure that
on the Web there is a first-rate political Web site with the
highest news value.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the company's contractual agreements with the
campaigns were no different from the relationships between
mainstream news organizations and advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   On the Web site, however, the content that the campaigns provide
is not clearly identified as advertising, nor does the site
indicate that campaigns had paid to place the information on those
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua King, vice president of external affairs for
SpeakOut.com, said that the company maintained a wall between the
news operation and the political division, which manages the
partnerships with the parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proof is on the site,'' he said. ``You'll find things on
our site that are critical and laudatory of all political
persuasions.''
</P>
<P>
   These relationships raise questions about the distinction
between news organizations and information providers, said Bob
Steele, director of the ethics program at the Poynter Institute for
Media Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as an information site,'' he said, ``the content should
be taken with a large grain of salt if the site is beholden to the
politicians and the parties rather than to the citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele added, ``It sounds like in both of these sites that there
are connective tissues between the information content and the
groups and individuals who are the subjects of reporting that
appear to be very problematic.''

 &HT;    Aventura Haiti president
 &HT;    By Noah Bierman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Bonivert Claude is running for president
of Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Forget that few observers of Haitian politics have heard of him
and that most predict Jean Bertrand Aristide will steamroll his way
back into office.
</P>
<P>
   And ignore that his campaign consultants live in West Palm
Beach, have never been to Haiti and have never run a candidate for
national office (of any country).
</P>
<P>
   Those potential setbacks pale in comparison with his biggest
obstacle to leading the Caribbean nation: He lives in Aventura, a
Miami suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Its mixture of retirees from New York and young professionals _
equipped with golf clubs and laptops, Buicks and minivans _ doesn't
exactly resemble the population of his homeland, where 60 percent
of the people don't have jobs.
</P>
<P>
   So why does Claude think 6.8 million Haitians want him to lead
them?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Haitian people are fed up. They want a change,'' he said
Thursday. ``But they are afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Claude, 55, doesn't come without a strong resume. From 1991 to
1994, he governed the country's central bank. The economist
graduated summa cum laude from Haitian business and law schools and
received additional training in Washington, D.C., from the
International Monetary Fund Institute.
</P>
<P>
   A few Latin American and Caribbean candidates _ notably Aristide
_ have lived abroad before taking the presidency, but their exile
has usually been forced and their following traditionally has been
established before they had any hope of winning office. Aristide,
for example, won the election while he lived in Haiti; he came to
the United States only after a military dictatorship prevented him
from taking office.
</P>
<P>
   In a more recent example, Eddie Varon Levy, a Los Angeles
resident, is expected to take a position in the Mexican Congress
because his party scored enough votes in the July 2 election to
place him there, according to newspaper accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the present era, politics is not the same,'' Claude said.
``We have to campaign internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Claude tapped West Palm Beach consulting firm
Patriot Games to lead his money-raising effort. Patriot Games
partners Richard Giorgio and Francine Nelson hope to use this
international foray to propel their own careers. While their
consulting practice has grown to include candidates from around the
state since its founding five years ago, neither of them has
ventured beyond Florida's borders for clients. Claude came to them
through contacts he made in the Jewish Federation, who Giorgio had
worked with in the past, Giorgio said.
</P>
<P>
   Giorgio and Nelson have spent late nights in front of Internet
pages studying Haitian politics, a subject in which even academics
are reluctant to claim expertise. They won't say what they're
charging Claude, just that the great workload demands a higher fee
than they charge domestic clients.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign reports from March elections showed Boca Raton City
Councilor Susan Haynie paid the firm $6,000. Haiti does not require
candidates to disclose how campaign contributions are spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how this goes, but I would hope that this would be
only the beginning of our role there,'' Giorgio said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a stretch to compare this fledgling duo with the
international spin doctors who helped make Bill Clinton president
and Tony Blair prime minister, but the trend is similar. American
political experts are increasingly working abroad. Blair consulted
with American Democrats in Washington and hired Clinton's pollster.
James Carville, Clinton's gregarious strategist, advised Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak in his winning bid last year.
</P>
<P>
   Local consultant Daryl Glenney routinely works abroad for human
rights organizations, training people in developing countries to
build democracy. In the 1980s, after years of Washington politics,
she worked on a losing Venezuelan presidential campaign. Glenney
points out that many American tactics fail in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're dealing with the fourth pink house on the right,
it's hard to do a direct mail campaign,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Giorgio and Nelson acknowledge these problems as well. Their
greatest victories have come in local elections. They represented a
majority of the current West Palm Beach City Commission. They
worked for state Rep. Lois Frankel, D-West Palm Beach. They've won
referenda, including the one that made Wellington a city. They've
lost other elections, including one to overturn the sale of the
West Palm Beach auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has a history with major Washington contributors. They
cannot write campaign posters in Creole or French.
</P>
<P>
   And they have yet to see the country of their new candidate _
which, they say with considerable understatement, is not receptive
to political consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Partisans assassinated 15 people in weeks leading to recent
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   Haitians are scheduled to vote again in a December presidential
elections, but delays are common in Haitian elections.
</P>
<P>
   People who've heard about Patriot Games' new client always ask
whether the consultants will travel to Haiti, Giorgio said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say `hopefully' and Francine says `No, I'm chicken,' ''
Giorgio said. Nelson said she can work on American operations while
Giorgio meets with supporters in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Giorgio and Nelson don't know how much name recognition Claude
has in Haiti, if any.
</P>
<P>
   He did govern the central bank during the four years between
Aristide's election and his placement in office. Claude says he
refused to relinquish his position at the bank, despite pressure
from the military government, because the senate had legally placed
him there.
</P>
<P>
   But Anthony Maingot, a professor of sociology at Florida
International University who monitors politics in Haiti says, ``In
Haiti, you're going to run _ what? _ on your name. Being governor
of the central bank, who cares about that?''
</P>
<P>
   And opinion polls are difficult to conduct in a country with few
reliable telephones.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Claude has been working stateside, something political
observers question. The votes are in Haiti and, if he ever became
an important candidate, opponents could criticize him as an
American pawn, they caution.
</P>
<P>
   Since announcing his candidacy in February, Claude has met with
five U.S. Congressman. He's hoping they'll speak out in his favor.
So far, none have.
</P>
<P>
   His main message is unity. He wants to end political
assassinations and international condemnation that's led to a lack
of foreign aid and investment. He wants American political leaders
to put more pressure on Haiti for fair democratic elections.
</P>
<P>
   Patriot Games' role is to help him raise $5 million to $10
million, much of it from Americans, which he believes he needs to
field a successful campaign against what's expected to be a crowded
field of candidates led by Aristide. Rene Preval, the current
president, took office as Aristide's hand-picked successor in 1996
because the Haitian Constitution forbids presidents from succeeding
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Boca Raton, like other American
political leaders, has been disappointed that Haiti's recent
elections were fraudulent, as judged by international observers. He
said he was impressed with Claude's desire to improve the country
and hopes others like him emerge, but that's as far as he'll go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not generally comfortable with America getting
involved with other countries' elections in any direct way,'' said
Wexler, who met with Claude two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. State Department spokesman said the agency is aware of
Claude but would not comment on his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Although U.S. troops occupied Haiti in 1994 to restore Aristide
to office after a military coup there kept him out of office, few
now expect a strong role for America in the coming presidential
election. Many in Washington seem frustrated that recent efforts
have failed to bring democracy or economic stability to Haiti and
may give up on trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Haiti exhaustion in the United States,'' Maingot said.
International observers have denounced Aristide's supporters for
marring two rounds of elections in recent months with questionable
ballot-counting methods. Still, Maingot expects Aristide to crush
any opposition and wait out global skepticism until it's forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Claude said he will participate in December's election only if
the international community accepts its legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   University of Florida Latin American Studies Professor Terry
McCoy said another candidate's presence is not likely to make a
difference. Aristide's opponents have not been able to unify
against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unusual for Haitian elections to have lots of
candidates,'' he said. ``And most of them don't have a snowball's
chance in Haiti of winning anything.''

METS QUESTION UMPIRE'S CALLS AFTER LOSS TO BLUE JAYS
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ More and more often, the names and the strike zones
are unfamiliar to Al Leiter, who has been in the major leagues
since 1987. For years, there was little turnover among umpires, and
when a new umpire came into the league, Leiter said, he was like a
young pitcher added to a veteran staff: the experienced crew around
him lifted his performance.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after 22 umpires lost their jobs in a failed labor strategy
last summer, young umpires often serve on the same staff together.
Two first-year umpires worked at the Skydome Sunday, when Leiter
and the New York Mets lost to the Toronto Blue Jays, 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some of the young guys have been a little intimidated
and overmatched,'' said Leiter, the Mets' left-hander. ``It
happened to us in the Yankees series. There were a couple of times
when I've noticed the young umps _ not the older guys _ just seem a
little bit less sure of themselves. And it's understandable. It's
just like young players in the big leagues. You're not really
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The home plate umpire Sunday was Mike Fichter, who is listed by
Major League Baseball as a spring training umpire for 2000. Leiter
retired the first 11 Blue Jays in order, then walked three in the
fifth, leading to two runs, and allowed a grand slam to Marty
Cordova in the sixth. Leiter was dismayed at the umpiring, adding
that he hoped the people evaluating the performance of umpires take
note of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a little frustrated with the most inconsistent
umpiring I've ever had in my 12 years in the big leagues,'' Leiter
said. ``And it wasn't just us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone, Leiter said, is the umpires' familiarity with a pitcher's
repertory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy had no clue I have a slider that breaks late and
sharp,'' he said. ``I don't know how many sliders he's seen like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays agreed with Leiter's general assessment. One
Toronto player said the strike zone changed three or four times
during the game. ``It seemed like they missed as many calls as they
made, for both teams,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter walked Craig Grebeck to lead off the sixth, and Raul
Mondesi singled up the middle. After an out and a Tony Batista
single knocked down by the shortstop, Melvin Mora, Cordova came to
bat.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter fell behind, 2-1, then made a pitch he thought was an
obvious strike. ``I have to pitch now,'' Leiter said. ``It's 3-1, a
beautiful hitter's count.''
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting to walk Cordova with the bases loaded, Leiter tried
a slider, but it was not his best one, he said, because he wanted
to get a strike or to have Cordova hit it at somebody. Cordova hit
it to the relievers in the left-field bullpen, giving the Blue Jays
a 6-3 lead with his first career grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter retired the next hitter, but two singles followed and he
left after 5 2/3 innings, matching his season-low for innings
pitched. He allowed six runs, a season-high, and his record dropped
to 10-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had chances. They left 11 runners on base, and Todd
Zeile made inning-ending outs three times, stranding seven runners.
In the first inning, his line drive to center field held up just
long enough to be caught. In the ninth, he grounded to second.
</P>
<P>
   But the out that really bothered Zeile, and helped embolden
Leiter in making his post-game comments, was the called third
strike that ended the seventh inning with the bases loaded. The
Blue Jays' catcher, Alberto Castillo, set up outside, Leiter said,
but the pitch came in and was still called a strike. Zeile stood at
home plate and argued the call _ ``I can't believe you called that
a strike,'' he said _ as Fichter walked away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not somebody who assumes that's an easy job back there,
having caught,'' Zeile said. ``But I'm also somebody who is very
selective at the plate and I feel I've got a pretty good idea of
the strike zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeile said he did not want to be ejected, and neither did
Leiter, though he admitted he was ``that close'' to snapping. He is
not alone among his teammates, who grumbled privately about losing
to a pitcher, Roy Halladay, whose earned run average before the
game was 11.68.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have not played badly lately, but they have lost 9 of
12 games since Leiter beat Atlanta on July 1 to pull the Mets
within a game of first place. Now, the Mets are six games out,
further from first than they have been since May 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think guys realize it's not going our way in bunches,'' said
Mets manager Bobby Valentine. ``It'll come our way in bunches.
That's the way the game is. But we've got to make it happen.''

 &HT;    Concert dangers draw lawsuits
 &HT;    By Bill Douthat
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Crowd-surfing, body-slamming and other forms
of mayhem popular at heavy metal concerts was not what drew Jeff
Mostow to Ozzfest '97.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a music fan,'' he said. ``I certainly didn't expect
anything like that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   That, the 33-year-old said, was the trampling of his knee when
he was caught in a stampede by fans rushing from one stage to
another.
</P>
<P>
   Mostow, of Issaquah, Wash., is suing Coral Sky Amphitheatre,
claiming Coral Sky failed to warn him of unsafe conditions. He
lived in Palm Beach County at the time of the concert.
</P>
<P>
   His lawsuit, scheduled for trial next month, is one of five
against Coral Sky or its successor, MARS Music Amphitheatre, by
patrons claiming injuries at rock concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the suits, including two filed Thursday, were brought
by patrons who use wheelchairs who say they were caught in crowd
surges.
</P>
<P>
   A sixth suit, brought by Miranda Patricella of Fort Myers, was
settled in May, according to court records. She got a $29,000
settlement on her claims that when she was 15 she was dragged into
a mosh pit, fell and broke her ankle during a performance by Green
Day in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It was the girl's first rock concert and she had no clue what to
expect, said her attorney, Robert Scharf.
</P>
<P>
   Moshing, a kind of demolition dancing, caused more than 27
injuries at Coral Sky at six rock concerts in 1996 and 1997,
according to court records. Most injuries were minor.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for the amphitheater did not return phone calls
concerning this story, but spokesmen for other concert arenas and
promoters say their businesses don't encourage the rowdy dancing
and have no control over the behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Yvonne Emmons _ who claimed she was forcibly
lifted up by the crowd at a 1998 concert and ``surfed'' overhead on
the hands of the moshers until she fell _ a concert sponsor
suggested she should have foreseen the danger.
</P>
<P>
   Emmons ``assumed risk of injury by attending and participating
in an event where she was aware moshing could occur,'' said Palm
Beach Broadcasting, a defendant in the case because its station,
The Buzz (WPBZ-FM 103.1), sponsored the concert.
</P>
<P>
   Emmons says in court papers that the liability is not hers. The
concert sponsor and amphitheater failed to ban moshing or evict
those responsible, her lawsuit says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experts say that a sufficient show of force deters crazed
youngsters from running amok throughout the venue,'' said Craig
Goldenfarb, Mostow's attorney. ``In my case, witnesses say there
was no security in the area where this happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Concert promoter Jon Stoll, who is not involved in the lawsuits,
says moshing is difficult to control.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are going to act in an irresponsible manner, there
is only so much you can do,'' said Stoll, head of West Palm
Beach-based Fantasma Productions.
</P>
<P>
   Stoll said the lawsuits are driven by personal injury attorneys
who have discovered a new market for slip-and-fall claims.
</P>
<P>
   A researcher of concert injuries says moshing has become part of
the heavy metal concert culture because it is glamorized on videos
and in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moshing is hip, cool and cutting edge and no one knows the
danger until it's too late,'' said Peter Wertheimer, head of Crowd
Management Studies. ``Suddenly the mosh swirls over them like a
tornado and they are in the middle of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wertheimer, who often testifies in court for plaintiffs, became
interested in the subject when he was a city public information
officer in Cincinnati in 1979. He led a task force investigating
the trampling deaths of 11 people rushing for seats at a concert by
the British rock band The Who. He regularly visits concerts to
study crowd control.
</P>
<P>
   Wertheimer says there are thousands of injuries each year and,
occasionally, deaths. The most dangerous area is the mosh pit,
where heavy-booted dancers engaged in butting, bucking, skanking
(shadow boxing) and kicking while moving in a circle, Wertheimer
said.
</P>
<P>
   A 14-year-old boy died in April of last year when he fell to the
concrete floor while crowd surfing at a Napalm Death concert in San
Bernardino, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen people knocked out, bloodied and women attacked and
assaulted in mosh pits,'' said Wertheimer, who has been hired to
testify in the Mostow case. ``It's unbelievably reckless.''

REPORT URGES JAPAN TO RAISE TAXES 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Underscoring the effects of a rapidly aging population,
low birth rates and skyrocketing fiscal deficits in Japan, the
prime minister's tax advisory council released a report on Friday
strongly suggesting that tax increases are necessary if the country
is to avoid financial disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The Tax Commission recommended lowering the minimum income level
at which taxes begin, raising sales taxes and forcing even the 60
percent of Japanese corporations that report losses to pay local
taxes based on their size rather than their profitability.
</P>
<P>
   It noted that corporate tax rates have fallen to levels
comparable to those in the United States and that Japan's
income-tax revenue is among the lowest in major industrialized
countries. At 5 percent, Japan's sales tax is also one of the
lowest among its economic peers, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report poses a problem for the Japanese government, which
has struggled for the last decade to get the economy back on its
feet after the burst of the asset bubble that marked Japan's heady
ascent in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think Japan faces a policy bind _ no matter what you do,
you wind up creating problems in other areas,'' Vincent J. Truglia,
co-head of sovereign risk at Moody's Investors Service, the credit
ratings agency, told Bloomberg News on Friday. Moody's is
considering another downgrade of Japan's credit rating.
</P>
<P>
   The report is not binding. But the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party's tax panel, which makes policy, has in the past made its
revisions to the tax code in line with the Tax Commission's
reports.
</P>
<P>
   The implications of the report are sobering. Higher individual
taxes would hurt spending, which accounts for some 60 percent of
economic activity here at a time when policy-makers are heavily
relying on consumption to fuel Japan's sputtering economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   That will no doubt come under discussion on Monday when the Bank
of Japan's policy board meets. Economists have placed even odds
that the board will vote to increase interest rates, abandoning its
policy of maintaining rates at virtually zero.
</P>
<P>
   But the prospect of higher taxes combined with rising interest
rates would most likely choke whatever economic revival is under
way. An increase in the consumption tax a few years ago slammed the
brakes on what was shaping up as a mild economic recovery, a memory
that remains especially painful for the Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the report is somewhat embarrassing for the party,
which criticized the opposition Democratic Party for suggesting
during parliamentary elections last month that taxes must rise.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report's recommendations stand in stark contrast to steps
that other countries are taking to reduce the tax burdens on their
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The same day that the Tax Commission released its report,
Germany enacted a package of tax reforms intended to enhance the
competitiveness of its industries.
</P>
<P>
   That package is likely to push Germany's neighbors to adopt more
liberal tax policies, which would leave Japan to buck the trend
alone among the major industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   But Japan's problems, while not singular, are more exacerbated
than those of its biggest trading partners. The Japanese population
is aging far more rapidly and its birth rate is falling more
rapidly than those of any other country. Japan's effort to spend
its way out of a decade-long economic downturn, rather than
adopting more painful structural remedies, has left it with the
highest deficit of any industrialized country.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's tax revenue covers less than half its expenditures, and
thus the Organization for Economic Development estimates that
Japan's debts will exceed its gross domestic product by almost 18
percent this year. In contrast, Germany's debt stands at 63 percent
of gross domestic product and the United States' at 51.7 percent.

F.D. MILLER, 55, GREEN BERET AND HERO IN VIETNAM WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Franklin D. Miller, who won the Medal of Honor in the Vietnam
War for single-handedly repulsing an attack on his patrol after he
had been shot in the chest, died June 30 at a hospital in Bay
Pines, Fla. He was 55 and lived in St. Petersburg Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to receiving the Medal of Honor, the nation's
highest award for valor, Miller was awarded the Silver Star, two
Bronze Stars, the Air Medal and six Purple Hearts in four years in
combat, prompting Gen. Henry H. Shelton, the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, to call him ``an icon to what service in the armed
forces is about.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Miller was sent to Vietnam in 1966, he hardly seemed
destined to have his portrait hanging in the Hall of Heroes at the
John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School at Fort Bragg,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a native of Elizabeth City, N.C., was a private first
class in training with the Special Forces, popularly known as the
Green Berets, when he received his orders for Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I was the dining-room orderly, and the night before
I'd been running around all night, so when I thought no one would
miss me, I went up to the barracks and I fell sound asleep,'' he
recalled in an interview in 1998 with an Army publication at Fort
Bragg.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first people to wake me up were the company commander and
the first sergeant, who were inspecting the billets. The first
sergeant said, `You can take your punishment from me, or you can go
see the old man.' I'd never been in trouble before so I said I'd go
see the old man. I figured he would just chew me out. He said,
`We've got your reassignment orders to Vietnam.'''
</P>
<P>
   Miller was sent to the First Cavalry Division as an infantryman,
remained with the division in Vietnam for two years, then
transferred back to the Green Berets. After a promotion to staff
sergeant, he was assigned to the Fifth Special Forces Group in
Kontum Province, South Vietnam, a staging point for patrols into
Laos and Cambodia seeking intelligence on North Vietnamese troop
movements.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 5, 1970, while Miller was leading a seven-man patrol of
American soldiers and Montagnard tribesmen in Laos, a booby trap
injured five of his men and alerted a North Vietnamese
reconnaissance patrol, which opened fire and continued its attack
throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing firefight, every man in the patrol was wounded,
and then Miller was hit in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was being drowned,'' he said and added that he
was about to panic when ``I had something of a religious
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The image of his mentor from his days in the First Cavalry
Division _ Sgt. Roy Bumgarner, whom he regarded as a ``Superman''
soldier _ appeared to him.
</P>
<P>
   As Miller remembered, ``Sergeant Bumgarner was right there, and
he said, `Calm down, otherwise you'll scare yourself into shock.' I
tried to calm down and think about what I had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   What Miller did was repel two attacks, firing from a solitary
exposed position, after an evacuation helicopter had been driven
off by enemy fire and he was the only member of the patrol able to
keep fighting. Four of the seven patrol members were killed, but at
nightfall, when Miller was running out of ammunition, a relief
patrol evacuated him and the other two survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Miller received the Medal of Honor from President Richard M.
Nixon at the White House on June 15, 1971. He retired from the Army
in 1992 as a command sergeant major, then became a benefits
counselor for the Veterans Administration.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a son, Joshua; a daughter, Danielle; and a
brother, Walter, of Palmer, Alaska, who is also a retired command
sergeant major of the Special Forces.
</P>
<P>
   Miller occasionally visited Fort Bragg and spoke to Special
Forces trainees. His credo: ``Share your fears with yourself and
your courage with others. You will inspire people to do things that
are incredible.'' &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nielsen Media Research, the television ratings
company, had a problem. Univision, the nation's largest
Spanish-language broadcaster, wanted credit for a larger audience
than Nielsen was reporting.
</P>
<P>
   But executives at most of the English-language stations believed
that if Nielsen added more Spanish-speaking households, their
programs stood to lose ratings points to programs on
Spanish-language television. With lower ratings, the stations would
have to charge less for commercials. The executives feared losing
up to $50 million in advertising in New York each year.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen, whose officials estimated that they were undercounting
Spanish-speakers in the New York City market by about 300,000
households, was worried about its credibility. So last year,
company officials called a meeting of New York television
executives to talk about the Spanish-language sample.
</P>
<P>
   The executives at the English-language stations were not happy.
They disputed Nielsen's findings _ that Spanish speakers make up 8
percent of the television viewers in the New York market _
complaining that the company's survey had used faulty sampling
techniques. Executives at Univision dismissed those complaints as
stalling tactics.
</P>
<P>
   After Nielsen announced that it wanted to increase its number of
Spanish-speaking households, Dennis Swanson, the president and
general manager of the NBC affiliate, WNBC, said that he had asked
half-jokingly: ``Can't they wait for a couple of years until I
retire?''
</P>
<P>
   The struggle over how to count Spanish speakers in the Nielsen
ratings is another indication of the rapidly growing influence of
Hispanics on American culture and business.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Spanish-language television was a backwater of the
broadcast industry. Nielsen did not even begin to calculate ratings
for Hispanic programs until 1992. But growth of America's Hispanic
population has changed the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``As more and more Hispanics have come to the United States it
has become more complicated,'' said Harry R. Stecker, the Nielsen
executive who manages the ratings system for local television
stations. ``We might have the right number of households that are
Hispanic by origin in our sample, but we do not have the right
number of people who primarily speak Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that the sample included too many Hispanics who
primarily spoke English.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen officials admit undercounting Spanish speakers in almost
every major market with a large Hispanic population, from Chicago
to Los Angeles. Naturally, Univision executives say they want
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ratings are the real problem, because they are the real
currency of the broadcast industry,'' said Michael Wortsman, the
president of Univision's national station group. ``Nielsen is
discounting our currency because it is using an inaccurate
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics are the fastest growing segment of the American
population and are getting close to overtaking blacks as the
nation's largest minority group. There are more than 32 million
Hispanics in the United States, compared with 23 million 10 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growth of Hispanic immigrants in New York has been just
astronomical in the past three years,'' said Andrew Beveridge, a
demographics expert and sociology professor at Queens College.
Given that, he said, ``it makes a lot of sense to distinguish those
who primarily speak Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching Hispanic consumers has become more important to
advertisers. The estimated annual buying power of the Hispanics is
expected to surpass $440 billion this year, according to federal
statistics. In the New York television market, the nation's
largest, Nielsen estimates that Hispanics make up more than 1
million of the 6.8 million households with televisions. If
Nielsen's estimates are right, Spanish is the dominant language in
about 500,000 of those households.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in the stock market seem to believe in the strength of
Univision's market and its business model. The company's stock has
jumped to about $110 per share, compared with $54 per share in a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nielsen numbers, Univision officials say, have not kept
up with the demographic changes.
</P>
<P>
   At one time or another, nearly every broadcaster complains about
Nielsen's ratings numbers. But in this case, Univision officials
were able to get Nielsen's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen's field agents conducted door-to-door surveys to
estimate the New York area's Spanish-speaking population. (Stecker,
the Nielsen executive, said that his company could not use federal
census data because it was 10 years old and did not ask the right
questions about language preference.)
</P>
<P>
   Based on the results from the survey, Nielsen estimated that
Spanish-dominant households should be represented by 43 of the 500
households in the New York area with television-viewing meters;
there are now only 21 Spanish-dominant households in the sample.
</P>
<P>
   But local English-language broadcasters are fighting the
changes, which would include removing meters from English-language
households. Their arguments vary, but mostly center on claims that
Nielsen's estimates used to determine the number of Spanish
speakers in the market are inflated. They argued that Nielsen's
estimates of the size of the Spanish-speaking population was biased
through leading questions and beginning the interviews with
Hispanics in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen now concedes those problems and attributes them to
insufficient research into Spanish-language polling techniques. The
company plans to compile new estimates, but still believes that
Spanish speakers are underrepresented.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nielsen originally wanted to begin increasing the
number of Spanish-dominant households in the New York sample last
September, this was delayed because of the complaints about the
surveys. The plan was again delayed in January. ``There are two
sides to every story,'' Swanson of WNBC said in an interview.
``But, ultimately, these are difficult issues because of the money
that is at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   The networks have watched their ratings drift downward in recent
years, in part partly because of the growth of cable and niche
television stations. Gone are the days when CBS' ``Cosby Show''
could rank No. 1 among black, white and Hispanic viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Even under the current Nielsen counting system, Univision's New
York affiliate, WXTV Channel 41, has been consistently beating
UPN's New York affiliate, WWOR Channel 9, and occasionally beating
the major networks in key time slots.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the May sweeps, for example, the Nielsen ratings reported
that an average of 144,375 households were tuned into WXTV from 6
to 7 p.m. on weekdays (a rating of 2.1). But a separate Nielsen
service, called the Hispanic Ratings Index, which Nielsen set up in
1995 as a compromise between English-language stations and
Univision officials clamoring for changes in the ratings, reported
236,168 households, or a 3.4 rating, during the same time period.
</P>
<P>
   The February sweeps numbers provide a telling example of how the
undercount affects Univision.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the Hispanic Index reported that ``Noticiero
Univision'' beat ``NBC Nightly News,'' ``ABC World News Tonight''
and ``The CBS Evening News with Dan Rather'' among adults 18- to
49-years-olds. In Nielsen's general ratings, ``Noticiero
Univision'' finished behind all of the programs except ``The CBS
Evening News.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like going to the bank and getting a report that says
you have $10 and $10 million in the same account, at the same
time,'' said Cristina Scwartz, the general manager of WXTV. ``They
both can't be right.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Scwartz says that Mr. Swanson ``knows that his market is not
a wide English-speaking audience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has put together programs that reach out to Hispanic
audiences,'' she said, ``and I can't say that about everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   WNBC recently won the rights to broadcast the National Puerto
Rican Day Parade. It has a number of Hispanic reporters, manages a
Hispanic scholarship fund and refused to rerun of episode of
``Seinfeld'' that was offensive to many Hispanic viewers.
</P>
<P>
   But WNBC officials acknowledge that they are able to reach only
a limited segment of the Hispanic audience. ``We are not going to
do Spanish-language programming; that is not the business we are
in,'' he said. That is why, Swanson says, he is so concerned that
any increase is accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Univision officials said they were concerned that the delays
were an attempt to get Nielsen to revise its estimates of what
percentage Spanish-dominant households make of the market. ``Yes,
they are right in taking into consideration those concerns,'' said
Mimi Berry, the research director at WXTV. ``But why not start the
process of beginning to correct the sample numbers now and then
re-evaluate the estimates. Let's get it started now, instead of two
years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stecker, of Nielsen, said that Univision officials did not
need to worry about English-language broadcasters weakening the
company's resolve, even though some the English-language
broadcasters had initially threatened to pull themselves from the
service. (They have threatened in the past to create their own
ratings service, a notion that is considered unlikely given the
high costs.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really react to threats, because I wouldn't be doing
my job if I did,'' Stecker said. He said that the company had not
been cautious due to fear, but because because it was ``measuring a
medium that involves a lot of complexity and that is going through
rapid changes.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Univision officials could be guaranteed there
would soon be some changes. ``We know how important the data is,
how it is used and how much money it allocated because of it,'' he
said. ``But we have to take the high road and do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Stecker said Nielsen would begin adding meters in
Spanish-dominant New York homes, installing at least five meters _
representing about 50,000 households _ in September.

LOCKERBIE BOMBING PROSECUTION HITS ROADBLOCKS AT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands _ All that can be fairly predicted about
the trial of two Libyans accused of blowing Pan Am Flight 103 out
of the skies above Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 is that it may take
less time _ and be somewhat less painful _ than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the only clear feature of the little-watched
proceedings at this military camp an hour outside Amsterdam is that
not all has gone as the prosecution might have hoped. Some
witnesses have failed to appear and the testimony of others has
been less than crystal clear.
</P>
<P>
   One expert from the University of Edinburgh law faculty has
confidently predicted that the trial will be over by November and
that the defense may not have to present a case. Another from the
University of Glasgow suggests that the prosecution is making
methodical progress and that April is a likely target.
</P>
<P>
   Clare Connelly, leader of the Glasgow law school's Lockerbie
trial team, said that the prosecution seemed ``meticulously
prepared'' and that the evidence was ``being carefully presented.''
Robert Black, a professor of Scottish law at Edinburgh, seemed to
view the situation more pessimistically, saying that so far ``there
is no evidence that is positively incriminatory of either
accused.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution and defense cut at least two months from the
proceedings here by agreeing not to argue over the discovery of
each bit of wreckage found scattered over 850 square miles of
Scotland. They also agreed that the 270 victims had all died in the
crash, meaning that a relative of each did not have to take the
stand as Scottish law _ under which the case is being tried _
usually requires.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been minor delays over the sound system and
translation and the dismantling of a blown-apart luggage container
so it could fit through the door of the high-tech courtroom here,
where bewigged judges inspecting exhibits on desktop monitors make
the trial look like ``Rumpole of the Bailey'' shot in a high-school
computer lab.
</P>
<P>
   More of a problem is that the prosecution is having some trouble
producing its witnesses. They have to be flown here from Malta or
Germany or Scotland or the United States, and some have proved
uncooperative. Just this week a prosecutor, Alan Turnbull, had to
apologize for the refusal of some Maltese witnesses to appear or
testify on a live television link, and expressed his frustration at
being unable to subpoena witnesses as he would in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   The trial began May 3 and is approaching its planned summer
break, from July 29 to Aug. 22. The caravan of reporters and
photographers that mobbed families in the first week has dwindled
to a half-dozen toiling quietly in the cavernous media center.
</P>
<P>
   The most eagerly anticipated witness is said to be a turncoat
Libyan intelligence officer now in a witness-protection program in
the United States. There is much speculation about how he will be
delivered to this well-protected camp and how his identity will be
kept hidden.
</P>
<P>
   This week, for the first time, a witness pointed out one of the
defendants in court. Toni Gauci, the owner of Mary's House, a
clothing store in Malta, said Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi
resembled the man who bought a jacket, pajamas, trousers, shirts,
sweaters, a baby sweater and an umbrella, all without trying
anything on.
</P>
<P>
   The singed remnants of such items from Gauci's store were found
in the wreckage and the prosecution says they were used to pad out
the brown Samsonite suitcase that contained the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   But in the years since the bombing, Gauci has been asked many
times to look at photo displays and lineups and has seen articles
with photos, which have blurred his memory. The defense got him to
admit that he once told investigators that a newspaper picture
resembled the man he had seen. That picture was of Muhammad Abu
Talb, a member of a Palestinian group. The defense is expected to
argue that Palestinian terrorists in Frankfurt slipped a bomb just
inside the plane's fuselage, and that it was not placed on board in
a suitcase by the Libyans.
</P>
<P>
   Gauci was touching in his honesty about his confusion: ``Yes,
yes, 11 years, so many years,'' he said. ``I would like to have a
computer in my head, but. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Black said Gauci's testimony could not have helped the
prosecution, which now must hope for convincing identification from
the defector. ``If they don't get damning evidence from him, then
there's nothing else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most of the earlier testimony has been about forensic evidence,
with experts analyzing where in the plane the bomb exploded and how
one pound of Semtex could have torn apart a 747. Most insisted that
the blast emerged from inside the damaged baggage container and
blew a 20-inch hole in the fuselage ``as if a shotgun had been
fired at close range,'' as one put it.
</P>
<P>
   A witness who elicited open criticism was the co-owner of the
Swiss electronics company, Mebo, that supplied bomb timers to
Libya. Edwin Bollier, 62, spent a week on the stand in May. The
Glasgow team updating the trial's progress on its Web site
(www.law.gla.ac.uk/lockerbie/) commented that he ``is not a
credible and reliable witness,'' and had ``repeatedly changed his
story and indeed changed it in court as he was examined.''
</P>
<P>
   (Black has his own Web site at www.thelockerbietrial.com)
</P>
<P>
   A defense lawyer, Richard Keen, accused Bollier of being ``mired
completely in a web of deceit, cunning and lying of your own
invention,'' and the prosecution admitted it had considered
charging him as a co-conspirator.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, according to his own contradictory accounts, Bollier
has led a checkered life. He began, he says, running offshore
pirate radio stations, then developed Libya as his best customer
for timers, antennas, listening devices and other electronics. He
said he once supplied electronic detonators to Stasi, the East
German intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
   He helped the Libyans test his timers on an aircraft at a desert
military base. But in late 1988, two days before the Lockerbie
bombing, he said he got into a dispute over paying for timers he
had supplied.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted that in January 1989, a month after the bombing, he
wrote to the CIA blaming specific Libyan officials, including Col.
Moammar Gadhafi, for ordering the destruction of Pan Am 103.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, he wrote to a Libyan intelligence officer saying he had
gone to authorities, but had told them that he had sold timers to
someone in Beirut. On the stand, he denied that this letter was a
veiled blackmail threat.
</P>
<P>
   Some time later, he testified, Libya paid him 23,000 Swiss
francs to do his own ``investigation'' of the Lockerbie bombing,
and a lawyer for the two Libyan defendants met with him in 1993 to
discuss a $1.8 million loan. He concluded that a bomb placed
against the fuselage had been responsible and could have been
constructed with a timer like those he had supplied to the Stasi in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   On the witness stand, he said he had himself been blackmailed
into writing the 1989 CIA letter by a man who visited his Zurich
office and ordered him to write it on a Spanish typewriter. In a
1991 interview, confronted by prosecutors, he said he had written
the letter, which he now says was ``pure fantasy,'' to throw
investigators off the track.
</P>
<P>
   Bollier was also confronted with various versions of what he
said was in a brown suitcase he admits taking from Zurich to Libya.
At different times, he has claimed he took with him a blue baby
sweater, a present for his Libyan driver. At different times, he
has said the other clothes were for different people.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor suggested he had been lying all along, changing
his story as different facts emerged from the investigation. He
also suggested that an invoice found in Bollier's desk saying he
sold timers to the Stasi in 1985 had been fabricated and backdated.

   Utilities Seek New Ways To Change Use of Power
</P>
<P>
   With millions of air conditioners humming and dire warnings of
electricity running short at hours of peak demand, a growing number
of utilities say there is plenty of power around if only they can
allocate it properly.
</P>
<P>
   Utilities are using some decidedly novel tactics to do so,
particularly new methods of pricing energy and new ways for
managing energy demand, like installing radio-controlled switches
on central air conditioners, to turn them off at peak hours, and
paying companies not to use electricity.
</P>
<P>
   General Mills in Deal for Pillsbury
</P>
<P>
   In the latest merger between food companies seeking strength
from scale, General Mills will pay $10.5 billion for Diageo's
Pillsbury unit. Under the deal, to be announced Monday, Diageo will
receive $5.1 billion in cash and $5.4 billion in General Mills
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Mind Behind the Sport Utility Buyer
</P>
<P>
   Research by automakers is finding that buyers of sport utility
vehicles and minivans are different psychologically. Sport utility
buyers tend to be more ``self-oriented'' while minivan buyers tend
to be more ``other-oriented.'' The carmakers find the research
persuasive enough that it is affecting the way vehicles are
designed and advertised.
</P>
<P>
   Cooperating to Attract Customers
</P>
<P>
   Before Internet retailers were expected to make a profit, they
could easily spend $100 or more chasing down a customer. Those days
are over, but a technique known as reciprocal marketing, which
allows companies to offer their paying customers discounts at other
online retailers, allows merchants to attract customers at little
expense. For example, consumers who spend $40 at eToys get a gift
certificate for $10 at Gap.com. Those that spend $40 at Gap.com get
a $10 certificate at ProFlowers.com. And so on.
</P>

   Ebony Shuts Down in South Africa
</P>
<P>
   The South African edition of Ebony magazine, introduced nearly
five years ago in the afterglow of the country's triumph over
apartheid, has shut down after failing to find profits or many
readers. Prosperity has been slower than expected in reaching the
black majority. For Ebony South Africa, that meant a retail market
with too little interest in advertising to black consumers and a
magazine industry with little room for a publication celebrating a
level of success that few blacks in the country have achieved.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Patrick J. Leahy admits it can all become a
little obsessive. When he stumbles out of bed in the morning, his
first destination is not the kitchen for a cup of coffee or the
doorstep for the morning paper. It's to turn on his home computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first thing I do before anything, I flip on the
computer,'' says the man known to his colleagues as the
cybersenator. As the computer warms up, he gets the cup of coffee.
``And then I come back with the coffee, in my pajamas, and I see
what's come in,'' Leahy says.
</P>
<P>
   What comes in? E-mails from staff members in Washington and
constituents in Vermont. Petitions from colleagues in the
international campaign to ban land mines, one of Leahy's favorite
causes. Family photographs that have been scanned into cyberspace
by his three grown children.
</P>
<P>
   He will surf the Internet for breaking news. His bookmarks on
the World Wide Web include sites for the Supreme Court (as ranking
Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, he needs to monitor the
court's rulings), The Irish Times (he has an abiding interest in
the land of his ancestors), and the music group the Grateful Dead
(www.dead.net).
</P>
<P>
   A white-haired 60-year-old grandfather and a 25-year veteran of
the Senate, Leahy is a proud Deadhead, as the cultlike followers of
the band are known. He takes pride in having introduced Jerry
Garcia, the band's founder who died in 1995, to Strom Thurmond,
R-S.C., the Senate's oldest member _ and the senator perhaps least
likely to have heard of Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy's twin passions for the Dead and for cyberspace came
together last week in a Senate hearing room, as he sat with a
laptop computer and tried to download a copy of a favorite Dead
anthem, ``Touch of Grey,'' as his colleagues on the judiciary
committee watched with amusement.
</P>
<P>
   The download from the Internet site Napster was taking a long
time. ``It went from `Touch of Grey' to `Touch of White' by the
time it downloaded,'' Leahy said, drawing laughter from a packed
audience.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was called to consider whether Congress needs to
intervene to control Napster, Gnutella, MP3 and other Internet
sites that allow music to be shared freely among millions of fans,
without copyright payments to artists and recording companies.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing's star witness was Lars Ulrich, drummer of the
heavy-metal band Metallica, who complained that his work was being
stolen off the Web. The band has sued Napster for copyright
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy doesn't know how Congress should respond to the issue. ``I
don't know what the solution will be,'' he said after the hearing,
taking a seat in the small office just off the Senate chambers that
he is granted by virtue of his seniority; it has a magnificent view
toward the Washington Monument. ``Obviously artists deserve to be
paid,'' he said. ``But our responsibility in the Congress is not to
stifle innovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not like U.S. Steel evolving over decades. This could
be a brilliant 19-year-old in a college dorm figuring out Gnutella
or some like it. You can't stop it. You couldn't stop it even if
you wanted to. What we need to do, I think, is make sure copyrights
and patent laws actually reflect the new reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Leahy draws a comparison between the arrival of Napster and its
cyberspace kin, and the advent of the videocassette recorder in the
1970s, which was initially described by the Hollywood studios as a
threat to their survival because of copyright violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you can't make a movie without figuring videos into the
whole equation,'' he said. ``Some movies that are real turkeys in
the theaters recoup their money in video.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, Leahy knows how passionately some fans
feel about their ability to grab music off the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   An e-mail campaign organized by music-sharing Internet companies
jammed his electronic mailbox in the Senate with more than 17,000
messages last week, so many that he had to shut it down
temporarily. ``I got more on this subject than I got on
impeachment,'' the senator said. ``We turned it off because I don't
want to crash the rest of my system.''
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley and the other outposts of the Internet
industry, Leahy is seen as one of the champions of cyberspace
freedom. But the senator knows that his work on the issue carries a
political cost, especially after he led opposition to the 1996
Communications Decency Act and other popular legislation designed
to block access by children to sexually explicit Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   His critics _ mostly outside Vermont, where he remains so
popular that he won the 1998 election with 72 percent of the vote _
have charged that Senator Leahy is siding with pornographers and
pedophiles.
</P>
<P>
   But he is unrepentant, especially about the Communications
Decency Act, and his opposition on the law on free-speech grounds
was vindicated in 1997 by the Supreme Court, which agreed
unanimously that the law was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy noted that as a state prosecutor in Vermont, ``I sent
child molesters to prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I yield to nobody in the Senate on the First Amendment,''
he said. ``I am not going to vote for a law that is so broadening
that you could finish up closing down just about every library.''
</P>
<P>
   The responsibility for policing the Internet, Leahy says, has to
rest largely with parents, who can purchase software that restricts
access to Internet sites that feature pornography or that promote
racism and other forms of intolerance. ``Maybe parents need to
spend some time with their kids on the computer, figuring out what
they're looking at,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean it is much fun for a politician to stand up
for the rights of those who use the Internet to distribute graphic
sexual images or messages of hate. The fight for free speech and
other freedoms on the Internet can be a lonely one, Leahy says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is in favor of the First Amendment,'' he said. ``But
we'd have a hell of a time ratifying it today.''

 &HT;    Texas budget surplus report released early
 &HT;    By Gary Susswein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Hoping to squash nationwide speculation about a
fiscal crisis in Texas, the state comptroller on Sunday released
projections of a budget surplus for 2000-01 _ five months before
any numbers were expected.
</P>
<P>
   Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander confirmed that the state will
collect at least $1.1 billion more than expected during the budget
cycle that ends Aug. 31, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that will pay for $610 million in budget overruns
revealed last week.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have accused Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican
candidate for president, of being fiscally irresponsible and blamed
the overruns on tax cuts he supported. Bush defended his record
Sunday and pointed to Rylander's preliminary projections as proof
that the state is in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did have a projected surplus. We still have a surplus. As a
matter of fact, the comptroller will tell you that the surplus is
going to be $1.1 billion,'' Bush said on ABC's ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   Rylander said her decision to release the projections is meant
to instill confidence in Wall Street analysts who will set the
state's bond ratings next month _ not as a boost to Bush's
campaign, as some Democrats charged.
</P>
<P>
   But she acknowledged that Bush's run for the White House has
focused unprecedented attention on the state's financial health,
creating theimpetus for the preliminary estimates, which will be
formally released later this week and updated in December.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic candidate
for president, has raised the budget overruns to suggest Texas is
on the verge of a crisis, Rylander said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president has been putting out inaccurate
information,'' Rylander said. ``There's been all sorts of
misinformation, inaccurate information, going around these United
States, and my concern is that could damage the state of Texas if
unanswered.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore appeared Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' from his
residence in Washington, ready to make Texas an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponent has put forward economic proposals that would
start increasing the debt again and put us back into deficit. And,
incidentally, that's what he has done in Texas,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ray Sullivan said he believes Rylander's
projections should blunt those criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president has continually made false attacks in the
face of the truth, but we do hope a thorough look at our balanced
budget and our surplus will help Americans realize that Texas has a
fiscally responsible and balanced budget,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state will spend $610 million more than expected this year
because Texas' prison population and the cost of prescription drugs
are higher than projected. It also will collect $1.1 billion extra
from sales and automobile taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Rylander had not planned to release those numbers until
December, just before the Legislature meets. Now, she said, she
wants the figures available for August meetings with analysts who
will set the state's bond ratings. Those ratings will determine
interest rates for $3.9 billion in bonds to cover expenses over the
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The state has used the short-term notes since the 1980s,
Rylander said, and could save millions of dollars by securing a
lower interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   But the state Democratic Party chairwoman said she thought it
was politics, not policy, that prompted the projections.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who believe in fiscal responsibility will be concerned
when Bush and the Republicans dismiss the state's budget situation
as no big deal,'' said Mary Beth Malcolm. ``It is highly unusual to
release a revenue estimate so early because so much can change. But
they are trying to put a mask on a situation that can be
devastating to Bush's presidential campaign.''

A THEATER MAVERICK SAYS HE'S NOT FRETTING ABOUT A LEAN SPELL 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Martin Guerre'' didn't make it to Broadway last
season. ``Oklahoma!'' is no longer coming next season. ``Cats'' is
closing. So is ``Saigon.'' ``Putting It Together'' did not last
earlier this year. And whether there will be a future for ``The
Witches of Eastwick,'' which opens in London Tuesday night, is
anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   Whither Cameron Mackintosh, the guiding force behind them all?
The boyish British producer who brought Broadway one long-running
blockbuster after another in the 1980s and early '90s _ ``Cats,''
``Saigon,'' ``The Phantom of the Opera'' and ``Les Miserables'' _
is not turning them out as he used to. Maybe the age of the
megamusical has come and gone. Gone, too, perhaps is the age of the
maverick producer. Or has Mackintosh, 53, simply lost the touch?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a tough 10 years,'' said Gordon Davidson, artistic
director of the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. ``But he's
indefatigable.''
</P>
<P>
   Along Broadway he has a legion of admirers who don't doubt that
sooner or later he will be back with another hit; he still hopes to
bring his acclaimed revival of ``Oklahoma!'' across the Atlantic
next summer. ``He's really the only giant we have left in our
business,'' said Rocco Landesman, president of Jujamcyn Theaters.
``Cameron is the last singular idiosyncratic producer.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent interviews in London and by phone from New York,
Mackintosh did not seem particularly concerned about the state of
his career. The Sunday Times of London lists him as one of
Britain's 200 richest people, estimating his personal wealth at
$600 million. He owns seven theaters in the West End of London. He
was knighted in 1996 for his services to British theater. ``When
it's meant to stop, I can do other things,'' he said, sipping tea
in his London office of overstuffed couches and oriental rugs.
``I'm not in any way wedded to doing theater for the rest of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking to Mackintosh one gets the feeling he might be ready to
hang it up, spend more time at his estate in Scotland, the vineyard
in the South of France, that dairy farm in Somerset, England. ``We
make very nice cheddar,'' he said. ``We raise our own sheep. All of
that I find equally satisfying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is for living,'' he added. ``Life isn't just for musical
theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by telephone a few days ago he sounded confident about
his musical ``Witches,'' derived from John Updike's novel and
written by two young Americans, John Dempsey and Dana P. Rowe.
``I'm enjoying it, the cast is having a good time, audiences seem
to like it,'' Mackintosh said. ``Now we need several good
reviews.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Witches'' and ``Oklahoma!,'' while ambitious, are clearly
shows of a different order from his earlier extravaganzas in which
chandeliers crash, helicopters land, barricades revolve and tires
rise. Economics comes into play. ``Phantom of the Opera,'' which
cost about $8 million when it was originally produced in 1988,
would cost nearly twice that now. The expense of taking big shows
on the road, where much of the profit resides, have escalated as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Costs being a great factor, the spectacle of those musicals is
very difficult to continue, except for someone like Disney,'' said
Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert Organization, which owns
the theaters that house Mackintosh's Broadway productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really represented a golden age,'' he added. ``Now it is
winding down.'' (``Saigon'' and ``Cats'' are to close before the
end of the year.)
</P>
<P>
   Mackintosh said he was not preoccupied with his dwindling
presence on Broadway. ``When I grew up wanting to put on shows and
musicals, I never dreamt any would run 5 years, let alone 9 or 10
or even 20,'' he said. ``To have any sense of sadness would be
stupid, and because they're good shows, they will appear in other
guises forever. I would much rather go out still being thought of
as good shows rather than faded replicas.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Enfield, in north London, the son of a timber merchant
who played the trumpet and a secretary, Mackintosh fell in love
with theater at age 8, when his aunt took him to see ``Salad
Days,'' a musical by Julian Slade and Dorothy Reynolds. His first
theater job was as an apprentice stagehand at the Theater Royal
Drury Lane, during the run of ``Camelot'' in 1965. ``Saigon''
recently closed at that theater (not one of his), and ``Witches''
is now ensconced there.
</P>
<P>
   After he worked as a stagehand and stage manager, Mackintosh's
first big West End production was a revival of ``Anything Goes'' in
1969, which flopped. His first hit came in 1976, when he invested
in the revue ``Side by Side by Sondheim,'' which came to New York.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mackintosh said he was disappointed that his revival of
``Oklahoma!'' would not come to New York this year, a decision
announced 10 days ago, citing scheduling difficulties involving the
show's production team. ``There isn't enough time to do it
properly,'' he said. ``That's not the way I produce things, in a
hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular the show has been trying to work around the
schedule of Trevor Nunn, who is artistic director of the Royal
National Theater in London. Other members of the production team
include Susan Stroman as choreographer and Anthony Ward as set
designer. Plans to bring ``Oklahoma!'' were canceled once before,
when the Actors Equity Association refused Mackintosh's request to
bring the all-British cast to Broadway last year. For the
production that was supposed to come this season, he had agreed to
try to cast U.S. actors. (In a similar showdown, Mackintosh
successfully insisted that Jonathan Pryce play the Eurasian
narrator in ``Saigon'' despite Equity's calls for an Asian actor.)
</P>
<P>
   Mackintosh disputed a report that the problem with ``Oklahoma!''
had to do with the amount that SFX Theatrical Group was asking for
the Ford Center for the Performing Arts. ``I'm sure a deal would
have been sorted out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As to why ``Martin Guerre'' never made it to New York,
Mackintosh said that musical, which received poor reviews out of
town, was a difficult challenge. Based on a 1982 film and the
16th-century case history about a soldier returning from war, the
musical had been about four years in the making. Mackintosh said
even he turned it down at first. ``It took me a long time to get
into the subject matter,'' he said. ``I couldn't see what was
intriguing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, Mackintosh said, he came to understand what the
authors _ Claude-Michel Schonberg and Alain Boublil, who also wrote
``Les Miz'' and ``Saigon'' _were trying to accomplish. ``I'm a huge
admirer of both of them,'' Mackintosh said. ``I made a fortune
beyond my dreams on two of their shows. My misgivings about it
initially were how you tell the story, which has been the practical
search for the authors.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackintosh is a hands-on producer who works closely with his
creative team _ asking questions, making suggestions _ and then
checks in regularly during rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is produced by committee these days,'' Landesman
said. ``There are very few producers who have their own personal
imprint on their shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackintosh said it was important not to hand a project to a
director too quickly, that he prided himself on being able to prod
the writers to do their best work. And when he does turn a show
over, he said, it's like letting a child venture forth into the
world. ``I'm not in charge anymore,'' he said of ``Witches.'' ``I
had to pass the baton.''
</P>
<P>
   He makes no secret of preferring old-fashioned like ``South
Pacific'' and ``Oliver!'' He will revive ``My Fair Lady'' in the
West End next season, with his longtime colleague Trevor Nunn
directing. It is ``arguably the greatest book musical ever
written,'' he said. ``Every note is perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he was rarely attracted to anything that did not
have a strong dramatic theme, and that the work he did was almost
always based on classics.
</P>
<P>
   His love of the conventional may seem difficult to reconcile
with his love of Stephen Sondheim's work. But there is darker
Sondheim (``Passion''), and there is lighter Sondheim (``Putting It
Together''), and Mackintosh does not profess to like it all. ``He's
one of my closest friends,'' he said of Sondheim. ``Could I produce
all his other shows? I don't have the personality that has a
rapport with some of the characters he writes about.''
</P>
<P>
   After seeing ``Company,'' for example, Mackintosh said he loved
the score but not its effect on him. ``I couldn't understand why,
having been so theatrically excited, I came out of the theater
feeling gutted,'' he said. ``One of my strong suits is I still care
as much.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that caring, producers say, that suggests that Mackintosh
will be around the theater for some time to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that a few things he has done haven't worked out
doesn't mean anything,'' said Roger Berlind, a longtime Broadway
producer. ``He's an extraordinary showman. He ain't going away.''

A LOW SHOT UNDER AN OAK TREE HELPS SORENSTAM WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. _ Annika Sorenstam and Rosie Jones, playing
in the final group of the day, were tied for the lead in the Japan
Airlines Big Apple Classic Sunday afternoon when they stepped to
the 17th tee at Wykagyl Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Things looked good for Jones when her tee shot found the fairway
because Sorenstam's shot had landed in the left rough, making a
precise shot to the green difficult. A huge oak tree stood to the
left, its branches hanging low, leaving Sorenstam only a narrow
passage to the green.
</P>
<P>
   She took the only option she had: a low, knockdown shot under
the tree. Her shot, with a 7-iron from 132 yards, ended up
pin-high, 15 feet to the right of the hole. Sorenstam proceeded to
make the putt for birdie that led to a one-shot victory over Jones
in the $900,000 tournament, the lone stop in the New York
metropolitan area for the Ladies Professional Golf Association
Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ask me to hit that shot again,'' Sorenstam said about
her second shot on the par-4, 396-yard 17th. ``To hit a low shot
like that and get it pin-high, I had some luck there. I also knew
that if I made that putt it would be the deciding putt.''
</P>
<P>
   It was and it gave Sorenstam her second victory in a row, third
in the last four tournaments, and fifth of the season. She won for
the second time in three years at Wykagyl. The first-prize check of
$135,000 put Sorenstam, 29, on top of the LPGA tour's money list.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam surpassed Karrie Webb, who ended at even-par 213, tied
for 18th, Sunday. It is the first time this season that Sorenstam
leads the money list. She headed that list in 1997 and 1998, and
finished fourth last season. Regaining the top spot has been
Sorenstam's goal for almost two years.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam won the 54-hole tournament _ Saturday's third round
was canceled because of heavy rain _ with a total of 7-under 206
from rounds of 69-65-72. The 6,161-yard Wykagyl course played much
harder Sunday because of Saturday's rain, with only 11 players in
the field of 70 breaking par.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam and Jones shot 72 Sunday, and Allison Finney, who
finished alone in third after leading the first two rounds, shot 75
for a total of 208. It was the highest finish for Finney since a
victory in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal was to make some birdies early, create some pressure
and make people notice,'' Sorenstam said. ``But I made three bogeys
on the front nine, and I was going the opposite direction. I felt
like going home, that it wasn't my day. I felt like I had no
energy. I tried to stay calm, but I was too calm. I couldn't get
going. I was just hanging around.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam hung around long enough to be in contention, but she
had plenty of help from Finney and Jones, her partners in the last
threesome of the day. While Sorenstam had three bogeys to go with
her two birdies on the day, Finney was worse. She made three
consecutive bogeys starting on No. 9 and ended the day with six
bogeys and two birdies.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who started the day a shot behind Sorenstam, made three
bogeys and a birdie. She had the lead at the turn, but failed to
stay on top with bogeys on Nos. 11 and 12 and no birdies the rest
of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Annika made a great shot on 17,'' said Jones, whose
second-place finish was her best of the season. ``She can hit a
shot like that and she is the type who can capitalize.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty confident for next week,'' Sorenstam said about
the U.S. Open in Libertyville, Ill., which she captured in 1995 and
1996. ``A victory on this course is good because this course is
like the U.S. Open.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Internet helps provide speedy response to disease outbreaks
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Internet is providing an avenue for the rapid
spread of destructive computer viruses to the far corners of the
world. But for the World Health Organization, the net is proving to
be a new tool for spotting the emergence of real disease-causing
viruses and speeding the international response to outbreaks of
infectious disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``We scour the Web every day for any mention of possible
outbreaks,'' WHO Communicable Disease Director David L. Heymann on
Sunday told the International Conference of Emerging Infectious
Diseases in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Geneva-based WHO relies heavily on official
channels for notification of outbreaks, Heymann said the resurgence
of infectious disease worldwide _ and deteriorating public health
resources in countries racked by war, famine and poverty _ have
made the Internet a valuable early indicator of possible trouble
spots, as well as a vital link in exchanging information about
confirmed outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, WHO has recorded more than 600
confirmed outbreaks of infectious diseases around the world. The
agency is currently tracking a deadly outbreak of acute hemorrhagic
fever syndrome _ cause still unknown _ in Afghanistan, an outbreak
of milk-borne staph infections in Japan that have sickened more
than 13,000 people and an estimated 1,000 cases of cholera in
Micronesia.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 public health experts from more than 30
countries are meeting in Atlanta this week to consider why
infectious diseases, which 50 years ago were considered a problem
solved, are now the world's leading cause of premature death,
claiming more than 16 million lives a year.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the United States, public health authorities are
scrambling to deal with the spread of previously unknown disease
causing organisms _ like the appearance of West Nile fever in New
York City _ and the resurgence of old diseases, like tuberculosis,
pneumonia, and foodborne illness that have become resistant to
once-effective antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention launched
its first assault on the problem in 1994, the agency has spent $128
million to improve its surveillance and prevention of infectious
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   But James Hughes, director of the National Center for Infectious
Diseases, said the figure represents only about half of the $260
million the agency needs for the task.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are scrambling to make up for lost time,'' Hughes said.
``We never know what the next big surprise will be. We need to be
prepared for the next AIDS, for the next hantavirus. A real
emergency, like the next influenza pandemic, will expose the gaps
in the system.''

<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   A group of 10-year-old girls from the Manhattan Soccer Club's
traveling teams gathered recently at the home of coach Bob Bodian
to make plans for a new team they will be fielding this fall. The
highlight of the agenda for the girls was deciding on a new team
name.
</P>
<P>
   Simeon Baum, the manager of the team, decided that names would
be nominated and winnowed down through rounds of balloting.
Conventional names like Cyclone, Hurricane and Comets kept
dropping, and in came names _ Tsunami, Dunkin' Donuts, Slickers _
that nobody was really enthusiastic about.
</P>
<P>
   Simeon reluctantly decided to restart the process with a new
round of nominations and found himself besieged by the clamor of 15
girls screaming to be heard over one another. ``Girls, girls,'' he
cried. ``This is chaos!''
</P>
<P>
   Bingo! This fall, Manhattan Chaos will uphold the pride of New
York City and all that it stands for.

   ``This was one of the funnier things I've heard in my 15 years
as a restaurateur,'' reported Danny Meyer, the co-owner of Gramercy
Tavern.
</P>
<P>
   One night, toward the end of the Knicks' futile playoff run, a
man telephoned to confirm that the Knicks game would be turned on
at the bar during his scheduled dinner at Gramercy Tavern. ``I'm
sorry,'' the reservations clerk replied. ``We have no television
sets at the restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it says you do in the Zagat Survey,'' the caller replied.
``That's why I picked your restaurant in the first place.'' The
puzzled clerk asked, ``Where does the Zagat Survey say we have a
TV?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's right here on page 229,'' the caller replied. ``You're
one of the places recommended for game in season.''

   Kathleen Finn and her husband, Neal, were crossing Third Avenue
during the rush hour when they noticed a well-dressed man standing
in the street, hailing a cab. A large truck started to back up
directly in his path and, because of the noise, the man did not
hear the truck's warning bell or Neal Finn's warning yell. Neal
Finn ran over to the man and, lifting him by the lapels on his
coat, carried him out of danger.
</P>
<P>
   The man, realizing what had happened, called out, ``You saved my
life.'' Not so unusual, you might say, but Finn had just celebrated
his 75th birthday.

   I approached a young lady walking by and told her of my problem.
She took out a handful of quarters, said ``Take as many as you
want,'' and refused my nickels and dimes in exchange. ``Be my

</P>
<P>
   As this young lady was leaving the scene, another young man
approached and shoved two quarters in my hand and walked away.

   Last year I received a talking clock for a birthday present.
When the alarm goes off, you can hear the crowing of a rooster _
cock-a-doodle-doo. A few weeks ago, I noticed the crow was hardly
audible and was told that the battery had to be replaced. The clerk
in the appliance store changed the battery and put the clock in a
large brown bag.
</P>
<P>
   I got on a very crowded bus in midafternoon and stood near the
driver, holding onto the pole. The bus swerved, the bag hit the
pole and the alarm _ COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO _ went off, full strength
with that new battery. I tried to turn it off but the lever was so
small I couldn't see it, so the alarm just continued as everyone on
the bus looked on, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   As I got off, the driver put in his 2 cents: ``Next time, please
leave your rooster at home,'' he said.

 &HT;    Doing the right thing
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Bob Whitfield is convinced it's a conspiracy,
but that's just Bob.
</P>
<P>
   When Falcons coach Dan Reeves suggested to offensive line coach
Art Shell that he might benefit from an assistant, Reeves merely
was trying to do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   After just two days of training camp, Shell and former tight
ends coach James Daniel are wearing out Whitfield, the team's
starting left tackle for the past 112 games.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield isn't arguing Reeves' logic. But, as usual, he has a
beef.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel, who coached the offensive line under Pat Dye at Auburn
from 1981-92, is a little more forward than Shell.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can call them a tag team torture tandem,'' Whitfield said.
``I think Daniel's job is to ride our (butts). Now, though, I think
they're competing to see who can ride our (butts) the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves made the suggestion to Shell after the line played poorly
last year in a season that saw eight starters for the five
positions. In `98, all five starters were in the lineup every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got five different positions, and 15 people in the
offensive line,'' Reeves said. ``That's a lot for one man. We can
get a lot more teaching done this way.''
</P>
<P>
   So Shell took Daniel as an assistant, though he said he doesn't
understand Reeves' reasoning about five different positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not against it (having two men coach the line). I've done
it before, and a lot of people do it,'' he said. ``I don't believe
in, `You take this position, and I'll take this position.' I want
the guys to be get the same coaching from me they hear from James.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing my teaching, and James is doing a good job of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel had a summer internship with the Broncos in Reeves' last
year as head coach there, `92. The next season, Daniel was coaching
tight ends for Reeves and the Giants. He followed Reeves to Atlanta
in `97.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no ego clash, or anything like that,'' said the
soft-spoken Daniel. ``We're just trying to get better. I just like
to coach.''
</P>
<P>
   When Reeves made staff changes last offseason in a spate that
included moving former wide receivers coach Rennie Simmons to tight
ends, and passing game coordinator Jack Burns to wide receivers, he
gave Daniel and Shell some liberty.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't assign one to tackles, and the other to inside
linemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told them to work it out among themselves,'' Reeves
said.
</P>
<P>
   All center Calvin Collins seems to know is there is a voice
coaching him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have extra eyes out there, you'll get more
attention to detail,'' Collins said. ``Right now, one guy will have
the tackles and tight ends, and the other will have the inside
guys. Other times they switch.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Whitfield eventually concedes to the logic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're on your neck, but that's good because now you got
someone who can see it all going on,'' he said. ``You can't cheat a
step, cheat a technique.''

YANKS FIND THEIR GROOVE JUST IN TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fissures have appeared this season in the dynasty
that is the New York Yankees, from the growing burdens of pressure
and time. But they demonstrated again Sunday why they will be a
dangerous postseason team, if they qualify to play in the October
games.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody does a comeback like the Yankees, who opportunistically
pieced together fragments of offense, drawing base on balls and
slapping singles, to score five runs in the bottom of the ninth to
tie the Phillies. Nobody can match the Yankees' potential for
relaxed relentlessness.
</P>
<P>
   After Mariano Rivera surrendered a two-run homer in top of the
10th, the Yankees scored three times in the bottom of the 10th,
David Justice slamming a one-out single off Jeff Brantley to win
the game, 9-8, rewarding those few among the 53,131 who stayed to
the end at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the most memorable win we've had this year,''
said Paul O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Gooden proved pivotal in his first relief appearance for
the Yankees, holding the Phillies to one run over 5 1/3 innings
after he took over for Andy Pettitte in the third inning. Bernie
Williams had a home run (No. 21) and hit singles in both the ninth-
and 10-inning rallies. The Yankees are 47-39, a half-game ahead of
Toronto in the American League East.
</P>
<P>
   It had all the makings of a crummy day, Chuck Knoblauch noted
later. Pettitte couldn't keep the ball down, was ripped for nine
hits before he left in the third inning, and the Phillies were
pounding the Yankees, 6-1, after four innings. The Yankees started
to rally a few times, all of them aborted, and their frustration
was probably heightened by the fact that the pitcher who was
shutting them down _ Paul Byrd _ does not look like a major league
pitcher. Byrd possesses the body of Wiffleball star, slight in
frame and fastball, and bends at the waist with runners on base the
way Phil Niekro did in his late 40s, his socks pulled up high.
</P>
<P>
   But Byrd, who had almost been scratched because of a stiff neck,
grittily confounded the Yankees, changing speeds, keeping his
hittable stuff just far enough out of harm's way, at the borders of
the strike zone. Scott Brosius and O'Neill flung bats angrily after
making outs; Williams dumped his helmet and bat on the ground after
whiffing to end the seventh inning, and fans poured into the
aisles, reaching into their pockets for car keys and Metro cards,
the afternoon seemingly wasted.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Thompson led off the bottom of the ninth inning for the
Yankees, the score still 6-1, and grounded to short, a routine
play. Desi Relaford fielded it cleanly, but his rushed throw pulled
Brian Hunter off the base. Scott Brosius flipped a soft liner over
shortstop. Steve Schrenk, the Philadelphia pitcher, walked
Knoblauch. Derek Jeter _ who had three walks in his previous 24
games _ waited out a four-pitch walk, forcing home a run.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Vizcaino, acquired by the Yankees in a trade last month,
said after the game that these were the type of at-bats he had seen
for years, watching the Yankees on television. ``This is why
they've won this many World Series,'' Justice said.
</P>
<P>
   There was a pitching change, the left-hander Bryan Ward taking
over for Schrenk. Jeff Brantley, the Philadelphia closer, was
warming up, but Phillies Manager Terry Francona desperately wanted
to get through the game without using Brantley, who pitched
Thursday and Friday and warmed up fully Saturday. O'Neill took a
pitch out of the strike zone, whacked at a high fastball, looking
to tie the game _ and drove it deep to left, a sacrifice fly. The
Phillies' lead was down to three runs.
</P>
<P>
   Batting right-handed, Williams punched a single through the big
hole on the right side of the infield, scoring Knoblauch as Jeter
stopped at second. Justice worked the count to three balls and two
strikes, the pressure on Ward mounting, and drew a walk. Bases
loaded. Players from both teams stood at the railing in front of
their respective dugouts.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez blooped a single into right-center, just in front
of the diving Bobby Abreu, and Jeter scored. Phillies 6, Yankees 5,
only one out. Jorge Posada struck out, however, and with just one
out needed, Francona called for Brantley.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre inserted Vizcaino as a pinch-hitter
for Thompson, knowing that Vizcaino had four hits and two walks in
14 prior plate appearances against Brantley, a favorable matchup _
and Vizcaino smashed a liner that tipped off the glove of third
baseman Scott Rolen. The ball fell, Williams scored, the game was
tied, the Yankees were clapping and shouting in their dugout,
Martinez raising two hands.
</P>
<P>
   Brantley fell behind Brosius three balls and one strike,
struggling, before Brosius popped out, sending the game into the
10th inning.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera was in trouble immediately in the 10th. Rolen lined a
single to center to lead off _ only the fourth time in 35 games
that Rivera had allowed a hit to the first batter he faced. With
two outs, Rivera left a fastball over the middle for Hunter to
crush; the closer sat stoically in the dugout after the half
inning, the Yankees trailing 8-6.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, leading off against Brantley, fouled off a two-strike
pitch and drew his second walk in two innings; he hadn't drawn two
walks in a game since May 19. Jeter hovered over the plate and
Brantley bounced a fastball off his elbow. All Brantley had left
physically, Francona acknowledged later, ``is guts,'' and, the
manager added, ``that's a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill singled to right-center, scoring Knoblauch. Williams _
batting left-handed this time _ slapped a single to the opposite
field again, through the hole between short and third, and Jeter
scored unchallenged, O'Neill stopped at second. The game was tied
again, the fans bellowing.
</P>
<P>
   Brantley threw a ball to Justice to fall behind, 2-1, and was
shaking his head: Doomed. Justice then leaned over the plate to
drive a liner to left. Ron Gant raced back and reached up with his
glove. O'Neill hesitated between second and third, unsure _ until
he saw the ball carry over Gant's glove. Then O'Neill charged
around third and across home plate, giving high-fives to the few
teammates who hadn't rushed to hug Justice and thump him on the
helmet between first and second base.
</P>
<P>
   Before this comeback, Knoblauch said, it seems like the Yankees'
rallies mostly fell short this year. This was something different.
This seemed like old times.

GENERAL MILLS REPORTED TO BE BUYING PILLSBURY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.)   By CONSTANCE L. HAYS and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the latest merger between food companies seeking strength
through scale, General Mills has agreed to pay $10.5 billion for
the Pillsbury division of Diageo PLC, executives close to the talks
said Sunday. The deal is set to be announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of the Pillsbury brands, which had sales of $6
billion last year and include Green Giant vegetables, Haagen-Dazs
ice cream and Old El Paso Mexican food, vaults General Mills into
the No. 5 spot among U.S. food makers.
</P>
<P>
   The company will have $12.2 billion in annual sales and will be
a dominant player in the increasingly important refrigerated
section of supermarkets _ where General Mills sells Yoplait and
Colombo yogurt and Pillsbury is a key purveyor of ready-to-bake
cookies and biscuits _ and in the food-service sector, which
supplies products to restaurants and institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Less vibrant but strengthened is the baking division, where
General Mills owns Gold Medal and Betty Crocker, and the Pillsbury
Doughboy is a household name.
</P>
<P>
   ``A stronger General Mills is emerging, and that's what the
industry needs,'' said Jeffrey G. Kanter, an analyst for Prudential
Securities. With its broader lineup of brands, General Mills is no
longer as dependent on breakfast cereal for earnings. Cereals like
Cheerios, Cocoa Puffs and Lucky Charms accounted for over half the
company's earnings last year, Kanter said, but the category is
troubled by high prices and dwindling demand.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which values Pillsbury at 1.7 times last year's sales,
is the latest in a flurry that began this spring when Unilever PLC
made an unsolicited bid for Bestfoods that culminated in a $20.4
billion agreement last month. That move shook up the sluggish food
sector, which had logged little growth recently and had seen share
prices slide drastically.
</P>
<P>
   With supermarket chains consolidating into a relative handful of
strong global players over the last several years, brand-name food
makers felt their power slipping and have sought ways to regain
influence with retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Eroded stock prices played a role in the General Mills deal as
well. The company agreed to pay $4.5 billion in cash and $5.4
billion in stock for Pillsbury. The company, whose shares closed
Friday at $36.3125, also argued that its stock would rise to at
least $42.55 and agreed to cover the difference with a fee of up to
$642 million if its shares do not reach the target within the next
12 months. For tax purposes, General Mills paid the fee up front
but it will receive a rebate if its stock hits $42.55.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst applauded that detail, saying it could promote
better results from the combined company. ``It puts a little extra
pressure on their performance and adds a little more discipline to
the economics,'' said Jaine Mehring of Salomon Smith Barney, who
has a price target of $45 for General Mills over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Diageo will have a 33 percent stake in General Mills, the
executives said, and will name two directors to the General Mills
board. One is expected to be the Diageo chief executive. Paul S.
Walsh, Diageo's chief operating officer, who recently served as
Pillsbury's chairman and chief executive, is to take the top job at
Diageo in January.
</P>
<P>
   Both Pillsbury and General Mills are based in Minneapolis. While
some job cuts are expected from combining operations, the resulting
company is likely to strengthen the area's economy, local officials
said last week. ``Any opportunity to see them grow and keep our
companies home-based is good news,'' said the mayor of Minneapolis,
Sharon Sayles Belton.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another analyst, Erike Gritman Long of J.P. Morgan, said the
price paid was on the high side, considering how the Pillsbury
brands have been performing. ``We'll still need to get some details
from General Mills about what they think this does to their
top-line growth,'' she said. ``Some investors will argue that,
given the amount of equity they are giving away, they will need to
accelerate top-line growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for General Mills and Diageo could not be reached for
comment Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   With its Pillsbury division sold and plans under way to spin off
its Burger King fast-food restaurants, Diageo plans to focus on the
liquor business and its Guinness beer holdings. That could mean
acquiring brands in the near future and returning some cash to
shareholders, a spokeswoman said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Some premier liquor brands are up for grabs, including Chivas
Regal scotch and Martell cognac. Those brands are owned by Seagram
Co., which has agreed to be acquired by Vivendi SA, a French
conglomerate that has said it plans to sell the brands to pay off
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts expect General Mills to sell brands that do not
fit its portfolio. Among those could be Green Giant, which makes
canned and frozen vegetables, and Haagen-Dazs. Unilever paid $326
million in April to acquire Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade, which could
help command a high price for Haagen-Dazs.
</P>
<P>
   And it is possible that the new General Mills will become a
target for a larger company. Long said last week that it was
already attractive for Nestle SA, the Swiss-based food giant, and
having Haagen-Dazs in its lineup made it even more so.

DIVERS SEARCH FOR SURVIVORS OF CANADA TORNADO 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Recasts lead with search of lake, puts missing trailers at
70; more specific attribution for Dudley; adds details
throughout.) 
By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta _ Hoping to find survivors trapped in air
pockets, divers searched about 70 trailers Sunday that had been
hurled from a campground into a lake by a tornado on Friday evening
125 miles south of here.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado, just before 7 p.m., obliterated the campground with
winds of almost 200 miles an hour. The death toll was raised to 10
Sunday with the death of a camper who had been hospitalized. The
dead included a 2-year-old child.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said it probably was so deadly because the campers and
fishermen on the lake did not hear storm warnings and could not see
the storm coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``A trailer park like this offers absolutely no protection in
the winds of a tornado, set down in a valley where it is difficult
to see the storm approaching,'' Dennis Dudley, a severe weather
specialist for the Calgary office of Environment Canada, a federal
agency, said at a news conference Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Dudley was on vacation with his family when he spotted the
threatening weather formation and called in a warning.
</P>
<P>
   Divers searched Pine Lake on Sunday, looking for the bodies of
fishermen who may been tossed from their boats when the storm hit.
The search was complicated by low visibility and waters
contaminated by battery acid from the submerged vehicles. Military
and police divers also searched the trailers that were blown into
the lake by the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Smith, the director of the search, said Sunday that he
believed that almost all of the 300 people staying at Green Acres,
a private campground, had been accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   The storm injured at least half of the people in the campground,
sending 132 to local hospitals for treatment, many for broken
bones.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado was Canada's deadliest since July 1987, when a
tornado struck Edmonton, killing 27 people, injuring 300, and
causing $230 million in property damage. Alberta usually
experiences 16 to 20 tornadoes a year, but most are relatively
weak.
</P>
<P>
   Although a severe thunderstorm warning, with a potential for
tornados, had been issued about 40 minutes earlier, the campers
apparently had not heard the warnings on the radio, officials said
Sunday. Most were sitting down for their evening meal when the
storm suddenly roared over a hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hailstones started falling,'' Harold English, a camper, told a
local reporter. ``The wind came up and trees started breaking _
some 8 inches thick _ near our trailer. Within two minutes it was
all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Lapreirie, who was camping Friday, had stitches on his face
and his arm in a sling on Sunday. ``After this thing hit, I jumped
into my trailer as it was going by,'' he said. ``It was moving when
I got in _ I knew my wife was in there. I happened to get inside,
and the next thing you know it's upside down, around, then we hit
the dirt.''

MRS. CLINTON DENIES MAKING ANTI-SEMITIC SLUR 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton summoned reporters to a
rare news conference outside her home here Sunday afternoon to
denounce as ``absolutely false'' an allegation in a new book that
she used an anti-Semitic slur in a heated conversation with her
husband's campaign manager after Bill Clinton lost his first race
for Congress in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Her face taut, her voice trembling and her eyes welling with
tears, Mrs. Clinton said she had never used the profanity-ridden
slur against the campaign manager, Paul Fray, who is not Jewish.
She challenged the credibility of three Arkansas people cited as
sources for the incident in the book ``State of the Union,'' by
Jerry Oppenheimer, a former National Enquirer reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did not happen,'' Mrs. Clinton said, adding: ``I have never
said anything like that. Ever. Ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said she did not even recall the meeting in
question, a reportedly tense election night post-mortem involving
the Clintons, Fray and his wife, Mary Lee, that has been mentioned
in a number of books written about the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton issued a statement from Camp David, where he
was overseeing Middle East peace talks this weekend, backing up
this wife. ``I was there on election night in 1974, and this charge
is simply not true,'' Clinton said. ``It did not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The three sources were the Frays and an Arkansas political
consultant who said he overheard the exchange while standing
outside the door. The Frays said in an interview Sunday night that
they stood by their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In making such a public statement, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged
that she was drawing more attention to a report that so far has
received relatively little coverage in New York newspapers and
television. Her decision reflected clear concern that the report
could damage her standing among Jewish voters in her race against
Rep. Rick Lazio, a Republican of Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``My policy for the last eight years has largely been just to
absorb whatever insult, whatever charge, whatever accusation
anybody said,''' Mrs. Clinton, standing beside Rep. Nita Lowey, a
Westchester Democrat and a prominent Jewish member of Congress.
``Not respond, because they are so outrageous and so unfair. I
mean, I've been accused of everything from complicity in murder to
_ you know, you name it, people have been out there saying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton released a copy of a hand-written letter she said
Fray had been written her on July 1, 1997, apologizing for negative
things he had said about her to people writing critical books and
articles about the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point in my life, I would say things without thinking,
without factual foundation, and without rhyme or remedy until it
furthered my own agenda,'' the letter writer says, adding: ``I was
wrong and I have wronged you; I ask for your forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Fray on Sunday night said that he had written a letter of
forgiveness to Mrs. Clinton, but added that he needed to see the
document to determine whether what she released was what he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his remark in the letter about saying things
``without a factual foundation,'' Fray responded: ``You know, I
don't recall, to be honest with you. I'm like her: She doesn't
recall there being a meeting up there, or so I've heard.''

U.S. IS TIED BY GUATEMALA IN WORLD CUP QUALIFYING 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMIE TRECKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAZATENANGO, Guatemala _ The U.S. men's team began their
CONCACAF World Cup 2002 Qualifying campaign Sunday by snatching a
draw from the jaws of victory. Conceding a goal in the 87th minute,
the Americans were sent home with a 1-1 tie against
lightly-regarded Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very disappointed in the result,'' coach Bruce Arena
said. ``And I am not happy with my team's effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Goalkeeper Kasey Keller said, ``We did a lot of dumb things, for
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The match showcased two vastly different U.S. teams _ one
confident and poised, the other scrambling for cover. After
thoroughly dominating the first half of play, the United States
faded badly in the second, allowing the Guatemalan attack to
compress the Americans' defense and fire away at will.
</P>
<P>
   Keying off dynamic play from David Regis, Claudio Reyna and
Chris Armas, the United States looked as if it could do no wrong in
the first half. Crisp passes and clever ball movement allowed
forward Ante Razov to repeatedly penetrate _ and ultimately
capitalize upon _ a three-man Guatemalan back line. When Reyna and
Razov finally combined in the 45th minute with a nice drop pass
that split the defense, even the crowd seemed to sense that this
might not be the home side's day.
</P>
<P>
   But the second half was a wholly different story, with Guatemala
getting an energizing boost from forward Fredy Garcia, who promptly
began shredding the American's left side. Gone were the tight
crosses and swift counters that characterized the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any excuses,'' U.S. defender Robin Fraser said.
``We just didn't defend as well as we could have.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller said: ``Conceding a goal late is the difference between a
great team and a good team. It was the little things that we didn't
do that gave them opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Heat was clearly a factor. Staged in a rural village some 120
miles south of Guatemala City, Mazatenango was a curious choice for
a qualifier, especially since Guatemala usually enjoys a distinct
advantage in their capital _ altitude _ and would have drawn 35,000
fans to the national stadium instead of the 8,511 who could be
shoe-horned into tiny Luis Salazar Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But the site proved to be a provident choice as the game was
played in sweltering temperatures that had the Americans wilting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I hit the wall,'' Keller said.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Ruiz made them pay for those lapses when he converted a
ball chested down into the 6-yard box by Dwight Pezzarossi. A
quality strike, it also preserved Guatemala's hopes for the later
rounds. As coach Julio Cesar Cortez said, ``We had many
opportunities, but it was only when it became urgent that we were
able to come through.''
</P>
<P>
   The result gives the United States one point and raises the
stakes for its next match, next Sunday in Costa Rica. Historically
a hostile environment for the United States, the Americans must now
regroup and hope to find their three road points there.
</P>
<P>
   There were some positives to be taken away: the U.S. team looks
much tougher and crisper than it has looked at times in the past.
Reyna has blossomed into a true playmaker, but he, too, wilted in
the closing stages. And it is difficult to overlook the impact of
the loss of Eddie Pope to an injury in the 76th minute. Without the
lanky defender, the U.S. back line simply fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday's result surely bothers the U.S. players: as Razov
put it, ``We just gave away two points.''
</P>
<P>
   How costly that could be remains to be seen. The top two
finishers in the group will advance to a six nation CONCACAF final
next year. From that will come three qualifiers for the 2002 World
Cup in Japan and South Korea.

EDITORIAL: CHANNELING THE REVENUE RIVER 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, July 17:
</P>
<P>
   If there is anything as inevitable as death and taxes, it is the
fact that the presidential candidates will be debating tax policy.
Certainly, the differing proposals by both Gov. George W. Bush and
Vice President Al Gore to cut taxes will keep the issue before the
voters. Later in the campaign, we will be looking at the details of
their plans. But at this early stage, we feel it would be useful to
define some broad principles that ought to govern the choice of
potential tax cuts. The threshold question that needs to be asked
is whether tax cuts of any kind are the best way to bring about
economic growth as well as progressive policy goals like expanded
health care.
</P>
<P>
   If there is to be a tax cut, it should make the tax code more
simple, fair and progressive. Progressivity is a time-honored
principle often forgotten in the political debates. But since the
beginning of this century, Americans have consistently embraced the
principle that calls for the wealthy to pay proportionately larger
shares of their income in taxes. The tax system became less
progressive after the tax cuts of President Ronald Reagan and more
progressive after tax increases under Presidents George Bush and
Bill Clinton. The latest Treasury estimate is that the top fifth of
American families accounts for 56.7 percent of American family
income but 65.1 percent of total federal tax revenues. The top 1
percent accounts for 14.8 percent of total income and 20.1 percent
of tax revenues. These rates do not make for an excessively
progressive tax system.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that higher taxes on the wealthiest taxpayers _
particularly the marginal income tax rate of 39.6 percent and the
estate tax _ are destructive of the incentive to create more
wealth. But raising the highest income tax rates on the wealthiest
families in 1993 did not deter them from increasing their wealth
throughout the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the importance of progressivity, fairness dictates that
taxpayers in similar categories be treated equally. But this
principle can be difficult to implement. Many in Congress argue
that it is unfair for a married couple earning the same income and
filing a joint return to pay more in taxes than an unmarried couple
filing separately. This bipartisan group wants to eliminate the
so-called ``marriage penalty.'' Doing so, however, would lower
taxes on families with higher incomes.
</P>
<P>
   The tax code is filled with quandaries like this one. A certain
amount of inequity is inevitable in the tax code. Two families with
the same income, living across the street from each other, might
pay dramatically different amounts of taxes, depending on which
took advantage of tax breaks for health care, child care, education
or tax-free investments. A major step toward simplicity was taken
in 1986, when several layers of credits, deductions and loopholes
for special interests were stripped out of the tax code so that all
taxpayers could enjoy somewhat lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since then, however, many more tax breaks have been
introduced. Faced with a Republican Congress, President Clinton has
been a master at expanding the role of the federal government, not
by spending programs but by tax credits for child care, education
and other activities. Now both Gore and Bush have moved in the
direction of more tax breaks. The Texas governor calls for new tax
credits for long-term health care, education, health insurance,
charitable giving and adoptions. Gore proposes tax credits for
health insurance premiums, after-school care, college tuition and
retirement savings. All these proposals make the tax code more
complex, adding to the billions it already costs taxpayers simply
to prepare their forms. Rather than indiscriminately handing out
more tax incentives, Gore and Bush should consider simplifying the
code and achieving the lower tax rates they think the voters are
demanding in an across-the-board but progressive way.
</P>
<P>
   Tax cuts, in the final analysis, should be tested on whether
they eat up too much of the federal surplus, leaving little money
for other needs. They must not be weighted to the wealthy, like the
repeal of the federal estate tax that has now passed both houses.
They should keep the tax code equitable and be implemented in a way
that the working poor can use to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The logic for large tax cuts is that the surplus ``belongs'' to
American taxpayers and should be returned to them before being used
for more federal spending. What that formulation leaves out is that
the federal debt also belongs to the taxpayers, and so does the
obligation to think about huge future costs, including the
retirement security of the current work force. Assuring that the
next generation will have the education and skills to keep the
economy growing, and a clean environment to live in, is also an
obligation that belongs to the taxpayers.

RUNYAN BECOMES FIRST LEGALLY BLIND AMERICAN TO QUALIFY FOR GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Regina Jacobs and Suzy Favor Hamilton
relied on tactics rather than record speed Sunday in the women's
1,500 meters at the Olympic trials. When Jacobs put the accelerator
down in the final lap, there was no one who could beat her to the
checkered flag. But just as impressive as her victory in 4 minutes
1.1 seconds was the third-place finish by Marla Runyan, who became
the first legally blind American athlete ever to qualify for the
Winter or Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Johnson won the 400 meters by nearly a second in 43.68
seconds, the 10th-fastest time ever, but this was the rare occasion
where he became a footnote to the day's events. The real drama
occurred in the women's 1,500 where two long-time rivals, Jacobs
and Favor Hamilton, finished first and second, and Runyan made her
historical run for third.
</P>
<P>
   Runyan suffers from Stargardt's disease, a degeneration of the
retina that began to affect her in childhood and has essentially
left her with a hole at the center of her vision. She can see the
track with her peripheral vision but her competitors are often no
more than smudges of color and fuzzy hair styles. She has 20-300
vision in one eye, and 20-400 in the other. She must use magnifying
devices to read, and to watch videotapes of her races, she must
press her face inches from the television.
</P>
<P>
   In early June, her vision impairment led to an injury while
training in Eugene, Ore. Runyan jumped out of the way to avoid a
kid on a bike on a running trail, and she twisted her left leg,
injuring the ilio-tibial band of connective tissue that runs from
the hip to the knee. She could not run on a track or a trail for
five weeks, running in a pool instead, and it was not until last
Saturday that she began to train again on dry land. Exhausted, she
began dry-heaving after Friday's preliminary round and limped off
the track in a way that seemed to suggest she had no chance of
making the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   However, she is one of the country's most versatile and
resourceful athletes, having competed in the heptathlon at the 1996
Olympic trials. After the Atlanta Games, she decided to concentrate
on running, finishing 10th in the 1,500 meters at the 1999 world
championships in Seville, Spain. She received treatment on her leg
before stepping on the track, and even though she was in pain, she
positioned herself smartly for a final sprint to the tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awesome,'' Runyan said of making the Olympic team. ``I
never really think of my vision as much as the media does. And I
don't think my competitors do either. I think my vision is just a
circumstance that happened. I never looked at it as a barrier. I
never said I wanted to be the first legally-blind Olympian. I jut
wanted to be on an Olympic team, me, Marla.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Runyan added, she had received a heavy amount of
encouraging mail as her story has become public and her running
career has ascended.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me feel really good that it affects people in a
positive way,'' Runyan said.
</P>
<P>
   The men's 1,500 meters was won by the eccentric collegiate
champion from Stanford, Gabe Jennings, who made a break with 550
meters to go to set a personal best in 3:35.90. Jason Pyrah took
second in 3:36.70 and Jennings' Stanford teammate, Michael Stember
finished third in 3:37.04, but must make the Olympic qualifying
standard of 3:37 to compete in Sydney. Jennings grew up without
electricity on a commune in Northern California and never saw the
Summer Games on television until four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As the women's 1,500 began, Jacobs and Favor Hamilton dropped to
the back of the pack to avoid any early congestion, then both moved
up easily to the middle of the field. Runyan hung back also on the
outside so that her legs would not become entangled. Jacobs, a
two-time bronze medalist at the world championships, and Favor
Hamilton, the only American woman other than Mary Slaney to run
under 4 minutes, went through 400 meters in 67 seconds and the 800
in 2:12.83. The two were never more than a stride apart, and Jacobs
controlled the race from just off of Favor Hamilton's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Runyan almost experienced disaster in the third lap when
chain-reaction bumping forced her to reach out and touch the back
of Shayne Culpepper to maintain her own balance.
</P>
<P>
   Favor Hamilton made a charge heading into the bell lap, but
Jacobs easily followed and began a fierce kick that took her around
the final lap in 57.6 seconds. Favor Hamilton sprinted desperately
but could never make up any ground, and had to settle for second in
4:01.81. Runyan began her kick with 200 meters left and held off
Culpepper to take third in 4:06.44.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming off the last turn, I shifted gears and tried to hold it
to the finish,'' Runyan said. ``I began to tighten up, but I hoped
I was able to hold them off.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Slaney's 17-year-old national record of 3:57.12 will stand
for at least another season. However, Jacobs and Favor Hamilton are
expected to challenge for a gold medal at the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of strategy, it looked like Suzy and I had both the
same idea,'' Jacobs said. ``The race really started to go with a
lap to go. That's where I wanted to start winding it up. If I can
run a strategic 4:01, that tells me I have a lot of fitness and am
in position to run a very fast sub-4 if I get the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Favor Hamilton, who missed last season after surgery on her
Achilles' tendon, said she had just begun her speed work and was
encouraged because the Olympics were in September this year instead
of the usual month of July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty excited because the race felt easy to me,'' she
said. ``I just need to work a little bit more on my sprinting,
which is easy to do.''

WAR WITHOUT END IN SRI LANKA 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, July 17:
</P>
<P>
   Few ethnic conflicts in the world are more savage than the war
in Sri Lanka, an island nation off the southern tip of India. Since
1983, more than 60,000 people have died, many times the number
killed in Northern Ireland. The fighting has so resisted outside
efforts to mediate that Michael Ondaatje, in his powerful new novel
``Anil's Ghost,'' refers to it as ``a Hundred Years' War with
modern weaponry.'' Since the spring, the war has heated up again
with an anti-government offensive by separatist Tamils in Sri
Lanka's north. But there has also been a positive development. The
United States, India and other countries are increasingly united in
trying to bring an end to the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Sri Lanka was often hailed as a model of
stability, democracy and economic progress in the Third World. But
for many decades, Sri Lanka's Tamil minority bristled under
discriminatory policies of the government in Colombo, which is
dominated by the ethnic Sinhalese majority. With covert help from
India, a Tamil insurgency seeking independence in the north and
east made extensive military gains in the 1980s, capturing the
northern city of Jaffna. India later came to its senses and kicked
the Tamil rebels off Indian soil and sent its own troops to Sri
Lanka. The troops were later withdrawn, but Tamil rebels retaliated
by murdering former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffna is now controlled once again by the government, but in
the last two months its 30,000 troops have been besieged by the new
Tamil offensive. The obvious way to stop the fighting would be to
establish some sort of federation on Sri Lanka, with autonomy for
Tamil areas. The government has accepted the idea but not gone far
enough in its devolution proposals. Tamil rebels cling to their
goal of independence. Moreover, the main rebel group, known as the
Tigers, has killed off and wiped out rival moderate groups.
</P>
<P>
   A mediation attempt by Norway made some progress earlier this
year, but the offensive by the Tigers has put the possibility of
talks on hold. One good sign is that President Chandrika
Kumaratunga of Sri Lanka has been working with the main opposition
party to agree on a set of new Tamil autonomy proposals. These need
to be fleshed out, but the unity attempt is a step forward.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be possible to restart the negotiating process until
it is clear who will control Jaffna and the surrounding peninsula
in the north. But all sides should recognize that there can be no
military solution to Sri Lanka's troubles. The terror,
assassinations and army clashes have gone on so long that, as
Ondaatje writes, the original reasons have been all but forgotten.

FAMILIES OF THOSE KILLED ON TWA FLIGHT 800 BREAK GROUND ON
MEMORIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC LIPTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHIRLEY, N.Y. _ On a wind-swept point overlooking the expanse of
ocean where the fiery remnants of Trans World Airlines Flight 800
landed four years ago, relatives of some of the 230 people killed
in the crash gathered Sunday to break ground for a memorial.
</P>
<P>
   A wall of black granite _ 30 feet long, 12 feet high and etched
with the names of each passenger and crew member _ is scheduled to
be placed on the spot, surrounded by a sculpture garden, with the
entombed belongings of some of the victims. Along the entryway,
flags are to be flown, one from each of the 14 countries that had
been home to the passengers and crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say if you hold someone in your thoughts, they are not
really gone,'' said John J. Seaman of Albany, whose niece, Michele
Becker, 19, died in the crash. ``That is why today is so important
to us.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Gov. George Pataki, New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater and James Hall,
chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, all attended
Sunday's ceremony, a day before the fourth anniversary of the crash
on July 17, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing any of us says can change what happened here or bring
back the ones you love so much or miss so dearly,'' Pataki told the
crowd, gathered under a tent at the edge of Smith Point beach on
Long Island, near Shirley. ``But I do hope that this memorial will
always remind you that the people of our nation _ indeed, the
people of the world _ continue to mourn the loss of 230 very
special people.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is in the final stages of the Flight 800
investigation. Federal officials met Sunday with relatives of the
victims to brief them. One of the issues discussed, according to
one participant, were steps being considered for other airplanes to
prevent similar crashes. The safety board, which is scheduled to
meet next month to consider a report on the cause of the crash, has
already blamed an explosion in the center fuel tank, although what
ignited the explosion has not been determined conclusively.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the estimated $1.5 million needed to build the
memorial has been raised, including $355,000 from the state,
$200,000 from New York City, $25,000 from Suffolk County and about
$100,000 from law firms representing families, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Gallagher of Seaford, N.Y., raised additional money last
week when he made a six-day, 51-mile swim from near Kennedy
International Airport to Smith Point, following the path of Flight
800. Organizers are holding off until they collect the remaining
money before starting construction, but they said they hoped to
complete the memorial by next July, and to hold an official opening
on the fifth anniversary of the crash.

IVY LEAGUE RULE LIMITS BASEBALL PROSPECT FROM PRINCETON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  By STEVE POPPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rule is buried in the Ivy League Presidents' Agreement,
adopted at the league's inception 25 years before Chris Young was
born. Young did not know the rule existed when he entered Princeton
in 1998, but it may alter his athletic career.
</P>
<P>
   The rule, Section IV-A-7, prohibits an Ivy League athlete from
signing a contract with a professional team and participating in
another intercollegiate sport. Every other conference allows this
sort of flexibility, allowing someone like Drew Henson to play
minor league baseball and still play quarterback at Michigan in the
fall, or Danny Ainge to take Brigham Young's basketball team to the
NCAA tournament while playing for the Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   But in those rare instances when a two-sport Ivy League athlete
is held in high enough regard to be wooed by the pros, a player
must decide. And Young, who plays both basketball and baseball at
Princeton, has a decision to make.
</P>
<P>
   Young is a 6-foot-10-inch center for the basketball team, good
enough to start from his first day at Princeton. He was the Ivy
League rookie of the year and last season became the sixth player
at Princeton to be named all-Ivy as a sophomore. He led the Tigers
in scoring (13.5 points), rebounding (5.8) and blocked shots (73)
and was second in assists (87).
</P>
<P>
   He was also a pitcher for the baseball team, good enough to be
named all-Ivy as a freshman and become the first male athlete in
the league to be rookie of the year in two sports. As a sophomore
this spring, he was 5-0 with a 1.82 earned run average, and in the
NCAA tournament, he held fifth-ranked Houston hitless for four
innings before leaving with the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Another rule that Young was not aware of allows a baseball team
to draft a player once he turns 21, superseding the normal process
of drafting a collegian after his junior year. Young turned 21 in
May and was drafted in the third round last month by the Pittsburgh
Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   He has also heard rumblings from basketball scouts that he will
be a first-round selection if he enters the NBA draft following his
junior year.
</P>
<P>
   If Young signs with the Pirates, however, he gives up his final
two years of basketball at Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough decision,'' he said. ``And at times it's been
frustrating, but I've been trying to keep an optimistic attitude
about it. So many kids are not so lucky. I'm just in a very
fortunate position and I'm just trying to enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Young is spending most of his summer on the beach on Cape Cod,
relaxing. But every fifth night, he treks to the mound for the
Chatham A's of the Cape Cod League, and this has only made his
decision more difficult. In one of the most prestigious amateur
leagues, Young has been one of the best pitchers. He is 2-2 with a
2.78 ERA and 41 strikeouts in 321/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   If he returns to college this fall, the Pirates lose his rights
the first day he goes to class. Young would most likely move up in
the baseball draft, however, having dropped as far as he did
because he made it clear that even if he signs and gives up on
basketball, he is committed to returning to Princeton to finish his
degree in politics and fitting in professional baseball after that.
He also remains adamant that it will take first-round money to get
him to sign. The lowest bonus for any of the first-round picks who
have signed so far this year was $950,000, and the final
first-round selection got $1,225,000.
</P>
<P>
   Young said the Pirates had offered him what they gave their
third-round pick last year (believed to be in the $500,000 range).
But he said he had set up financial parameters for signing, which
he feels are ``reasonable to get me to give up basketball and
baseball at Princeton.''
</P>
<P>
   There is talk at Princeton of addressing the rule, which the
basketball coach, Bill Carmody, called archaic. Few Ivy League
players have been in position to raise the issue, the last being
Mark DeRosa, a football player and shortstop at Penn whom the
Atlanta Braves drafted in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But any change would be too late to accommodate Young now. And
as much as money may be the deciding factor, he has tried to follow
his passion, too. For someone who grew up in Texas idolizing Nolan
Ryan and whose fastball has been clocked at 94 miles an hour with
control that would have made Ryan envious at this age, the passion
is baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his whole life, while he really likes basketball and
enjoys playing at Princeton, until his junior year of high school
he thought he was just going to be a baseball player,'' said Scott
Bradley, Princeton's baseball coach, who spent nine seasons in the
major leagues as a catcher. As much as Young likes basketball,
Bradley said, ``since he's a little kid, when he goes to sleep, he
dreams about pitching in the big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley acknowledged, however, that in basketball, Young keeps
getting better. ``He's a 6-foot-10 kid who shoots 3-pointers,
blocks shots, can run and do so many things,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not blessed as explosively fast or a great leaper,''
Bradley said. ``But he's an athlete in the purest terms. He's got
the feel, a real feel for the game, for both games. I think what
people see is the 6-foot-10 body and the first thing they think is
Randy Johnson. I played with Randy and caught him, but Chris is
like Greg Maddux in Randy Johnson's body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced he's going to pitch in the big leagues
someday.''
</P>
<P>
   His father, Charles Young, said, ``Ever since he's been a little
kid he always wanted to play professional baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chris Young maintains his options. ``It might seem that
baseball is more my love now because it's come up quicker,'' he
said, ``but my dream has always been to be a professional athlete.
Which sport, it's hard for me to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the tough part. People say, `Why not go back and
concentrate on just one or the other and make yourself a
first-rounder?' That's something that would be nice, but I've
always played both, and my love is so great, it's tough to choose
and give one up.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes the decision harder is that no one is certain which
sport provides a brighter future. Coaches and scouts agree that
when Young leaves one sport behind, he will grow in the other. He
has squeezed work for one sport within the confines of the other's
schedule, walking over to the baseball diamond after basketball
practice to throw, and shooting baskets during his downtime on the
diamond.

   There is also the tantalizing notion that he will get better and
the offers will be greater in a year in both sports. On the
basketball court, he has outplayed Chris Mihm of Texas, the first
center taken in the draft this year. That starts the math going in
Young's mind: a first-round draft pick in the NBA earns a
three-year guaranteed contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about him in baseball as being polished, a big guy
with control,'' Carmody said. ``As a basketball player, it's the
same thing. He came in and was a good passer right away, understood
where to throw the ball. He's different than guys we've had before
in that he's a legitimate center with a center's body. He was
picked No. 89 in baseball and next year's he's at worst in the top
20 in basketball. But it has to be from the kid's heart. Is there a
passion of one over the other?''
</P>
<P>
   Young said that if there were no obstacles, ``there's no doubt
I'd like to go back to Princeton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough decision, and I'm going to have to weigh whether
I think next year will improve my status,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he said, ``I'm going to enjoy it, whatever I
decide.''

 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With millions of air-conditioners humming this
summer, and dire warnings of electricity running short at hours of
peak demand, a growing number of utilities say there is plenty of
power around if only they can allocate it properly.
</P>
<P>
   These utilities are using some decidedly novel tactics _
particularly new methods of pricing energy _ to do so. In the
process, they are inducing companies and individual consumers to
change how they use electricity and think harder about how much
power they really need at different times.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin Electric Power is one of the utilities with a new
approach to pricing power. The company usually has no trouble
meeting demand when temperatures rise in the summer. But in the
second week of May, usually the slack season for power use, between
the winter and summer peaks, the utility had closed many generating
stations for maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   So when the temperature in Milwaukee hit an unseasonable 90
degrees, Wisconsin Electric saw a power shortage looming. One
possibility was buying electricity from another company on the open
market, but because other utilities were also caught short, that
would have cost 10 to 20 times the usual price.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the utility called one of its biggest customers, the
Cleveland Cliffs iron ore mine, in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. How
would the mine feel, dispatchers asked, about taking the afternoon
off _ and being paid for it?
</P>
<P>
   At first the answer was no. But then plant managers looked at
the pile of crushed ore coming out of the milling machines, and
realized that if the machines shut down for the rest of the day, no
shipments would be delayed. After some quick negotiations, a deal
was struck: Wisconsin Electric would pay the mine $82,000 to shut
down its ore crushers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a heck of a good deal,'' said Richard A. Abdoo, the
chairman, president and chief executive of Wisconsin Electric. His
company would be paying Cleveland Cliffs about 30 cents a
kilowatt-hour not to use electricity, or about six times what
Wisconsin Electric usually charges industrial customers for a
kilowatt hour. But it was a lot cheaper than buying electricity on
the open market.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin has gotten more sophisticated since May, gathering the
beeper and fax numbers of 80 of its biggest customers. On hot
afternoons, it can alert them to log on to its Web page, where it
offers them cash _ the amount varies, much like the price of a
restaurant's lobster special _ to reduce consumption at certain
hours.
</P>
<P>
   There are no statistics on the number of utilities using new
methods to manage energy demand, but more and more companies seem
to be doing it. In Connecticut, Northeast Utilities is installing
Internet-controlled thermostats in 50 houses, which it can use to
bump air conditioner settings up by 4 degrees when it needs the
power, in exchange for a $200 payment to each homeowner for the
summer. And around the country, utilities are installing
radio-controlled switches on central air conditioners and swimming
pool pumps to turn them off at peak hours.
</P>
<P>
   For years, electricity has been sold under a system that is
worthy of the old Soviet Union: a kilowatt-hour has a fixed price,
and you can have as much as you want until it runs out; then there
isn't any for anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Schurr, vice president of Silicon Energy, which writes
software for the Internet-controlled thermostats, compared the
traditional system to an airline that keeps a flock of planes by
the gate in case a crowd suddenly wants to fly somewhere. ``We
don't have a reservation system,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Not troubling customers with the fluctuations of price worked
fairly well under the old regulated system. A kilowatt-hour, which
the utility typically sold for 8 to 10 cents, often cost 2 cents
but hardly ever more than 12. Now, electricity is often bought and
sold wholesale, with no regulation, and the cost can temporarily
soar to $6 a kilowatt-hour. Some utilities can pass those costs
through and spread them among their customers, but everyone's costs
would be much lower if customers had a choice to cut consumption
when prices became exorbitant.
</P>
<P>
   The new pricing structure, with rates varying by the hour, will
take some getting used to. ``A lot of people are going to say, I
don't want to face this,'' said Eric Hirst, a consultant on
electric industry restructuring. ``But others are going to say, I
can make money by cutting consumption here and increasing
consumption there.''
</P>
<P>
   Pricing by the hour has no impact on energy efficiency _ the
amount of work done per kilowatt-hour _ but it does improve
reliability, he said, because it will minimize power failures.
</P>
<P>
   Some utilities are reluctant to let customers know they do not
have enough power on hand to handle every contingency, preferring
to sell as much power as possible and pass along occasionally
extraordinary prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, there are not a lot of production operations that
keep a lot of inventory around these days,'' said William T.
McCormick Jr., chairman and chief executive of CMS Energy, the
parent of Consumers Power, of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   And customers can be reluctant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like to take a plant up and down if we don't have
to,'' said David L. Gardner, a spokesman for Cleveland Cliffs. But
on that day in May, it worked out that a shutdown entailed little
waste of manpower. ``It was a win-win situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland Cliffs is one of many Wisconsin Electric customers on
an ``interruptible'' contract, which allows the utility to pull the
plug in an emergency. But this wasn't an emergency, just a time
when the economics favored rewarding the mine to shut down.
</P>
<P>
   The utility has signed up 81 major customers this spring, with a
total demand of 40 megawatts (enough to power 1,000 homes), who are
prepared to bid for power interruptions. It hopes to sign up
customers using an added 30 megawatts, though it is not yet sure
how much of that will be volunteered when it needs relief.
</P>
<P>
   In a blunt, low-tech way, utilities have tried for years to cut
peaks in demand for power, which they call peak load. Potomac
Electric Power, which serves the District of Columbia and some
Maryland suburbs, has persuaded about a third of its 600,000
residential customers to join a ``kilowatchers club.'' In exchange
for a monthly credit of $9 on their bill, the utility has installed
a second electric meter for their air conditioners. It can shut off
the air conditioners by radio control for 13 minutes every
half-hour. Some customers, in exchange for a $22 monthly payment,
have meters that can shut off their appliances altogether. Last
year, peak load was 5,927 megawatts, but the kilowatchers can shave
271 megawatts if necessary. Potomac Electric typically uses the
radio control five to 10 days a year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, utilities are getting more sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of June, David and Elizabeth Yu, of Unionville,
Conn., accepted a $50 payment from their utility, Northeast
Utilities, to let Northeast replace the thermostat that runs their
air conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   Central air conditioners in houses like the Yus' _ a
16-year-old, four-bedroom Cape _ draw about 3 kilowatts; raising
the thermostat 4 degrees cuts the number of minutes they run each
hour by about 30 percent, said Michael W. Townsley, a Northeast
manager who oversees conservation. If the family had the thermostat
set at 74, for example, the utility could re-set it to 78.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the year, the power saved is not worth much; if the air
conditioner ran for an hour, Northeast would charge the Yus less
than 15 cents. But now that Northeast buys its electricity on the
open market at peak hours, the price can change fast. Hence the
value of fiddling with the Yus' thermostat from a central office.
</P>
<P>
   ``When supply and demand are very tight, you're going to see
tremendous swings,'' Townsley said. ``In the morning the price
might be down around 2 cents, later, $1 a kilowatt-hour. What that
says is, there are some potential economic opportunities there.''
</P>
<P>
   Many companies offer radio-controlled switches that will turn
off an air conditioner or a pool pump. But the thermostat,
developed with the Carrier Corp., has a more subtle impact on the
household.
</P>
<P>
   The Yus' new thermostat calls in four times a day for
instructions. If the family lets the utility control the
temperature, Northeast will pay them another $150 on Oct. 1. But if
Elizabeth Yu finds the house uncomfortably warm, she can override
the setting. Each time she does so, though, Northeast will deduct
$15 from that bounty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The financial incentive is not that much,'' David Yu said.
``It'll just get absorbed into the budget.'' But, being a
gadget-lover, he is attracted by the device itself.
</P>
<P>
   David Yu is at work during the hours that Northeast is most
likely to adjust their thermostat. But Elizabeth Yu, who is at home
with the couple's three children, said, ``It'll be interesting to
see how it changes our lives during the peak hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all utilities, Northeast already has precise historical
data on how much power customers will demand at any given level of
temperature and humidity; now it wants to know what that demand
curve looks like when price is a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our interest is primarily reliability, when supply and demand
tend to be outside of equilibrium,'' Townsley said. ``But that's
also at the time when the economics come in.''

STRUGGLING, SHINNECOK INDIANS EYE ATTEMPT AT RECOVERING SOUTHAMPTON
LAND 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE LeDUFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y. _ The road leading into the Shinnecock Indian
reservation is not a welcoming one: The sign marking the way reads,
``Trespassers will be arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   Some uninvited people _ drug dealers and government workers _
have been reportedly fired upon after crossing onto tribal lands.
Tourists are simply asked to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians are an insular lot. The world outside their 800-acre
reservation here on the Shinnecock Peninsula knows little about
them, and for 350 years, that's the way they have preferred it.
Their dealings with society, they say, have never been good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems every time we've dealt with the white man, we've come
out the worse for it,'' said Harriet Gumbs, a 79-year-old elder and
a tribal historian.
</P>
<P>
   The reservation is a postage stamp of marshland swamped by
poverty and unemployment. For years, the Indians watched as land
that was once theirs was transformed into housing subdivisions.
Although they complained, there were few sympathetic ears at the
local courthouse and Town Hall. After all, they had signed treaties
and land-swap agreements, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They built on our ancestors' bones, and we never really did
anything to stop it,'' said Elizabeth Haile, 69, a member of the
Thunderbird clan who watched over the years as houses and other
buildings sprouted up around the reservation. ``That's changing
with the young people.''
</P>
<P>
   East End power brokers on Long Island have taken notice as this
new breed of Shinnecock have lain in front of bulldozers, marched
on Town Hall and protested on the steps of the state Capitol in
Albany to stop the development of 62 acres of virgin woodland to
the north of the Montauk Highway, the road that separates the
reservation from the rest of Southampton. The news of the protests
has spread from Indian-run radio in Canada to the editorial pages
of The News From Indian Country, a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The young Shinnecock have been radicalized by the success of
tribes that were once destitute, like the Oneida Indians. The
Oneida reservation was once a tumble-down 32 acres in upstate New
York, but the tribe now owns the state's largest casino and has a
land claim wending its way through federal court asking for the
return of 250,000 acres between Syracuse and Utica.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the young group of Shinnecock are talking
aggressively about claiming 3,600 acres of prime Southampton real
estate that includes three golf courses _ among them the renowned
Shinnecock Hills, site of the U.S. Open in 2004 _ and Southampton
College of Long Island University.
</P>
<P>
   It is land that once belonged to the Shinnecock. It is land they
want back. The tribe filed a petition with the federal government
three years ago seeking recognition and has since raised the
specter of casinos on the East End.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my people are scared about what we're doing,'' said
Becky Genia, 43, who left the reservation as a teen-ager in the
mid-1970s and learned the politics of protest with the American
Indian Movement. ``We're surrounded by very rich people. The folks
on the res think that raising Cain about broken promises and
miserable living conditions means they're going to take what little
land we got left. I got news: they aren't going to touch another
acre of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Developers say that they hold a title to the disputed 62 acres
that dates back more than a century, and their claim to the
property is built on firm legal ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``The homes are being built as we speak,'' said John Bennet, a
lawyer for the developers, Parrish Pond Associates. ``The Indians'
lawsuit was thrown out of court.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians have stopped short of laying formal claim to the 62
acres, but say the wooded site is a small but sacred portion of
their heritage that should be preserved.
</P>
<P>
   The Shinnecock are a state-recognized tribe, but one of more
than 100 Indian tribes not acknowledged by the federal government.
They have no access to federal education and health money and run
no gambling operations. More important, they receive no legal
assistance from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, so their land claims
hang in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   According to records, in the early 18th century, the town of
Southampton paid the tribe $20 for its land and gave it a
1,000-year lease on the 3,600 acres. In 1859, town officials
convinced the state legislature that the Shinnecock were willing to
break that lease to allow the Long Island Rail Road to go through
in exchange for outright title to the current reservation on
Shinnecock Neck.
</P>
<P>
   John Strong, a professor emeritus of history at Southampton
College, said he believes the Shinnecock were pressured into the
deal and that the signatures on the document were faked. If a court
should ever rule in the Shinnecock's favor, the tribe would hold
legal title to billions of dollars in property.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new group of Indians have got people's attention,'' said
state Sen. Kenneth LaValle, a Republican who represents the area.
``The buzzword is casino. Right now, the Indians don't have a
friend in the world, but if they get the feds on board, imagine the
fight. The Hamptons are the playground of the powerful. You think
they'll stand for rabble coming out from the city to play cards,
get drunk and urinate on their hedgerows?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   New homes are being built on the reservation by retirees who,
after living in black society in cities like Washington and Los
Angeles, have returned to the reservation, where they pay no
property taxes. The income disparity on the reservation has
widened. The main employers are the smoke shops and hot dog stands
that line the highway and serve the weekend tourists. The tribal
schoolhouse has been closed and Indian children attend public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Shinnecock, for the most part, take a hostile view of
politics, whether they are federal, state, town or tribal. But it
is especially the tribal politics that tie the community in knots.
Without a coherent voice of resistance for the tribe, the
bulldozers continue to clear trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those old dogs, they're in it for themselves,'' said Ruben
Bess Valdez, 45, a university-trained environmentalist, speaking of
the tribal trustees. He said the leaders have in the past made
land-use and right-of-way deals with the state, kept the money for
themselves and kept the tribe in the dark. ``If you're in it for
yourself, how can you fight for anyone else?''
</P>
<P>
   With little money for court battles, the tribe remains divided
over the more aggressive tactics. On one side are the tribal
trustees who hold nearly all the decision-making power in the lives
of the 500 people on the reservation. On the other side are the
brash group of college- and street-educated Indians who want a
settlement now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need changes now,'' said Chuck Quinn, who has been arrested
for sitting on the 18th green at Shinnecock Hills in protest. ``No
more selling us out, no more backdoor deals with the whites.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Indians await word of their application for federal
recognition. Such status would give the tribe the right to
negotiate gambling deals with the state. The application process
can take years, experts say, and the tribal trustees have yet to
respond to a 1998 letter from the Bureau of Indian Affairs
requesting more application materials.
</P>
<P>
   Federal recognition would also mean that the tribe would have to
draft a new constitution and set up a new government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of the matter is that we need to come together on
the reservation before we can make our demands to the general
public,'' said Harold Dent, a Shinnecock and an adviser to the
tribal trustees. ``I am trying to make this point to the trustees.
But people running around shouting willy-nilly isn't going to help
our situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The reservation is a world apart from the rest of the Hamptons.
Cancer rates among the Shinnecock are among the highest on Long
Island. In a town where a pool-side bungalow rents for $30,000 for
the summer, the median per capita income on the reservation hovers
around $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   The reservation, in addition, has yet to be hooked up to the
Suffolk County water supply. The Indians drink from an aquifer that
is contaminated with the pesticide Temik at levels seven times the
amount considered safe for human consumption, according to the
county health department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water authority simply won't run them pipes,'' said the
Southampton town supervisor, Vincent Cannuscio. ``Somebody has to
pay for it. And it's going to have to be the Shinnecock.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians also cannot get home-improvement loans because the
land is held in common and they have no mortgages. What is more, no
Indian holds any meaningful elected or appointed town position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their situation is the dirty little secret of Southampton,''
said Bob Zellner, a civil rights activist and adjunct professor of
history at Southampton College.

SPORTS COLUMN: IN THE LONG JUMP AND BEYOND, THE DAWN OF A NEW DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Sunday afternoon, a crowded stadium roaring
like the three-ring circus that is track at its best. High jumpers,
pole vaulters and sprinters all competing at once.
</P>
<P>
   For about an hour Sunday afternoon all eyes focused on the
long-jump pit, where history was unfolding and folding up. All eyes
were on Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who has competed in four Olympics and
is one of the most outstanding athletes of the last century.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday she was chasing the rising sun, Marion Jones, 25, who
wants a shot at winning five gold medals in September at the Games
in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee, 38, won her first Olympic gold medal in 1984,
when Jones was 9 but already developing her sprinting resume.
</P>
<P>
   Inactive since 1998, Joyner-Kersee decided to give the Olympics
one final try. No one was jumping out of the box, and besides, she
wasn't going to let Jones or anyone else inherit her mantle by
default. Jones would have to take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't give up,'' Joyner-Kersee said.
</P>
<P>
   She did not give up, and Jones took it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon Section 102 was a tense section of family,
friends and coaches. The front-row scene was classic, a photo of
aspirations: past, present and future. There was C.J. Hunter,
Marion Jones' husband. Next to him was Trevor Graham, Jones' coach.
</P>
<P>
   To Hunter's right sat Al Joyner, Jackie's brother and the
husband of Florence Griffith-Joyner, the the sprinter who died two
years ago. Sitting in his lap was their 9-year-old daughter, Mary.
For Joyner-Kersee, Sunday was a direct challenge, not so much to
Jones but to the coming generation of athletes Jones leads.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee had not jumped since 1998; she watched track and
field from afar, spending most of her time managing her foundation
in East St. Louis, tending to her NASCAR interest. But out of the
corner of her eye she watched the distances of the female long
jumpers. She noticed, as July approached, that nobody, including
Marion Jones, was jumping out of the box. No one was long jumping
so fantastically that Jackie Joyner-Kersee would be intimidated
from even competing.
</P>
<P>
   So here she was. And here she learned the lesson all great
champions inevitably learn when their time has passed. Younger legs
and stronger arms make up in strength what they lack in experience,
and make up in speed what they lack in frame of reference. Watching
from afar is one thing, but in the end it ain't nothing like the
real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee performed a minor miracle by making the cut for
the second round. At one point Jones was fourth with a longest jump
of 22 feet 1} inches. Joyner-Kersee was fifth at 21-10}.
</P>
<P>
   Now she jumped 20-11\; Jones uncorked a jump of 22. On that
jump, Hunter, who had sat stoically, jumped up and clapped. Moments
later Bobby Kersee, her husband and coach, walked by and in a
gesture quick and subtle, stuck out his hand to Hunter. They shook
hands. Joyner-Kersee kept moving. History kept moving. This was a
special day of demarcation, when the weight of being the face,
heart and soul of track and field shifted from Joyner-Kersee to
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of how I did, I wanted to give it my best shot
before I ended my career,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This was special day for 9-year-old Mary Griffith-Joyner, too.
</P>
<P>
   Before today she never saw her aunt Jackie compete in person.
``It was always on tape or on television,'' Al Joyner said. ``All
her classmates would write book reports about Jackie, but I wanted
her to see her perform. I wanted her to see this. She saw her aunt
dig down deep just to make it to the second round.''
</P>
<P>
   I wondered how Joyner felt as he watched his sister compete for
the last time with his daughter at the first major race he attended
since his wife died. He wore a shirt she had made, with her world
record printed on the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tough,'' Joyner said. ``I've been growing, maturing.
But it's been tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon his daughter _ their daughter _ saw the
remarkable tide of history. Her aunt was the tide going out, Marion
Jones, the tide coming in.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Flo-Jo, is like the omnipresent ocean. When
historians talk about the 100 meters, they talk about her mother,
who has the fastest time ever run and four of the five fastest
times ever run. When historians talk about the 200 meters, they
talk about her mother, who owns three of the top five times. And
when historians talk about great female athletes, they talk about
her aunt Jackie.
</P>
<P>
   Marion Jones was 9 when Jackie Joyner-Kersee won her first
Olympic gold medal. That's the distinguishing virtue of this sport.
Dawn after dawn after dawn.
</P>
<P>
   No sunsets.
</P>
<P>
   Just dawns. &QL;

AETNA'S PLAN TO SELL UNITS TO ING SAID TO HIT SNAGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURA M. HOLSON and MARY WILLIAMS WALSH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aetna Corp., which has been in talks to sell its financial and
international units to ING Groep, the Dutch financial services
company, has yet to resolve key issues in the deal, people close to
the talks said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Aetna's board tentatively endorsed the transaction,
which is likely to exceed $7 billion, including debt, according to
several people close to the companies. But Aetna and ING executives
still have to resolve issues related to Aetna's domestic business,
particularly how Aetna can avoid paying a huge tax bill as a result
of the sale to ING.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies had originally planned to announce Monday that a
deal had been struck. But if they can come to terms in the coming
days, the people said, the sale could be announced by the middle of
the week.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna executives initially thought they could get a better price
by auctioning off the businesses in pieces instead of selling them
as a whole. But it found few takers and was worried about a huge
tax bite.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna began talks with ING several months ago, but those
discussions stalled over price. The financial services unit
includes the annuity and asset management business, while the
international unit is made up of businesses that include life
insurance and health care, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of both Aetna and ING would not comment on the
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Lane, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said that for
Aetna shareholders pondering the talks between Aetna and ING, the
central question was not the ``minutiae'' of credit ratings and tax
planning, but the underlying value of Aetna's health-care unit. If
the sale goes forward, he said, current Aetna shareholders would
most likely be left with shares in a new company that is made up of
Aetna U.S. Healthcare and some cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the math that people should be thinking about, and
there's no visibility on it,'' Lane said. ``The management team has
not been willing to comment on the outlook for earnings in the U.S.
Healthcare segment. They haven't given a definitive earnings
outlook for two and almost three quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   One scenario that has been described is Aetna spinning off its
health-care unit to shareholders before it completes the sale with
ING. If Aetna and ING did that, Lane said, it would be a much more
shareholder-friendly deal because the tax bill would be lower.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna has been under pressure from shareholders to sell assets
and improve its health-care operations, thus lifting its stock
price. The company has sold seven of its international units and
ventures over the last 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   Lane said that Aetna's operations were so diverse that it was
hard to find synergies among them.

 IMMIGRANTS FALL PREY TO CON ARTISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS HEDGES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ When Erik Giovanni Rosales, 28, an illegal
immigrant from Guatemala, was picked up by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service in late 1997 at a factory on Long Island, he
was promptly put into the pipeline to be deported.
</P>
<P>
   Frantic, he searched the Spanish-language papers for help. He
found it in a large advertisement by Stela Sapio, who advertises
herself as an immigration specialist.
</P>
<P>
   According to Rosales' girlfriend, Marlen Jadira Martinez, 26,
and her mother, Rebecca Lima, 47, who were present at the meeting,
Sapio told Rosales that she was an immigration lawyer and would
represent him in his dealings with the INS.
</P>
<P>
   But in the three meetings with INS officials in New York City
that eventually led to Rosales' deportation, Sapio never appeared,
despite having charged $700 up front, Martinez said. Then on the
eve of Rosales' departure late last year, she said, Sapio assured
him that he could get a green card if he paid her $2,400. Rosales
and Martinez had become desperate, and they maxed out her credit
cards and delivered the money in cash.
</P>
<P>
   There are hundreds of con artists who prey on the New York
region's illegal immigrants, whose ignorance of the legal system is
matched only by their desperation, according to law-enforcement
officials. These profiteers, who often pose as lawyers, have been
around for decades, adjusting their schemes as immigration laws
change.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials say that once immigrants are fleeced,
many operators close shop to move on to another part of the city or
up the eastern seaboard to cities with large immigrant populations.
They often make $100,000 to $200,000 a year. The few who have been
caught rarely serve more than a few months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we tell people that the doors are closed, that there is
nothing we can do for them, they often do not want to believe it,''
said Angela Divaris, the lawyer for the Central American Refugee
Center in Hempstead. ``The people who carry out this fraud feed off
of this desperation. They extract what are huge sums from these
immigrants, usually thousands of dollars, and by the time the
victims realize they have been cheated, the offices have shut down
and the fraudulent lawyers have vanished.''
</P>
<P>
   The bogus claims filed by these con artists often keep
immigrants' legitimate claims from being heard. ``People who might
very well have meritorious cases might never have the chance to
present them to the INS, because of the fraudulent preparer's
lies,'' Divaris said.
</P>
<P>
   For all the money that Rosales and Martinez paid to Sapio,
Martinez said, he never received a green card. Late last year the
INS deported him to Guatemala. Martinez filed a consumer complaint
and informed the district attorney's office, but Sapio's
immigration services offices remain open.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who makes $1,200 a month as a housekeeper at the Park
Avenue Extended Care Center in Long Beach, said she is still trying
to pay the debt.
</P>
<P>
   Although Martinez has receipts with Sapio's signature and
canceled checks paid to Sapio and her office totaling $3,460, Sapio
said she never received more than a few hundred dollars to
accompany Rosales to the INS.
</P>
<P>
   ``She ran out of money, and we terminated our services because
she could not pay,'' Sapio said. ``We did nothing illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez tells a different story. ``When we complained, Sapio
told us she would call immigration and get us deported,'' said
Martinez. ``She first tried to threaten me, but I have a green
card. Then she tried to threaten my mother, but she is a citizen.
It did not work with my family, but I know it works with many
others.''
</P>
<P>
   The most common and effective ruse nowadays, according to
advocates for immigrants, is to promise to provide a work permit
for $2,000. The bogus lawyer fills out an application for asylum
even though the client does not meet the criteria. The INS issues a
receipt acknowledging the application. Then the con artist shows
the immigrant the receipt as proof that things are moving along.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are shocked a few months later to get calls to
appear for asylum hearings,'' said Joyce Antila Phipps, the staff
lawyer for El Centro Hispanoamericano, an immigration service
center in Plainfield, N.J. ``They did not know that they had
applied for asylum. Worse still, the story in the asylum
application is usually false. These so-called immigration
practitioners use stock asylum stories. Only the names are changed.
When the cases come up, most of their clients are ordered
deported.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other immigrants are misled because they are not familiar with
immigration law. Salvador Cruz, 31, a Salvadoran who has been in
the United States for 10 years, wanted a green card. So he went to
a man he thought was a lawyer, who had distributed fliers about an
opportunity to get residency after changes in immigration law.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me it was 100 percent certain I would get a card and
charged me $1,300,'' said Cruz. ``I believed him. I brought my four
brothers in to pay the same amount and apply. We were all cheated
out of our money.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigration law is confusing, but especially so to those who do
not speak English. The INS often takes months to publish new
regulations and update application forms.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the 1997 Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American
Relief Act, an amnesty law known among many immigrants as ``la ley
de siete anos'' _ the seven-year law _ is not as straightforward as
it appears.
</P>
<P>
   The law offers amnesty, but the criteria differ depending on
which Central American country the immigrant is from. While all
applicants must have registered with the INS by 1991 to qualify,
Cubans and Nicaraguans who entered the United States illegally to
flee left-wing governments are free from deportation. But
Salvadorans and Guatemalans must prove, for example, that they have
been here at least seven years, are of good moral character and
would suffer extreme hardship if they returned home.
</P>
<P>
   But profiteers and bogus lawyers often assure clients that
living in the country for seven years is enough.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Cardona, an INS spokeswoman in Washington, said that the
agency was concerned about the reports of fraud. ``The INS takes
very seriously the unscrupulous behavior of those who seek to
benefit by exploiting vulnerable immigrants who only seek to abide
by the law,'' she said. ``Going after these criminals is one of the
agency's priorities in our interior enforcement strategy. As long
as this is a widespread problem, the agency will continue to
aggressively pursue these criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   But public interest lawyers such as Phipps and Divaris say that
the INS has done little to crack down on the activity. They concede
that it is in part because of the reluctance of victims to speak to
authorities. But they say it is also because the bogus lawyers
serve a useful function.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot get the INS to take these people seriously,'' Phipps
said. ``After all, they are locating illegal immigrants and putting
them into removal proceedings for the INS.''

ST. JOSEPH RESIDENTS BRISTLE AT HARD WATER AND PROSPECT OF HIGHER
BILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRAHAM  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. JOSEPH, Mo. _ The thirsty in St. Joseph can agree on only
one thing about the drinking water _ it's wet.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, one person's refreshing thirst quencher from the
kitchen faucet is liquid yuck to another.
</P>
<P>
   A water war regarding taste buds and the film that floats on
coffee has raged since the private Missouri-American Water Co.
opened the valves on a new $72 million treatment plant in April.
Complaints prompted the Office of the Public Counsel, the state's
utilities consumer advocate, to ask the Missouri Public Service
Commission to investigate whether the water is drinkable.
</P>
<P>
   This comes as the commission considers Missouri-American's
request for a 51 percent rate increase to pay for $100 million in
capital improvements in Missouri operations, including the St.
Joseph plant.
</P>
<P>
   Those involved in the rate case have until today to file
responses regarding quality, and then the commission will decide
whether to investigate. A decision on the rate increase is expected
in September.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Department of Natural Resources is testing St.
Joseph's water because of complaints, said Bill Hills, an
environmental engineer based in Kansas City. Those results are
incomplete. But after inspecting the treatment plant and drinking
the water from a public fountain, Hills thinks it tastes OK and
will meet all standards.
</P>
<P>
   But some residents disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the water got worse as far as the taste and the
color,'' said Cheryl Licht, 40. ``I'm afraid of what we're
drinking. It tastes like there's a thickness to it, like it's not
pure water. I won't let my kids drink it.''
</P>
<P>
   But down the street in the city's old north side, near North
26th and Folsom streets, a neighbor drinks it heartily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had any problems,'' said Jim Pillsbury, 65. ``The
water's got a different taste. But it doesn't stink and it still
makes good ice cubes. I drink four glasses a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Drink up, says Bob Amman, Missouri-American's manager for
operations in northwest Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The water has been tested and it meets all federal and state
drinking water standards for the company's 32,000 customers, about
100,000 people, in St. Joseph and surrounding rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drink this water every day and I notice no problems with
taste and odor,'' Amman said.
</P>
<P>
   But what has changed, he said, is the ``hardness'' or calcium
content, because the water is being drawn from a new source.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri-American formerly pumped water directly out of the
Missouri River into a treatment plant near the river. Plans at one
time called for a $30 million or $40 million upgrade of that plant
to modernize and keep up with St. Joseph's growth.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1993 flood prompted a change in plans.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than trying to floodproof the old plant,
Missouri-American built a new one on high ground. Also, to avoid
intake problems as water levels vary, aquifers 120 feet below the
riverbed were tapped with a series of wells.
</P>
<P>
   But those aquifers have water that's been trapped for thousands
of years and is much heavier in dissolved minerals such as calcium
than river water, Amman said.
</P>
<P>
   St. Joseph customers in April went from Missouri River water
with 250 to 350 parts per million calcium content to well water
with more than 400 parts per million calcium, he said.
Missouri-American officials expect the calcium level to drop as
older water is pumped out of the aquifer and newer water filters
in. The water should eventually be only slightly harder than
before, Amman said.
</P>
<P>
   But calcium levels in the water haven't dropped as quickly as
expected.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the calcium content in Kansas City's water is
about 150 to 180 parts per million.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 percent of Kansas City's water comes from the Missouri
River, and about 25 percent from wells along the river.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Water Services Department adds softening agents
to help save on soap costs and reduce buildup of calcium deposits
inside pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Amman said St. Joseph's water has always been hard and problems
should diminish as fresh water seeps into wells.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible,'' said Shirley Jones. ``My biggest problem is
my dishes are not getting clean. They're spotted now, and the
dishwasher just doesn't do the job. When you make coffee, there's
kind of scum on top.''
</P>
<P>
   Amman said he, too, has seen the film atop coffee in his cup.
Natural oils in coffee and tea will accumulate around calcium in
heated water.
</P>
<P>
   Those who don't like the water are not as optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like the way it tastes, so we had a Culligan water
softener installed,'' said Carrie Shindorf, 34. ``I think it's
gotten worse, and I've talked to a lot of women who say their
dishes are just not getting clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Ward, 28, spent $4,000 for a complete water treatment
system for his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was oily and made the tea taste bad,'' Ward said,
``and it just tasted different to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The taste doesn't bother Mark White, 28, who recently slaked his
thirst at water fountains in Noyes Elementary School during breaks
from tearing up floor tile.
</P>
<P>
   But he finds an annual increase in customers' bills of $204 to
$309 to pay for the plant offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see anything wrong with the plant they had before,''
White said. ``Now the rate increase just seems outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Amman believes the price increase is the real reason that some
customers are unhappy with the water.
</P>
<P>
   The rate increase could also affect Missouri-American's
Northland customers in the Parkville and Riverside areas. But water
for those areas is treated in Parkville.
</P>
<P>
   The city's water quality dominated a recent rate hearing in St.
Joseph, said John Coffman, deputy public counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been hearing from hundreds of customers who don't
believe the quality is adequate,'' Coffman said.
</P>
<P>
   St. Joseph City Manager Stet Schanze said City Hall has fielded
numerous complaints about the water and forwarded them to city and
county health officials. But St. Joseph officials have been assured
the water is safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal opinion is, I haven't noticed a change in the
water,'' Schanze said. ``We drink out of the tap.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri-American may benefit from a water-quality
investigation, Amman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident they won't find anything but the hardness
issue,'' he said, ``and if people want to pay more, we can do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   But rather than saddling all customers with more expensive
bills, Missouri-American believes individual homeowners can buy
water softeners if they desire, Amman said.
</P>
<P>
   Some customers are happy with the new water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't notice a difference in the smell or the flavor,'' said
Melissa Birdsell, 36.
</P>
<P>
   She sometimes notices a film on drinking glasses. But she has no
trouble getting her dishes clean.
</P>
<P>
   Other neighbors say the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed a little film on the coffee, but nothing to get
upset about,'' said Mike Leach, 42.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Tighe, 35, finds the controversy shallow compared with
water problems in the world's impoverished nations, and she doesn't
mind St. Joseph's new water.
</P>
<P>
   But she does have an in-house dispute among her teen-age
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daniel likes new water better,'' she said, ``but Brooke
doesn't care for the taste.''
</P>

 Farmers and enthusiasts honor machinery of the past  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRAHAM  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BONNER SPRINGS, Mo. _ A smokestack belched black coal smoke as
the tractor's steam-driven flywheels clanged in rhythm, powering an
early 1930s grain thresher fed by men not afraid to work on a
sweltering summer day.
</P>
<P>
   Like Fred Tinbird. At midday on Sunday, the 80-year-old stood
atop a gray, galvanized metal thresher as the machine spouted wheat
grain into a wagon, straw into a heap on the ground and dust
skyward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably the only one out here today who actually ran
one,'' said Tinbird, who learned to operate such machinery by
necessity on a Leavenworth County farm.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his co-workers at the Farm Heritage Days and Steam Show
were self-taught through curiosity. They gathered at the National
Agriculture Hall of Fame to show off restored antique farm
equipment and celebrate what replaced the horse and mule on
America's farms _ man-made power and mechanical ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Reilly, 38, watched as a massive iron tractor shaped like
a small locomotive backed up and then pulled forward with barely a
whisper of escaping steam, its water boilers pressurized and
firebox dampers closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so quiet,'' Reilly said. ``You've got 11 tons moving
along and you can't hardly hear it, yet it mashes the ground down
under the wheels.''
</P>
<P>
   His grandfather's first tractor, a four-cylinder
McCormick-Deering Farmall, was rusting away on his family's
northeast Kansas farm when the restoration bug struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 15 or 16 and my dad told me if I could overhaul it and
get it to running, I could have it,'' Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he lives near Tonganoxie and works as a mechanical
engineer for a company that manufactures airplane parts. But he
fires up Grandpa's old tractor at shows and tinkers with other
early steam and gasoline tractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like the challenge involved,'' Reilly said. ``These
machines only work as well as they're worked on.''
</P>
<P>
   Old tractors have knobs and levers to do what a few buttons and
a steering wheel do on a modern tractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``These machines are based on the skills of the operator,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some farmers were slow to switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandpa's tractor was made in 1930, and he didn't get it until
1947,'' Reilly said. ``He farmed with horses all through the
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The tractors pulled plows, and farmers attached belts to side
wheels to operate machinery such as threshers and saws.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father bought a thresher when I was 8, and when I was 10 I
could belt it and adjust wheels and things,'' Tinbird said. ``I
haven't forgot too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, one person driving a modern combine can cut and thresh
vast wheat fields in a single day while riding in an
air-conditioned cab.
</P>
<P>
   Tinbird remembers when wheat stalks were cut and bound, then
hauled from the fields on a wagon. A July 4 to Aug. 4 threshing
season followed, with men using machines to separate wheat grain
from straw and chaff.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer heat, his mother and neighbor women labored over
wood stoves to cook large meals for threshing crews, usually 13 men
including the water boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know how they did it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaning against a thresher, clad in Big Smith overalls,
long-sleeved blue work shirt and straw hat, he remembers when many
worked long, hard days in sizzling heat and thought little of it.
</P>
<P>
   It's good for people to remember the work that came before,
Tinbird said, and the connection between farmers and food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids come up to us here and ask what we're doing, and I say
threshing wheat,'' he said. ``Then they ask, `What's wheat?'''
</P>
<P>
   America owes a great debt to the farmers and engineers who made
farm production more efficient, Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It freed people to work in other jobs,'' he said, ``and there
was always plenty of cheap food available.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City's past was tied to outlying farms. A large red brick
building in the West Bottoms still bears the visible lettering,
``John Deere Plow Company, farm implements and wagons.''
</P>
<P>
   But few who drive old machinery now, fond as they are of it,
wish to return to the days when men rode bare steel tractor seats
for a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's 100 degrees or minus 20,'' Reilly said, ``I'm glad I
can work inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the young are drawn to the old machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Uhler, 19, drove an old two-cylinder tractor in the
``parade of power'' as her fiance, D.J. McGrath, also 19, rode on
the fender. The Grantville, Kan., youths met at an antique tractor
show and will marry in August.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath, a welder, grew up attending antique equipment shows. He
took his turn operating the old steam tractor on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting to compare what they had then to now,'' he
said. ``There's so many similarities. They were really ahead of
their time.''

MALONE, JOHNSON DESERVE THE BLAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers have more questions than
Regis Philbin.
</P>
<P>
   They have plenty of millionaires, thank you, but they have no
ready answers for any of the queries lying at their cleats. The
middle of July finds them not sinking in the National League West
as much as floating, bobbing on the surface and getting nowhere
fast. They could use a lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   The longest winning streak of the season has been six games, and
that was two months ago. Since June 22, they are 7-13 and have seen
San Francisco zip by them in the division and the Angels take two
of three from them in the first post-All-Star series.
</P>
<P>
   If you really want perspective on the Dodgers' status, align
their record (45-44) alongside those of the financially-deprived
Expos (43-44) and Marlins (46-44). That sound you hear is your head
shaking in amazement.
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult question facing the Dodgers may be ``where
does one start'' fixing things. It may be preferable from a fan's
perspective to start on the field, but Gary Sheffield and friends
have a lot less to do with the situation than one would think.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Malone and Davey Johnson are the fellows who put this team
together after Fox needed only six months to torch 41 years of
tradition and goodwill. As much as one may like reminding the
Foxies of this, it's been two years, more than enough time to chart
a new direction.
</P>
<P>
   The one blazed by the general manager and manager has gotten the
Dodgers nowhere. People inside the franchise know it and sides are
being taken, although a handful are bright enough to distance
themselves from both wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Daly, who casts the biggest shadow as the club's new CEO,
took a side this week when he said Malone's job was safe. It took
Johnson less than two days to start a campaign for his own job by
intimating he's being prepped as the fall guy.
</P>
<P>
   Daly has restored a lot of the team's credibility after becoming
a minority owner and being named CEO, but keeping Malone around
would test it. Malone hasn't made a single good move since becoming
G.M. in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Want a list?
</P>
<P>
   1. Publicly said he would deliver Felipe Alou as manager and
didn't, leading the Foxes to select Johnson even though he wasn't
Malone's second choice.
</P>
<P>
   2. Signed Devon White to a three-year contract even though the
outfielder would be 36 in 1999. White hit .268 last season and has
been injured most of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   3. Signed a 35-year-old pitcher, Kevin Brown, to a seven-year,
$105 million deal. Not only did it break the previous free agent
ceiling, but it was $15 million more than the next best deal on the
table. Brown's a stud, but for how long?
</P>
<P>
   4. Traded a Gold Glove catcher, Charles Johnson (.303, 20 homers
in 2000) to the Mets for a catcher, Todd Hundley, coming off elbow
surgery. Hundley hit .207 last year, and while he's hitting .316
with 17 home runs in 2000, he's been ailing the last two months and
has thrown out only 7 of 49 base stealers.
</P>
<P>
   5. Signed Carlos Perez, who had shoulder surgery in 1996 and one
winning season in his career, to a $15 million, three-year
contract.
</P>
<P>
   6. Traded Dave Mlicki and Mel Rojas to Detroit for Robinson
Checo in a financially-motivated deal.
</P>
<P>
   7. Traded Raul Mondesi for Shawn Green in a deal suggested and
bartered by the agent for both players. Mondy's having a fine year
on a team (Toronto) in playoff contention. Green has played well
but he hasn't magically changed the standings.
</P>
<P>
   8. Traded a starting pitcher, Ismael Valdes, and the team's
second baseman and leadoff hitter, Eric Young, for a setup man,
Terry Adams, in another financially motivated trade.
</P>
<P>
   In summation, he's been used by two agents, traded two starting
pitchers, signed two free agents in their late 30s to multiyear
deals, and retained and obtained two players with medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   It's just my opinion, but I don't keep Malone around waiting for
the ninth wonder of his world. The aggregate of all of these deals
has backed the team in a corner.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the eight highest paid players on the team were
obtained or signed under Malone's watch, the only exception being
Sheffield, who renegotiated his deal after he was obtained in the
Mike Piazza deal. The only player on this list who was part of the
team at the start of the 1998 season is Eric Karros.
</P>
<P>
   The aggregate payroll of Brown, Sheffield, Green and Karros is
$45 million a year, and the years on their contracts make them
untradeable. Hundley, Shaw, Perez and White make another $20
million per year, and their age or ailments make them untradeable.
</P>
<P>
   This is why young players like Darren Dreifort and Adrian Beltre
are the only ones ever mentioned in trade talks, because they're
the only players other teams want or can afford.
</P>
<P>
   It's also why four rookies are on the roster (Eric Gagne, Alex
Cora, Matt Herges, Paul LoDuca), and why four non-roster players
(Mike Fetters, Chad Kreuter, Kevin Elster, Geronimo Berroa) made
the team, and why journeymen like F.P. Santangelo, Jim Leyritz and
Gregg Olson are still employed. The bottom of the Dodgers roster
hasn't looked this bad since the years between the Koufax-Drysdale
and the Lopes-Garvey-Cey eras.
</P>
<P>
   All this shouldn't be viewed as tacit support for Johnson. The
manager certainly deserves some consideration for being dealt a bad
hand, and his visit to a hospital Sunday to check out an irregular
heartbeat is surely job-related.
</P>
<P>
   But he hasn't lived up to his reputation as a can-do manager. He
played his own role in Raul Mondesi's departure, supported the
Hundley trade because he was desperate for a left-handed hitter,
vexed a few pitchers on the team with some of his decisions, and
didn't make Orel Hershiser feel at home in his bid to keep pitching
at 41.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers say they want to be a player in the Alex Rodriguez
sweepstakes, but is there room for another $15 million-plus salary
at the top of roster on a team that's already out balance? Plus, do
they really need another middle-of-the-order hitter?
</P>
<P>
   Worse, what if Rodriguez announces he doesn't want to play for
the Dodgers because he's not sure the team can win? Now there's a
$64,000 question I don't want answered.

<P>
   SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y. _ The road leading into the Shinnecock Indian
reservation is not a welcoming one: The sign marking the way reads,
``Trespassers will be arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   Some uninvited people _ drug dealers and government workers _
have been reportedly fired upon after crossing onto tribal lands.
Tourists are simply asked to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians are an insular lot. The world outside their 800-acre
reservation here on the Shinnecock Peninsula knows little about
them, and for 350 years, that's the way they have preferred it.
Their dealings with society, they say, have never been good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems every time we've dealt with the white man, we've come
out the worse for it,'' said Harriet Gumbs, a 79-year-old elder and
a tribal historian.
</P>
<P>
   The reservation is a postage stamp of marshland swamped by
poverty and unemployment. For years, the Indians watched as land
that was once theirs was transformed into housing subdivisions.
Although they complained, there were few sympathetic ears at the
local courthouse and Town Hall. After all, they had signed treaties
and land-swap agreements, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They built on our ancestors' bones, and we never really did
anything to stop it,'' said Elizabeth Haile, 69, a member of the
Thunderbird clan who watched over the years as houses and other
buildings sprouted up around the reservation. ``That's changing
with the young people.''
</P>
<P>
   East End power brokers on Long Island have taken notice as this
new breed of Shinnecock have lain in front of bulldozers, marched
on Town Hall and protested on the steps of the state Capitol in
Albany to stop the development of 62 acres of virgin woodland to
the north of the Montauk Highway, the road that separates the
reservation from the rest of Southampton. The news of the protests
has spread from Indian-run radio in Canada to the editorial pages
of The News From Indian Country, a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The young Shinnecock have been radicalized by the success of
tribes that were once destitute, like the Oneida Indians. The
Oneida reservation was once a tumble-down 32 acres in upstate New
York, but the tribe now owns the state's largest casino and has a
land claim wending its way through federal court asking for the
return of 250,000 acres between Syracuse and Utica.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the young group of Shinnecock are talking
aggressively about claiming 3,600 acres of prime Southampton real
estate that includes three golf courses _ among them the renowned
Shinnecock Hills, site of the U.S. Open in 2004 _ and Southampton
College of Long Island University.
</P>
<P>
   It is land that once belonged to the Shinnecock. It is land they
want back. The tribe filed a petition with the federal government
three years ago seeking recognition and has since raised the
specter of casinos on the East End.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my people are scared about what we're doing,'' said
Becky Genia, 43, who left the reservation as a teen-ager in the
mid-1970s and learned the politics of protest with the American
Indian Movement. ``We're surrounded by very rich people. The folks
on the res think that raising Cain about broken promises and
miserable living conditions means they're going to take what little
land we got left. I got news: they aren't going to touch another
acre of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Developers say that they hold a title to the disputed 62 acres
that dates back more than a century, and their claim to the
property is built on firm legal ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``The homes are being built as we speak,'' said John Bennet, a
lawyer for the developers, Parrish Pond Associates. ``The Indians'
lawsuit was thrown out of court.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians have stopped short of laying formal claim to the 62
acres, but say the wooded site is a small but sacred portion of
their heritage that should be preserved.
</P>
<P>
   The Shinnecock are a state-recognized tribe, but one of more
than 100 Indian tribes not acknowledged by the federal government.
They have no access to federal education and health money and run
no gambling operations. More important, they receive no legal
assistance from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, so their land claims
hang in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   According to records, in the early 18th century, the town of
Southampton paid the tribe $20 for its land and gave it a
1,000-year lease on the 3,600 acres. In 1859, town officials
convinced the state legislature that the Shinnecock were willing to
break that lease to allow the Long Island Rail Road to go through
in exchange for outright title to the current reservation on
Shinnecock Neck.
</P>
<P>
   John Strong, a professor emeritus of history at Southampton
College, said he believes the Shinnecock were pressured into the
deal and that the signatures on the document were faked. If a court
should ever rule in the Shinnecock's favor, the tribe would hold
legal title to billions of dollars in property.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new group of Indians have got people's attention,'' said
state Sen. Kenneth LaValle, a Republican who represents the area.
``The buzzword is casino. Right now, the Indians don't have a
friend in the world, but if they get the feds on board, imagine the
fight. The Hamptons are the playground of the powerful. You think
they'll stand for rabble coming out from the city to play cards,
get drunk and urinate on their hedgerows?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   New homes are being built on the reservation by retirees who,
after living in black society in cities like Washington and Los
Angeles, have returned to the reservation, where they pay no
property taxes. The income disparity on the reservation has
widened. The main employers are the smoke shops and hot dog stands
that line the highway and serve the weekend tourists. The tribal
schoolhouse has been closed and Indian children attend public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Shinnecock, for the most part, take a hostile view of
politics, whether they are federal, state, town or tribal. But it
is especially the tribal politics that tie the community in knots.
Without a coherent voice of resistance for the tribe, the
bulldozers continue to clear trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those old dogs, they're in it for themselves,'' said Ruben
Bess Valdez, 45, a university-trained environmentalist, speaking of
the tribal trustees. He said the leaders have in the past made
land-use and right-of-way deals with the state, kept the money for
themselves and kept the tribe in the dark. ``If you're in it for
yourself, how can you fight for anyone else?''
</P>
<P>
   With little money for court battles, the tribe remains divided
over the more aggressive tactics. On one side are the tribal
trustees who hold nearly all the decision-making power in the lives
of the 500 people on the reservation. On the other side are the
brash group of college- and street-educated Indians who want a
settlement now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need changes now,'' said Chuck Quinn, who has been arrested
for sitting on the 18th green at Shinnecock Hills in protest. ``No
more selling us out, no more backdoor deals with the whites.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Indians await word of their application for federal
recognition. Such status would give the tribe the right to
negotiate gambling deals with the state. The application process
can take years, experts say, and the tribal trustees have yet to
respond to a 1998 letter from the Bureau of Indian Affairs
requesting more application materials.
</P>
<P>
   Federal recognition would also mean that the tribe would have to
draft a new constitution and set up a new government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of the matter is that we need to come together on
the reservation before we can make our demands to the general
public,'' said Harold Dent, a Shinnecock and an adviser to the
tribal trustees. ``I am trying to make this point to the trustees.
But people running around shouting willy-nilly isn't going to help
our situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The reservation is a world apart from the rest of the Hamptons.
Cancer rates among the Shinnecock are among the highest on Long
Island. In a town where a pool-side bungalow rents for $30,000 for
the summer, the median per capita income on the reservation hovers
around $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   The reservation, in addition, has yet to be hooked up to the
Suffolk County water supply. The Indians drink from an aquifer that
is contaminated with the pesticide Temik at levels seven times the
amount considered safe for human consumption, according to the
county health department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water authority simply won't run them pipes,'' said the
Southampton town supervisor, Vincent Cannuscio. ``Somebody has to
pay for it. And it's going to have to be the Shinnecock.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians also cannot get home-improvement loans because the
land is held in common and they have no mortgages. What is more, no
Indian holds any meaningful elected or appointed town position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their situation is the dirty little secret of Southampton,''
said Bob Zellner, a civil rights activist and adjunct professor of
history at Southampton College.

INTERNET &HT;    BC-SALESTAX-AZR(a) 
 &HT;    INTERNET SALES TAX EYED AGAIN(a) 
 &HT;    By KERRY FEHR-SNYDER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With proposals on the Nov. 7 ballot to eliminate Arizona's
personal income tax and rely even more on sales taxes for
education, politicians and others are eyeing electronic commerce to
pick up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes on Internet sales in Arizona alone could eventually top
half a billion dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gov. Jane Hull told reporters, ``I believe that after
the election, there will be serious discussions about the Internet
- sales on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull didn't say whether she supports or opposes such a tax, only
that it's time to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   But others are clearer about their position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of a fairness issue than a tax issue to me,'' said
Jeff Hatch-Miller, R-east Phoenix, who headed a state Internet
Study Committee that considered an Internet sales tax, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a study committee, we couldn't find any justification for a
tax on shoes by one type of seller but not another,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current tax code, consumers can avoid paying sales
taxes on items they buy online provided the seller doesn't have a
presence, or nexus, in the state.
</P>
<P>
   For example, book purchases from Amazon.com are not taxed
because the company doesn't operate a brick-and-mortar store in
this state. But purchases from Barnes &AMP; Noble are taxed, because it
operates stores in Arizona, giving it nexus in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The different tax treatments grew out of the catalog business,
which argued successfully before the U.S. Supreme Court that it
should not be responsible for tracking the 7,500 individual taxing
jurisdictions just so it could sell products by phone or mail. The
argument didn't hold for sales from companies operating both
catalogs and brick-and-mortar stores, because those retailers
already track the tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Internet is simply another form of remote selling, the
tax exemption for catalogers was extended to e-commerce
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   And it's quickly become popular with consumers. A recent survey
found that 57percent of online shoppers decide to make purchases
over the Internet, in part, because they often don't have to pay
sales tax. The survey of 1,656 Web users by Internet researcher PC
Data Online also found that eight of 10 respondents said online
purchases should be tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   Many tech companies agree, arguing that taxes on all online
sales would discourage the growth of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the Internet Taxation Freedom Act in 1998, which
imposed a three-year moratorium that prevents states from putting a
new tax on Internet access or discriminating in the way they tax
online purchases. Some in Congress want to make permanent the
prohibition on new and discriminatory taxes. Others believe all
bets are off when the moratorium expires Oct. 21, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   For now, all 45 states that have a sales tax are collecting what
limited taxes are allowed on sales of merchandise over the
Internet, according to the national Federation of Tax
Administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of Internet taxes maintain that the tax-free approach
is outdated in the New Economy, which can more easily track all the
varied taxing jurisdictions due to the widespread use of
computerized data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, that argument has lost its validity,'' said Marshall
Vest, director of economic and business research at the Eller
College of Business and Public Administration at the University of
Arizona. ``There are third-party venders that can process these
orders in a blink of an eye, so is it still an unfair burden on
these companies?''
</P>
<P>
   Vest said online retailers currently enjoy a price advantage
over mainstream brick-and-mortar companies. Taxing e-commerce
``certainly is a fairness issue,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   More than fairness, is the issue of dollars and cents to local
governments that are relying more heavily than ever on sales tax
revenues to pay for goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, an initiative to raise more money for Arizona schools
hinges entirely on hiking the state sales tax rate from 5 percent
to 5.6percent. The Nov. 7 ballot initiative is expected to generate
about $450 million a year in tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   But the initiative could be unnecessary, some argue, if goods
sold over the Internet were taxed.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the loss in tax revenue could hit $10.8 billion in
2003, according to a February study by the University of Texas. How
much the loss would be to each state is difficult to determine.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Department of Revenue does not track sales tax
revenue from items sold by e-commerce retailers with a presence in
the state. It also could not provide an estimate of how much
potential tax revenue is being lost because of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Vest estimates the potential number for Arizona could, in about
five years, be as much as $400 million to $600 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   But Dennis Hoffman, dean of Arizona State University's masters
of business administration program, warned against overestimating
lost revenue because the bulk of e-commerce is from non-taxable
transactions, such as the sale of stock, airline tickets and
business-to-business goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an issue that's resulting in massive losses to the
general fund,'' he said. ``The mistake is taking the big number of
Internet sales and multiplying it by 5 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hoffman, who consults on tax issues for the state, allowed
that the situation could change as more people buy big-ticket
taxable goods online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe we need to monitor it,'' he said. ``If more and
more people start going online to order items like furniture, that
would have a real sales-tax (revenue) impact.''

ANALYSIS: FRONT-RUNNER BUSH KEEPING TO A CONSERVATIVE CAMPAIGN
STYLE
</HEADLINE>
  (CORRECTS ``inner city'' to ``poor'' in 22nd graf) 
By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Out on the campaign trail, Gov. George W. Bush
appears to be barely breaking a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Town hall meetings where large audiences are free to ask
questions vanished months ago when Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the
master of spontaneity, disappeared from the presidential race. Now
audiences rarely get to ask Bush anything.
</P>
<P>
   On many days he makes no more than one or two public
appearances, and occasionally they last no more than 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's signature campaign events are small panel
discussions that more resemble seminars on social services.
Ostensibly the sessions are about new policy proposals. But Bush's
aides say they are just as much about mood, emotion and image. As
panelists tell Bush how they have overcome hardship, he responds
with emotive language, words and phrases like ``love'' or ``loving
family'' or ``willing heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The style and schedule that Bush is keeping is deliberate,
reflecting the campaign's strategic confidence that he can mold the
image he wants by creating carefully choreographed television
images in battleground states. In an era in which voters are more
and more turned off by partisanship, the events make him seem to be
governing rather than campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost as if he's running on the Rose Garden strategy,
only with the Rose Garden situated not at the White House but in a
handful of swing states across the country.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that Bush is not working hard. His days are
filled with fund-raisers, policy meetings and interviews with the
news media. He is putting the last touches on his convention
speech, and is in the final phase of choosing a running mate.
Still, Bush's style these days could not be more different from
that of his opponent, Vice President Al Gore, who is generally
running behind in the polls and has longer, more event-packed
campaign days. Gore takes question after question from larger
audiences, showing off a detailed knowledge of everything from
immigration law to the history of the Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   But while the presidential race is only now moving into the
critical convention period, Bush and his aides believe his method
of campaigning has produced good results and put him ahead in many
critical states and made him competitive in states that the
Democrats had counted on winning.
</P>
<P>
   At Bush headquarters in Austin, Texas, the governor's staff
monitors an array of polls and keeps a blue and red color-coded
electoral map that shows which way each state is leaning. Bush's
aides right now have a panorama showing Bush leading in states with
345 electoral college votes, Gore leading in states with 92
electoral votes and 101 votes up for grabs. A candidate needs 270
votes to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is I'm leading some of the polls,'' Bush told
state Republican officials gathered in Austin last week. ``The bad
news is the election isn't tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   So confident are the Republicans that after running about $5
million in ads promoting Bush's Social Security proposals, they sat
back and let the Democrats spend about $14 million on commercials
in key states promoting Gore and Democratic issues, without
responding. ``The race stayed the same,'' said one Bush adviser.
The GOP is now readying a new ad campaign to lead into the
Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides attribute the state of the presidential race partly
to a series of missteps by Gore over a rocky spring. But they also
point to Bush's turn to a policy-oriented campaign style right
after the Republican primaries ended, when he needed to erase the
bitterness of his fight with McCain and soften the hard
conservative edges he had created for himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor says he knew from the start that he wanted to
campaign in this softer style, much as he did in his first
governor's race in Texas in 1994. At that time he stuck to four
issues with relentless repetition: juvenile crime, welfare
overhaul, education and an overhaul of the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candidates tend to repeat the successes of the past,'' Bush
said. ``I found that ideas do drive campaigns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is still using the same phrases that he did more than a
year ago, that he is a ``compassionate conservative,'' that he
wants to fight the ``soft bigotry of low expectations'' for
minority students in public schools, that he wants to rally ``the
armies of compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he does not get bored by the repetition. ``I view it as
an opportunity,'' he says. ``What a good candidate has to
understand is every minute is an opportunity to convey a message.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has used policy proposals to give himself and his themes
more definition, showing how he is a traditional Republican and how
he is not.
</P>
<P>
   The groundwork for the policy offensive was set more than a year
ago when Bush named three senior advisers: Lawrence Lindsey for
economic policy, Stephen Goldsmith for domestic policy and
Condoleezza Rice for international affairs. He also assembled a
large think tank inside his campaign under the leadership of Josh
Bolten, who had worked in the administration of Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   But the final plan for a spring of policy proposals leading into
the convention was put together by campaign staff at a country club
retreat just as the Republican primaries were coming to a close in
early March.
</P>
<P>
   The first speeches on education and health care and the
environment put Bush squarely on Democratic turf with reading
programs for poor and tax credits to help people who lack health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Then came broad proposals to reshape Social Security and rethink
nuclear policy. They skipped all of the devilish details. But
Bush's aides say they showed voters that Bush was willing to take
risks and challenge the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Bush seems to be unveiling policies for every line item
of the federal budget _ an additional $75 million across five years
for veterans mentoring, or $400 million for after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem small, but aides say that Bush is using these ideas
to shape his own image. In an election year in which no issue is
dominating, a Bush adviser said, ``Issues are important but they
are important as reflections of broader values and keys into a
candidate's leadership.'' He said, ``The independent swing voters
are not taking their stands on individual issues but their feelings
about what values the candidate reflects.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And the campaign is making strategic decisions about where and
how often to appear to talk to those swing voters. ``Why not three
or four events in the same media market?'' Bush said on his
campaign plane last week. ``We're trying to have a consistent
message.'' He added, ``There's no need to be stepping on my own
lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally the technique works and in swing state after swing
state, evening news programs usually show Bush surrounded by
winsome minority children or troubled teen-agers or
poor-but-determined single mothers talking of hopes for building a
better life. Only rarely is the script interrupted the way it was
on Friday in New Jersey when a minister challenged Bush about the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamics of the presidential race could well change by the
fall. Gore's aides say that a vice president traditionally does not
come out from under the shadow of the president until his party's
nominating convention. And they argue that the public still favors
Democratic positions on issues, that Gore is better under pressure
and that he will shine when the two candidates meet in debates.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Bush has had the Republican Party solidified behind
him since the Republican primaries ended. His aides say they expect
that Gore will unify his own base and that will cause the race to
tighten after the Democratic National Convention in August. The
governor promised Sunday that he will not lie back and let Gore
criticize his positions and his Texas record. ``I'm a good
counterpuncher,'' he said in an appearance on the ABC program
``This Week.'' ``I am.''

IN POTOSI, SITE OF MISSOURI'S DEATH ROW, EXECUTIONS AREN'T BIG
NEWS

   WITH SIDEBAR SLUGGED EXECUTION-STATS
</P>
<P>
   POTOSI, Mo. _ The flurry of legal activity that put the
execution of convicted murderer Mose Young on hold last week made
headlines from St. Louis to St. Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the news made barely a ripple in the small town
where the state carries out Missouri's executions. No smaller a
ripple, though, than the earlier news that he was scheduled to die.
</P>
<P>
   Capital punishment, it seems, is no longer a life-and-death
issue in Potosi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably controversial,'' said Karen Gomas, a clerk at
the Super 8 Motel in Potosi, a town of about 2,000 people in
southeastern Missouri. ``Executions aren't so talked about. Most
people don't even know about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, 44, on death row since 1984, had been convicted of
fatally shooting three persons in a pawnshop in St. Louis. He was
scheduled to die at 12:01a.m. Wednesday. But about six hours before
the execution, an appeals court judge ruled that his due process
had been violated. Just after midnight, the U.S. Supreme Court
refused the state's request to vacate the stay.
</P>
<P>
   So on Wednesday morning, the sun rose for Mose Young. But it was
just another day in Potosi.
</P>
<P>
   The town's collective uninterest in events a mile outside the
city limits was evident as the clock ticked toward Young's
scheduled death. Residents went about their day waving at one
another from passing cars in the bumper-to-bumper downtown
district, which, with its squat stone and brick buildings, retains
the look of a frontier town.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds of people, many with squawking infants, fanned out across
the parking lot of the local Wal-Mart, shopping carts heaped with
goods. It's a short hop from there for a quick bite to eat at the
Hardee's up the road.
</P>
<P>
   From his office downtown, Washington County Sheriff Ronnie
Skiles echoed the business-as-usual sentiments of others in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time, executions were new to Potosi and new to law
enforcement here,'' Skiles said. ``It's pretty well settled down
now. People are people and, sure, we talk about it, but it's no big
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the country, executions have become a big deal.
Illinois placed a moratorium on its executions earlier this year
after several death-row inmates were cleared of charges against
them, and lawmakers in New Hampshire voted to abolish that state's
death penalty. In Virginia and Texas, new DNA testing was ordered
for a convicted rapist and a murderer _ the latter decision, by
Gov. George W. Bush, thrusting capital punishment into the arena of
presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   Young would have been the third Missouri inmate put to death by
lethal injection this year and the 44th since use of the death
penalty resumed in the state in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Young's execution, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled that St. Louis Circuit Attorney Dee Joyce-Hayes had
violated Young's right to due process. The court said she might
have interfered with testimony from a witness who could have helped
Young avoid the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The court ordered U.S. District Judge Jean Hamilton to
reconsider Young's appeal. Now that the U.S. Supreme Court has
refused to vacate the stay, the execution is postponed.
</P>
<P>
   No other executions have been scheduled this year.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over use of the death penalty has taken on a renewed
vigor in Missouri and throughout the country, with opinions
reflecting deep divisions. A poll commissioned recently by /{The
Kansas City Star/}, for example, found Missourians opposed to a
moratorium on the death penalty, 47 percent to 38 percent, with 15
percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   But in Potosi, the issue generates little emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Don Strauser, a barber at Legendary Cuts, dismissed news about
Young with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never gave the death penalty much thought, but I'm all for
it,'' Strauser said. ``We're used to it. It's not a big thing. If
Young has killed someone, he should get the same.''
</P>
<P>
   About a mile east of town stands the Potosi Correctional Center,
a 140-acre prison complex rising out of a rolling field burned
brown from the sun. Its huddled groups of flat, tan buildings give
it the look of a college campus. Rolled rows of barbed wire and
steel gates, however, remind passers-by just what the buildings are
really for.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 people work at the prison, where about 80 inmates are
on death row and the inmate capacity is about 815. Many of the
employees live in and around Potosi, said Kris Richards, a former
president of the Potosi Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to get the prison here,'' Richards said. ``For the
jobs. It's maximum security. People won't just walk away from
there. We never see them. It makes executions an anonymous thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Richards said that if administrative parking spaces at the
prison were empty on Wednesday morning, he'd know an execution had
taken place.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means that the executives had to stay out late, so
something was going on. When a person is in prison, we don't know
who they are. We're like the rest of the state. If it didn't happen
in your town.''
</P>
<P>
   Employees at Lomax's, a restaurant downtown, have had firsthand
experience with executions: In the past, the restaurant has
prepared the last meals of condemned inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd call about 6 p.m.,'' said waitress Christine DeClue.
``Always something different. Never the same meal twice. No one
talked about it much. Those men did bad things. Doesn't bother us
because of the murders they committed.''
</P>
<P>
   For the pastor and staff at St. James Church, a Catholic church
in Potosi, the subject of executions is at best a delicate issue,
since some parishioners work at the prison.
</P>
<P>
   The pastor of St. James declined to comment on his church's
dealings with the death penalty, but a spokesman for the
archdiocese of St. Louis acknowledged that the situation called for
a ``certain sensitivity,'' given the church's historical opposition
to capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church's teachings on the death penalty and justice are
clear,'' said spokesman Steve Mamanella. ``The pastor and his staff
have to address that in the way they feel is best for their church.
A parish in that situation will have issues of just treatment of
prisoners and victims' rights more at the front of their radar
screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Brewer, the associate pastor at the First Baptist Church of
Potosi, acknowledged that the issue of wrongful convictions had
made executions more complicated but said he didn't see the level
of interest rising much.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it's done because it's publicized,'' Brewer said.
``It's kind of here, but it's a distant thing. There are those who
are for it, some against it and some apathetic. We talk about it;
it's nothing that's hidden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that's just done.''

MISSOURI A LEADER IN CAPITAL PUNISHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MALCOLM GARCIA  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED SIDEBAR TO CAPITAL-PUNISHNENT
</P>
<P>
   Last week's postponement of Mose Young's execution slowed, but
did not stop, Missouri's march to near the top of states with the
highest numbers of executions.
</P>
<P>
   Since it reinstated the death penalty in 1989, Missouri has
executed 43 inmates by lethal injection _ fourth among states using
capital punishment, according to figures from the Death Penalty
Information Center as of Thursday. Texas leads the nation with 224
executions since it reinstated the death penalty in 1982; Virginia,
which also reinstated capital punishment in 1982, is a distant
second with 77. Florida is third with 48; it reinstated the death
penalty in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri executed one inmate in 1989, four in 1990 and one each
in 1991 and 1992. In 1993, the state executed four inmates. After a
one-year break with no executions in 1994, six inmates were put to
death in each of the next three years. That slowed to three in
1998, then jumped again to nine last year. This year, two inmates
have been executed.

NEXT MONTH'S PRIMARIES HERALD A LIVELY ELECTION YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIT WAGAR  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The summer calm cloaking the political
landscape will soon be shattered as candidates in both Missouri and
Kansas gear up for primary elections early next month.
</P>
<P>
   The primary campaigns kick off one of the most hotly contested
election years in Missouri history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Missouri is a battleground state,'' said Roy Temple, executive
director of the state Democratic Party. ``It has close races for
president, Senate and governor; competitive congressional races;
and the legislative chambers are in play. It's the grand slam and
the Triple Crown of elections.''
</P>
<P>
   From president and governor to treasurer and secretary of state,
even low-profile statewide races are shaping up as potential fights
for every vote. Many of the races carry national implications.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of congressional races in Missouri's 6th District
and Kansas' 3rd District could help determine whether Democrats
regain control of the U.S. House. A Democratic victory in
Missouri's U.S. Senate race would weaken Republican control of that
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   And Missouri's reputation as a presidential bellwether has both
major parties looking to the state as a key to winning the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   This year, even races for the General Assembly resonate in
Washington. That is because lawmakers elected this year will draw
new legislative and congressional districts based on the 2000
census. And Missouri Republicans see this year as their best chance
in decades to take control of the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats hold only an 18-16 majority in the Senate and an 87-76
advantage in the House.
</P>
<P>
   In the marquee races for U.S. Senate and governor, the Aug. 8
primaries appear to be mere formalities. The Senate race will pit
incumbent Republican Sen. John Ashcroft against Democratic Gov. Mel
Carnahan.
</P>
<P>
   For governor, the Republicans have all but nominated U.S. Rep.
Jim Talent of St. Louis County, and the Democrats have all but
anointed state Treasurer Bob Holden of Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   But the race for lieutenant governor features hard-fought races
in both major parties. On the Democratic side, state Sen. Joe
Maxwell of Mexico is running against state Rep. Gracia Backer of
New Bloomfield. Both are respected within the party and have raised
hundreds of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The race has been quiet so far as both have concentrated on
building organizations and meeting with local groups. That doesn't
surprise Temple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, the primary is hand-to-hand combat among party
insiders,'' he said, ``until the last two or three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, St. Charles County Executive Joe
Ortwerth is running against former state Treasurer Wendell Bailey.
Through the end of March, neither had raised more than $100,000.
State Sen. Bill Kenney of Lee's Summit had been expected to win the
Republican nomination, but he dropped out of the race in May.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Steve Gaw of Moberly is the favorite among
Democrats running for secretary of state. State Rep. Matt Blunt of
Springfield has emerged as the favorite among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In the treasurer's race, Platte County prosecutor Todd Graves
appears to have the inside track on the Republican side. Democrats
have a three-way race between state Reps. Brian May of St. Louis
and Scott Lakin of Kansas City and former Rep. Nancy Farmer of St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The surplus of high-quality candidates stems at least partly
from term limits, which begin to affect most lawmakers in 2002.
Many are trying to continue their political careers by seeking
higher office. That, in turn, opens up their current seats to new
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock, executive director of the Missouri Republican
Party, described the situation as a sinkhole. When Talent ran for
governor, five Republicans and a Democrat filed for his seat in
Congress. They included state Sen. Franc Flotron of St. Louis
County. Two state representatives then filed for Flotron's Senate
seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Term limits are a looming ax on the horizon,'' Hancock said.
``Any open seat creates a ripple effect. Big primary fields for an
attractive seat are going to become the norm.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, which holds its primary Aug. 1, the featured races
involve the 3rd Congressional District and the seat on the Kansas
Board of Education now held by Linda Holloway.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway was chairwoman of the Kansas board when it decided last
year to de-emphasize certain aspects of evolution in the state's
science curriculum standards. The decision touched off protests
across the country by science teachers who said it represented
religious intrusion into science education.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway is being challenged by Sue Gamble, a member of the
Shawnee Mission school board. The winner will face Ron Patton, a
Democrat, in November.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional races for Kansas' 3rd District and Missouri's
6th District are attracting national attention. Both parties see
them as crucial to winning control of the chamber, where
Republicans hold a 222-211 majority.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Moore, a former Johnson County district attorney, was the
first Democrat elected from the 3rd District in nearly 40 years
when he defeated a Republican incumbent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Moore benefited from a split between conservatives and moderates
in the Kansas Republican Party. The district includes Johnson,
Wyandotte and Miami counties and most of Douglas County.
</P>
<P>
   Three Republicans _ Overland Park Councilman Greg Musil, state
Rep. Phill Kline and Olathe physician Gary Morsch _ are seeking the
Republican nomination to challenge Moore in November. They span the
ideological spectrum within the Kansas GOP. Each Republican claims
to be the only candidate who can beat Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's 6th District was considered a safe Democratic seat
until Rep. Pat Danner suddenly withdrew in May. Four Democrats,
four Republicans and a Libertarian are seeking the seat.
</P>
<P>
   The district covers 27 counties in northwest Missouri, including
Kansas City, North, from the Missouri River to the Iowa state line.
</P>
<P>
   John Petrocik, chairman of the political science department at
the University of Missouri-Columbia, said the two races are likely
to attract significant resources from national parties.
</P>
<P>
   Because 95 percent of incumbents are re-elected, only about 20
congressional races are truly competitive in a given election, he
said. So the parties focus on open seats, such as Missouri's 6th
District, and officeholders who don't seem to fit their districts,
such as a Democrat representing Kansas' heavily Republican 3rd
District.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever comes out of the primary will attract national money
and will have help from pollsters, managers and other major figures
from the national party,'' Petrocik said. ``They typically will
have their campaign steered toward fund-raisers and campaign aides
from inside the Beltway.''
</P>
<P>
   Petrocik said the winning presidential candidate is likely to
have coattails long enough for his party to control the House.

 &HT;    TENSIONS INCREASE AS MIDEAST PEACE TALKS CONTINUE
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ President Clinton said Sunday that he was
``slogging'' through the sixth day of Mideast peace talks, and he
called the negotiations ``the hardest thing I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from Camp David by telephone with a reporter from the
New York Daily News, Clinton cited ``some progress'' in the peace
summit he's hosting between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more optimistic than I was when they got here,'' last
Tuesday, said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He stressed the difficulties over the gains, though, and
emphasized that the outcome remains in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be totally misleading if I said I had an inkling that
a deal is at hand,'' Clinton said. ``That's just not true. But
we're slogging.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has struggled through seven years of on-again
off-again Mideast peace efforts to cast a hopeful light on the
process, declined to predict success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might make it, I don't know,'' Clinton said. ``God, it's
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks were the first in which he has characterized
the Camp David negotiations since he opened the talks July 11. The
White House press office released a transcript of the comments late
Sunday to reporters staking out the peace summit from this mountain
hamlet five miles from the presidential retreat.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Clinton compared the talks with other peace
initiatives he's overseen concerning conflicts in Northern Ireland,
Bosnia and even earlier phases of peace talks between Palestinians
and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Camp David summit, an effort to resolve the toughest
issues at the core of 52 years of bloody conflict between Israelis
and Palestinians, is the greatest diplomatic challenge of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like nothing I've ever dealt with,'' he said. ``All the
negotiations with the Irish, all the stuff I've done with the
Palestinians before this and with the Israelis, the Balkans at
Dayton. What's really troubling is that (Arafat and Barak) know if
they make a peace agreement half of their constituencies will have
to be angry at them for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also left open the question of whether he would leave on
schedule Wednesday for a trip to Japan. That journey, to attend the
annual summit of leaders from the so-called Group of Eight
democratic powers, has provided a de facto deadline for the ongoing
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would leave as planned, though, Clinton was
noncommittal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope so; I'm gonna do my best to finish here,'' he said.
``There's been some progress, but I can't say I know we'll
succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Clinton, ``It's really hard. It's the hardest thing I've
ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met into the night with Arafat, and White House
spokesman P.J. Crowley told reporters that the president planned to
spend the night again at Camp David and get back to the negotiating
table on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a reminder of the issues and passions at stake, more than
100,000 Israeli demonstrators rallied in Tel Aviv Sunday to protest
Barak's approach to the peace process. There were scattered
demonstrations in Palestinian-controlled territory as well by Arabs
fearing that Arafat might concede too much in an effort to strike a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   And in Washington, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
warned that the Republican-led Congress would not give Clinton a
blank check to pay for pledges he might make to secure a Mideast
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to be open to look at whatever they come up
with,'' Lott said during an interview on Fox News Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Lott, ``there are some items that they would ask for
that clearly I don't think the Senate would be inclined to go along
with. For instance, paying for Palestinian resettlement would be of
some concern to Senators.''
</P>
<P>
   While no hard numbers have been discussed, Clinton and his
national security aides have advised Lott and other Congressional
leaders of the likelihood that any Camp David peace agreement would
require substantial U.S. military and economic aid.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have generally agreed that something in excess of $15
billion, over some
</P>
<P>
   period of time, would be expected from the United States _ along
with at least that much
</P>
<P>
   from the oil-rich states near the Persian Gulf, as well as U.S.
allies in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want Middle East peace,'' Lott said. ``But we'd better be
very careful with how those dollars are used.''
</P>
<P>
   After attending church services at Camp David's Evergreen Chapel
with his daughter, Chelsea, Clinton spent much of Sunday afternoon
huddling with senior Israeli and Palestinian negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat are focused on the most difficult areas of
dispute between them, including the question of Palestinian
statehood, territory and security, the future of Jerusalem, Jewish
settlers and the issue of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Both face strident political opposition at home from quarters
that fear the concessions their side would be asked to make in
order to reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the difficulties Barak could face selling a peace
accord back home, more than 100,000 Israelis gathered Sunday in Tel
Aviv to protest what many expect will be Israeli concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Centered in Rabin Square, the large plaza where former Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was killed in 1995 by an opponent of
the peace process, the rally was primarily organized by Jewish
settlers from the occupied areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Israel captured the territories in the 1967 Israeli-Arab war and
has been handing over land there to Palestinians bit-by-bit under
the terms of the 1993 Oslo Accords. As many as 40,000 settlers may
have to move if Barak yields more land at Camp David, as is widely
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to influence him to change his plans,'' said
Haya Ledaber, a 26-year-old resident of the Bet El settlement in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Like other demonstrators, Ledaber fears Barak might go too far
in his efforts to grant Arafat the territory he is demanding to
build the foundations of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole country will be given away to the Arabs,'' Ledaber
said. ``The settlements will be left under the Arabs without the
protection of the army and the Jews will be pushed into the
ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak has vowed to put any peace accord directly to the Israeli
people in a public referendum, should he strike a deal with Arafat
at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 210,000 settlers in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, areas populated by more than 2. 5 million Palestinians. The
Israelis were encouraged to move there by the government in order
to stake a claim to the land. Barak vows not to move more than
50,000, though even that could face stiff resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday in the West Bank, Israeli police forced about 30 young
settlers to give up a new hilltop they had staked out without
government permission.

GORE AND BUSH GIVE VOTERS A SIDE-BY-SIDE COMPARISON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 3rd graf from end with two grafs on background of executions
in Texas)   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush have
yet to meet face-to-face in a debate, but Sunday they gave voters a
chance for the first time to make a side-by-side comparison as the
two sat for hourlong interviews on network television.
</P>
<P>
   Gore faced aggressive questioning from Tim Russert of NBC's
``Meet the Press'' on his record and past statements, while Bush
was asked questions of a more political nature by Sam Donaldson and
Cokie Roberts on ABC's ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither candidate revealed anything about his vice-presidential
selection process. Bush said that while retired Gen. Colin Powell
was not interested in the vice presidency, he might accept another
post. Speculation has centered on secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   The questioning highlighted some stark differences between the
candidates, for example on Social Security, the death penalty and
abortion. The side-by-side comparison also showed that Gore's 25
years in public office have left him not only with a deep
familiarity with issues but also with a lengthy record that can be
examined for its consistency.
</P>
<P>
   The interviews also underscored the political needs of each
candidate as the campaign heads toward the conventions. Bush, who
leads in the polls, seemed content to keep the conversation vague,
a posture that allows voters to read what they want into him. Gore,
on the other hand, has been eager for direct debates with Bush. His
advisers believe that once voters can compare Gore's grasp of
policy and his center-left positions with what they say is Bush's
right-wing bent, Gore will win the election.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the third-party candidates, Ralph Nader and
Pat Buchanan, also appeared on talk programs. Nader said on CBS'
``Face the Nation'' that he was not worried about siphoning votes
from Gore, even if it could cost Gore the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be running if I were worried about taking votes
away from Al Gore or George W. Bush,'' Nader said. ``Nobody is
entitled to votes. They have to earn them.''
</P>
<P>
   On the same program, Buchanan was asked whether Bush might
choose a running mate who favored abortion rights. ``Mr. Bush is
blowing smoke,'' Buchanan said. ``He would have an explosion at his
convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore underwent scrutiny of his Social Security plan. Russert
said repeatedly that Gore's proposal was based on a rosy scenario
that anticipated budget surpluses for the next 40 years. Gore said
that his plan would keep the Social Security trust fund sacrosanct
and, by eliminating the national debt by 2012, would help extend
the life of the entitlement program.
</P>
<P>
   Russert noted that the Clinton-Gore budget for 2000 had proposed
increasing the money for Social Security by investing some of the
budget surplus set aside for Social Security ``in corporate
equities or other private financial instruments.'' Russert
described the difference between the two candidates' approaches
this way: ``You want the government to invest in the market; George
Bush wants individuals to invest.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that he did not support that proposal, even though it
was in the administration's budget, and he called it a trial
balloon. The vice president said that Bush's plan for privatizing
part of Social Security would be a ``catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What he wants to do is to divert 16 percent of the money
that's going into the trust fund and put it into the stock market
now,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bush has not specified an amount that he would allow
individuals to invest in the market from their Social Security
payroll tax.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seemed deliberately vague and refused to answer whether
under his plan the government would protect individuals against any
losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``A safe return _ the safest of all investment vehicles _ yields
about twice what the Social Security Trust is getting today,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Governor,'' Donaldson said, ``if this were 1929, we'd
probably make the same statement and then those awful years came
forward and people would have lost money.'' Donaldson then
reiterated his question about ``whether you think the government
should make good any losses for retirees.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said, ``There's going to be a lot of discussions about the
particulars of the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he agreed with the details of one of the proposals
on Capitol Hill to overhaul Medicare, Bush said, ``I believe the
next president must put Republicans and Democrats in a room and
say, `Let's reform Medicare.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also took a pass on whether the Republican Congress should
accept a deal with President Clinton to cut the marriage penalty in
exchange for funding Medicare to cover prescription drugs. ``That's
up to this current Congress and this current president,'' Bush
said. ``What the people need to know about me is that this is where
I'm going to lead the Congress when I become the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Russert also highlighted some of the changes that Gore has made
on various issues over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who favors abortion rights, was asked if he believed that
life began at conception. ``No,'' he said. Asked when life did
begin, Gore said: ``There is a developmental process during which
the burden kind of shifts over time,'' citing the first trimester
of a pregnancy as being different from the third, but not
pinpointing a time when he thought life began.
</P>
<P>
   Russert pointed out that in 1987, Gore had opposed federal
funding for abortions for poor women and had called abortion
``arguably the taking of a human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore acknowledged that he had changed his position, saying he
did so about 15 years ago. ``I talked to a lot of women who taught
me about the kinds of circumstances that can come up and the kinds
of dilemmas that women can face,'' he said. ``I've come to the very
deep conviction that a woman's right to choose must be protected
regardless of the woman's income.''
</P>
<P>
   Of a vote that he had cast that would define the term ``person''
to include the unborn, Gore said, ``That was a very odd procedural
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested, without saying directly, that he would not require
parental permission for a minor to have an abortion. He said that
such requirements have tended to be used as a back-door way to try
to eliminate abortion altogether.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On the death penalty, Gore said he did not support a national
moratorium on it for the 21 federal prisoners who are on death row.
But he said he did support the moratorium on the death penalty in
Illinois ``based on the extraordinary number of errors'' found in
those cases.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had been quoted as saying that with the death penalty,
``there are always going to be some small numbers of errors.''
Sunday Gore said he wanted zero errors but sometimes because of
human imperfection, even jury verdicts ``sometimes produce a
mistake.'' But he said he was unaware of any involving the trials
of the 21 federal death-row inmates.
</P>
<P>
   He also hinted that any state with questionable executions would
do well to consider a moratorium. He did not mention Texas,
however, a state that has the highest number of executions. Because
of Gore's position on the death penalty, he has refrained from
criticizing Bush's record on executions. Since Bush took office in
1995, Texas has executed 137 people, more than twice as many as the
next highest state, Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said that he was certain tht every execution in Texas
had been warranted, that the inmates had been guilty and had had
full access to the appeals process. Sunday, Cokie Roberts directed
him to the case of Odell Barnes, who was executed in March even
though several questions had been raised about his case. He was
convicted of raping and murdering Helen Bass, a 42-year-old nurse
who was his mother's best friend. Barnes went to his death
insisting that he had had a sexual relationship with Bass but that
he had not killed her.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was also asked about a recent Supreme Court decision that
said the Boy Scouts could exclude gay members. Gore said he had not
read the opinion and offered none of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Russert posed a series of questions on the investigations into
Gore's financial activities in the 1996 campaign. Gore said that
Russert was ``beating a dead horse.'' Asked if his visit to a
Buddhist temple in 1996 was a fund-raising event, Gore said: ``I
believe it was not,'' adding, ``There was no request for funds, no
money changed hands.''

   WASHINGTON - Generous corporate hosts and wealthy individuals
will be making the most of the Aug. 14-17 Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles, footing 64 percent of a record $48.8
million budget for what is expected to be Vice President Al Gore's
four-day coronation ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Convention planners say the contributions fill a gaping hole in
funding the national events, but critics contend the heavy
corporate involvement amounts to influence peddling under the guise
of civic-mindedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just another loophole in campaign financing law that
allows people to influence people and lawmaking,'' said Holly
Bailey, a researcher for the Center for Responsive Politics, a
Washington-based watchdog group. ``Donors say this is all about
civic pride, but it's just another form of lobbying.''
</P>
<P>
   The outlay for the DNC, as reported by the Federal Election
Commission and convention organizers, includes:
</P>
<P>
   --$13.5 million in taxpayer funds donated via a checkoff on
income-tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   --$4 million in tax money given to the committee by the city of
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   --$31.3 million in goods, services and cash collected from
private and corporate donors by L.A. Convention 2000, the
Democrats' official host committee.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers say the massive outlay, up $5 million from what the
Democrats and their Chicago hosts spent on their 1996 confab, is
needed to offset a serious shortfall in public funding. Under
campaign reforms enacted by Congress in 1971, conventions are to be
primarily funded by voluntary taxpayer contributions.
</P>
<P>
   They also argue that the convention will be worth every penny,
as it will bathe Los Angeles in positive publicity aimed at
national and international audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what it costs to put on a convention. It's a gigantic
undertaking, and there are no frills in our budget,'' said Ben
Austin, director of communications for L.A. Convention 2000.
``We're spending $4 million on special community events, and we
also have high costs for transportation and other services.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin also stressed that organizers estimate that the
convention will draw 35,000 visitors and pump $135 million into the
region's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign reform laws - which allow host committees to collect
money and help bankroll conventions to ``promote the commerce of
the host city during the convention'' - also contains a loophole
for the political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Party convention spending is strictly limited to the grant of
taxpayer funds from the FEC. That means the Democratic National
Committee, which recently confirmed it has more than $30 million in
cash on hand for the fall campaign, won't be dropping a dime of it
on the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Alexander, professor emeritus of political science at
the University of Southern California and a veteran convention
watcher, agreed that corporate sponsorship of conventions is
worrisome. But he said that flaws in federal law have made it a
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make a mockery of the law by establishing public funding
for conventions and then not supplying enough money,'' Alexander
said. ``You can't put on a decent convention with such small
grants. If the federal government was willing to put up $40 million
for each party to pay for these events, there would be no problem.
But that's just not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   FEC officials agreed that their grant program, which debuted at
the 1976 conventions, has proven woefully inadequate. The basic
grant of $4 million to each party has not changed since 1976. This
year's $13.5 million grant to both Democrats and Republicans only
represents a cost-of- living adjustment for 24 years of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC also reported that its source of grant funds is
diminishing. In 1980, 28 percent of all taxpayers chose to
participate in the checkoff program on Internal Revenue Service tax
forms. That level has since fallen annually and now stands at 16
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and their L.A. hosts are quick to point out that
Republicans are spending even more on their July 31-Aug. 3
convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC estimates the GOP's total at $63.5 million, up $20
million from the amount the party and its host committee spent in
San Diego in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It includes the $13.5 million FEC grant and $7 million forked
over by the taxpayers of the City of Brotherly Love.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. convention organizers also point to the fact that they have
refused donations from tobacco companies. The Republicans'
corporate lineup includes a $250,000 donation from cigarette maker
Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
   (Second take to come)
</P>
<P>
   Local boosters, including Mayor Richard Riordan, a registered
Republican who gave $1 million to the Democrats' host committee,
see the convention as a sure-fire vehicle for showcasing the
Southland's comeback from such setbacks as the 1992 riots, the 1994
Northridge Earthquake and a massive post-Cold War paring of the
aerospace industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way Los Angeles could have put on this event even
four years ago,'' Austin said, ``There were just too many serious
problems to deal with. But there has been a remarkable turnaround.
This isn't about putting L.A. on the map, everyone knows about us
through Hollywood and other sources. This is about redefining the
new L.A. to a national and international audience.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention's estimated crowd of 35,000 will include 15,000
journalists, as well as 4,368 voting delegates and 600 alternates.
</P>
<P>
   Also attending will be AT&AMP;T, which has contributed $1 million
worth of communications equipment, expertise and cash to the host
committee. AT&AMP;T is also giving $1 million to the Republicans'
Philadelphia host committee.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Rochelle Cohen said her company was doing its civic
duty by assisting the Democrats and the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T has a long and proud history of involvement with the
conventions and the democratic process,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also said that AT&AMP;T plans to donate 100 used cell phones
to disadvantaged youths in Southern California after conventioneers
are through with their freebies.
</P>
<P>
   Researcher Bailey said other considerations may be behind AT&AMP;T's
largess. She noted that the telecommunications giant is currently
lobbying Congress to bless its merger with MediaOne, a major cable
TV and Internet provider, and to keep its cable lines closed to
other providers.
</P>
<P>
   American International Group, a New York-based insurance and
financial services conglomerate, gave the host committee $2
million. Bailey noted that AIG is lobbying for approval of
permanent normal trade relations with China, a measure passed by
the House but tied up in the Senate. AIG has already begun training
agents in China in anticipation of the opening of Chinese financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said corporate giving appears to be a sound investment
for donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the conventions, you are dealing with an elite audience of
decision makers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In her recent report on corporate convention giving, Bailey also
questioned whether host cities are going to get bangs for their
bucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a healthy sum of money for an event that has drawn a
collective yawn from the major TV networks,'' she wrote. Bailey
noted that ABC-TV plans to shoehorn opening-night Democratic and
GOP convention coverage into halftime of a pair of ``Monday Night
Football'' NFL preseason games.
</P>
<P>
   USC's Alexander, who attended every Democratic and GOP gathering
from 1960 to 1992, disagreed with the impact of the conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't downgrade them,'' he said. ``They are still
important kickoffs for the candidates and forums for issues. And
besides, the conventions are a lot of fun. It's only once every
four years that party activists can get together, socialize and
network.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander had one caution for Southland merchants expecting a
convention bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   ``Restaurants usually don't do very well,'' he explained.
``There are so many receptions and buffets that you rarely have to
pay for a meal.''

LEGISLATORS WRESTLE WITH ASSET FORFEITURE POLICY, LAWS

<P>
   CHICAGO _ As hundreds of state legislators from around the
country gather here this week, some are talking about finding ways
to stop police from evading state forfeiture laws.
</P>
<P>
   Some want to tighten their laws to prevent police from using
federal law enforcement agencies to improperly keep millions of
dollars in seized drug money.
</P>
<P>
   Others represent states with November voter initiatives that
would keep seized money out of police coffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, asset forfeiture is something that needs to be
revisited by legislators throughout the country,'' Louisiana state
Rep. Kip Holden, a Baton Rouge Democrat, said Sunday. ``It's going
to be a big debate. It's going to be a very complicated
procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers are in Chicago through Thursday for the National
Conference of State Legislatures, which will address myriad state
and federal issues. More than 5,000 legislators and their staff are
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Holden is chairman of the organization's Law and Justice
Committee, which sponsored one of the forums Saturday that kicked
off the convention. Holden's forum focused on police circumvention
of forfeiture laws and was prompted by information in a two-day
series published in May in The Kansas City Star.
</P>
<P>
   Most states have laws that block seized money from going
directly back to police because they don't want police profiting
from crime fighting, The Star found.
</P>
<P>
   The series also showed that police in more than two dozen states
often hand off property and cash they seize in drug cases to a
federal agency, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration. The
agency keeps a cut, usually 20 percent, and returns the rest to
police.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of the organization, Craig Nienaber, The Star's
projects editor, presented the series' findings during the Saturday
forum.
</P>
<P>
   Two panelists, Steve Kessler, a New York criminal defense
attorney, former prosecutor and national expert on state and
federal forfeiture laws, and Gene Voegtlin, legislative counsel for
the International Association of Chiefs of Police, spoke on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri state Sen. Harry Wiggins, a Kansas City Democrat, also
spoke about the problem in Missouri and his bill to correct it.
</P>
<P>
   The host organization has a policy meant to discourage police
from avoiding states' laws when seeking asset forfeiture.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing the panelists and the questions raised by a dozen
legislators, Holden said Sunday he would request that the issue
also be put on the agenda of the organization's December meeting.
</P>
<P>
   He said it would be important to have attorneys general,
district attorneys and state judges represented in December, as
well as members of law enforcement and the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Holden said he believed the American Bar Association also should
be involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ABA should be in the forefront of dealing with this
issue'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Voegtlin, legislative counsel for the police chiefs'
association, said during the Saturday forum that forfeiture is an
important law enforcement tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forfeiture in the views of our members is probably one of the
most effective weapons that law enforcement has in the war against
crime,'' he said. ``Nothing, I think, makes more sense than for law
enforcementto be able to take the proceeds out of the hands of drug
dealers and the associates of that money.''
</P>
<P>
   Voegtlin said, however, the need for an aggressive fight against
crime appears to be swinging back from the 1980s, when federal laws
were passed that allowed police and federal law enforcement to
share forfeited drug money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in '84 and in the early '90s, the nation was in the midst
of a pretty massive crime wave,'' Voegtlin said. ``I think that
everything that could be done to empower law enforcement to protect
the citizens was being done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have years of declining crime rates and people feel
safer in their homes. Perhaps there is beginning to be some feeling
that perhaps the criminal justice system needs to be reined in.''
</P>
<P>
   Kessler, who has published two treatises on forfeiture law, said
if local and state police were made to follow state laws,
forfeiture would radically change.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that would be difficult because forfeiture has
become ``unquestionably the largest, most lucrative business in the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   At the forum, he discussed a case in Arkansas in which the state
police seized $3.2 million and handed it off to the federal
government, expecting to get 80 percent back. State law would have
allowed the agency to keep $250,000. The rest would have gone to a
statewide law enforcement fund.
</P>
<P>
   But the prosecutor took the case to the state Supreme Court,
which ruled that the police could not keep the money they wanted.
The agency appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused to
hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fight between law enforcement agencies,'' Kessler
said. ``And it is not that uncommon.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that in some Texas counties and Southern states,
sheriff's salaries are based on the proceeds of forfeiture. Across
the country, the operation of law enforcement drug task forces
depends on that money.
</P>
<P>
   ``An old adage is police should not eat what they kill,''
Kessler said. ``These are not isolated incidents. The best way to
reduce the abuse related to civil forfeiture is to defuse the
incentive.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the mouse gets to keep the cheese, then the
corruption within the system, through no fault of law enforcement,
will remain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Forfeiture is easier under federal law than under most state
laws, Kessler said, which is why police often ask a federal agency
to ``adopt'' a seizure. Most state laws carry strong protections
for citizens' property.
</P>
<P>
   For example, some states require a conviction or at least
evidence of a felony crime before a judge can order property
forfeited. Federal law does not have such a provision. Kessler said
that in 80 percent of federal civil forfeiture cases, a person's
property is taken without a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law also allows a law enforcement agency rather than a
judge to declare property forfeited, Kessler said, and that's what
happens in a great majority of federal cases.

FOREIGN CIGARETTES AVOID COSTLY SETTLEMENTS, SELL FOR LESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BENJAMIN PARKE and STEVE CARNEY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
LOS ANGELES _ Exploiting costly tobacco industry settlements that
have boosted brand-name cigarette prices, a Southern California
chain of cigarette stores has been selling foreign brands for as
much as $10 less a carton than American labels.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Smokers are lighting up with joy, but big U.S. tobacco companies
are puffing mad, saying foreign and small manufacturers have taken
advantage of the fact that they're exempt from the landmark 1998
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Big Tobacco must either pass on the cost of the $246 billion,
25-year settlement with the states to its customers or take a hit
on the bottom line, company executives say. And with Friday's jury
verdict ordering the tobacco industry to pay a record $145 billion
in punitive damages to ailing Florida smokers, that's an additional
cost that these new competitors don't have.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prices of all cigarettes have gone up dramatically since
the (1998) agreement,'' said Mark Smith, spokesman for
Louisville-based cigarette manufacturer Brown &AMP; Williamson. ``For
all intents and purposes it's a tax, and these people are not
taxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would seem to be an unfair advantage. The more those
cigarettes are purchased, it not only hurts the big four
manufacturers, it also hurts the states, because the states are not
getting the money from those manufacturers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Barankin, spokesman for California Attorney General Bill
Lockyer, said the issue wasn't of much concern for the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market share for the nonparticipating manufacturers is so
incredibly minuscule that it's difficult to say that it has any
meaningful impact in terms of the settlement,'' Barankin said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies must pay into the settlement if their cigarettes reach
more than a 1 percent share of the market, according to Ann Gurkin,
tobacco analyst for Richmond, Virginia-based Davenport &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The four major American cigarette makers constituted a market of
420 billion cigarettes in 1999, a 9 percent decrease from 460
billion cigarettes the previous year, Gurkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the decline in market share is due to what Big Tobacco
calls ``renegade'' brands.
</P>
<P>
   At Cheap Cigarettes! stores across the Los Angeles area, owner
John Roscoe's smokes _ with such names as Revenge, Bandito and
Geronimo _ sell for $10 a carton cheaper than Marlboro, Camel and
other well-known labels.
</P>
<P>
   According to Roscoe, big tobacco companies exert such dominance
in the marketplace that they charge whatever they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``World prices are cheaper than domestic cigarettes,'' Roscoe
said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, cartons of Marlboro were selling for $32.99 last
week at the store in suburban Reseda, while its erstwhile twin,
Geronimo, was going for $22.49. But whether they stick with the big
brands or try the copycats, the 1.2 million customers Roscoe says
he gets every week all agree they like the prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cheaper,'' said Sanda Stein, 18, while stopping by the
Reseda store with a friend, J.P. Dunbar, 18.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar, a regular Camel smoker who went to buy a carton of
Virginia Slims for his grandmother, sampled a Bandito while he was
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's tasty, like Camel,'' he said, and both marveled at the
price _ $2.25 a pack compared to the $3.12 to $4.25 they pay for
Camels.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's like back in the day,'' Stein said. ``Not for like
three years have we paid $2.25.''
</P>
<P>
   Like retailers of copycat perfumes and colognes, Roscoe features
fliers with ``If you like (Product X), then try (Product Y).'' And
he said he's been told that the foreign smokes are as good or
better than the domestics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't smoke, so I don't know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheap Cigarettes! gets its alternative cigarettes mainly from
Tabacalera, a 370-year-old Spanish company that holds a monopoly on
that country's tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the big four in the U.S. that he's trying to fight. He
said the American tobacco companies raise their prices every four
months for about a month at a time _ like this month, for instance.
So now a carton of Marlboros costs about $4.50 more than it did in
June. He believes they increase prices so they can boast about
lowering them during the other nine months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make any sense to me. It makes the customers mad as
hell three times a year,'' Roscoe said.
</P>
<P>
   Roscoe started selling the discount foreign cigarettes after the
major tobacco producers lowered their prices _ starting with Philip
Morris dropping the cost of Marlboros _ at the same time they
raised the prices on the store-brand smokes they were producing,
like F&AMP;L.
</P>
<P>
   Roscoe said customers then flocked back to the name brands,
because they weren't that much more expensive than the cheaper
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   So in his company's newsletter, he urges smokers to make July
``Brand Switching Month.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith acknowledged that his company does discount brands in
order to stay competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're seeing is price discounting from the manufacturer
at certain times,'' said Smith. ``That's nothing new _ it's been
going on for years and years. The more frequent discounting is
reflective of the fact that prices have gone up dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Roscoe started Cigarettes Cheaper! six years ago, and now has
725 stores in 25 states. About 10 percent of them are in
California, and Nevada and Arizona each have about 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On July 29, Roscoe said they'll open 43 more stores in 14
states, and plans to open an average of one per day until he
controls 20 percent of the nation's cigarette retail business. So
far he has about 10 percent of the business in California and 1.5
percent nationwide _ though that figure makes Cigarettes Cheaper!
the third-largest cigarette retailer in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Roscoe said he was in the grocery business for 40 years in
Northern California, and sold a store brand, F&AMP;L, that was
manufactured by Philip Morris. While on a trip with an executive
from that tobacco giant, Roscoe noticed that many cigarette-only
retailers were dingy businesses and he decided he could do better.
</P>
<P>
   He sold his stores and in 1994 opened the Cigarettes Cheaper!
chain, based in Benicia, in the San Francisco Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought this was a better business,'' he said. He said all
his cigarette customers are happy, while ``you don't find many
happy grocery store customers.''

WASHINGTON: Philip Morris.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Local boosters, including Mayor Richard Riordan, a registered
Republican who gave $1 million to the Democrats' host committee,
see the convention as a sure-fire vehicle for showcasing the
Southland's comeback from such setbacks as the 1992 riots, the 1994
Northridge Earthquake and a massive post-Cold War paring of the
aerospace industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way Los Angeles could have put on this event even
four years ago,'' Austin said, ``There were just too many serious
problems to deal with. But there has been a remarkable turnaround.
This isn't about putting L.A. on the map, everyone knows about us
through Hollywood and other sources. This is about redefining the
new L.A. to a national and international audience.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention's estimated crowd of 35,000 will include 15,000
journalists, as well as 4,368 voting delegates and 600 alternates.
</P>
<P>
   Also attending will be AT&AMP;T, which has contributed $1 million
worth of communications equipment, expertise and cash to the host
committee. AT&AMP;T is also giving $1 million to the Republicans'
Philadelphia host committee.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Rochelle Cohen said her company was doing its civic
duty by assisting the Democrats and the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T has a long and proud history of involvement with the
conventions and the democratic process,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also said that AT&AMP;T plans to donate 100 used cell phones
to disadvantaged youths in Southern California after conventioneers
are through with their freebies.
</P>
<P>
   Researcher Bailey said other considerations may be behind AT&AMP;T's
largess. She noted that the telecommunications giant is currently
lobbying Congress to bless its merger with MediaOne, a major cable
TV and Internet provider, and to keep its cable lines closed to
other providers.
</P>
<P>
   American International Group, a New York-based insurance and
financial services conglomerate, gave the host committee $2
million. Bailey noted that AIG is lobbying for approval of
permanent normal trade relations with China, a measure passed by
the House but tied up in the Senate. AIG has already begun training
agents in China in anticipation of the opening of Chinese financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said corporate giving appears to be a sound investment
for donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the conventions, you are dealing with an elite audience of
decision makers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In her recent report on corporate convention giving, Bailey also
questioned whether host cities are going to get bangs for their
bucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a healthy sum of money for an event that has drawn a
collective yawn from the major TV networks,'' she wrote. Bailey
noted that ABC-TV plans to shoehorn opening-night Democratic and
GOP convention coverage into halftime of a pair of ``Monday Night
Football'' NFL preseason games.
</P>
<P>
   USC's Alexander, who attended every Democratic and GOP gathering
from 1960 to 1992, disagreed with the impact of the conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't downgrade them,'' he said. ``They are still
important kickoffs for the candidates and forums for issues. And
besides, the conventions are a lot of fun. It's only once every
four years that party activists can get together, socialize and
network.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander had one caution for Southland merchants expecting a
convention bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   ``Restaurants usually don't do very well,'' he explained.
``There are so many receptions and buffets that you rarely have to
pay for a meal.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON - Generous corporate hosts and wealthy individuals
will be making the most of the Aug. 14-17 Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles, footing 64 percent of a record $48.8
million budget for what is expected to be Vice President Al Gore's
four-day coronation ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Convention planners say the contributions fill a gaping hole in
funding the national events, but critics contend the heavy
corporate involvement amounts to influence peddling under the guise
of civic-mindedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just another loophole in campaign financing law that
allows people to influence people and lawmaking,'' said Holly
Bailey, a researcher for the Center for Responsive Politics, a
Washington-based watchdog group. ``Donors say this is all about
civic pride, but it's just another form of lobbying.''
</P>
<P>
   The outlay for the DNC, as reported by the Federal Elections
Commission and convention organizers, includes:
</P>
<P>
   --$13.5 million in taxpayer funds donated via a checkoff on
income-tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   --$4 million in tax money given to the committee by the city of
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   --$31.3 million in goods, services and cash collected from
private and corporate donors by L.A. Convention 2000, the
Democrats' official host committee.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers say the massive outlay, up $5 million from what the
Democrats and their Chicago hosts spent on their 1996 confab, is
needed to offset a serious shortfall in public funding. Under
campaign reforms enacted by Congress in 1971, conventions are to be
primarily funded by voluntary taxpayer contributions.
</P>
<P>
   They also argue that the convention will be worth every penny,
as it will bathe Los Angeles in positive publicity aimed at
national and international audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what it costs to put on a convention. It's a gigantic
undertaking, and there are no frills in our budget,'' said Ben
Austin, director of communications for L.A. Convention 2000.
``We're spending $4 million on special community events, and we
also have high costs for transportation and other services.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin also stressed that organizers estimate that the
convention will draw 35,000 visitors and pump $135 million into the
region's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign reform laws - which allow host committees to collect
money and help bankroll conventions to ``promote the commerce of
the host city during the convention'' - also contains a loophole
for the political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Party convention spending is strictly limited to the grant of
taxpayer funds from the FEC. That means the Democratic National
Committee, which recently confirmed it has more than $30 million in
cash on hand for the fall campaign, won't be dropping a dime of it
on the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Alexander, professor emeritus of political science at
the University of Southern California and a veteran convention
watcher, agreed that corporate sponsorship of conventions is
worrisome. But he said that flaws in federal law have made it a
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make a mockery of the law by establishing public funding
for conventions and then not supplying enough money,'' Alexander
said. ``You can't put on a decent convention with such small
grants. If the federal government was willing to put up $40 million
for each party to pay for these events, there would be no problem.
But that's just not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   FEC officials agreed that their grant program, which debuted at
the 1976 conventions, has proven woefully inadequate. The basic
grant of $4 million to each party has not changed since 1976. This
year's $13.5 million grant to both Democrats and Republicans only
represents a cost-of- living adjustment for 24 years of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC also reported that its source of grant funds is
diminishing. In 1980, 28 percent of all taxpayers chose to
participate in the checkoff program on Internal Revenue Service tax
forms. That level has since fallen annually and now stands at 16
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and their L.A. hosts are quick to point out that
Republicans are spending even more on their July 31-Aug. 3
convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC estimates the GOP's total at $63.5 million, up $20
million from the amount the party and its host committee spent in
San Diego in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It includes the $13.5 million FEC grant and $7 million forked
over by the taxpayers of the City of Brotherly Love.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. convention organizers also point to the fact that they have
refused donations from tobacco companies. The Republicans'
corporate lineup includes a $250,000 donation from cigarette maker
Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
   (Second take to come)
</P>
<P>
   Local boosters, including Mayor Richard Riordan, a registered
Republican who gave $1 million to the Democrats' host committee,
see the convention as a sure-fire vehicle for showcasing the
Southland's comeback from such setbacks as the 1992 riots, the 1994

ANGELS LOSE ON ERROR IN 10TH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO -- There were some big home runs in Sunday's game
between the Angels and San Diego Padres, but the hit that
ultimately won the game traveled all of 60 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Owens' bases-loaded bunt handcuffed Angels pitcher Al
Levine, allowing Kory DeHaan to score from third with the winning
run in the bottom of the 10th inning in the Padres' 6-5 victory
before 28,941 at Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had erased a three-run deficit in the ninth inning
with four runs against Padres closer Trevor Hoffman, only to lose
it one inning later on Levine's error.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting to a guy like Hoffman happens about as often as going
65 mph on the Hollywood Freeway,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia
said. ``Right now it stings a little bit. ... When you get ahead
and think you have the game and can't close it out, sure it stings
a little bit. But this team has been good at turning the page. It's
one more loss and that's it. If you allow it to carry over, you're
really setting yourself up for trouble down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Home runs by Bret Boone, Joe Vitiello and Ben Davis gave the
Padres a 4-0 lead in the fourth inning. Darin Erstad's RBI double
in the seventh cut the Angels' deficit to 4-1, and it stayed that
way going into the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   But in the ninth the Angels rallied against Hoffman, who went
into the day with 23 saves, second most in the National League.
Adam Kennedy began the inning with a double, and one out later went
to third on a single by Erstad, his third hit of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Stocker, who had already struck out three times in the
game, followed with a triple to the right-center field gap to score
Kennedy and Erstad and cut the Padres' lead to 4-3. Mo Vaughn then
gave the Angels their first lead of the day at 5-4 with a two-run
homer to right field, his 24th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was thinking sacrifice fly in that situation, Vaughn
smiled and said: ``I'm never thinking sacrifice fly. I'm in a
position to take some chances, especially early in the count.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels closer Troy Percival entered the game in the bottom of
the ninth, but the Angels soon found themselves fighting to extend
the game. Al Martin led off the inning with a double and after a
sacrifice bunt by Kevin Nicholson, Owens tied the game by driving
in Martin from third with a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the inning, ex-Angel Phil Nevin had a chance to win it
but Percival struck him out with the bases loaded to send the game
to extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   With Levine pitching in the 10th, DeHaan led off with a pinch
double and went to third on a grounder to second by Davis. After an
intentional walk to Martin, the Angels brought in Erstad from left
field to form a five-man infield.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out they didn't need the extra infielder because
Levine struck out Nicholson for the second out. Erstad then
returned to left field and Levine walked Ryan Klesko intentionally
to bring up Owens.
</P>
<P>
   Owens tried to push the ball past the mound to the right, but
didn't hit it hard enough. Levine got to the ball in plenty of time
but fumbled it for an error and the game was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took my eye off the ball and that was it,'' Levine (1-2)
said. ``I wanted to throw it before I caught it. I had plenty of
time. It was a mental mistake, really. ... When it costs you the
game, it really sucks. The guys battled and a play like that costs
us the game. It hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels wasted numerous opportunities to score early in the
game against Padres starter Adam Eaton. They had runners on first
and second with nobody out in the second inning and didn't score.
Kennedy was stranded after a leadoff triple in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the fourth, the Angels loaded the bases with none out
but again squandered the chance. Troy Glaus struck out looking,
Bengie Molina popped to shallow right field and Kennedy flied to
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't pick those guys up,'' Scioscia said.
``Obviously that changed the whole complexion of the ballgame. With
a little better situation hitting, it's a different game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told somebody the other day, they all sting,'' Vaughn said
of the loss. ``Regardless of how, they all do. But the thing about
this ballclub is the ability to come back. We dropped the first
game in L.A. and played well the next two.''

Baseball's biggest need: fewer teams
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ If your child is sick, the prescription is medicine.
It's as simple as that.
</P>
<P>
   You don't go into committee meetings with other parents and talk
about various ways to circumvent the illness. You don't ignore the
symptoms and keep shooing the kid toward the playground _ his eyes
drawn, his face flush, his fever rushing higher and higher.
</P>
<P>
   You go to the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   You don't crater to the convenient love of the favorite uncle _
we'll call him the Players Association _ who usually shows up only
when times are good, offering gifts and money, but is rarely around
in the middle of the night when the kid is wheezing and coughing.
</P>
<P>
   You make the child well. No matter how much it might hurt and no
matter if the tears break your heart, you do what is best for the
child's condition before it becomes dire and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball is sick.
</P>
<P>
   While some teams flex and strut, the Minnesota Twins, Florida
Marlins, Montreal Expos, Tampa Bay Devil Rays and Oakland
Athletics, to name just five, wallow and deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity in competitive balance in baseball today is grave,
and the realistic hope for long-term health is a joke.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for owners to swallow hard and do what is best for
their game, which is contraction, or de-expansion, or whatever
label MLB owners might want to place on the only thing that will
make the game well.
</P>
<P>
   At 30 teams, the game has at least two too many for its own
good. Maybe four.
</P>
<P>
   It's always painful to admit to mistakes, and it is easy for
those of us whose baseball teams would survive such a drastic move
to tell fans in Minneapolis and Montreal that we're sorry.
</P>
<P>
   But eliminating at least two teams from baseball, which is
something owners unofficially discussed at meetings this past week,
is the simple prescription that will work.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of trading for pitcher Denny Neagle, the New York
Yankees' payroll for the 2000 season is $115 million. The Twins
reportedly have a payroll of just over $17 million, only slightly
more than Dodgers pitcher Kevin Brown will make this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain climbing might have a playing field as slanted as this,
but little else does.
</P>
<P>
   Among the possibilities offered last week by a committee
investigating ways to increase competitive balance were:
</P>
<P>
   Imposing a 50 percent luxury tax on payrolls exceeding $84
million.
</P>
<P>
   Having teams share 40 to 50 percent of local revenues after
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Forming a ``competitive balance draft'' for players born outside
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Relocating franchises ``when necessary'' to address competitive
issues in some cities.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding baseball's domestic and international promotion of the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   But with a wound so deep, bandages don't stop the bleeding.
Besides, competitive balance is only one wound. Another problem is
the game itself.
</P>
<P>
   Even a revenue-sharing plan won't make pitching better or
reverse the growing trend of going to a major-league ballpark and
watching a beer-league softball game break out. A 5.00 ERA used to
mean a ticket to the minor leagues. Today, it's worth a five-year,
$16 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   When the first century of ``modern baseball'' ended last year,
only two men _ Hank Aaron and Babe Ruth _ had hit more than 700
home runs in a career. Within six or seven years, three players of
the same era _ Mark McGwire, Barry Bonds and Ken Griffey Jr. _
might have joined them.
</P>
<P>
   Home runs are coming cheap, but the game is cheapening itself,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another wound self-inflicted by owners is the not-so-subtle
arm-twisting done to cities, forcing them to build new baseball
palaces or else. The owners have thrown out All-Star Game plums as
prizes, as if this is all cities need to remain ``big-league.''
</P>
<P>
   But baseball clearly has underestimated the public's craving for
competitiveness, fallen victim to its own circus act called the
All-Star Home Run Derby and overestimated the value of cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos have perhaps the game's best manager in Felipe Alou
and maybe the best player in Vladimir Guerrero _ a bona fide
long-ball whiz. But attendance is horrid in Montreal because fans
realize the Expos' chances of winning are zilch.
</P>
<P>
   Some might tell you that all the Expos need is a new stadium,
but that would only draw fans for the short term, perhaps much like
Enron Field is doing for the Astros today.
</P>
<P>
   What baseball needs is to swallow hard and admit its mistakes.
It needs to take its medicine and get better.
</P>
<P>
   Less is more.
</P>
<P>
   $$$

JONES SOARS, JOYNER-KERSEE FALLS SHORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL OBERJUERGE  
 San Bernardino Sun 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  SACRAMENTO -- Marion Jones took a great leap forward in her
bid for five gold medals. Jackie Joyner-Kersee's career ended,
again, with a game effort.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Johnson fended off his opponents, then shrugged off
critics. A legally blind woman qualified in the 1,500-meter run, an
Olympic first, and a pair of twins made another first by qualifying
out of the men's 400.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day of triumphs, clutch performances, upsets and
precedents a tthe U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials on Sunday at
Sacramento State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is guaranteed at the trials,'' Johnson said after
winning the 400 in 43.68 seconds. ``Nothing is easy. Nobody gives
you anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones averted disaster in the women's long jump, the weak link
in her ambitious scheme for an unprecented five track-and-field
gold medals at Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   After fouling on her first two tries, she popped a jump of 22
feet, 1 3/4 inches on her third jump, putting her into the final
group of eight.
</P>
<P>
   She won the event on her fifth jump, a season-best 23-0 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a blink of an eye there, I though `I've got to get the
next one, or this dream is over,''' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee, Jones' idol, said she was as confident as was
Jones that Jones would get a qualifying mark on her third leap.
``She knew exactly what she had to do,'' Joyner-Kersee said. ``She
didn't even have to hit the board to qualify, and she knew it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones hopes to win gold in the 100, 200, long jump and both
relays. She now has secured Olympics berths in three events (the
100, the long jum p and the sprint relay), and has five days off
before beginning her bid for a 200 berth on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee, 38, ended her quixotic comeback bid with a
nothing-to-be-ashamed of leap of 21-10 3/4, good for sixth. She
came out of retirement only two months ago, and the trials was her
first meet since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never be disappointed,'' she said. ``I was on four
Olympic teams. This really was a longshot.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was pushed slightly in the 400, but never seemed in
trouble while winning the men's 400 in 43.68.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked if he could have threatened his world record of
43.18 had he pushed hard the entire race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Records, records, records!'' he said with some exasperation.
``That's all anybody ever talks about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Records don't happen every day, and to set a record, you have
to take risks, and this isn't the place for it. In Sydney, I want
to run the race of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he takes no umbrage at sniping at him by other track and
field athletes, particularly Maurice Greene and Inger Miller.
Miller on Saturday suggested the curls in Johnson's coiffure ``were
too tight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have never been criticized, I guess,'' Johnson
said. ``A veteran athlete, a mature athlete, knows that all that
matters is what you do on the track.''
</P>
<P>
   Twins Alvin and Calvin Harrison ran second and fifth in the 400.
Alvin will compete in the individual 400 competition, and Calvin
very likely will be part of the relay team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is wonderful, for twins to be on the same team,'' Alvin
said. ` `Always before, one got left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Marla Runyon refused to be left behind in the women's 1,500,
finishing a strong third in 4 minutes, 6.44 seconds, to make the
Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   Runyon is legally blind, and nearly fell when she bumped into a
competitor on the second lap, but said she doesn't think about her
condition, known as macular denegeration (which leaves her with
20/300 vision) as much as do people watching her.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I don't think my competitors do,'' she said. ``I'm
definitely an athlete. My vision is just a circumstance that
happened. I never really looked at it as a barrier. I never said to
myself, `I want to be the first legally blind Olympian.' I just
said I wanted to be on an Olympic team.''
</P>
<P>
   Regina Jacobs won the 1,500 in 4:01.01, making her fourth
Olympic team , and Suzy Favor Hamilton was second.
</P>
<P>
   In other events on a busy Sunday at Hornet Stadium:
</P>
<P>
   -- Lawrence Johnson took advantage of a field stripped of
American world-record holder Jeff Hartwig, who no-heighted in
qualifying, to win the pole vault at 19-1 1/2. Nick Hysong was
second, and Chad Harting won a jumpoff, the first at the trials
since 1936, according to meet organizers, with Derek Miles for
third.
</P>
<P>
   -- Gabe Jennings threatened the men's 1,500 trials record of
3:35.15 seconds before finishing first in 3:35.90. Jason Pyrah and
Michael Stember also qualified in the metric mile.
</P>
<P>
   -- Latisha Colander-Richardson won the women's 400 in 49.87,
well below her previous best, and veteran Jearl Miles-Clark was
second. San Diego prep Monique Henderson was eighth.
</P>
<P>
   -- Karol Damon was the surprise winner of the women's high jump
with a modest leap of 6-4. Amy Acuff, formerly of UCLA, won a
jumpoff with pre-meet favorite Tisha Waller for the third berth.
</P>
<P>
   -- Michelle Rohl won the women's 20,000-meter race walk.

been repaved for years, and 16 percent of the city's buildings are

away from the mayor, City Council and regulatory and licensing
agencies and put it all in the hands of one person, a chief

   MARKET-VALUE-ENERGY (Washington) _ With millions of air
conditioners humming this summer, and dire warnings of electricity
running short, a growing number of utilities are using novel
tactics to avoid blackouts and other disasters. Some are offering
cash to companies willing to reduce energy consumption at certain
hours, figuring the payments are less than the cost of providing
power at peak times. Other utilities are paying residential
customers for the right to shut off their air conditioners when
power usage is high, or to set them at higher temperatures.
Electricity has long been sold under a system under which a
kilowatt hour has a fixed price, and you can have as much as you
want until the supply runs out and there is none for anybody. But
now, utilities are pricing power the way almost everything else in
America is priced: by market value. By Matthew L. Wald.

   AUTO-PSYCHOLOGY (Detroit) _ Of all the mysteries facing auto
industry marketers in recent years, few have been so puzzling as
how families choose between minivans and sport utility vehicles. To
look at median income, by age, by occupation, by family size, by
where they live, people who buy minivans and people who buy sport
utilities look fairly similar, the auto makers' research has found.
Yet a growing body of research in the auto industry suggests that
buyers of these two kinds of vehicles are very different
psychologically. Sport utility buyers tend to be more restless,
more sybaritic, less social people who are ``self-oriented,'' to
use the auto makers' jargon, while minivan buyers tend to be more
``other-oriented'' _ more involved with family, friends and their
communities. By Keith Bradsher.

   MICROSOFT-RESEARCH (Redmond, Wash.) _ For decades, Microsoft has
held a reputation in the computer industry as an imitator, not an
innovator. That reputation rankles deeply inside the software
giant, which has gained a Rodney Dangerfield-like complex about the

tragic that the unions and companies couldn't come to some middle

CHANGE IS IN THE AIR AS THE COWBOYS OPEN TRAINING CAMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The Dallas Cowboys arrive at Midwestern
State University on Monday to begin training camp for a third
summer in a row, but that's about where the sameness leaves off and
the newness begins.
</P>
<P>
   What will Camp Campo be like? How quickly until Jack Reilly's
new adaptation of an old Cowboys' offense becomes second nature?
Who will replace Deion Sanders at right cornerback?
</P>
<P>
   The Dave Campo era begins at 3 p.m. Monday when all players are
scheduled to report and be checked into their dorm rooms. Two-a-day
workouts then get under way Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Sanders missed all of training camp and raised a
major question over when he would be able to play after undergoing
big-toe surgery three months earlier. Michael Irvin reported to
Wichita Falls amid a controversy over what then-coach Chan Gailey
outlined as a reduced role for Irvin in the offense.
</P>
<P>
   But a year ago, at least Sanders and Irvin were Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders is now a member of the NFC East rival Washington
Redskins after the Cowboys opted not to re-sign the 32-year-old
cornerback/return man for salary-cap reasons and the 34-year-old
Irvin retired because of a spinal condition. Irvin now begins a
broadcasting career with Fox Sports Net.
</P>
<P>
   Most Cowboys fans recognize that receiver Joey Galloway was
acquired by the Cowboys from Seattle in February to serve as a
complement to Rocket Ismail and a replacement for Irvin. The deal
cost owner Jerry Jones two first-round draft picks and a seven-year
deal worth $42 million, including a $12.5 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys fans probably are less aware that Cleveland free agent
Ryan McNeil was acquired a couple of weeks after Galloway to become
Sanders' replacement.
</P>
<P>
   While Galloway has been impressive in each of the Cowboys' four
organized workouts at Valley Ranch this off-season, McNeil looked
``rusty'' to the defensive coaches until the final minicamp, June
12-14, when he started to find his niche.
</P>
<P>
   But confidence has never been a problem for McNeil, 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest asset is that I'm able to adjust and adapt,'' said
McNeil, who finds himself playing for his fourth NFL team (Detroit,
St. Louis, Cleveland and Dallas) and seventh defensive coordinator
in eight NFL seasons.
</P>
<P>
   McNeil and veteran Kevin Smith enter training camp as the
Cowboys' starting corners. Smith missed half of the 1999 season
with lower back and hamstring injuries. Injury-plagued Kevin
Mathis, who opened the '99 season as a starter and started four
games at cornerback last season, was traded this off-season to New
Orleans for linebacker Chris Bordano.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys haven't tried to hide their concern at cornerback.
They used three of their top four draft picks to take cornerbacks
Duane Goodrich, Kareem Larrimore and Mario Edwards to compete with
McNeil, Smith, Charlie Williams and NFL Europe star Duane
Hawthorne.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say that (cornerback) is a weak link,'' said
defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer, ``but it is an area of concern
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   McNeil feels it's just a matter of learning the defense before
he begins to help erase some of those concerns. He's a tall corner
(6-foot-2) with a good burst to the ball. Two years ago with the
Rams, he led the NFL with nine interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be a lot of question marks (at cornerback) around
here,'' said McNeil, ``but not on my part.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys appear deeper at wide receiver than they have been
in years with Galloway and Ismail backed up by James McKnight, who
already has shown signs of coming back strong from major
reconstructive knee surgery 11 months ago, plus the 1999 emergence
of TCU grad Jason Tucker. Also figuring into the mix will be Chris
Brazzell, Wane McGarity and another NFL Europe star, Jeff Ogden.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback? It's a different kind of depth there. Training camp
will be used to sort out the contenders from the pretenders. nn

STRUGGLE CONTINUES FOR PERCIVAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO -- Angels closer Troy Percival was given the ball to
start the bottom of the ninth inning Sunday afternoon at Qualcomm
Stadium, asked to save a 5-4 lead. The Angels had just scored four
runs in the top of the ninth off Padres closer Trevor Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of getting his 22nd save, Percival was tagged with
his sixth blown save when the Padres scored once to tie the game
and send it into extra innings. The Padres eventually won in 10
innings, 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   Percival faced seven batters in all, and it wasn't pretty:
Double, sacrifice bunt, walk, sacrifice fly, hit batter, walk,
strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is expected to be successful every time, but Percival's
postgame comments showed he still is searching to find a consistent
rhythm that has eluded him most of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was probably physically as good as I've felt in four
years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Percival threw mostly curveballs, staying away from his 95-mph
fastball because ``I had an open base with fastball hitters coming
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Martin doubled on Percival's first pitch of the inning, a
fastball. But Percival, normally not afraid to challenge hitters
with his fastball, stayed away from it most of the time, though he
did strike out Phil Nevin on a fastball to end the inning. In
between, though, the Padres pushed across the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably could have thrown a few more fastballs than I
did,'' Percival said. ``But I'm not going to second-guess myself. I
had good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival said his only mistake was a fastball away to Eric
Owens, who went the other way and hit a sacrifice fly to right
field that tied the game. Percival said he should have thrown the
pitch inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy's had a lot of success,'' Angels manager Mike
Scioscia said. ``He's got a good feel for what he has to do out
there. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. He feels good
with his breaking ball. If he feels he needs a breaking ball to get
out of an inning, he'll use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Jarrod Washburn threw six innings innings Sunday,
five of which were scoreless. But it was the one inning that hurt
him and the Angels. The Padres hit three homers in the fourth,
scoring four runs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wash was getting behind a lot of the hitters, and it caught up
with him,'' Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn struck out seven to tie his career high, but the one
bad inning was the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left some balls up,'' Washburn said. ``They were the right
pitches, just in the wrong spots and they made me pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Lou Pote was optioned to Triple-A Edmonton after
Sunday's game to make room for Brian Cooper, who was activated and
will start tonight's game. ... Garret Anderson, who missed
Saturday's game because of a sore right knee, returned to the
lineup Sunday and went 4 for 5, extending his hitting streak to 10
games.

MISSION ACCOMPLISHED: COWBOYS SIGN FINAL PICKS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Dallas Cowboys' chief negotiator Stephen
Jones has fulfilled his promise to have all the rookie draft picks
signed for the start of training camp Monday at Midwestern State
University.
</P>
<P>
   Jones made good on the promise Sunday when the team's first and
last picks came to terms. Cornerback Dwayne Goodrich (second round)
and linebacker Orantes Grant (seventh round) joined the team's
three other picks _ cornerbacks Kareem Larrimore (fourth round) and
Mario Edwards (sixth round) and running back Michael Wiley (fifth
round) _ with contracts just in time for camp.
</P>
<P>
   Players are scheduled to report to camp by 3 p.m. Monday. The
first practice is set for Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to get everybody in camp on time,'' Jones
said. ``We actually got a day or so to spare. This is early for us.
We are usually not done until midnight before the first practice.
This might be a record.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich signed a four-year deal with a $1 million signing
bonus. His base salaries are $250,000 in 2000, $312,500 in 2001,
$375,000 in 2002 and $437,500 in 2003. His deal will count just
$500,000 against the Cowboys salary cap in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Grant's deal calls for him to receive $193,000 in 2000, $275,000
in 2001 and $356,000 in 2002. He also got a $30,000 signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie free-agent offensive tackle Jonathan Gray, who played at
Texas Tech, surprised the Cowboys by deciding to retire from
football. .MDBU/ nn

LACK OF TIMELY HITTING SINKS RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Tony Bennett mighthave left his heart in San
Francisco, but the Texas Rangers seem to have left their clutch
hitting in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The big hits that carried them to two thrilling victories
against the Diamondbacks were notably absent on a cold afternoon at
Pacific Bell Park on Sunday when the Rangers went 1-for-11 with
runners in scoring position and fell to the San Francisco Giants,
6-4.
</P>
<P>
   The loss left the Rangers 2-2 on the current 11-game road trip
and dropped them 8 1/2 games behind the Seattle Mariners in the
American League West.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating we couldn't get the big hit,'' shortstop
Royce Clayton said. ``But we kept battling back. This team doesn't
quit. If we keep doing that and keep playing good baseball, we'll
be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Esteban Loaiza took the loss by allowing five runs in five-plus
innings and the Giants got an extra run in the eighth when a fan in
left field reached over the wall to snag Rich Aurilia's long fly
ball when it appeared Rusty Greer was going to catch it.
</P>
<P>
   But Rangers manager Johnny Oates wasn't interested in talking
about his enigmatic starting pitcher or the home run that could
have been caught. Instead he focused on the Rangers' ``missed
opportunities,'' a lament that echoed throughout the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had three or four opportunities where one or two big hits
would have led to big innings,'' Oates said. ``But we couldn't get
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers gave Loaiza a 3-1 lead going into the sixth, but it
disappeared quickly into the gloom. Loaiza walked Barry Bonds to
start the inning, Jeff Kent singled to left and J.T. Snow, jumping
on the first pitch, lined a home run to right to give the Giants a
4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After Ellis Burks singled to center, Loaiza was pulled.
Francisco Cordero took over andwalked Aurilia, then gave up a
single to Bobby Estella to make it a two-run game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loaiza was fine,'' Oates said. ``It's not always Loaiza's
fault. He gave us five-plus innings against the best hitting team
in the National League. Two base hits at the right time and instead
of leaving the game trailing 4-3, he's leading 7-4 and we're
talking about how well he pitched.''
</P>
<P>
   There were four such innings where a key hit could have won it
for the Rangers against Giants starter Shawn Estes or left-handed
reliever Alan Embree.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers started the first with a single by Luis Alicea and a
double by Greer. But they got just one run on Ivan Rodriguez's
grounder. Estes struck out David Segui and got Chad Curtis on a
grounder back to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis' run-scoring double in the fourth, giving the Rangers a
2-1 lead, also left them with runners on second and third with no
outs. But they got just one more run on Gabe Kapler's grounder to
short. On the same play, first baseman Snow cut down Curtis, who
was trying to go to third.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers loaded the bases with one out in the seventh off
Estes. After Embree took over, they got only one more run on
Greer's sacrifice fly as Rodriguez, in a 1-for-13 slump, struck
out.
</P>
<P>
   With the Rangers trailing 5-4, Segui and Curtis started the
eighth with singles. But Scott Sheldon, pinch hitting for pitcher
Mike Venafro, bunted too hard back to Embree and Segui was forced
at third. Embree, who had a 16.20 career earned-run average against
the Rangers coming into the game, then struck out Mike Lamb and
Clayton looking.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at my numbers in the past against Texas, they
haven't been the best,'' Embree said. ``I think I had one good
outing against them and that was in long relief. That's something
you hope that down the line, you'll get the monkey off your back.''
</P>
<P>
   Aurilia's controversial home run made it 6-4, but Giants closer
Robb Nen breezed through the ninth, which is why there was little
complaining in the Rangers' clubhouse afterward about the umpires
costing them the game. The Rangers knew this one was lost at the
plate, or left behind in Arizona. nn

THE HOME RUN THAT WAS THAT MAYBE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The San Francisco Giants got a potentially
important, but controversial insurance run in the bottom of the
eighth inning Sunday when Rich Aurilia hit a home run off Tim
Crabtree. But the Texas Rangers contend fan interference should
have been called because a spectatorappeared to reach over the
left-field wall and catch the ball before left fielder Rusty Greer
could.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it appeared the two gloves bumped. But the fan's glove
was higher and replays also showed it was in front of Greer when he
caught the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt something,'' Greer said. ``But I was focused on the
ball so I don't know what it was. I can't say definitely I would
have caught it, but I felt I had a chance to make the play.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Royce Clayton, who led the argument with second
base-umpire Steve Rippley, said, ``My whole thing was I don't think
the ball would have gone out. I saw Rusty go up for it and hit the
fan. I thought fan interference would have been called.'' HISTORIC
DAY FOR SEGUI
</P>
<P>
   David Segui started at first base Sunday to earn his niche in
baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   The game was Segui's 1,000th at first base, which qualified him
to be listed among the all-time fielding percentage leaders at the
position.
</P>
<P>
   Segui has a .99590 career percentage, which places him second
behind Steve Garvey (.99594) and just ahead of Don Mattingly
(.99582).
</P>
<P>
   Oates, with the designated hitter not being used at the National
League park, started Segui because left-hander Shawn Estes was on
the mound. It also gave him a chance to rest Rafael Palmeiro for
two consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
   Oates said Palmeiro will start the next two games in San
Francisco, which end the Rangers' interleague schedule. But he also
plans on giving Palmeiro more time at designated hitter in the
second half than before the All-Star break. The Rangers have fewer
days off in the second half and Oates wants to keep Palmeiro
strong. He said it falls under the same philosophy of giving
catcher Ivan Rodriguez more time off in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro not being in the lineup gave Oates a terrific
pinch hitter on the bench. But he could never get him in the game.
Oates did use two pinch hitters, Scott Sheldon in the seventh and
Frank Catalanotto in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   With the Rangers trailing by one, Sheldon batted with runners on
first and second and nobody out. With left-hander Alan Embree on
the mound, Oates wanted a sacrifice bunt. Instead Sheldon bunted
too hard and forced Segui at third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to hit Raffy off a left-hander,'' Oates said.
``We're bunting there.'' OLIVER JOINS RANGERS
</P>
<P>
   Darren Oliver rejoined the Rangers Sunday, but manager Johnny
Oates is still unsure when Oliver will return to the rotation.
Oates said Oliver would likely pitch either Wednesday or Thursday,
either for the Rangers or on medical rehabilitation assignment for
Triple-A Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to pitch,'' Oliver said. ``We'll see what happens.
It's not always my decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers could create an opening for Oliver by trading
Esteban Loaiza, going back to a 12-man pitching staff or dropping a
reliever, either Doug Davis or Francisco Cordero. GLYNN FOR
DRANSFELDT
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are planning to activate pitcher Ryan Glynn off the
disabled list Monday and send shortstop Kelly Dransfeldt back to
the minors. Dransfeldt was promoted the week before the All-Star
break when shortstop Royce Clayton was sidelined because of a
strained left side muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Dransfeldt is 1-for-5 with the Rangers, his only hit being a
double off Randy Johnson on Saturday. Dransfeldt is hitting .224
for Triple-A Oklahoma. Despite his lack of offense, Johnny Oates
says of Dransfeldt's defense, ``he's as good as any shortstop in
the majors.'' nn

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ This won't be a summer forgotten anytime
soon by Angela Stanford, and ``I'm only halfway through,'' she
says, with the exuberance of 5-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford, who received her degree from TCU this spring, spent
most of June in England representing the United States at the
Curtis Cup, and later competed at the British Women's Amateur.
There, she qualified for match play and beat four opponents in two
days, before losing in the semifinals to eventual champion Rebecca
Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   And, Stanford's selection to the U.S. Curtis Cup squad also
ensured her berths in the U.S. Women's Amateur Championship and the
U.S. Women's Open Championship, which begins Thursday at Merit Club
in Libertyville, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to play in the Open,'' Stanford said. ``But
if the Open experience even touches the experience I had at the
Curtis Cup, I'll be shocked. The experience I had those two weeks
in England was probably the best golf experience I'll ever have.
But I'm thinking the Open will come extremely close.
</P>
<P>
   ``My best friend called me a couple of nights ago, and she said,
`I saw your pairings for the Open,' '' Stanford continued. ``That's
when I lost it. That's when it was like, `Oh, wow!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford will be paired with Sherri Turner and Melissa McNamara,
and the best the LPGA offers _ players such as Karrie Webb, Pat
Hurst, Grace Park, Beth Daniel, Pat Bradley and Kelly Robbins _
will be playing in the four groups behind her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be teeing the ball up in front of Beth Daniel and
Pat Hurst,'' Stanford said. ``I think that's when it hit me. I'm
more concerned about who's behind me. I'm telling you that it's
going to be hard because I'm going to be wanting autographs.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's primary goal this week will be to survive the cut and
then set her sights on finishing as the tournament's low amateur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's going to be overwhelming,'' she said. ``I know I'm
going to have to play better than I feel like I've ever played
before.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Open, Stanford will begin preparing for the U.S.
Women's Amateur Championship, scheduled Aug. 5-12 in Portland, Ore.
She will likely turn professional after that.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford plans to enter the LPGA's first sectional qualifier,
scheduled for Aug. 21-25 at The Plantation Golf and Country Club in
Venice, Fla., and attempt to earn a berth in the final LPGA
qualifying tournament, scheduled Oct. 16-20 at LPGA International's
Champions Course in Daytona Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the Open awaits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like a kid in a candy store right now,'' she said. nn
