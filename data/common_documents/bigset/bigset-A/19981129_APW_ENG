	   SENDAI, Japan (AP) _ After days of controversy over historical
issues, Chinese President Jiang Zemin left behind the bustle of
Tokyo Sunday to tour farms and visit a Chinese writer's memorial in
northern Japan.
	   Jiang and his wife, Wang Yeping, laid wreaths on a pristine day
at a monument to Chinese writer and social critic Lu Xun in the
northeastern Japanese city of Sendai.
	   Grandchildren of Lu and Genkuro Fujino, Lu's professor at
Sendai's Tohoku University where the writer studied in 1904, shook
hands with Jiang at the ceremony. Lu is one of China's most popular
and influential authors.
	   Jiang also visited Tohoku University and stood at the lectern of
a classroom where Lu studied.
	   Jiang's trip to the rural north on the fifth day of his historic
visit to Japan marked a break from the diplomatic snafus that
characterized his stay in Tokyo.
	   On Friday, protesters shouted anti-Chinese slogans while Jiang
delivered a speech urging Japan to remind its youth of the horrors
it committed during World War II. Three students were arrested in
scuffles with security guards.
	   Scores of demonstrators, protesting China's nuclear weapons
program and human rights abuses, were dragged away by police.
	   Japan's omission of a full written apology for its brutal
invasion of China has led observers to question whether Jiang's
visit has succeeded in its aim of achieving a full reconciliation
between the two Asian giants. Jiang's repeated references to
Japan's past militarism in recent days have indicated lingering
mistrust of Tokyo.
	   Later, Jiang boarded a plane to Japan's northernmost main island
of Hokkaido, where he was scheduled to visit farms.
	   Sendai is 302 kilometers (189 miles) northeast of Tokyo.
	   Jiang's trip is the first of a Chinese head of state to Japan
since World War II. The Chinese president departs Monday for
Beijing.

Fleeing a degraded habitat, turtles invade fruit orchards
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Fleeing stripped forests and chemically
tainted rivers, turtles by the tens of thousands have invaded fruit
orchards southwest of Bangkok where they are falling prey to
hunters, a newspaper said Sunday.
	   ``They hide in the undergrowth and tall grass to escape sunlight
during the daytime and come out at night in droves to look for
food,'' one orchard owner, Preecha Pukkabutr, told the Bangkok
Post.
	   The 60-year-old Preecha said he had recently found some 50
freshwater turtles of different sizes and species in just one
10-meter-square (107-square-foot) area of his orchard.
	   The ``invasion'' started nearly a year ago, but in recent months
it has reportedly attracted hunters from other provinces who
Preecha said trespassed on the orchards to ferret out the turtles
for sale to restaurant owners.
	   He said the hunters, arriving in pick-up trucks, normally came
at night, poking into the undergrowth with long bamboo poles. Some
also stole fruit from the orchards in Samut Songkram Province,
sparking threats by owners that they would be shot.
	   While locals normally don't eat turtles, they are a popular item
Bangkok restaurants catering to tourists from Taiwan, Hong Kong,
China and South Korea who believe turtle meat improves sexual
performance.
	   Charuchin Natheepraphas, a reptile expert at the National
Science Museum Organization, recently said the turtle migration
indicated there was something terrible amiss in the traditional
habitat of these animals.
	   He cited chemical pollution in the Mae Klong River and massive
deforestation in areas northwest of Samut Songkram.
	   ``Turtles are very sensitive to changes in water quality,'' he
said, adding they were important to riverine ecology, helping to
keep the water clean by feeding on dead vegetation.
	   The expert said habitat destruction and hunting had brought some
species to the brink of extinction.

FedEx, Nippon Express agree to transport services alliance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Nippon Express Co. and America's Federal
Express Corp. have agreed to form a wide-ranging alliance in
international transport services, a news report said Sunday.
	   Cooperation will begin in December when Nippon Express, Japan's
largest transport company, starts using FedEx's international
delivery service, the Nihon Keizai newspaper said, quoting company
sources.
	   The tie-up is expected to include joint use of parcel collection
points and other facilities around the world.
	   FedEx, America's second-biggest transport company, and Nippon
Express will also share information systems to track cargo
deliveries, the paper said.
	   FedEx, which has its own network in Tokyo, Osaka and other major
Japanese cities, will contract out work to Nippon Express in areas
not covered by its network. The U.S. company also hopes to use
Nippon Express's network in Asia.
	   The two companies hope to save money through increased
efficiency at a time when businesses worldwide are reviewing their
logistic systems.
	   The Nihon Keizai said that as the two firms rank among the
world's top five transport companies, their alliance is likely to
affect the strategies of United Parcel Service of America Inc. and
other competitors.
	   The two companies are expected to finalize the deal by the end
of December.
	   Nippon Express aims to more than triple overseas deliveries to
some 70,000 a month by the year 2000, boosting annual revenue by
several billion yen (million dollars).

</HEADLINE>
October

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Sharply falling imports helped South
Korea post a dlrs 2.75 billion current account surplus in October,
the central Bank of Korea said in a preliminary report Sunday.
	   October's gain pushed the nation's combined current account
surplus for the first ten months of this year to dlrs 34.11
billion, compared with a dlrs 12.62 billion deficit in the same
period last year.
	   October's surplus was the nation's 12th consecutive monthly
gain. It compared with a dlrs 488 million deficit during the same
month last year.
	   Exports fell 11.4 percent to 10.79 billion in October but
imports plunged by 39.7 percent to dlrs 7.34 billion, leading to a
3.45 billion surplus in the trade component of the current account.
	   Imports have dropped sharply in recent months as businesses
slashed capital investment and consumers spent less amid the
country's economic crisis.

 &UR; Slow-moving ice trek passes grim milestone &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout; ADDS detail, background, byline.
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ After three weeks of hauling heavy
sleds across jagged ice and being locked down by a blizzard, three
Antarctic adventurers trying to make an unassisted round trip to
the South Pole have passed a grim milestone, their support group
said Sunday.
	   New Zealander Peter Hillary and his two Australian colleagues
Jon Muir and Eric Philips have passed the site where the British
explorer Robert Falcon Scott perished on the frozen continent more
than 85 years ago.
	   Hillary and his team are trying to recreate Scott's ill-fated
1911 expedition and ski nearly 1,875 miles from New Zealand's
Antarctic Scott Base to the South Pole and back with no outside
assistance.
	   If successful, the trip will be the longest unsupported ice trek
this century.
	   Farewelled by 60 staff from Scott Base and the nearby U.S. base,
McMurdo Station, the three departed Nov. 4. But they have traveled
only 186 miles (300 kilometers) because of bad weather and
difficult terrain.
	   ``We have had to endure temperatures as cold as minus 15 C (5
F), a screaming blizzard which forced us into the tent for a day,
and sastrugi which have made our progress slower than expected,''
Hillary said in an update posted Sunday on the team's Internet
site.
	   Sastrugi are wavelike ridges and furrows chiseled out of the ice
or snow surface by the abrasive action of snow whipped through the
air by wind.
	   Scott and his team of four men, who set out with ponies and
sled-dogs, died of starvation and weakness only a few miles from a
supply dump, and just days from journey's end.
	   The Australasian team are banking on modern technology to see
them through the adventure, which is expected to take about 100
days. Sunday's update did not give the date the team passed the
site where Scott died.
	   ``We think a lot about Scott,'' Phillips said. ``We feel very
strongly that he and his group were a very committed party.
	   ``Despite the advantages of modern technology that we have ...
the task ahead of us is still a huge challenge.''
	   Hillary said the team had established two depots of food and
cooking fuel which the men plan to use on the return journey.
	   Each man is dragging a sled weighed down by more than 396 pounds
(150 kgs) of food, fuel and equipment. The gear includes
super-lightweight equipment, an Iridium satellite telephone and
paraglider-style kites.
	   ``As we leave each depot our load lightens and we can travel
faster,'' he said.
	   The team is still hopeful of reaching the South Pole by
Christmas Day.
	   To get there they must cross the 88-mile-long (140 kms)
crevasse-riddled Shackleton Glacier, which is thought to never have
been crossed before.
	   Hillary said mileage would be further improved when the
quadrifoil kites are unfurled.
	   With tail winds, the kites will allow the men to double their
speed. They hope to average 9 to 15 mph (15-25 kph) with the kites,
which are expected to be used mostly on the return trip.
	   The men had taken turns each evening preparing meals saturated
with anhydrous milk fat and olive oil to help meet their daily
6,000 calorie quota from two meals and five snacks, the team update
said.
	   The men are also melting snow each day to drink 2.4 gallons
(nine liters) of water.
	   New Zealander Hillary is the son of Sir Edmund Hillary, the man
who conquered Mount Everest. Peter Hillary has also climbed Mount
Everest, the world's tallest peak.

Hong Kong company sues Lufthansa caterer over shoddy meals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A Hong Kong company is suing Lufthansa's
in-flight caterer for allegedly providing it substandard meals _
including one said to have contained a cockroach, local newspapers
reported Sunday.
	   LSG Lufthansa Service Hong Kong began providing pre-cooked box
lunches this summer to Nutritional Food Production Ltd., which
supplies lunches to elementary and high schools, Chinese-language
Ming Pao said.
	   But the meals delivered were too small and of ``substandard or
unacceptable quality'' according to a High Court document filed
against the German-based caterer, the paper said. Some contained
sand, pencil lead and wood chips, and a cockroach was found in one
meal, it said.
	   Officials at the caterer were not available for comment Sunday.
	   Nutritional Food Production claimed it had lost contracts
totaling 11 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 5.6 million), the
report said. It is seeking 3.3 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
423,000) in estimated lost gross profits and an unspecified amount
in damages, it said.

Top-ranked Tennessee remains on course for Fiesta Bowl
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with USC-Notre Dame &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _Tennessee moved one step closer to a shot at the
national title.
	   Tee Martin threw for a touchdown and ran for another as the
top-ranked Volunteers routed Vanderbilt 41-0 Saturday.
	   If Tennessee (11-0, 8-0 Southeastern Conference) beats
Mississippi State in the SEC title game next weekend, the Vols will
probably get to play for the national championship in the Fiesta
Bowl.
	   The Vols are currently No. 1 in the Bowl Championship Series
rankings, ahead of two other undefeated teams, UCLA and Kansas
State. The top two teams in the BCS standings will meet in the
Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4.
	   ``They're a well-deserving No. 1,'' Vanderbilt coach Woody
Widenhofer said of the Vols. ``In the four years that I've been
here, this is the toughest team they've had.''
	   UCLA and Kansas State each have a game left next Saturday. The
Bruins play at No. 19 Miami, while Kansas State meets No. 6 Texas
A&AMP;M for the Big 12 championship in St. Louis.
	   Tennessee intercepted four passes, recovered two fumbles and
converted those turnovers into 24 points to beat Vanderbilt (2-9,
1-7) for the 16th straight time.
	   ``I don't think we did anything wrong out of here today,'' said
Tennessee receiver Peerless Price, who caught seven passes for 181
yards, including a 67-yard touchdown.
	   After struggling to score against Vandy the past three seasons,
Tennessee finally got on track with 17 points in the second quarter
for a 20-0 halftime lead.
	   In other Top 25 games, it was Southern California 10, No. 9
Notre Dame 0,; No. 17 Georgia Tech 21, No. 12 Georgia 19; No. 16
Virginia 36, No. 20 Virginia Tech 32; No. 21 Syracuse 66, No. 19
Miami 13; and No. 23 Penn State 51, Michigan State 28.
 &UR; USC 10, No. 9 Notre Dame 0 &QC; 
	   At Los Angeles, Chad Morton rushed for 100 of his 128 yards in
the second half, and the USC defense was at its best against the
Irish.
	   The game was scoreless until freshman quarterback Carson Palmer
scored the first touchdown of his career on a 2-yard bootleg,
capping a 64-yard, five-play drive on USC's second possession of
the third quarter. Adam Abrams kicked a 23-yard field goal 3:18
later to complete the scoring.
	   The win was the third straight for USC (8-4) over Notre Dame
(9-2) after the Irish went 12-0-1 against the Trojans from 1983-95.
It was the first time USC (8-4) has blanked Notre Dame since
winning a 25-0 decision en route to the national championship in
1962.
	   Notre Dame, playing without injured quarterback Jarious Jackson,
committed five turnovers four on interceptions.
 &UR; No. 17 Georgia Tech 21, No. 12 Georgia 19 &QC; 
	   At Athens, Ga., Brad Chambers kicked a 35-yard field goal with
two seconds remaining as Georgia Tech (9-2) ended a seven-year
losing streak against Georgia (8-3).
	   The Yellow Jackets, co-champions of the Atlantic Coast
Conference, had not beaten Georgia since 1990, losing the last
three years by a combined margin of 13 points.
	   Joe Hamilton, who committed three turnovers, redeemed himself by
directing a nine-play, 52-yard drive that set up the second field
goal of the game by Chambers. The Bulldogs called two straight
timeouts hoping to distract Chambers, who earlier had missed a
37-yarder. But his final kick sailed straight down the middle.
 &UR; No. 16 Virginia 36, No. 20 Virginia Tech 32 &QC; 
	   At Blacksburg, Va., Ahmad Hawkins caught a 47-yard TD pass from
Aaron Brooks with 2:01 remaining to cap a big second-half comeback
by Virginia.
	   The Cavaliers, who overcame a 29-7 halftime deficit, marched 93
yards in six plays for the winning score.
	   Virginia (9-2) is going to the Peach Bowl, while Virginia Tech
(8-3) is still waiting for a bowl bid. Officials from the Music
City and Gator bowls were among those on hand.
 &UR; No. 21 Syracuse 66, No. 19 Miami 13 &QC; 
	   At Syracuse, N.Y., Donovan McNabb ran for three touchdowns and
threw for two as the Orangemen won the Big East title and earned a
berth in the Bowl Championship Series.
	   Syracuse (8-3, 6-1), which will play in the Orange Bowl or Sugar
Bowl, scored the most points against Miami (7-3, 5-2) since the
Hurricanes lost to the Orangemen 56-16 in 1970.
	   It was Miami's second-largest margin of defeat behind a 70-14
loss to Texas A&AMP;M in 1944.
 &UR; No. 23 Penn St. 51, Michigan St. 28 &QC; 
	   At State College, Pa., Eric McCoo rushed for 206 yards, and
David Macklin and Anthony King returned interceptions for
touchdowns as Penn State strengthened its case for an eighth
straight Jan. 1 bowl.
	   McCoo also scored a touchdown and Travis Forney kicked a
career-high five field goals for the Lions (8-3, 5-3 Big Ten), who
have a chance to go to the Outback Bowl after finishing their home
schedule unbeaten for the first time since 1994.
	   Michigan State (6-6, 4-4) didn't qualify for a bowl despite
victories over Notre Dame and then-No. 1 Ohio State.

Top-ranked Tennessee remains on course for Fiesta Bowl
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Michigan-Hawaii &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Tennessee moved one step closer to a shot at the
national title.
	   Tee Martin threw for a touchdown and ran for another as the
top-ranked Volunteers routed Vanderbilt 41-0 Saturday.
	   If Tennessee (11-0, 8-0 Southeastern Conference) beats
Mississippi State in the SEC title game next weekend, the Vols will
probably get to play for the national championship in the Fiesta
Bowl.
	   The Vols are currently No. 1 in the Bowl Championship Series
rankings, ahead of two other undefeated teams, UCLA and Kansas
State. The top two teams in the BCS standings will meet in the
Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4.
	   ``They're a well-deserving No. 1,'' Vanderbilt coach Woody
Widenhofer said of the Vols. ``In the four years that I've been
here, this is the toughest team they've had.''
	   UCLA and Kansas State each have a game left next Saturday. The
Bruins play at No. 19 Miami, while Kansas State meets No. 6 Texas
A&AMP;M for the Big 12 championship in St. Louis.
	   Tennessee intercepted four passes, recovered two fumbles and
converted those turnovers into 24 points to beat Vanderbilt (2-9,
1-7) for the 16th straight time.
	   ``I don't think we did anything wrong out of here today,'' said
Tennessee receiver Peerless Price, who caught seven passes for 181
yards, including a 67-yard touchdown.
	   After struggling to score against Vandy the past three seasons,
Tennessee finally got on track with 17 points in the second quarter
for a 20-0 halftime lead.
	   In other Top 25 games, it was Southern California 10, No. 9
Notre Dame 0; No. 15 Michigan 48, Hawaii 17; No. 17 Georgia Tech
21, No. 12 Georgia 19; No. 16 Virginia 36, No. 20 Virginia Tech 32;
No. 21 Syracuse 66, No. 19 Miami 13; and No. 23 Penn State 51,
Michigan State 28.
 &UR; USC 10, No. 9 Notre Dame 0 &QC; 
	   At Los Angeles, Chad Morton rushed for 100 of his 128 yards in
the second half, and the USC defense was at its best against the
Irish.
	   The game was scoreless until freshman quarterback Carson Palmer
scored the first touchdown of his career on a 2-yard bootleg,
capping a 64-yard, five-play drive on USC's second possession of
the third quarter. Adam Abrams kicked a 23-yard field goal 3:18

It was the first time USC (8-4) has blanked Notre Dame since
winning a 25-0 decision en route to the national championship in
1962.
	   Notre Dame, playing without injured quarterback Jarious Jackson,
committed five turnovers four on interceptions.
 &UR; No. 15 Michigan 48, Hawaii 17 &QC; 
	   At Honolulu, Anthony Thomas ran for 104 yards and three scores
in the first half, and Tom Brady threw two touchdown passes to Tai
Streets _ also in opening 30 minutes _ as Michigan routed Hawaii.
	   The Wolverines (9-3) kept their hopes of landing a good bowl
berth intact, and extended the Rainbows' losing streak to 18 games,
currently the longest in the nation. Hawaii's 0-12 record also
matches college football's worst single-season mark, by Colorado
State in 1981.
	   Thomas finished with 13 carries for 183 yards. Brady, replaced
by freshman Drew Henson late in the first half, completed 9-of-10
passes for 142 yards. Streets had five catches for 90 yards.
 &UR; No. 17 Georgia Tech 21, No. 12 Georgia 19 &QC; 
	   At Athens, Ga., Brad Chambers kicked a 35-yard field goal with
two seconds remaining as Georgia Tech (9-2) ended a seven-year
losing streak against Georgia (8-3).

by Virginia.
	   The Cavaliers, who overcame a 29-7 halftime deficit, marched 93

One-thousand cellists gather in Kobe for earthquake benefit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos
 &UR; By ERIC TALMADGE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KOBE, Japan (AP) _ In what organizers said was the largest
concert of its kind ever held, more than 1,000 cellists gathered
here Sunday to raise funds for continuing efforts to rebuild this
city from the earthquake that devastated it in 1995.
	   Prince Takamado, Emperor Akihito's cousin, and his three
daughters were among the 1,013 cellists who played in the concert,
held before an audience of about 3,500.
	   ``I thought this was a wonderful idea from the start and I
volunteered to help right away,'' the prince said. ``But I was
worried that we would not be able to get 1,000 cellists together.''
	   Organizers said cellists from all over Japan, Germany, Brazil,
Ireland, Switzerland, the United States, China and England played
in the concert. Their ages ranged from four years old to 87.
	   ``It was a great pleasure for me to be a part of this,'' said
office worker Hiroaki Oikawa, who plays cello in an amateur
orchestra in Nara, a city in western Japan. ``I hope in some way we
are helping the people of Kobe.''
	   The 1995 earthquake was one of the worst in modern Japanese
history. More than 6,000 people were killed, and much of the city
was either destroyed by the jolt or consumed by fires that spread
immediately afterward.
	   Takumi Matsumoto, a cellist and the main organizer of Sunday's
concert, survived the Kobe quake, but suffered a broken rib. He
said that although the city has made a great deal of progress
toward rebuilding itself, it still has a long way to go.
	   ``We hoped that by holding the concert here, instead of Tokyo,
we could focus attention on our city again,'' he said. ``As a
citizen of Kobe, I think that is important.''
	   Featured in the concert was Rudolf Weinsheimer, a former cellist
with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra who organized a similar but
smaller cello performance in Germany several years ago.
	   ``I am very pleased with the outcome,'' he said. ``The
performance exceeded my expectations.''

China building longest bridge on Yangtze River
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China is building its longest bridge over its
longest river, the Yangtze.
	   The 2.6 billion yuan (dlrs 314 million) bridge under intensive
construction in the city of Wuhu, in eastern China's Anhui
province, will have a 6-kilometer-long (4-mile-long) highway
section and a 10-kilometer-long (six-mile-long) train section, the
state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Sunday.
	   When it goes into operation in 2000, it will shorten the route
between Beijing and Xiamen, a special economic zone on the
southeastern coast, by 800 kilometers (500 miles).
	   The government is increasing spending on infrastructure to keep
the overall economic growth rate strong.
	   The nation's total investment in the first nine months of this
year was 1.1 trillion yuan (dlrs 131 billion), an increase of 20

 &UR; Throwing a banquet, Thai town says thanks to its monkeys
 &UR; By DAVID LONGSTREATH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOPBURI, Thailand (AP) _ With big appetites and their own
version of table manners, hundreds of monkeys got their annual
reward Sunday for bringing good fortune to this central Thailand
town _ a feast served up on red table cloths.
	   Scooting down from their perches in ancient temples, squads of
simians descended upon a dozen banquet tables to grab noodles,
popcorn, mangoes, papayas, nuts and soft drinks.
	   While the macaques appeared to have learned little etiquette of
sit-down dinners in the 10 years since the feast started, a certain
method in the monkey madness emerged.
	   Rather than overwhelm the tables, aggressive males helped
themselves to the chow first, followed by shyer mothers and their
babies.
	   Older, experienced types plopped themselves casually at the
center of tables, confidently stuffing themselves, while youngsters
would grab a few handfuls from the plates and eat either on the run
or crouched under a table.
	   By day's end, hundreds of monkeys were fed at two sittings
within Lopburi's Three Pagoda Compound, watched by thousands of
tourists and townsfolk who joined in the merriment while keeping a
respectful distance from the diners.
	   Leading the locals was monkey magnate Yongyuth Kitwatananusont,
the 57-year-old son of impoverished Chinese immigrants who suddenly
experienced good fortune when they moved to the town.
	   Yongyuth ascribed it to the monkeys, resident in the town for
centuries and traditionally regarded as luck-bringing despite their
habit of snatching food from passers-by and food stalls.
	   Proving there was no business like monkey business, Yongyuth
dreamed up the simian feast idea a decade ago. While he makes
little or no money from the actual event, tourists crowd the hotels
and stores he owns in the town, 115 kilometers (71 miles) north of
Bangkok.
	   He hopes to attract a steady flow of visitors by 2000, when he
expects to have opened what he says will be the largest monkey
theme park in the world, on 40 acres (16 hectares) of land in
Lopburi.
	   He promises it will be a year-round primate paradise.

Communist, Muslim guerrillas agree to defend southern camps
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Muslim and communist rebels have an
agreement to jointly defend each others' camps against military
offensives in southern areas of the Philippines, a Muslim rebel
leader said Sunday.
	   Al Haj Murad, vice chairman of the separatist Moro Islamic
Liberation Front, said the informal agreement has been forged in
recent years and covers areas in the southern Mindanao region where
the rebel groups maintain camps in close proximity.
	   Though no other alliances among the rebel groups exist, they are
open to discussing possible cooperation on certain political
campaigns, such as jointly campaigning against abusive landlords,
Murad said.
	   ``It's practical for us to cooperate in areas where our camps
are near each other,'' Murad said.
	   The MILF is the largest Muslim rebel group battling the Manila
government to establish a separate Islamic state in Mindanao, the
traditional homeland of the country's Muslim minority. It claims to
have 13 major and 29 minor camps all over Mindanao.
	   Murad said the MILF forged the agreement with both the New
People's Army, the armed wing of the Communist Party of the
Philippines, and a breakaway faction, called the Revolutionary
Proletarian Army-Alex Boncayao Brigade. Both have a presence in
Mindanao.
	   The Philippine government has been separately holding peace
talks with the MILF and the CPP.
	   Murad said the main communist party has camps in at least three
Mindanao provinces while the RPA-ABB rebels have a significant
rebel presence on the Zamboanga Peninsula, also in Mindanao.
	   At least once in 1996, MILF and RPA-ABB rebels jointly fought
back government troops during a military offensive in a hinterland
Zamboanga area where both rebel groups maintain camps, Murad said.
	   Military officials have said they are aware of the tie-up
between the communist and Muslim rebels and are monitoring both
groups.
	   The RPA-ABB broke off from the mainstream communist party in
1993 due to differences in ideology and tactics for carrying out
the guerrilla war.
	   At their peak in the mid-1980s, communist guerrillas numbered
more than 25,000 and operated in the Manila area and two-thirds of
the country's 76 provinces. But their ranks have thinned due to
battle casualties, surrenders and factionalism.

Search for lawmaker's killers turns up criminal activity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The search for the killers of a prominent Russian
lawmaker has turned up a wide range of criminal activity, but no
suspects, a news agency reported Sunday.
	   The Nov. 20 killing of Galina Starovoitova, a liberal member of
Russia's parliament, is believed to have been a contract hit and
police are concentrating their search for witnesses in known
criminal haunts, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Over the weekend, police in St. Petersburg, where the killing
took place, raided hundreds of night clubs, casinos, and markets in
their search for possible suspects in the killing of Starovoitova,
the news agency said.
	   Police arrested 324 people on suspicion of various crimes, but
the raids did not turn up any suspects in the slaying of
Starovoitova, the report said. About 50 of those arrested were
wanted by police.
	   The officers confiscated 55 firearms, 144 rounds of ammunition
and 500 grams (18 ounces) of narcotics. They also found 20 stolen
cars during traffic stops of thousands of automobiles, ITAR-Tass
said.
	   Similar raids will continue nightly while the investigation is
underway, the report said.
	   On Saturday, the country's prosecutor general said detectives
were making headway in their investigation into the killing, and
are hoping to track down witnesses.
	   Yuri Skuratov said in a television interview that detectives are
poring over material evidence left at the scene, and that they are
close to finding people ``who could have witnessed this crime,''
according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Starovoitova was one of the most prominent victims of violence
in post-Soviet Russia, and her death has rallied liberal forces in
the country and prompted numerous calls to crack down on
lawlessness and violence.

Leaney wins in playoff
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Australian golfer Stephen Leaney beat
American Corey Pavin on the first sudden-death playoff hole Sunday
to win the ANZ Players Championship at Royal Queensland.
	   Leaney shot a closing five-under-par 68 to catch 1995 U.S. Open
champion Pavin (69) at 17-under 275, then parred the first playoff
hole when Pavin made bogey.
	   The win capped an emotional week for Leaney, who missed his U.S.
PGA Tour card in California.
	   Three Australians _ David McKenzie, Peter O'Malley and Richard
Backwell _ were tied for third, four strokes back of Leaney and
Pavin. (djp)

Attorney General Ghalib: Suharto to be interrogated soon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Attorney General Andi Mohamad Ghalib
has reconfirmed that his office will soon interrogate ex-President
Suharto over alleged corruption.
	   ``There is no intention on the part of the government to delay
the probe into the Cendana family and their cronies,'' Ghalib was
quoted as saying Sunday by the official Antara news agency.
	   Cendana refers to the street in Jakarta where Suharto lives.
	   Ghalib called on the people to be patient and not to try to
force the outcome of the probe.
	   ``I have no intention to buy time in the investigation ... into
the wealth of the Cendana family based on the existing laws,
although the case was loaded with political connotations,'' Ghalib
said.
	   Suharto, 77, who had ruled the country with an iron hand since
1966, resigned in May amid widespread student protests and violence
that claimed about 1,200 lives in Jakarta, the capital.
	   Critics have accused him of siphoning off state wealth to
benefit his family's business empires.
	   Students have been staging almost daily protests demanding
Suharto be tried. Police and soldiers heavily guard his residence
in an affluent neighborhood, and have blocked protesters from
breaking in several times.

Congolese rebel leaders says no cease-fire without fighters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABALO, Congo (AP) _ The Congolese rebel leader said Sunday no
cease-fire will be possible without him, and vowed to continue
fighting President Laurent Kabila until he negotiates peace
directly with the insurgents.
	   ``In principle, we are supporting cease-fire initiatives
followed by political negotiations,'' Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said.
``But without us, no cease-fire is possible. Who is going to
implement it?''
	   On Saturday, presidents of Rwanda, Uganda, Zimbabwe and Congo
meeting in Paris said they had agreed to a truce which is to be
signed at Congolese peace talks starting on Dec. 9 in Lusaka,
Zambia.
	   The rebels were not invited to the Paris talks, which included
African heads of state.
	   So far, Kabila has refused to negotiate directly with the
rebels, instead demanding that Rwanda and Uganda first end their
support for the insurgents and leave Congo. Both countries have
said they will stay as long as Congo remains unstable and an
agreement is reached between the rebels and Kabila.
	   Zimbabwe, Angola, Chad and Namibia have sent troops, tanks and
jet fighters to prop up Kabila.
	   On Sunday, the southern front line at Kabalo, 300 kilometers
(185 mile) south of rebel eastern stronghold at Goma, remained
quiet. Zimbabwean war planes combed the skies, sending the rebels
to take cover in abandoned huts and thick forest.
	   There were no attacks.
	   Wamba, who was speaking from Bunia on the border with Uganda,
said he welcomed the commitments to a cease-fire, but added they
can succeed only if the rebels are included and if Kabila agrees to
talk to them.
	   ``We don't want to waste any more lives,'' he said. ``But the
cease-fire can be successful only if all the belligerents are
included. And that includes us.''
	   He said he was not consulted about the agreement in reached
Paris, which was achieved under auspices of U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan.

Attacks kill four in runup to Ramadan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A highway bombing and an attack at a
fake police roadblock left three people dead and two injured, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks,
but suspicion fell on Muslim militants waging a nearly 7-year-old
insurgency against the military-backed government.
	   Militants posing as police at a mountain roadblock near Ain
Defla, 100 kms (60 miles) west of Algiers, opened fire on a vehicle
Friday, killing two people, the independent El Watan said.
	   The bomb Friday, planted in a roadway near the mountain town of
Chlef, 150 kms (90 miles) west of Algiers, exploded under a
horse-drawn cart carrying a couple and their child, El Watan said.
	   The blast killed the father and gravely injured the mother and
child, the paper said. Three days earlier, a similar blast in the
same area killed two people and injured two others.
	   Meanwhile, security forces broke up a ring of about a dozen
hospital workers in the eastern town of Constantine who were
providing militants with medicine and transport, El Watan said.
	   During an offensive over the past several months, the army has
encircled and attacked militant strongholds.
	   Militant attacks have waned, though authorities were bracing for
the holy month of Ramadan that begins in mid-December. In past
years, the insurgency has flared up during that period.
	   More than 75,000 people have died since the government canceled
January 1992 elections the Islamic Salvation Front was expected to
win amid voter anger with high unemployment and corruption in this
petroleum-rich North African nation.

El Condor Pasa wins Japan Cup, Canada's Chief Bearhart fourth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FUCHU, Japan (AP) _ El Condor Pasa, a three-year-old Japanese
colt, won the Japan Cup thoroughbred horse race Sunday, beating
eight Japanese and six foreign horses, led by Canada's Chief
Bearhart.
	   It was the first victory in the race by a Japanese horse in four
years.
	   A crowd of more than 138,000 fans watched El Condor Pasa, the
third favorite, make a dash over the final two furlongs to beat out
14 other horses on the 2,400-meter (1 1/2-mile) turf track at the
Tokyo Racecourse on the western outskirts of Tokyo.
	   El Condor Pasa, ridden by Japanese jockey Masayoshi Ebina, won
the race in two minutes, 25.9 seconds, behind the Japan Cup record
of 2:22.2 set by Horlicks of New Zealand in 1989.
	   El Condor Pasa received first prize money of 132 million yen
(dlrs 1.1 million). The horse returned 600 yen (dlrs 5) to win on a
bet of 100 yen (83 cents).
	   Second favorite Air Groove, a five-year-old Japanese mare and
runner-up in last year's race, was 2 1/2 lengths back in second
place. Top favorite Special Week, a three-year-old Japanese colt,
was third a half length back.
	   Air Groove collected 53 million yen (dlrs 442,000) and Special
Week earned 33 million yen (dlrs 275,000).
	   Chief Bearhart, the 1997 winner of the Sovereign Award as
Canadian horse of the year and the 1997 U.S. Eclipse Award winner
for champion turf male, was fourth in 2:26.7, or two lengths behind
Japanese horse Special Week. Chief Bearhart received 20 million yen
(dlrs 167,000).
	   Chief Bearhart, a 5-year-old horse ridden by American jockey
Jose Santos, made a dash in the last furlong but could not catch up
with the Japanese horses.
	   Other foreign horses were from the United States, England and
Germany.
	   Maxzene, a five-year-old American mare ridden by French jockey
Cash Asmussen, finished fifth.
	   Faithful Son, a 4-year-old gelding from England and ridden by
Italian jockey Lanfranco Dettori, was seventh.
	   Caitano, a 4-year-old colt from Germany and ridden by French
jockey Olivier Peslier, came in 11th, while Ungaro, a 4-year-old
colt from Germany and ridden by German jockey Terence Hellier,
finished 12th.
	   Luso, a 6-year-old horse from England and ridden by Irish jockey
Michael Kinane, was 15th.

Pakistan totters at 44 for six
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan was hopelessly placed at 44
for six in its second innings at lunch after Zimbabwean medium fast
Henry Olonga claimed three wickets in the space of 10 deliveries on
the third day of the first cricket Test Sunday.
	   Pakistan, which got a vital 58-run first innings lead, is now
overall 102 runs ahead with unfit Saeed Anwar batting on eight and
Wasim Akram yet to get off the mark.
	   In a dramatic opening session in which nine wickets fell,
Olonga's sensational opening spell saw the Pakistan procession
starting as early as in the second over when skipper Aamir Sohail
was caught by the right-arm paceman off his own bowling.
	   Azhar Mahmood, who opened the innings as Anwar was down with
influenza, and Inzamamul Haq (2) were his other victims. Mpumelelo
Mbangwa then further reduced the home team by taking two wickets in
five balls when he bowled Moin Khan (6) and Yousuf Youhanna (14),
the only batsman, who has so far crossed the double figures.
Mbangwa has taken two wickets for eight while Olonga has three for
19.
	   Earlier, Zimbabwe was bowled out for 238 in reply to Pakistan's
296 after resuming at the overnight total of 218 for seven. Akram
took his 22nd five-wicket haul in Test cricket and finished with
5-52.
	   Akram joined the 350-wicket Test club when he got rid of
overnight batsman Neil Johnson off the second ball of the day after
Zimbabwe resumed at 218 for seven.
	   The left-arm paceman became only the eighth Test cricketer after
Kapil Dev (434), Richard Hadlee (431), Ian Botham (383), Courtney
Walsh (379), Malcolm Marshall (376), Imran Khan (362) and Dennie
Lillee (355) to cross the 350-wicket mark.
	   Mahmood, who dropped the left-hander on 99 Saturday evening off
Akram, this time caught on the second attempt at second slip which
gave Akram his 350th scalp in 82nd Test match. Johnson's (107)
maiden century in only his second Test included 16 fours before he
was out at the overnight score of 107.
	   Waqar Younis, in his comeback match after missing the Test
series against Australia, ended up with four for 78.

Muslim party opens national congress in Jakarta

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Muslim-based United Development
Party opened a national convention Sunday to elect a new chairman
to lead the opposition group into multiparty elections next year.
	   Waving its signature green flags, more than 110,000 party
members and supporters gathered inside the soccer stadium at
Jakarta's Senayan sports complex as Ismail Hasan Metareum, the
party's current chairman, kicked off the four-day congress.
	   ``We call on President (B.J.) Habibie to carry out the general
election in time and not to repeat the mistakes by two previous
presidents,'' Matareum said in his opening speech, calling for
``honest and fair'' general elections.
	   Habibie had earlier planned to open the congress but canceled
his appearance without offering a clear explanation.
	   Representatives from 27 provinces and 330 districts are taking
part in the party's fourth convention, which lasts through
Wednesday. Deliberations are to be held on the eastern outskirts of
the capital.
	   The party, known as the PPP, was set up in January 1973 as a
fusion of four Islamic political parties. Some of the four,
however, have set up their own parties for next year's polls.
	   Matareum cited bureaucracy and anarchism as the two main threats
faced by the nation during its transition period from the
dictatorship of former President Suharto.
	   Suharto, 77, resigned in May _ just two months after being
elected to a seventh five-year term _ amid violence and widespread
protests against his 32-year authoritarian rule. He was succeeded
by Habibie, his vice president. Suharto had succeeded Sukarno,
Indonesia's founding president.
	   The PPP gained 89 of the 425 seats in Parliament in the 1997
general election. The ruling Golkar party, the main vehicle of
former autocrat Suharto, won 325 while the minor Indonesian
Democratic Party picked up 11 seats in the 500-seat Parliament.
	   The country's highest legislative body has decided that the next
general elections should be held in May or early June next year
under new political laws that allow many more parties competing for
550 seats.
	   The main contenders for the party chairmanship are Hamzah Haz
and A.M. Saefuddin, both Cabinet ministers under Habibie's reform
administration.
	   Party supporters marched in small scattered groups along streets
in the capital after the opening ceremony but there were no reports
of violence.
	   Indonesia has been hit by renewed political violence in recent
days as student demonstrators have demanded Suharto be put on
trial. On Nov. 13, nine protesting students were shot dead by
Indonesian troops.

Leaney beat Pavin in playoff
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: adds quotes, new material throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Australian golfer Stephen Leaney used
his putter like a magic wand to catch and then defeat American
Corey Pavin in a sudden-death playoff Sunday in the ANZ Players
Championship at Royal Queensland.
	   Leaney finished with seven successive one-putts between 10 and
40 feet in a stunning homeward nine of five-under-par 32, reeling
in Pavin who seemingly had him beat with a three-shot lead with six
holes to play.
	   Leaney started his charge with birdies at the 11th, 13th, 14th
and 16th then drilled a spectacular four-iron into the 17th green
for an eagle to catch the American.
	   Having carded a five-under 68 to tie Pavin (69) at 17-under 275,
he sealed his victory by sinking a pressure seven-foot par putt on
the first playoff hole after Pavin bogeyed.
	   A two-time winner in Europe this year and 11th on that tour's
money list, Leaney blocked out the disappointment of missing his
U.S. Tour card at the qualifying school in California earlier this
week to wear down Pavin.
	   ``Stephen just made everything,'' said Pavin. ``I can't think of
a putt he missed today. His back was the the wall coming down the
stretch and he performed admirably.''
	   Peter O'Malley (71-68-69-71) cost himself outright second after
leaving a seven-foot par putt inches short on the final hole and
finished tied for third with fellow Australians David McKenzie and
Richard Backwell, four shots behind the leading pair. (djp)

Iraq dailies says U.S., Butler aim to stop review of arms programs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's state-run newspapers on Sunday
accused the United States and the chief U.N. arms inspector of
blocking a review of Iraqi weapons programs in order to maintain
tough economic sanctions on the country.
	   Iraq has argued that chief inspector Richard Butler has demanded
a series of documents from Iraq to block the comprehensive review,
which Iraq maintains would show it has fulfilled U.N. demands to
eliminate its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The daily Babil, owned by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's son
Odai, said the documents issue ``is meant to picture Iraq as not
cooperating with the international community.''
	   The comprehensive review, to be conducted by the U.N. Security
Council, depends on Iraq showing it is fully cooperating with U.N.
arms inspectors since their return to Baghdad in mid-November after
the latest Iraq-U.N. crisis.
	   Iraq has since gone out of its way to picture itself as
cooperative.
	   On Sunday, the Iraqi New Agency quoted the head of the country's
monitoring directorate a saying U.N. inspection teams carried out
15 ``announced and surprise visits'' on Saturday.
	   The visits were carried out by 12 inspection teams using
helicopters in some work, INA quoted Hussam Mohammed Amin as
saying. Amin's group provides the Iraqi escorts for U.N. teams on
their visits to the field.
	   Amin also was quoted as saying a team of nuclear inspectors
collected soil samples from 12 sites around Baghdad. He told INA
that a team of chemical inspectors completed its work and left
Iraq.
	   U.N. officials in Baghdad could not be immediately reached about
Amin's report, but they rarely comment on details of the
inspections.
	   A front-page editorial in the daily Al-Thawra also said the
documents demanded by Butler were an impediment to the Security
Council's promised review.
	   The paper of the ruling Baath Party said that after U.N.
inspectors failed to find weapons that ``do not exist,'' Butler has
``started demanding documents which also do not exist or have no
relations to the disarmament procedures.''
	   After Butler asked for a dozen documents on Iraqi weapons
earlier this month, Iraq said all relevant papers in its possession
had been turned over.
	   The inspectors must certify Iraq's lethal weapons programs have
been ended before trade sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Iraq can be lifted. The sanctions include a ban on free
export of oil, which has ruined Iraq's economy.

Report: Malaysia to get loan from Islamic Development Bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Islamic Development Bank will
provide a 380 million ringgit (dlrs 100 million) loan to aid
Malaysia's economic recovery, an official said Sunday, according to
a news report.
	   The loan was approved at a meeting of the Organization of
Islamic Conference two weeks ago, Bernama News agency quoted Deputy
Finance Minister Affifuddin Omar as saying.
	   ``It is hoped that the loan will lighten the burden of the
government in overcoming the current economic downturn,''
Affifuddin told reporters.
	   The money would be given through local banks which practiced the
Islamic method of financing.
	   Affifuddin said the money would form part of overseas borrowing
to help restore the economy. Foreign loans amount to a third of the
total borrowing by the government for boosting its economy out of a
worsening recession.
	   The latest government statistics say the economy shrank by 8.6
percent in the third quarter of 1998.
	   Malaysia's gross domestic product grew by 7.8 percent in 1997.
This year's contraction is likely to exceed 5 percent.
	   Unlike other Asian nations pummeled by financial turmoil,
Malaysia has rejected the policies of spending cuts and high
interest rates promoted by the International Monetary Fund and
Western governments. It has instead opted to pump more money into
the economy and boost government expenditure.

Egyptian president holds talks with Eritrean leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak met Sunday with his
Eritrean counterpart Isaias Afwerki and discussed ways of ending
Eritrea's border dispute with Ethiopia.
	   Mubarak and Afwerki also talked about ways to expand economic
ties between Egypt and Eritrea, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported. It gave no details.
	   It said the two leaders talked about a possible role for the
Organization of African Unity in reaching a solution to the
Eritrean-Ethiopian conflict.
	   Mubarak had similar talks last week with Ethiopian Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi in Paris on the sidelines of the 20th
French-African summit, where 34 African leaders discussed security
issues.
	   Several hundred people were killed in two weeks of battles in
June between Eritrea and Ethiopia. Since then, there has been a
standoff by troops from both countries along the border, with
sporadic artillery exchanges.
	   Eritrea fought a 30-year war against Ethiopia and gained
independence in 1993. But the border between the two countries has
never been officially delineated.

	   A front-page editorial in the daily Al-Thawra also said the
documents demanded by Butler were an impediment to the Security
Council's promised review.
	   The paper of the ruling Baath Party said that after U.N.
inspectors failed to find weapons that ``do not exist,'' Butler has
``started demanding documents which also do not exist or have no
relations to the disarmament procedures.''
	   After Butler asked for a dozen documents on Iraqi weapons
earlier this month, Iraq said all relevant papers in its possession
had been turned over.
	   The inspectors must certify Iraq's lethal weapons programs have
been ended before trade sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Iraq can be lifted. The sanctions include a ban on free
export of oil, which has ruined Iraq's economy.

Foreign aid to follow formation of Cambodian government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) Impoverished Cambodia looked forward
to the return of desperately needed foreign aid Sunday on the eve
of Prime Minister Hun Sen's presentation of his new Cabinet to
Parliament.
	   Dependent on foreign assistance for half its annual budget,
Cambodia suffered dramatic cuts in aid last year after Hun Sen
ousted his co-prime minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh in a violent
coup.
	   The European Union, which spent dlrs 11 million on a July
election that brought Ranariddh back to Cambodia, welcomed Sunday a
coalition deal between the two rival leaders, saying it would
``consider a full resumption of aid to Cambodia'' once Hun Sen's
government is installed.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party narrowly won the election,
but a political crisis followed the polls when Ranariddh and his
opposition ally, Sam Rainsy, denied Hun Sen the two-thirds vote in
parliament necessary to approve a government.
	   Ranariddh, bowing to what he described as intense international
pressure, broke the stalemate Nov. 13 with a coalition deal that
made the prince president of the National Assembly and gave his
FUNCINPEC party nearly half of the positions in Hun Sen's proposed
Cabinet.
	   The United States, Hun Sen's fiercest critic after the coup,
also applauded the deal and on Sunday sent a State Department
official to Cambodia to meet with the new prime minister. It was
not clear if and when Washington would resume aid.
	   The U.S. Embassy was tightlipped on what one American official
described as a low-key overnight visit to Phnom Penh by Ralph
Boyce, deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific affairs.
	   The embassy would not confirm Boyce's schedule, but the
Cambodian ministry of foreign affairs announced he would meet both
Hun Sen and Ranariddh. He will also call on opposition leader Sam
Rainsy, according to a Sam Rainsy Party spokesman.
	   Hun Sen will present his Cabinet to the National Assembly on
Monday along with a policy statement that is said to promote
widespread economic and administrative reform.
	   Hun Sen's government is certain to be approved by the assembly,
as coalition partners the CPP and FUNCINPEC control a combined 107
seats in the 122-seat legislature.

IAEA director general arrives in Seoul
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Mohamed ElBaradei, director general of
the International Atomic Energy Agency, arrived in Seoul on Sunday
for talks about a suspected underground nuclear site in North
Korea.
	   ElBaradei will meet President Kim Dae-jung, Foreign Affairs and
Trade Minister Hong Soon-young and other government officials
during his four-day visit, the Foreign Ministry said.
	   In discussions earlier this month in Pyongyang, North Korea
rejected a U.S. request for unconditional access to the site,
arguing that the facility is not nuclear-related.
	   North Korea said, however, that it would allow a one-time
inspection of the site if the United State paid it dlrs 300
million. U.S. officials rejected the offer.
	   Both sides are scheduled to meet in New York and Washington in
early December for further talks about the site at Kumchang-ri, 25
miles (40 kilometers) northwest of Yongbyon, the nation's main
nuclear complex.
	   Under a 1994 deal, North Korea agreed to abandon its suspect
nuclear weapons program. In return, it will get two safe nuclear
reactors worth dlrs 4.6 billion and substitute fuel oil and other
economic benefits.

Fleming (9-62) has England facing defeat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stumps score
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Swing specialist Damien Fleming
undermined a remarkable England comeback to have the visitors
facing a comprehensive defeat in the second cricket test at the
WACA on Sunday.
	   Trailing by 128 runs, England, batting the second time, was
teetering on 126 for five at stumps on the second day after
Australia had lost its last six wickets for 39 runs to be bowled
out for 240 just after lunch.
	   England's Alex Tudor, the 21-year old rookie fast bowler, was
the chief wrecker, claiming 4-25 in 21 balls with the second new
ball.
	   But Fleming with 5-46 in the first innings made short work of
the England top order again, and had it facing defeat inside two
days until Mark Ramprakash denied them.
	   Fleming removed Mark Butcher (one), Nasser Hussain (one) and
Alec Stewart (naught) in a 16-ball spell before tea and soon after
ended Mike Atherton's 82-minute defiance to have England struggling
on 40 for four. Atherton scored 35 runs with six fours.
	   But Ramprakash, 26 not out in three hours, survived a boisterous
appeal for a catch behind off Glenn McGrath, to stand between
Australia and a meek English capitulation.
	   Graeme Hick, dismissed for a second-ball duck in the first
innings, spiced up an obdurate England batting lineup with an
unbeaten 42 off 33 balls with four boundaries and two sixes.
	   England was shot out for 112 in 39 overs after being sent in by
Australian skipper Mark Taylor.
	   Taylor's 61 remains the only half century of the test so far.
	   Fleming, 4-16 in a 11-over spell only separated by tea, left the
field four overs after the break with a suspected strain on his
right thigh.
	   Australia, having overcome a testing morning session against
Darren Gough and Alan Mullally, succumbed to the sheer pace of
debutant Tudor.
	   Tudor began the slide with the wickets of the Waugh twins _
Steve (33) and Mark (36) _ in successive overs, and then removed
Ricky Ponting and McGrath in the space of two balls, separated by a
no-ball.
	   In between Gough, the unluckiest bowler with five dropped
catches off his bowling in the slips in two Australian innings in
the series, removed Ian Healy and Fleming with successive balls.
	   Tudor, picked ahead of the experienced Angus Fraser, took his
first wicket in the 18th over, beating Steve Waugh for pace after
the Australian vice-captain had hit him for three successive fours
in the previous over.
	   Tudor finished with the fine figures of 4-89 while Gough took
3-43. (ik/djp)

Striking teachers are paid and set to return to work
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ About 400 teachers in the central Russian region
of Ulyanovsk ended a 10-day hunger strike and will return to work
after officials found money to pay their salaries, a news report
said Sunday.
	   Regional authorities and the mayor's office in the city of
Ulyanovsk drew up a schedule of payments to the teachers, who
agreed to call off their strike and return to work on Monday, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The teachers received about 6 million rubles (dlrs 353,000) in
back wages earlier in the week, the report said.
	   Wage arrears are a chronic problem in Russia, and widespread
failure to pay pensions and salaries on time is one of the
government's largest problems, often resulting in strikes and other
protests.

Opposition leader ridicules Clinton's plan to topple Saddam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Iraqi opposition leader says President
Bill Clinton's plan to give Iraqi dissidents nearly dlrs 100
million to topple Saddam Hussein will not succeed because more than
money is needed to oust the Iraqi leader.
	   Changing the Iraqi regime ``needs real efforts from inside Iraq
and cooperation among the army, tribal people and the effective
Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish powers,'' Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim was
quoted as saying in the Arabic daily Al-Hayat on Sunday.
	   ``We are not waiting for another country to occupy Iraq and
change its regime,'' said Hakim, leader of an Iranian-based Shiite
Muslim group called the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution
in Iraq.
	   Hakim said if ousting Saddam needed only money, ``I would have
begged this money from those who suffered under Saddam and ended
the problem.'' He referred to U.S. plans to provide dlrs 97 million
to opposition groups and dlrs 2 million for anti-Saddam radio
broadcasts into Iraq.
	   Despite his criticism, Hakim sent a representative to talks by
16 opposition groups with British and American officials in London
last week to discuss ways to topple Saddam.
	   Asked why his group participated, Hakim said ``to listen to what
the others say ... and let others hear our ideas and position.''
	   On Saturday, Al-Hayat quoted unnamed opposition sources as
saying Hakim was invited to visit Washington to meet with senior
U.S. officials on Iraq's future.
	   Sources at his office in Tehran neither denied nor confirmed the
report but said ``we will announce our position only when we
receive an official, declared and clear invitation.''

Brian Watts wins Casio World Open, Tiger Woods finishes 15th
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   IBUSUKI, Japan (AP) _ American Brian Watts won the 150 million
yen (dlrs 1.25 million) Casio World Open in a playoff Sunday, while
fellow countryman Tiger Woods, playing in his first Japan PGA tour
tournament, came in 15th.
	   The win was Watts' second this season and his 12th career
victory in Japan.
	   Watts, who started Sunday's final round one stroke behind
Naomichi ``Joe'' Ozaki, shot a four-under-par 68 for a 14-under-par
274 total, tied for first place with Toshimitsu Izawa of Japan.
Izawa also fired a 68 on the 7,105-yard (6,467-meter), par-72
Ibusuki Golf club course.
	   Watts won the playoff on the second extra hole, the 206-yard,
par-3 17th, by sinking a two-meter (6 1/2-foot) birdie putt as
Izawa shot par. Both golfers birdied the first extra hole, the
par-5 18th.
	   Japan's Joe Ozaki shot a 71 to finish third at 276.
	   Watts took home first prize money of 27 million yen (dlrs
225,000) while Izawa earned 13.5 million yen (dlrs 112,500) for
second place.
	   Playing before a gallery of 10,141, Woods, top ranked in the
world, shot a 70 to finish at 284 and a tie for 15th place with
Brandt Jobe of the United States and four Japanese golfers. Among
them was Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki, who leads the Japan PGA money
ranking list with two tournaments left this season.
	   Woods had four birdies and two bogeys in the final round.
	   Jobe shot a 68 and Jumbo Ozaki, the brother of Joe Ozaki, shot a
70.
	   ``I was the worst on my putts today,'' said Watts, who missed
one-meter (three-foot) par putts on the ninth and 17th holes. He
also missed several birdie putts.
	   Paul Stankowski of the United States shot a 67 for a 277 total
good enough for a tie for fourth place with Shigeki Maruyama and
Tsuyoshi Yoneyama, both of Japan. Maruyama shot the day's best
score of 66 while Yoneyama had a 68.

India's Congress Party to wait before final lunge at federal power
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NEELESH MISRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Armed with a huge win in crucial
provincial elections, India's opposition leader Sonia Gandhi said
Sunday her Congress Party was aiming for federal power but would
wait for the shaky ruling coalition to collapse on its own.
	   The Congress Party won enough seats to form governments in three
states _ the central Madhya Pradesh, the western desert province of
Rajasthan, and New Delhi where the federal capital is located. It
lost its government to a regional party in the tiny northeastern
state of Mizoram.
	   The main rivals, Congress and Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party _ went into the election heading
governments in two states each.
	   ``I feel that the message is quite clear. We have gained a lot
of strength, but we have to get down to work,'' Gandhi told the
private STAR television network.
	   But when asked whether her party would seek a vote of
no-confidence against the government when parliament opens Monday,
she added : ``We ought not to rush into certain situations. I
wouldn't like to do so.''
	   The election result has been widely interpreted as a rebuff from
voters for the eight-month-old, 19-party coalition headed by
Vajpayee. Preelection surveys and exit polls showed voters were
angry with the government mainly over soaring prices of vegetables
and food grains.
	   The BJP setback was expected to increasing already prominent
strains within the ruling coalition, but several of the party's
partners shrugged off the possibility after the results were
announced.
	   Top decision-makers of the two parties were scheduled to meet
Sunday evening to decide their future strategy.
	   Admitting defeat for his party, Vajpayee said Saturday voters
appeared to want a change, but added that the results would have no
bearing on the stability of his coalition.
	   Vajpayee's senior colleague in his party, Interior Minister Lal
Krishna Advani, called the results ``disappointing,'' Press Trust
of India reported from the southern city of Madras Sunday.
	   ``The exorbitant rise in the prices of essential commodities has
affected the mood of the people,'' Advani said.
	   ``The mandate is against the price rise and other things,''
coalition partner Mamata Banerjee said in the eastern city of
Calcutta . ``We want the government to be effective and
assertive.''
	   More than 600 seats were contested in the four states in the
balloting Wednesday to choose from about 5,000 candidates from
dozens of political parties.
	   The election was the first electoral test of the BJP since it
came to power this year. It was also expected to be an indicator of
the popularity of the Congress Party's new leader, Sonia Gandhi,
widow of slain former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and torchbearer
of the dynasty that has ruled India for most of its 51 years of
independence.
	   Sonia Gandhi has focused on rebuilding the Congress Party since
she emerged from seclusion early this year to campaign in national
elections. She was later named president of the party that was once
led by her husband, his mother Indira Gandhi, and Indira's father
Jawaharlal Nehru.

Minister: Flooding devastating northern Republic of Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Congo (AP) _ The health minister has called for
urgent international assistance for more than 20,000 people left
homeless by flooding in northern Republic of Congo.
	   Mamadou Dekamo, the minister for health and population, made the
call Saturday during a meeting with reporters to discuss the rains,
which have been falling for the past month in the Likouala region
bordering the Central African Republic.
	   Dekamo said more than 20,000 people had been left homeless, with
all their possessions swept away. He estimated the damage at more
than dlrs 500,000.
	   The heavily forested Likouala region, one of the most isolated
areas in central Africa, is largely made up of small villages that
are only accessible by boat. About 80,000 people are believed to
live in the region.
	   Republic of Congo, which was devastated by a 1997 civil war, is
struggling to replace its heavily damaged infrastructure and has
little money for disaster relief.

Victimized by Kosovo conflict, women may achieve gains, too
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Women have clearly suffered from the
conflict in Kosovo. But they may also have achieved something of an
emancipation, forced by circumstances to take on responsibilities
once reserved for men.
	   The traditional patriarchal society among ethnic Albanians, who
make up 90 percent of the people in this poor southern province of
Serbia, was showing cracks even before hostilities broke out with
Serbian security forces.
	   Now, with many of the men off in the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army or in exile abroad, Albanian women find themselves in charge,
and often the men don't like it.
	   One result has been a surge in domestic violence, says Dr. Vjosa
Dobruna, a pediatrician who founded the Center for Protection of
Women and Children in Pristina, the provincial capital.
	   With the help of a network of women around the province, Dobruna
is studying whether women see themselves as mere victims of the
struggle for independence by ethnic Albanians or whether they also
have benefited from their changed roles.
	   ``Then we hope to find out what these women really want, as
opposed to what we think they want,'' Dobruna says in an interview
at her poorly heated center, chair pressed close to an electric
heater, hot cup of coffee in her hands.
	   Albanian society has been changing since 1989, starting when
Serbia ended Kosovo's autonomy and many of the men left in search
of jobs. It changed further with the beginning of open warfare last
February.
	   Rural Albanian women are largely uneducated. Though respected in
a traditional way, they never had decision-making roles in family
or society. With the men working abroad, or off fighting, the women
found themselves with new responsibilities. And when the Serbs
cracked down, destroying homes and entire villages, those
obligations became heavier.
	   ``They take care of the children, the family finances, running
the farms,'' Dobruna says. ``In some cases there are elderly people
in the house.''
	   When the men come back, on annual visits from jobs abroad or
quick stops from the battlefield, many don't like what they find
and physical abuse is often the result, the doctor adds.
	   ``The men came home to an entirely different situation. They
were no longer head of the household. Somebody else was making
decisions. There was a huge change in attitude and men just
couldn't cope with it,'' she says.
	   Dobruna interrupts the interview to meet with two women who have
come to the center with newborn babies. She examines the children
and questions the mothers for her survey.
	   Both women, after 5{ months of wandering from the destroyed
village of Iglarevo, have made their way to Pristina. Their
husbands are somewhere in the hills with rebels.
	   After checking the babies, Dobruna counsels the young mothers
and turns them over to a nutrition specialist.
	   ``We started a workshop on how to stop domestic violence,'' she
continues, back in her office. ``Women became the victims both of
outside violence and domestic violence.''
	   Dobruna hopes to open five more centers as she can find the
money. That may not be easy. Money comes in from charities here and
there _ Women to Women in Sweden, Crabgrass in San Francisco,
several European Union projects _ but has never been easy to find.
	   Dobruna says the first step in educating women is teaching them
they are masters of their bodies, through seminars titled ``My
Body, My Rights.'' Then it's on to issues such as sexually
transmitted diseases and family planning.
	   Beyond sexual freedom, learning about contraception and deciding
for themselves when they will have babies, these women also must be
taught about earning their own incomes, that their work has value
and should be paid, the doctor says.
	   Some have been given sewing machines and now can sell what they
make. If they have chickens, they should be able to keep some of
the money generated from the meat and eggs, Dobruna says.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The Muslim-based United Development
Party opened a national convention Sunday to elect a new chairman
to lead the opposition group into multiparty elections next year.
	   Waving its signature green flags, more than 110,000 party
members and supporters gathered inside the soccer stadium at
Jakarta's Senayan sports complex as Ismail Hasan Metareum, the
party's chairman, kicked off the four-day congress.
	   ``We call on President (B.J.) Habibie to carry out the general
election in time and not to repeat the mistakes by two previous
presidents,'' Matareum said in his opening speech, calling for
``honest and fair'' general elections.
	   Habibie had earlier planned to open the congress but canceled
his appearance. Matareum told reporters afterward that Habibie
decided not to attend in order ``to make the party more
independent.''
	   In Indonesia it has been a tradition for the president to be
invited to open any congress of a political or mass organization.
Habibie, who has been distancing himself from the practices of the
Suharto era, is a member of the ruling Golkar Party.
	   Representatives from 27 provinces and 330 districts are taking
part in the United Development Party's fourth convention, which
lasts through Wednesday. Deliberations are to be held on the
eastern outskirts of the capital.
	   The party, known as the PPP, was set up in January 1973 as a
fusion of four Islamic political parties. Some of the four,
however, have set up their own parties for next year's polls.
	   Matareum cited bureaucracy and anarchism as the two main threats
faced by the nation during its transition period from the
dictatorship of former President Suharto.
	   Suharto, 77, resigned in May _ just two months after being
elected to a seventh five-year term _ amid violence and widespread
protests against his 32-year authoritarian rule. He was succeeded
by Habibie, his vice president. Suharto had succeeded Sukarno,
Indonesia's founding president.
	   The PPP gained 89 of the 425 seats in Parliament in the 1997
general election. The ruling Golkar party, the main vehicle of
former autocrat Suharto, won 325 while the minor Indonesian
Democratic Party picked up 11 seats in the 500-seat Parliament.
	   The country's highest legislative body has decided that the next
general elections should be held in May or early June next year
under new political laws that allow many more parties competing for
550 seats.
	   The main contenders for the PPP chairmanship are Hamzah Haz and
Ahmad Muflih Saefuddin, both Cabinet ministers under Habibie's
reform administration.
	   Party supporters marched in small scattered groups along streets
in the capital after the opening ceremony but there were no reports
of violence.
	   Indonesia has been hit by renewed political violence in recent
days as student demonstrators have demanded Suharto be put on
trial. On Nov. 13, nine protesting students were shot dead by
Indonesian troops.

Israeli Cabinet ministers call for reprisals against Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Cabinet ministers called Sunday for
military strikes against Beirut's power and water supplies in
retaliation for the killing of Israeli soldiers by Islamic
guerrillas in south Lebanon.
	   Seven Israeli soldiers have been killed in the past two weeks by
the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia in the security zone which
Israel occupies in south Lebanon to protect its northern border.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a European trip to
England and Spain to deal with a growing debate in Israel over the
losses in Lebanon and calls for a unilateral Israeli withdrawal.
	   The 12-member Cabinet security committee was to meet Sunday to
hear military and security chiefs report on the Lebanon situation
after Netanyahu returned from visiting soldiers wounded in the
latest fighting.
	   Army and intelligence chiefs, who met Saturday night, were
unanimous in saying withdrawal would be a dangerous gamble unless
Syria, which has 40,000 troops in Lebanon, guarantees that
Hezbollah will not attack the civilian towns in northern Israel
after the withdrawal, Israel radio said.
	   Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, the armed forces chief of staff, said
Friday that unilateral withdrawal would lead to more bloodshed, not
less, and the victims would be civilians as well as soldiers.
	   The ideas of a one-sided pullback has the support of Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon, a former general who was the architect of
the 1982 Lebanon invasion. He has called for a staged withdrawal
from Lebanon but added that the Lebanese government would be held
responsible for preventing Hezbollah attacks from the areas which
Israel has evacuated.
	   Should Lebanon fail to prevent these attacks, Sharon has argued
that the ``rules of the game'' would have to change and that Israel
could target Lebanese power stations, water pumping facilities,
bridges and roads.
	   Other ministers Sunday came out in support of attacks on
civilian facilities in retaliation for the stepped-up guerrilla
campaign. But there was no widespread support for the one-sided
withdrawal in the 18-member Cabinet.
	   ``The way to make them want this is to let Beirut wake up in the
morning without water and electricity and then, believe me, they
(the Lebanese) will send forces (to restrain Hezbollah) and so will
the Syrians,'' said Avigdor Kahalani, the minsiter in charge of the
national police force.
	   He said this would affect Syria as well as the Lebanese because
the Syrians have expanding economic interests in the current
construction boom in Beirut.
	   Hezbollah receives all its arms and other supplies from Iran
through Damascus airport, and it is believed in Israel that the
Syrian forces in Lebanon could stop the Hezbollah attacks if the
Syrian government wished, Kahalani said.
	   Trade and Industry Minister Natan Sharansky said on Israel radio
that Israel should place the responsibility for the Hezbollah
attacks ``not on the guerrillas but on those who send them.''
	   However, there was concern in the armed forces that Israeli air
strikes against power stations and other facilities would lead to
an escalation of the conflict.
	   The defense establishment is not in favor of opening a new front
against Syria in Lebanon, Israel radio reported.
	   Left-wing opposition leaders argue that Syria will never agree
to stop the bloodshed in south Lebanon until Israel agrees to
return the Golan Heights which it captured from Syria in the 1967
Mideast war.
	   Sharon said Sunday that to allow linkage between the Golan and
south Lebanon would make Israeli soldiers in Lebanon and the towns
and villages in northern Israel hostages to Syria.
	   ``Every time Syria demands more and more in the negotiations (on
the Golan) ... they will put pressure by increasing terrorist
activities and attacking the villages, so you have to separate the
two problems,'' he told reporters.

Iranian president presents budget to Parliament for approval
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ With oil prices hovering at 10-year lows,
Iran's president sent a 274 trillion rial (dlrs 91 billion) draft
budget to Parliament Sunday that seeks to compensate for low oil
revenues with a dramatic increase in non-oil exports.
	   In a speech Sunday to Parliament, Mohammad Khatami said that
drawing up the budget was ``not a simple task'' because of sagging
oil revenues, decreasing productivity in other sectors and the need
to create new jobs for young Iranians entering the work force.
	   The proposed budget, for the fiscal year beginning March 21, is
20 percent higher than the current budget, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
	   Compared to the current budget, expected expenditures were 12
percent higher, at 63.2 trillion rials (dlrs 21 billion), while
revenues were 24.5 percent higher, at 92.6 trillion rials (dlrs
30.8 billion).
	   A separate budget for state-owned firms, including banks and
companies, was projected at 184 trillion rials (dlrs 61.3 billion).
	   The amount of the deficit was not immediately clear, but
newspapers projected it at 8.4 trillion rials (dlrs 2.8 billion).
	   Iran faces an expected deficit of dlrs 6.3 billion in the
current year because of the international slump in oil prices.
	   Presenting what amounts to an austerity budget, Khatami hinted
that Iranians, who still suffer the economic effects of the 1980-88
war with Iraq, would have to remain strong if the economy plummets
further.
	   ``The government's great asset is its wise and intelligent
people, who stand firm when inflation, prices and the demand for
jobs is high,'' Khatami said in the speech broadcast live on Tehran
radio.
	   ``For this reason, the administration is not concerned about
social problems at all,'' Khatami said.
	   Iran relies on oil exports for more than 80 percent of its
earnings. But in the draft budget, oil accounts for less than
one-third of expected revenues, while non-oil revenues account for
almost half. Taxes make up around one-third, IRNA reported.
	   The increase in revenue depends on such exports as caviar,
pistachio nuts, carpets and other handicrafts. Iran's efforts to
boost these non-oil exports diversify its economy have been
hampered by red-tape, corruption and a weak infrastructure.
	   Khatami said that the draft budget emphasized spending on
education, culture and social security, IRNA said. He did not
disclose defense spending, which Iran has said is no more than dlrs
850 million per year. Western intelligence sources say it is much
higher.
	   The draft budget, now being debated in the Majlis, or
parliament, is expected to be approved over the next few days.
	   Iran, the second-largest producer within the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, has pledged to cut output by 140,000
barrels per day from February levels to help support global oil
prices. Iran has an OPEC quota of 3.9 million barrels per day.

South Africa squeeze life out of West Indies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE GREEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa put a
stranglehold on the West Indies as they reduced them to 82 for five
wickets at lunch Sunday on the fourth day of the first test at the
Wanderers Stadium.
	   South Africa have a slender seven run lead on the first innings,
so the tourists are 75 ahead on a pitch where it is not easy to
bat.
	   The morning belonged to the South African bowlers, who bowled a
tight line and length to make scoring difficult. It was the Allan
Donald-Shaun Pollock combination which struck early as Pollock
bowled Philo Wallace and Donald trapped Brian Lara for seven.
	   Once that breakthrough was made, it was a question of trying to
strangle the life out of the West Indies batting, which was
hamstrung by the enforced absence of Carl Hooper, who injured
himself while batting in the first innings.
	   Rules dictated that he could only bat at seven, but the West
Indies were disappointed that he even had to come to the crease in
the last over before lunch.
	   It was the discipline of the bowling which led to the wickets
falling. At one stage, David Terbrugge and Jacques Kallis bowled
five consecutive maiden overs at Clayton Lambert and Stuart
Williams.
	   When Williams attempted to break the stranglehold with a drive
though extra cover for four off Terbrugge, the debutante struck two
balls later to have him caught at second slip.

Five policemen killed in attack near Chechnya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) _ Five Russian policemen were shot and
killed Sunday in Dagestan by gunmen who opened fire from across the
border with neighboring Chechnya, a police official said.
	   Another officer was wounded in the attack Sunday morning,
regional police spokesman Magoumed Khanov said. He said the
officers were part of a mobile force on patrol near the Chechen
border when they were ambushed.
	   The southern Russian republic has been plagued by violence
spilling over from Chechnya, which fought a bloody independence war
with Russia in 1994-96, as well as by its own conflicts among
various religious and ethnic groups battling for power.

Mourners turn funeral of bombing victim into anti-terrorism protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DIPOLOG, Philippines (AP) _ Hundreds of mourners joined the
funeral Sunday of a teen-aged disc jockey who died in a bomb
explosion, turning his burial into a protest against terrorism.
	   Carrying placards and wearing black arm bands, more than 1,000
Roman Catholic priests, relatives and friends marched three
kilometers (1.8 miles) through downtown Dipolog City in Zamboanga
del Norte province before heading for a cemetery for the burial of
Dominic Acupiado.
	   Several people have been killed and scores wounded in a wave of
bomb explosions in passenger buses in Dipolog and other key
southern cities. Police suspect Muslim rebels extorting money from
bus companies are behind the bombings.
	   ``Terrorism shouldn't be left for authorities to check alone.
We'll help them,'' said the Rev. Enrico Montano, who led the
protesters. Policemen in patrol cars secured the protesters during
the march.
	   Acupiado was traveling on a bus enroute from Dipolog to Cagayan
de Oro City on Nov. 18 when a homemade bomb, planted near the
gasoline tank, went off inside the bus, injuring and later killing
him and the driver.
	   An hour before the blast, another bomb exploded in a bus
terminal in Dipolog, killing a child and injuring 13 other people.
	   Last October, a homemade bomb also exploded in a passenger bus
in the city, killing a pregnant woman and injuring 24 others,
police said.
	   Police have secured passenger bus and jeep terminals to deter
more bombings. Plainclothes policemen also regularly ride on buses,
local officials said.
	   Dipolog is about 275 kilometers (170 miles) south of Manila.
Separatist Muslim guerrillas are active in Zamboanga del Norte
province.

Attacks kill seven in runup to Ramadan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with seven dead &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Four attacks in the western mountains of
Algeria left seven people dead, newspapers and officials said
Sunday, while security forces sought to prevent a new wave of
violence during the holy month of Ramadan.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks,
but suspicion fell on Muslim militants waging a nearly 7-year-old
insurgency against the military-backed government.
	   Militants posing as police at a mountain roadblock near Ain
Defla, 150 kms (90 miles) west of Algiers, opened fire on a vehicle
Saturday, killing two people, the independent El Watan said.
	   At another fake police roadblock, gunmen shot and killed a
civilian and a member of a local civil defense group overnight
Friday near Khemis Miliana, 110 kms (70 miles) southwest of
Algiers, hospital officials said on customary anonymity.
	   The gunmen beheaded the civil defense member after killing him
in a shootout, the officials said.
	   Two shepherds kidnapped last week were found hanged with their
throats slit in a farm near the town of Ain el Hadjar near Saida,
400 kms (240 miles) southwest of Algiers, the independent daily La
Tribune reported.
	   In the same area, an armed group abducted two other people over
night Thursday, the paper said.
	   A bomb Friday, planted in a roadway near the mountain town of
Chlef, 110 kms (70 miles) west of Algiers, exploded under a
horse-drawn cart carrying a couple and their daughter, El Watan
said.
	   The blast killed the father and seriously injured the mother and
child, hospital sources said. Three days earlier, a similar blast
in the same area had killed two people and injured two others.
	   Meanwhile, security forces broke up a ring of about a dozen
hospital workers in the eastern town of Constantine who were
providing militants with medicine and transport, El Watan said.
	   During an offensive over the past several months, the army has
encircled and attacked militant strongholds.
	   Militant attacks have waned, though authorities were bracing for
the holy month of Ramadan that begins in mid-December. In past
years, the insurgency has flared up during that period.
	   More than 75,000 people have died since the government canceled
January 1992 elections the Islamic Salvation Front was expected to
win amid voter anger with high unemployment and corruption in this
petroleum-rich North African nation.

Dutch prince winds up Russian visit

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Dutch Crown Prince Willem-Alexander, a last-minute
replacement for his mother Queen Beatrix, ended a brief visit to
Russia Sunday.
	   The prince arrived in St. Petersburg Saturday for the
presentation of two cultural projects at the Hermitage museum, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Before leaving for the Netherlands, the prince placed flowers at
the grave of Galina Starovoitova, the member of parliament who was
gunned down in St. Petersburg on Nov. 20.
	   The prince's parents, Queen Beatrix and her husband Claus, were
scheduled to come to Russia for a state visit, but Kremlin
officials asked them to postpone their journey, which was to
include a meeting with President Boris Yeltsin, to give the ailing
president time to recuperate from pneumonia.

German aide hints at prisoner swap with Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany could swap prisoners convicted of an
Iranian-ordered murder in Berlin for a German sentenced to death in
Iran, a German official was quoted Sunday as saying.
	   Germany will not be blackmailed, but it could order the release
of four men held for the 1992 assassination of Kurdish Iranian
dissidents ``for overriding state interests,'' Gerd Poppe, the
Foreign Ministry's human rights commissioner, told the newspaper
Der Tagesspiegel.
	   Iran has suggested in return it could waive the death sentence
of German businessman Helmut Hofer, 56, convicted by a Tehran court
of having sex with an unmarried Iranian woman.
	   ``I don't consider political presents appropriate,'' Poppe said.
``We simply must find a compromise satisfactory for all involved.''
	   Hofer was sentenced in January, when German-Iranian ties were
still recovering from strains caused by the Berlin court ruling
last year implicating senior Iranian officials in the Berlin
slayings.
	   Kazem Darabi, an Iranian secret agent residing in Berlin, is
serving a life sentence for multiple murder in the case, along with
a Lebanese man. Two other Lebanese were convicted as accessories.

The Tractors aim for the comfort zone
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM PATTERSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ Imagine a farmer scratching his head
and wondering what the millennium will bring. Is the family farm
doomed? Is the stock market going to crash? Is science leading us
to utopia or to nuclear devastation?
	   Yes, farmers are as full of angst as the rest of us, says Steve
Ripley, leader of boogie-woogie country band The Tractors.
	   ``Banker got the money/Farmer put it in the ground/Banker goin'
uptown/Farmer goin' down,'' Ripley sings in the song ``Poor Boy
Shuffle,'' which is included on The Tractors' second album,
``Farmers in a Changing World.''
	   The latest album from this rumpled, raspy-voiced guitarist and
farmer's son doesn't offer answers. It just tries to offer a little
musical comfort with its blend of rock 'n' roll and country. And
``Farmers in a Changing World'' is as familiar and satisfying as
that first cup of coffee in the morning.
	   The first single is a catchy, danceable song based on the
children's standard ``Shortenin' Bread.''
	   Ripley turns his limited vocal range to his advantage. When he
croaks out a lyric about being ``The World's Biggest Fool,'' you
believe him. When he mumbles about how Elvis Presley changed his
life in ``The Elvis Thing,'' it rings true.
	   The Tractors _ Ripley, keyboardist Walt Richmond, drummer Jamie
Oldaker, bassist Casey Van Beek and guitarist Ron Getman _
seemingly came out of nowhere in 1994 when they scored a hit with
``Baby Likes to Rock It'' and sold more than 2 million of their
debut album ``The Tractors.''
	   Actually, they came from Tulsa, Oklahoma, where Ripley owns Leon
Russell's old recording studio, The Church. Ripley, 48, learned
recording from Russell and J.J. Cale, and played in Bob Dylan's
band in the 1980s. The other Tractors, all in their 40s and 50s,
have individually played in the bands of Bonnie Raitt, Eric Clapton
and Linda Ronstadt. On ``Farmers in a Changing World,'' Raitt plays
Stratocaster slide guitar on two songs, while former Presley
sidemen James Burton, Scotty Moore and D.J. Fontana sit in on
Ripley's tribute to Elvis.
	   For both Tractor albums, producers and main songwriters Ripley
and Richmond tinkered for years to come up with rootsy, good-time
rock 'n' roll that sounds deceptively casual. Coughs, clatter and
loose chatter start off many of the songs.
	   ``In the Tulsa tradition you record all the time,'' Ripley said.
``Everybody's got a studio. It's not a special event, it's the life
event _ your gig.''
	   The infectious off-the-cuff vibe is the result of painstakingly
recording lots of material, then editing it. And spontaneity rules.
	   It's a system that's not usual in Nashville, where polished
studio musicians crank out songs during tightly structured
three-hour recording sessions, a method that allows most country
stars to produce an album a year.
	   But that's not the way The Tractors work.
	   ``The truth is it takes longer to get enough of those moments of
spontaneity to make a whole record,'' Ripley said. ``But if you get
it right, you have much more passion.''

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ When a celebrity breaks the law, he doesn't
always go to jail.
	   Often, he's sentenced to perform ``community service,'' which
could include staging fund-raising concerts or making anti-this or
anti-that TV commercials.
	   But who benefits? The public or the celebrity?
	   Joe Sixpack breaks the law and he'll be cooling his heels in a
jail cell. Or, if community service hours are assigned, he'll be
pulling weeds or clearing trash on a road crew.
	   There is, however, a parallel universe in Hollywood, where the
suspension of reality transcends into the private world of show
business bad boys.
	   ``The fact is that in the justice system anyone who has a
private attorney is going to do better than someone with a public
defender,'' said a source familiar with the Los Angeles County
Probation Department's community service program.
	   ``When you can afford a dlrs 1,000-an-hour attorney you get a
better shot,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``They work it out with the judge. Sure, celebrities do
better.''
	   Community service sentences handed out by judges generally
involve menial tasks such as cleaning up parks, clearing flood
control channels or joining a road crew with the California
Department of Transportation.
	   ``The judge never suggests exactly what it will be. At the most,
a judge would, say, find an organization you could do community
service for that benefits the community,'' said county courts
spokeswoman Jerrianne Hayslett.
	   The program is administered by the Probation Department, which
refers defendants to a volunteer center. They are then assigned to
tasks with government agencies, shelters or schools, where they
might wind up wiping out graffiti.
	   Show business lawyers work out better deals for their clients,
however.
	   British pop star George Michael was handed a community service
sentence after he pleaded no contest to committing a lewd act in a
Beverly Hills park restroom. A judge ordered the singer to
telephone schools and children's centers to encourage kids to do
charity work.
	   When Tupac Shakur was sentenced to community service, the rapper
satisfied his obligation by staging a concert, with proceeds going
to an organization that benefits disadvantaged youngsters.
	   Christian Slater had to wash police cars, Zsa Zsa Gabor did
paperwork at a women's shelter, figure skater Oksana Baiul appeared
at charity ice shows, actor Martin Lawrence held charity comedy
shows, and singer Bobby Brown appeared in TV public service
announcements about the dangers of drugs.
	   ``The defendant in every case is handled independently,''
Probation Department spokesman Craig Levy said. ``If somebody has
an aptitude or ability that can be used, we'll use it.''
	   Community service programs clearly benefit taxpayers in Los
Angeles County, where there are 80,000 adults on probation.
	   ``You can't put 80,000 people in jail,'' Levy reasoned. ``There
have to be options for judges, how best to make them pay for what
they have done. Community service works well for lightweight
offenders.''
	   Thousands of people are performing community service sentences
each month, and usually it's a physical, sometimes backbreaking,
task. Caltrans gets the majority of community service assignments
for road cleanup.
	   ``It's just like a job. They sign in every day and sign out.
There's a record kept of the hours. If you blow it off, you go to
jail,'' said Levy, noting no-shows are often reassigned to dreaded
Caltrans assignments.
	   ``For you or me, the choice would be simple: Would you rather be
picking up trash in 110 degrees (43 C) or in an air-conditioned
office?''
	   There are rapists, drunken drivers, wife beaters, burglars and
some convicted of assault with a deadly weapon.
	   ``Sometimes I'm frightened, maybe about once a month. But I'm
always nice to them _ tell them I'm here to help you _ and they
settle down,'' said Leticia Cabrera of the Volunteer Center in the
San Fernando Valley.
	   Each month, her office gets about 175 new adult cases and 200
new juvenile cases. Some of them have to perform 1,000 community
service hours that take up to four years to complete.
	   Still, in Ms. Cabrera's nine years at the center, she's never
seen a celebrity walk through the door.
	   Thanks to the pricey entertainment lawyers.
	   Asked if celebrities get special treatment and are coddled, Levy
said: ``You have to look at what's the benefit for the community or
society.''
	   The Probation Department sometimes comes up with a novel way for
celebrities to satisfy community service obligations. Levy said one
high-profile actor, whom he wouldn't name, organized a play at a
juvenile probation camp heavily stocked with gangbangers.
	   ``It taught kids not used to working together to work
together,'' Levy said. ``It taught them to step out of their own
role and put on another face. It was positive for not only the
actor on probation to work with kids he's never worked with but it
was also positive for the kids.''

	   Entertainment highlights during the week of Nov. 29-Dec. 5:
	   65 years ago: ``Dancing Lady,'' Fred Astaire's first film, was
released. Joan Crawford was his dance partner. Astaire played
himself.
	   50 years ago: ``Kukla, Fran and Ollie'' debuted on NBC TV. This
whimsical puppet show became one of television's longest-running
and most loved children's programs.
	   40 years ago: The film, ``Auntie Mame,'' premiered at New York's
Radio City Music Hall. Rosalind Russell gave a tour-de-force
performance.
	   35 years ago: Audrey Hepburn, Cary Grant and Walter Matthau
starred in ``Charade,'' directed by Stanley Donen.
	   25 years ago: Mail-in ticket requests for a Bob Dylan tour went
on sale. At one San Francisco post office, traffic was backed up
for five blocks.
	   Al Pacino played an honest cop in Sidney Lumet's ``Serpico.''
	   And The Who spent the night in a Montreal jail after causing
dlrs 6,000 in damage to a hotel room. The incident inspired John
Entwistle to write the song, ``Cell Block Number Seven.''
	   10 years ago: Leslie Nielsen was the stumbling, stupid detective
in ``The Naked Gun,'' a film based on the TV sitcom, ``Police
Squad.''
	   Michael Landon took his final trip on ``Highway to Heaven'' as
the NBC TV show completed its last day of filming after five
seasons.
	   And the American Civil Liberties Union honored Kirk Douglas for
openly hiring blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo to write his
1960 film ``Spartacus.''
	   Five years ago: Garth Brooks fans trying to buy concert tickets
tied up telephone service in parts of three Midwestern states for
about two hours.
	   One year ago: Paul McCartney agreed to cut scenes containing
full frontal nudity from his new video _ jokingly dubbed ``Hey,
Nude'' _ after learning two British TV networks planned to trim the
footage if he didn't. The scenes from McCartney's video for his
song, ``Beautiful Night,'' showed a man and woman swimming naked in
a river.
	   Garth Brooks' eagerly awaited ``Sevens'' was the United States'
top-selling album in its first week of release, with 897,000 copies
sold.
	   And Kenny G showed he could carry a note _ for 45 minutes and 47
seconds. He made it into the ``Guinness Book of Records'' for the
longest-held note _ an E flat on his saxophone.
	   Spoken five years ago:
	   ``Everybody has a talk show now. On daytime, anybody. And most
of 'em aren't any good. Daytime has become just one big gab bag of
dysfunctional people talking to dysfunctional hosts about their
miserable lives.'' _ Former ``Tonight Show'' host Johnny Carson.
	   Spoken one year ago:
	   ``The extent of my celebrity at this point is, like,
20-year-olds with tattoos at the record store.'' _ Actor Ben
Affleck.
	   ``You look at all the stars, the people. You never figure you're
going to end up on the sidewalk with a star. This is very cool. But
above anything else, it's an honor.'' _ Actor Pierce Brosnan, who
got his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Sutherland, psychologist who wrote of own illness, dies at 71
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Stuart Sutherland, a British psychologist who
turned his own experience of manic depression into his best known
work, has died. He was 71.
	   Sutherland died Nov. 8 at home in Brighton, the south England
town where in 1964 he founded the internationally respected
Laboratory of Experimental Psychology at the University of Sussex.
News reports said he died from a heart attack.
	   Sutherland, who graduated from Cambridge University with degrees
in classics and psychology, wrote a string of academically
impressive publications.
	   But it was his book ``Breakdown,'' first published in 1976, that
had the widest influence.
	   The frank account of his illness, which eventually was
successfully treated with the drug lithium, was the inspiration for
a play, ``Melon,'' by Simon Gray, which ran in London's West End.
The work also broke new ground for airing personal agony.
	   Sutherland described how his illness developed a pattern of
being depressed every summer, when he could do nothing, followed by
hypomania each winter, when he felt tremendous, but endangered his
health and home life with wildly optimistic and extravagant
behavior. He would arrive home, for example, with cases of
expensive champagne.
	   He said his family told him they found him more tolerable when
depressed than when hypomanic.
	   ``At least I would listen to others in my depressions, even if I
did not have much to say myself, while the absolute conviction of
being right and the egocentricity induced by hypomania made it
almost intolerable for others,'' wrote Sutherland.
	   Norman Stuart Sutherland, who was born March 26, 1927, studied
zoology for a doctorate and his work ``Shape Discrimination in
Animals,'' published 1959 by Britain's Experimental Psychology
Society led to an appointment at Oxford University.
	   He was a visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in the early 60s before founding the unit at Sussex
University where he assembled a remarkable team of scientists.
	   His publications included the ``Macmillan Dictionary of
Psychology'' and ``Irrationality: The Enemy Within,'' as well as a
novel, ``Men Change Too.''
	   In 1966 he married Josie Fogden, who survives him with their two
daughters.

Report: Malaysia to resume joint military exercises under Five
</HEADLINE>
Powers

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia announced Sunday it will
resume war games next year under the Five Power Defense Arrangement
with Singapore, the national news agency reported.
	   Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar said officials from Malaysia
and Singapore would work out details next month, the Bernama news
agency said.
	   Malaysia had earlier pulled out from this year's FPDA exercises
at the last minute, blaming costs and the country's economic
difficulties.
	   Malaysia and Singapore's partners in the FPDA are Australia,
Britain, and New Zealand.
	   ``We have gained quite a lot from the joint exercises because of
its interchangeability,'' Syed Hamid said, according to Bernama.
``This exercise gives us exposure to areas that on our own we are
not able to achieve. And for that reason we have decided to
continue,'' he added.
	   The 27-year-old defense arrangement was originally created for
promoting regional security and protecting Malaysia and Singapore
from the threat of communism.
	   Asked if the airspace rule imposed by Malaysia on Singapore's
military aircraft would create problems for both countries, Syed
Hamid said permission would be given during the exercises.
	   ``The airspace rule is normal, we don't want it to be an
obstacle or hindrance to such exercises for the good of both
countries,'' he said.
	   In September, Malaysia abruptly revoked a long standing
agreement allowing Singapore military planes to transit through its
airspace without prior approval, part of a diplomatic wrangle that
has soured relations between the two neighbors.
	   Syed Hamid also said that he had not received reports recently
of Singapore's military aircraft breaching Malaysian airspace.
	   ``If there is no report then it should be considered as a good
development. I shouldn't be trying to look for problems, I think we
should be very happy when there are no reports about it,'' he said.
	   Singapore military aircraft do not need to fly through Malaysian
airspace to proceed to their training grounds and the planes can
land and take off from their air bases by flying over water.
	   Syed Hamid said he had spoken to the British High Commissioner,
or ambassador, about Malaysia's intention to resume its military
exercises under the FPDA, and was given a positive reaction.

	   In the spotlight: Garry Shandling
	    &UR; Image: Always a mix of shy and funny, comedian Garry
Shandling's act consists of self-deprecating humor that paints him
as a neurotic, self-obsessed, lovelorn mess. When his friends talk
about Shandling, the words ``neurotic,'' ``narcissistic'' and
``paranoid'' are often spoken.
	   ``I would never use the word 'happy' when talking about Garry,''
says Chris Thompson, a comedy writer who has known Shandling for
about 20 years.
	    &UR; Personal Stats: Shandling was born in Tucson, Arizona, on Nov.
29, 1949. He was 10 when his older brother died from cystic
fibrosis. ``His death had a huge impact on my life,'' Shandling
says.
	   In 1975, he dropped out of the University of Arizona, where he
was studying electrical engineering, to seek his fortune in show
business.
	   By 1977, he was writing for ``Welcome Back, Kotter'' and
``Sanford and Son.''
	   In the aftermath of a car accident that ruptured his spleen and
smashed his intestines, Shandling decided to follow his dream:
stand-up comedy.
	   Like many young comedians, his routines ran in a fretful vein;
wry, self-deprecating observations about hair loss and nightmarish
dates. (The name of his company is How's My Hair?)
	   In 1986, ``It's Garry Shandling's Show'' premiered on the
Showtime cable network. The TV series was a heightened version of
his real life.
	   Shandling followed up with ``The Larry Sanders Show,'' a
brilliant, lacerating situation comedy about a fictitious TV host
and the emotional and professional complications of his show-biz
life. The show ended its successful run earlier this year after six
seasons.
	   Shandling's mock autobiography, ``Confessions of a Late Night
Talk Show Host,'' parodies celebrity tell-alls. Readers can guess
how much of the book is based on his life.
	    &UR; Quote: ``The whole world is show business now. Everyone wants
to be famous. They think being famous will change their life. I'm
here to tell them that it doesn't.''

	   Here is a summary of news from The Associated Press. Stories
carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items below have
moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's state-run newspapers on Sunday
accused the United States and the chief U.N. arms inspector of
blocking a review of Iraqi weapons programs in order to maintain
tough economic sanctions on the country. Iraq argues that chief
inspector Richard Butler demanded a series of documents from Iraq
to block the comprehensive review, which Iraq maintains would show
it has fulfilled U.N. demands to eliminate weapons of mass
destruction. The daily Babil, owned by Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein's son Odai, said the documents issue ``is meant to picture
Iraq as not cooperating with the international community.'' The
comprehensive review _ and the lifting of sanctions _ depends on
Iraq's full cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors. (IRAQ-UN)
	   KABALO, Congo (AP) _ The leader of Congo's main rebel group said
Sunday no cease-fire will be possible without him, and he vowed to
continue fighting President Laurent Kabila until he negotiates
peace directly with the insurgents. ``In principle, we are
supporting cease-fire initiatives followed by political
negotiations,'' Ernest Wamba dia Wamba said. ``But without us, no
cease-fire is possible. Who is going to implement it?'' On
Saturday, presidents of Rwanda, Uganda, Zimbabwe and Congo agreed
to a truce during a meeting in Paris. It is to be signed at
Congolese peace talks starting Dec. 9 in Lusaka, Zambia. The rebels
were not invited to the Paris talks. So far, Kabila has refused to
negotiate directly with the rebels, instead demanding that Rwanda
and Uganda first end their support for the insurgents and leave
Congo. Both countries have said they will stay as long as Congo
remains unstable. Zimbabwe, Angola, Chad and Namibia have sent
troops, tanks and jet fighters in support of Kabila. (CONGO,
FRANCE-AFRICA-SUMMIT)
	   LONDON (AP) _ The British government is close to reaching a
compromise that would return Gen. Augusto Pinochet home to Chile to
stand trial on human rights charges stemming from his dictatorship,
two newspapers reported in Sunday editions. The Sunday Telegraph
and The Observer, citing unnamed government sources, reported that
the deal is seen as the best way for Britain to avoid potentially
damaging economic and diplomatic fallout from an extradition of the
former dictator to Spain. Spanish authorities want to try Pinochet
for genocide, torture and terrorism. Such a compromise would solve
the dilemma confronting Home Secretary Jack Straw. Many of Straw's
fellow Labor Party members would never forgive him if he let
Pinochet avoid prosecution. At the same time, a trial in Chile
would avoid damage to Britain's trade relations with the South
American country, the newspapers said. (BRITAIN-PINOCHET)
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Armed with a huge win in crucial
provincial elections, India's opposition leader Sonia Gandhi said
Sunday her Congress Party was aiming for federal power but would
wait for the shaky ruling coalition to collapse on its own. The
Congress Party won enough seats to form governments in three states
_ the central Madhya Pradesh, the western desert province of
Rajasthan, and New Delhi where the federal capital is located. It
lost its government to a regional party in the tiny northeastern
state of Mizoram. The main rivals, Congress and Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party _ went into the election
heading governments in two states each. When asked whether her
party would seek a vote of no-confidence against the government
when parliament opens Monday, Ganshi said: ``We ought not to rush
into certain situations. I wouldn't like to do so.''
(INDIA-POLITICS)
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Honduran authorities began
evacuating more than 10,000 people from the northern town of
Choluma out of fear that four days of heavy rains could cause
mudslides. Vice President Billy Handal said the evacuations that
began Saturday could be extended to other towns on Honduras'
Caribbean coast if rains continue as forecast. Already, parts of
Choluma, 125 miles (200 kilometers) north of Tegucigalpa, are
flooded, and the Choluma River has risen 3 feet (about 1 meter)
above its normal levels. Most of the 40,000 residents of the
low-lying parts of Choluma were evacuated last month because of

Book Review: ``Lethal Dose'' by Steven Snodgrass
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAKA TSUNODA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A new medical specialty is born. While other
specialties help patients to live, this one helps them die.
	   Fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on one's point of view,
this is fiction and not reality _ yet.
	   ``Lethal Dose,'' a powerhouse of a novel by Kentucky surgeon
Steven Snodgrass, tells a story of the world's first fellowship
program to train physicians in euthanasia.
	   One of the program's three fellows is Jeff Taylor, who has given
up his surgical career because he damaged his hand in a ski
accident. Predictably, the groundbreaking program at Northwest
Regional's Euthanasia Center becomes a lightning rod for
controversy.
	   Demonstrators chant outside the hospital, ``Stop the murder!''
Jeff's picture, euthanizing his first patient, who can not move or
speak, ends up in a supermarket tabloid with a headline: ``Mercy
killer doc murders mute martyr!'' And there are bomb threats from a
psychotic priest who believes it's his mission to stop euthanasists
as the ``Messenger of the Almighty.''
	   The problems do not come only from the outside. Since Jeff and
his two colleagues are working uncharted territory, they face a
gamut of questions to which there are no easy answers.
	   One of their patients wakes up from a coma just a couple of
hours before they are ready to euthanize him. How can they make
sure that they aren't killing patients prematurely?
	   Then there's an AIDS patient who begs them to be put to death
because, he says, he knows what the disease is going to do to him.
The problem is that he looks very healthy at present. Should they
still grant his wishes and kill him?
	   ``Lethal Dose'' moves fast, and has a lot of action, but its
true value lies in the author's realistic and insightful portrayals
of doctors, patients and anti-euthanasia activists caught in the
middle of a revolutionary moment in history.
	   This book is more than just a well-done medical thriller. It's a
valuable source material for anyone who wants to explore euthanasia
and physicians' roles in it.
	    &UR; ___
	   ``Lethal Dose'' was published by ICAM. dlrs 22.95.

 &UR; Eds: Movie opened Wednesday in the United States &QL; 
 &UR; By MALCOLM RITTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ So you've seen ``Antz'' and now there's ``A
Bug's Life.'' Does it make any sense to see another
computer-animated movie about ants?
	   Absolutely. Fact is, these are two quite different movies, and
each is delightful in its own way.
	   The main characters in ``A Bug's Life'' are drawn like shiny,
bright-colored toys rather than the more textured creatures of
``Antz,'' and maybe that's a tip-off. Clearly, ``A Bug's Life'' is
far more a kid's movie at heart. You won't find the knowing, Woody
Allen-like verbal humor of ``Antz.'' But you will see more action
per minute, and some of it is riveting.
	   Even grown-ups will snap to attention when a cute, brightly
colored songbird terrorizes our new insect friends. The scene drew
gasps at a recent screening.
	   And a closing chase, where the tiny characters speed through a
saturation bombing of raindrops and ultimately return to that
killer bird, is simply thrilling.
	   ``A Bug's Life'' tells the story of an ant colony that's invaded
annually by a gang of grasshoppers, who demand a major share of the
harvest. One of the ants, Flik (voice of Dave Foley, who stars in
TV's ``NewsRadio''), accidentally disposes of the offering just
before the grasshoppers show up. It's up to him to save his colony.
None of the grown-up ants has any faith in him, certainly not the
lovely Princess Atta (voice of Julia Louis-Dreyfus from TV's
``Seinfeld'').
	   Flik ventures out and recruits what he thinks is a band of
warriors, which is actually a third-rate troupe of performers from
a flea circus. But together with the ant colony, they drive off the
grasshoppers, thanks largely to Flik's cleverness and bravery. Of
course, he ends up with Atta.
	   The animation is superb, as one would expect from the folks who
created ``Toy Story.'' Not only is it technically impressive _ just
watch that tree in the opening sequence, with each leaf shimmering
in the breeze _ but it's clever. When the overbearing leader of the
grasshoppers paces among the trembling ants, two sets of hands are
clasped behind his back. When Flik ventures into the great outside
world, he wanders into a collection of food boxes that's instantly
recognizable as an ant-sized Times Square.
	   Curiously, just as in ``Antz,'' the villain gets the most
interesting face. It's just fun to watch Hopper (voice of Kevin
Spacey) be evil.
	   Grown-ups might find the story sagging a bit before they get
swept up in the closing scenes. But for them, there's a treat at
the closing credits: a series of supposed ``outtakes'' in which the
insects act all too human. It's some of the best stuff in the
movie.
	   ``A Bug's Life,'' rated G, comes from Walt Disney Pictures and
Pixar Animation Studios. It is produced by Darla K. Anderson and
Kevin Reher, directed by John Lasseter and co-directed by Andrew
Stanton, with screenplay by Stanton, Donald McEnergy and Bob Shaw.

At the Movies: `Very Bad Things'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Movie opened Wednesday in the United States &QL; 
 &UR; By TED ANTHONY &QC; 
 &UR; AP National Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The first clue was the production notes. There,
at the bottom of the cast list, were two odd credits: ``Bunker the
Dog 4 Legs'' was played by ``Wrangler.'' And ``Bunker the Dog 3
Legs'' was portrayed by ``Trooper.''
	   That, it turned out, was the least of it. Because ``Very Bad
Things,'' a black comedy written and directed by Peter Berg,
out-blacks most others of its ilk. In every way, it's one weird
movie.
	   Trapped in the surreal, mundane-as-terrifying genre so favored
by the Coen brothers (``Fargo,'' ``Barton Fink'') and the Farrelly
brothers (``There's Something About Mary,'' ``Dumb and Dumber''),
``Very Bad Things'' features some of the more unsettling film
scenes of the year. A nude prostitute gets impaled on a bathroom
hook. Body dismemberment and disposal is nauseatingly chronicled in
butcher-shop fashion. Main characters die off left and right in
horrible manner. And it's all played for laughs _ sort of.
	   Kyle Fisher (Jon Favreau of ``Swingers'') is about to be married
to the willowy Laura Garrety (Cameron Diaz), a California girl
who's not as sweet and angelic as her smile suggests. ``I am a
creature like no other. I know that,'' she proclaims imperiously.
Her wedding is her life's pinnacle, and no detail will go
unplanned; she even has tiny models of seats and guests so she can
rearrange at will.
	   Kyle, of course, must have a bachelor party. So his friends
Charles, Boyd, Michael and Adam (Leland Orser, Christian Slater,
Jeremy Piven and Daniel Stern) take him to Las Vegas _ this despite
Laura's admonition that, after their wedding, Kyle should
``re-evaluate'' some of his friendships.
	   She's a pain, but she may be right. During a cocaine- and
alcohol-laden hotel-room party, male bonding goes horribly awry.
Michael accidentally kills a stripper-prostitute during shower sex.
Dismemberment ensues. And the fun, as it were, begins.
	   Boyd emerges as the calm _ too calm, really _ force of the peer
group; Slater has never been more Nicholsonian. Adam (Stern, of
``Diner'' and ``Home Alone''), however, panics. ``We got a major
DNA problem here.''
	   But they manage to get away with it and return home _ to face
Kyle's imminent wedding.
	   The secret begins to tear them asunder, though. Adam can't cope,
and he takes it out on his wife (Jeanne Tripplehorn) and his sickly
children. Boyd turns ever more malevolent and unhinged. Kyle is
still agog at what's happened. Things fall apart. People die. And
through it all, Laura refuses to postpone the wedding. ``I will not
be denied,'' she says.
	   ``Very Bad Things'' is not sure whether it's funny or serious,
and that may be one of its strengths. It's so unsettling that it's
both hilarious and terrifying at the same time. It shows how
friendships break down in the face of adversity and how people
react when situations unravel. It reveals the banality of murder _
that it's not some mystical event but a simple, pathetic act. Berg,
who's also an actor (``Chicago Hope,'' ``Cop Land''), adds to the
unsettling feel by flouting film conventions and making sure his
stars do, too. Major characters are killed off with little warning
or sentiment and little regret afterward. Even though ample emotion
is shown, the effect is strangely emotionless, leaving a flavor
similar to that of ``Diner'' had it been made by David Lynch.
	   This is what the Coens and Farrellys have inspired _ a film
that's similar in sensation to watching a car wreck or plucking
limbs from a daddy longlegs, but also a film that acknowledges the
world is populated with unpleasant people and doesn't try to make
them redeeming. That takes guts.
	   In the end, ``Very Bad Things'' is a mean-spirited, ultimately
gross movie that's worth a look _ if you have a strong stomach.
	   ``Very Bad Things,'' a Polygram film, is produced by Michael
Shiffer, Diane Nabatoff and Cindy Cowan.

million yen (dlrs 417,000) Japan Senior Open on Sunday, ending Isao
Aoki's attempt to win the title for an unprecedented fifth straight

	   Marsh, who started Sunday's final round five strokes ahead of
Aoki, carded five birdies and three bogeys for a 14-under-par 274
total.

(6,146-meter), par-72 Ube Country Club course and placed second
with a 278 total.
	   ``I am very pleased to win this big title,'' said Marsh who
received first prize money of 7.5 million yen (dlrs 62,500).
	   Nakayama pocketed 3.5 million yen (dlrs 29,000) for second
place.
	   Aoki shot a 70 with one eagle, two birdies and two bogeys and
finished third at 279.
	   Aoki was the only golfer in Japan to win the same event fourth
straight years.
	   Aoki, 56, is second in career victories in Japan with 73 wins,
following Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki's 109.
	   Aoki earned 2.75 million yen (dlrs 23,000) for third place.
	   Taiwan's Hsieh Min-nan shot a 70 for a 281 total and tied for
fourth place with Teruo Sugihara of Japan. Sugihara also shot a 70
on Sunday.

	   ``Guilty: 30 Years of Randy Newman'' (Rhino) _ Randy Newman
	   The biggest problem with Randy Newman's music is there's too
little of it. He's the funniest man in rock 'n' roll, an American
original beyond imitation, but it's hard to make the case for
Newman as a giant of his generation because he has produced only 10
albums in 30 years.
	   That makes any release by the singer/songwriter/pianist big
news, and ``Guilty: 30 Years of Randy Newman'' is a bountiful
four-CD compilation that includes 105 tracks. The set underscores
the range of Newman's work _ a unique blend of Stephen Foster,
Hoagy Carmichael and Mark Twain, meshing the sounds of New Orleans,
Hollywood and Tin Pan Alley with lyrics that are by turns subtle,
cynical, tender and topical.
	   He writes often in character, a tongue-in-cheek technique that
can confuse casual listeners and turn Newman into a controversial
figure on such songs as ``Short People.'' He sings suburban blues
with sardonic humor with a permanent frog in his throat, impervious
to the demands of the marketplace. Or as Newman puts it in one
song: ``Who needs money when you're funny?''
	   The first two discs from ``Guilty'' feature the best of Newman's
studio recordings and are primarily for the uninitiated. The
development of his style is fully represented. And while any Newman
collection is destined to leave out important music, the biggest
hits are here _ ``Short People'' and ``I Love L.A.'' _ along with
songs that became hits for other artists, like ``Mama Told Me Not
to Come'' and ``I Think It's Going to Rain Today.''
	   For Newman fans, the set is essential because of Disc 3, which
includes demos, rarities and previously unreleased studio cuts. One
highlight is ``Happy,'' a crude, hilarious, 38-second demo about a
morning glory. Disc 4 is also valuable because it provides an
overview of Newman's marvelous film compositions from such movies
as ``Ragtime,'' ``The Natural'' and ``Toy Story.''
	   The holiday season brings a glut of new releases, but none will
be better than this.
	   _ By Steven Wine, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Takin' Chances'' (Cannonball Records) _ James Harman
	   There are some basic themes to the blues, such as love, hard
times and no money. But it isn't often you find a blues theme
record.
	   Leave it to James Harman.
	   After 1995's ``Black and White,'' Harman stayed out of the
studio for three years but didn't quit writing. In reviewing his
production for his first recording on his new label, he found an
album's worth of tunes that look at life's gambles.
	   Government-run lotteries (``Modern Numbers Game''), playing the
ponies (``Five'll Getcha Ten'') and, yes, the uncertainties of love
(``Crapshoot''), all get the naked-truth treatment from a master
storyteller. A horse tipster ``didn't scare me, though he reeked of
mortal sin.'' Love's a ``crapshoot'' so ``you can buy a Maytag,
baby, if you want guarantees.'' To an irresistible lover he
laments, ``I'd like to line up with the living, forget about being
your special friend.''
	   His vignettes are all set against some of the finest swing and
blues on the scene. The mainstream swing bands falling all over
themselves to get Top 40 play could take lessons from a guy who's
been on the 250-joints-a-year bus tour for nearly 40 years.
	   Harman has assembled some of his longtime recording buddies for
``Takin' Chances,'' including Kid Ramos and Robby Eason on guitars,
Jeff Tumes on bass and Stephen Hodges on drums. Harman's harmonica
is as steady as ever, though he uses it to accent more than lead.
The production work by co-conspirator Jerry Hall puts you right in
the middle of the recording session, as usual.
	   _ By James Reindl, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Spirit Trail'' (RCA Records) _ Bruce Hornsby
	   Critics and liner note authors like to write about Bruce Hornsby
as if each recording he makes is some huge musical evolution from
the preceding one. Bluegrass influences here, jazz there, funk
today, soul tomorrow. In truth, Hornsby has worked in an amalgam of
styles throughout his Grammy-winning career. He embraces many,
typifies none but his own.
	   ``Spirit Trail'' is his sixth recording, an ambitious double
compact disc. In some respects it is a greatest hits of Hornsby
style. It reaches back to the lyrical piano playing of his earliest
recordings in the mid-1980s and reprises the jazz of his latest
work. In the middle, the funk, soul and rock 'n' roll that have
always been there.
	   It's a storyteller's recording from a guy who knows how to tell
one. He happens to be able to put his stories to great music, but
in the end, it's the stories that count. Hornsby sums it up on the
disc's second cut, ``Resting Place'': ``You ever feel like a street
walker/I get by being a funny talker. All those funny jokes
sting/so keep walkin'.''
	   _ By James Reindl, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Devil in a Woodpile'' (Bloodshot Records) _ Devil in a
Woodpile
	   Anything with a devil on the cover and in its name that
mysteriously shows up at your desk probably should not be ignored.
So it needs to be noted that four guys who live in Chicago but
sound like they're down in a Tennessee hollow have put out a
down-home toe-tapper for their debut compact disc. Call it country
blues, rag or whatever, but when that washboard gets to humming and
that tuba gets to oomphing, it's hard to keep your shoes on, no
matter where you live.

Foreign aid to follow formation of Cambodian government

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Impoverished Cambodia looked forward
to the return of desperately needed foreign aid Sunday on the eve
of Prime Minister Hun Sen's presentation of his new Cabinet to
Parliament.
	   Dependent on foreign assistance for half its annual budget,
Cambodia suffered dramatic cuts in aid last year after Hun Sen
ousted his co-prime minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh in a violent
coup.
	   The European Union, which spent dlrs 11 million on a July
election that brought Ranariddh back to Cambodia, welcomed Sunday a
coalition deal between the two rival leaders, saying it would
``consider a full resumption of aid to Cambodia'' once Hun Sen's
government is installed.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party narrowly won the election,
but a political crisis followed the polls when Ranariddh and his
opposition ally, Sam Rainsy, denied Hun Sen the two-thirds vote in
parliament necessary to approve a government.
	   Ranariddh, bowing to what he described as intense international
pressure, broke the stalemate Nov. 13 with a coalition deal that
made the prince president of the National Assembly and gave his
FUNCINPEC party nearly half of the positions in Hun Sen's proposed
Cabinet.
	   The United States, Hun Sen's fiercest critic after the coup,
also applauded the deal and on Sunday sent a State Department
official to Cambodia to meet with the new prime minister. It was
not clear if and when Washington would resume aid.
	   The U.S. Embassy was tightlipped on what one American official
described as a low-key overnight visit to Phnom Penh by Ralph
Boyce, deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific affairs.
	   The embassy would not confirm Boyce's schedule, but the
Cambodian ministry of foreign affairs announced he would meet both
Hun Sen and Ranariddh. He will also call on opposition leader Sam
Rainsy, according to a Sam Rainsy Party spokesman.
	   Hun Sen will present his Cabinet to the National Assembly on
Monday along with a policy statement that is said to promote
widespread economic and administrative reform.
	   Hun Sen's government is certain to be approved by the assembly,
as coalition partners the CPP and FUNCINPEC control a combined 107
seats in the 122-seat legislature.

Zimbabwe strongly placed for first Test win abroad
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ Zimbabwe was an arms-throw away from
its first Test victory outside home Sunday on the third day of the
first cricket Test against Pakistan.
	   On an eventful day in which 14 wickets fell at a seamers'
friendly Arbab Niaz Stadium wicket, Zimbabwe _ chasing 162 runs for
victory _ was strongly placed at 70 for one at stumps. It needs 92
more runs to win with nine wickets in hand.
	   Zimbabwe has a poor overseas record. It went into the Peshawar
Test with 10 defeats in the 14 matches it had played, drawing the
rest. In all, it has lost 15 out of 31 matches played so far with
only two wins against Pakistan and India, both at Harare.
	   When stumps were drawn Sunday 12 overs before schedule due to
poor light, Grant Flower was batting on 24 while Murray Goodwin,
who hit six well timed boundaries, was unbeaten on 34.
	   Pakistan's lone success came in the ninth over when Ijaz Ahmed
had Gavin Rennie (6) caught at the gully off paceman Wasim Akram's
lifting delivery.
	   Pakistan, which got a vital 58-run first innings lead earlier in
the day, fell to Zimbabwean seamers Henry Olonga (4-42) and
Mpumelelo Mbangwa (3-23) as the home team was dismissed for 103 in
the second innings in just 36.5 overs, giving Zimbabweans a target
of 162 for victory.
	   It was Pakistan lowest ever total against Zimbabwe in 11 Test
matches, their lowest being 147 made at Lahore during 1993-94
season.
	   Earlier in the day, Zimbabwe made 238 in reply to Pakistan's
first innings effort of 296.
	   Olonga ran through the top order before lunch as Pakistan lost
six top batsmen with only 44 runs on board. Skipper Aamir Sohail
(2), makeshift opener Azhar Mahmood (2) and Inzamamul Haq (2) all
fell to Olonga in space of 10 deliveries while attempting to play
irresponsible strokes.
	   Ijaz Ahmed, who scored 87 in Pakistan's first innings, lasted
for only five deliveries before Heath Streak had him caught by
Alistair Campbell at first slip.
	   Mbangwa had Yousuf Youhanna (6) bowled before the right-arm
seamer had Moin Khan's middle stumps uprooted as the batsman
dragged the short delivery off an inside edge.
	   Saeed Anwar, who did not open the innings because of temperature
and upset stomach, put together 57 runs for the seventh wicket with
Wasim Akram in 87 minutes, but Pakistan lost the remaining four
wickets for five runs.
	   Akram spooned an easy catch to Olonga to give Mbangwa his third
wicket while Mushtaq Ahmed got a pair in the match when he failed
to respond to Anwar's quick call and Neil Johnson, seeing just one
wicket from point, hit the stump at the striker's end.
	   Anwar was the ninth man out after remaining joint top scorer
with Akram at 31, when he wildly flashed at Olonga's delivery
straight into wicketkeeper Andy Flower's hands.
	   Earlier Zimbabwe was bowled out for 238 after resuming at the
overnight total of 218 for seven. Akram took his 22nd five-wicket
haul in Test cricket and finished with 5-52.
	   Akram joined the 350-wicket Test club when he got rid of
overnight batsman Neil Johnson off the second ball of the day after
Zimbabwe resumed at 218 for seven.
	   The left-arm paceman became only the eighth Test cricketer after
Kapil Dev (434), Richard Hadlee (431), Ian Botham (383), Courtney
Walsh (379), Malcolm Marshall (376), Imran Khan (362) and Dennis
Lillee (355) to cross the 350-wicket mark.
	   Mahmood, who dropped the left-hander on 99 Saturday evening off
Akram, this time caught on the second attempt at second slip which
gave Akram his 350th wicket in his 82nd Test match. Johnson's (107)
maiden century in only his second Test included 16 fours before he
was out at the overnight score of 107.
	   Waqar Younis, in his comeback match after missing the Test
series against Australia, ended with four for 78.

Swiss look set to reject drug legalization
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Heeding government warnings against turning their
pristine Alpine nation into a junkies' backyard, Swiss voters were
set Sunday to reject proposals to legalize consumption of hard and
soft drugs.
	   Polls published for Swiss television forecast a 3-1 majority
against a plan to insert a new clause into the constitution that
``the consumption, cultivation or possession of drugs, and their
acquisition for personal use, is not punishable.''
	   The anticipated rejection was in contrast to the overwhelming
approval given last year to state distribution of heroin to
hardened addicts.
	   The government opposed the misleadingly-worded proposal ``for a
sensible drug policy.'' Ministers said it was a health risk and
would turn Switzerland into a haven for drug tourists and
traffickers and anger neighboring European countries.
	   The government said its current policy of helping hardcore
addicts while clamping down on dealers was the best way ahead.
	   Church groups, police chiefs, social workers, doctors and other
professionals working with addicts also said the proposal should be
rejected.
	   No other European nation, not even the Netherlands, has
legalized the possession or sale of any drugs or has plans to do
so.
	   The pro-legalization lobby _ a loose left-wing coalition which
gathered the necessary 100,000 signatures to force a referendum _
claimed it would stamp out trafficking and the black market.
	   Backers hoped that sufficient votes in their favor would
convince the government to relax laws on soft drugs like cannabis.
	   Switzerland has an estimated 30,000 hard drug addicts, one of
Europe's highest rates.
	   A government survey published last week showed a rise in
cannabis consumption. It revealed that 27 percent of people aged
15-39 said they had smoked cannabis at least once. This compared
with 16 percent in 1992.

Northern Irish leaders seeking help in South Africa visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Ten newly elected Northern
Irish leaders are heading to South Africa to study the country's
political system and transition from apartheid, a government
announcement said on Sunday.
	   The five-day visit _ to begin Tuesday _ is part of an ongoing
exchange in which South African leaders have explained how their
country ironed out often violent political differences to put an
end to apartheid.
	   Constitutional Development Minister Valli Moosa will host the
multiparty leaders from the Northern Ireland National Assembly,
spokesman Onkgopotse Tabane said.
	   They were elected in June under April's dramatic accord that
ended decades of violence between ruling Protestants and minority
Catholics. A power-sharing government received approval from 71
percent of Northern Ireland's voters in May, but Protestant leader
David Trimble has refused to set up a multiparty administration
involving Sinn Fein.
	   After a car bomb planted by Irish Republican Army dissidents in
Omagh killed 29 people in August, Trimble has insisted that the IRA
_ Sinn Fein's military wing _ disarm.
	   The bombing had parallels in South Africa, where extremist
groups also tried to derail the 1994 elections with violent
bombings and killings.
	   President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress had a power
sharing agreement with the apartheid era ruling group, the National
Party, for two years after it won the 1994 elections.

Pope lashes out at traffic in human beings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II on Sunday lashed out at
those who traffic in human beings, saying the death of immigrants
who died last week trying to reach Italian shores would haunt the
smugglers.
	   On Friday, a speeding motor boat with smugglers at the helm
crashed into a dinghy filled with ethnic Albanians from Kosovo,
killing four people, including a baby. Four others are missing and
presumed dead.
	   ``As I pray for the victims of the shipwreck, I cannot but
express the strongest condemnation of those who, because of the
thirst for money, trade in the misery of so many poor people,'' the
pope said. ``The dead will weigh on their consciences.''
	   John Paul spoke after a Mass at St. Peter's Basilica at which he
presented a papal bull offering the faithful new chances for
forgiveness in the year 2000.
	   The bull upholds a 700-year-old tradition of celebrating church
anniversary years, or Jubilees, by offering ``indulgences'' _ acts
of penance that allow forgiveness for sins.
	   In his homily, John Paul reminded the faithful that ``God comes
toward us, whether we have searched for him, whether we have
ignored him, or even when we have avoided him,'' the pontiff said.
``He is the first to approach, with open arms like a loving and
merciful father.''
	   Afterward, speaking to the faithful, the pope spoke out against
the ``unscrupulous traffickers'' in human beings.
	   Friday's tragedy was just the latest in a series of tragedies at
sea involving would-be immigrants and the people who prey on them.
The accident occurred about 35 kilometers (22 miles) east of
Brindisi, on Italy's southern coast.
	   The pope urged authorities to act quickly and decisively to stop
the people-smuggling traffic and improve conditions so people
wouldn't be forced to leave their homelands to seek a better life.
	   Would-be immigrants often pay thousands of dollars for passage
to Italy from places like the Balkans, Turkey, Asia and north
Africa. With its long coast, Italy is a favorite destination for
clandestine arrivals. In the past week alone, Italian authorities
have intercepted nearly 1,000 immigrants on the southern coast.

Olympics, Davis Cup could be part of future rankings system
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ The Davis Cup and the Olympics could
become part of a new tennis rankings system, perhaps in time for
the Sydney Games, officials said Sunday.
	   The new, simplified rankings system will go into effect in the
year 2000, becoming a 12-month points race where all the players
begin the year at zero and accumulate points throughout the
calendar year.
	   ``Our objective is to include the Olympics in the race for 2000.
We have time to achieve this objective,'' said Mark Miles, chief
executive officer of the ATP Tour.
	   ``I am very pleased they are considering having points for the
Olympics,'' said Juan Antonio Samaranch, the president of the
International Olympic Committee.
	   In a statement, Brian Tobin, president of the International
Tennis Federation (ITF), and Miles said both the ATP Tour and the
ITF were committed ``to a joint program to improve, market and
promote the game as a more entertaining and attractive sport for
public and players alike.''
	   The two bodies that have often been at odds in the past said
they would work closely in the future to improve the game.

	   INDIO, California (AP) _ Kostya Tszyu of Australia stopped
Diobelis Hurtado of Miami in the fifth round to win the interim WBC
super lightweight title Saturday night.
	   Tszyu, born in Russia, floored twice in the first round by
right-hand blows, but answered by knocking Hurtado down with a
right of his own in the wild round.
	   Tszyu used jabs and hard body punches to take control starting
in the third round. In the fifth round, Tszyu floored Hurtado twice
with left hooks to the body, with referee James Jenkin stopping the
bout at 2:35.
	   Tszyu, 29, will meet Miguel Angel Gonzalez of Mexico for the

	   In another 12-round bout at Fantasy Springs Casino, Luisito
Espinosa retained his WBC featherweight title for the seventh time
by knocking out Kennedy McKinney of Memphis, Tennessee, at 47

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak met Sunday with his
Eritrean counterpart Isaias Afwerki and discussed ways of ending
Eritrea's border dispute with Ethiopia.
	   Mubarak and Afwerki also talked about ways to expand economic
ties between Egypt and Eritrea, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported. It gave no details.
	   It said the two leaders talked about a possible role for the
Organization of African Unity in reaching a solution to the
Eritrean-Ethiopian conflict.
	   Mubarak had similar talks last week with Ethiopian Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi in Paris on the sidelines of the 20th
French-African summit, where 34 African leaders discussed security
issues.
	   Afwerki later told a news conference that his country's problem
with Ethiopia stemmed from ``Ethiopia's expansionist policies and
impractical conditions that call for laying siege to Eritrea in its
own territory and infringement of its sovereignty.''
	   He said he hoped the OAU's efforts would lead to a peaceful
solution to the conflict.
	   An OAU conference scheduled in mid-December in Burkina Faso on
settling the problems of war-divided Congo also may discuss
Eritrea's dispute with Ethiopia.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Armed with a huge win in crucial
provincial elections, India's opposition leader Sonia Gandhi said
Sunday her Congress Party was aiming for federal power but would
wait for the shaky ruling coalition to collapse on its own.
	   The Congress Party this week won enough seats to form
governments in three states _ the central Madhya Pradesh, the
western desert province of Rajasthan, and New Delhi where the
federal capital is located. It lost its government to a regional
party in the tiny northeastern state of Mizoram.
	   The main rivals, Congress and Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party _ each controlled two states
heading into Wednesday's election.
	   ``I feel that the message is quite clear. We have gained a lot
of strength, but we have to get down to work,'' Gandhi told the
private STAR television network.
	   But when asked whether her party would seek a vote of
no-confidence against the government when parliament opens Monday,
she added : ``We ought not to rush into certain situations. I
wouldn't like to do so.''
	   Top decision-makers of both parties were scheduled to meet
Sunday evening to decide future strategy.
	   Wednesday's vote was the first electoral test of the BJP since
it came to power this year. It was also expected to be an indicator
of the popularity of the Congress Party's new leader, Sonia Gandhi,
widow of slain former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and torchbearer
of the dynasty that has ruled India for most of its 51 years of
independence.
	   Sonia Gandhi has focused on rebuilding the Congress Party since
she emerged from seclusion early this year to campaign in national
elections. She was later named president of the party that was once
led by her husband, his mother Indira Gandhi, and Indira's father
Jawaharlal Nehru.
	   Wednesday's election result has been widely interpreted as a
rebuff from voters for the eight-month, 19-party coalition headed
by Vajpayee. Pre-election surveys and exit polls showed voters were
angry with the government over soaring prices of vegetables and
grains.
	   The BJP setback was expected to increase strains within the
ruling coalition, but several of the party's partners shrugged off
the possibility after the results were announced.
	   Admitting defeat for his party, Vajpayee said Saturday that
voters appeared to want a change, but added that the results would
have no bearing on the stability of his coalition.
	   Vajpayee's senior colleague in his party, Interior Minister Lal
Krishna Advani, called the results ``disappointing,'' Press Trust
of India reported from the southern city of Madras Sunday.
	   ``The exorbitant rise in the prices of essential commodities has
affected the mood of the people,'' Advani said.
	   ``The mandate is against the price rise and other things,''
coalition partner Mamata Banerjee said in the eastern city of
Calcutta. ``We want the government to be effective and assertive.''
	   On Wednesday, voters chose representatives for 600 seats. About
5,000 candidates from dozens of political parties vied for office.

Italy beats Yugoslavia for third straight world title

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Italy became the first men's team ever to win a
third straight world title Sunday, defeating Yugoslavia 15-12,
15-5, 15-10 in the World Volleyball Championships final.
	   In another final-round match, Cuba beat Brazil 12-15, 15-6,
15-11, 15-12 for the bronze medal in the 24-team men's competition
that started Nov. 13.
	   In the 16-team women's contest held Nov. 3-12, Olympic champion
Cuba also defended its world title. China placed second, followed
by Russia and fourth-place Brazil.
	   Italy's conquest in men's volleyball began in 1990 when it
overpowered Cuba for its first world championship in Rio de
Janeiro. It retained the title in 1994 in Greece.
	   But after numerous trophies, Italy lost the gold-medal match to
the Netherlands at the 1996 Olympics.
	   On Sunday, the Italians led throughout, except for a brief 2-1
deficit in the second set, before a capacity crowd of 12,000 at
Tokyo's Yoyogi Stadium.
	   The first set saw the score tied four times, at 5, 6, 9 and 12.
Andrea Giani, Andrea Gardini and Marco Brachi led the Italians
edging their opponents in attacking, retrieving the ball, serving
and blocking.
	   The victory was revenge for Italy's three straight losses to the
Yugoslavian squad since June last year. The first defeat was in a
World League match and then in the European Championships six weeks
later. The Italians also lost their quarterfinal round-robin match
against Yugoslavia last week.
	   The only time Yugoslavia mounted a real challenge came when the
match was nearly over. It saved seven match points as it battled to
stay in the game. At one point, an excited Italian fan even ran
onto the court believing his team had won.
	   Team captain Gardini had to point and show the man the giant
scoreboard which still read Italy 14, Yugoslavia 10.
	   The victory was a happy farewell for Bebeto, who has announced
this is his last game in charge of the national team.
	   Gardini was the most experienced player. He was a member of the
starting six during all three World Championships that Italy won.
	   ``Finally the tournament is over,'' Bebeto said when Samuele
Papi tipped in the championship point.
	   Yugoslavian coach Zoran Gajic agreed Italy deserved the gold
medal. ``The Italians sure were superior in speed and power,'' he
said.

Strict rules, economic woes are tough on athletes in Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ In a cold, dark gymnasium at the
battered Kabul National Stadium, about 20 bearded wrestlers huff
and puff on a worn-out mat performing training exercises.
	   All of them wear baggy pants and T-shirts to conform with the
strict dress code of the Taliban religious army, which says
exposing any part of the body below the stomach is ``un-Islamic''
even for men.
	   Such rules, and the lack of money in war-devastated Afghanistan,
make life tough for aspiring sportsmen.
	   After months of training by Afghan athletes, Taliban leaders
recently withdrew the nation's team from the Asian Games to be held
in December in Thailand. They cited lack of funds.
	   ``We want to promote sports in Afghanistan, compete in
international events, but the economic conditions in our country
are very bad,'' says Abdul Shakoor Mutmaen, a tai kwan do
black-belt holder who is sports minister for the Taliban
government.
	   The government, which controls about 90 percent of Afghanistan,
can barely afford sports facilities and few athletes can afford a
glass of milk.
	   Restrictive Islamic laws imposed by the Taliban have added to
the athletes' troubles. Taliban rules require athletes to wear
beards and forbid shorts.
	   Afghan wrestlers have been banned from international competition
because the sport's rules require competitors to be clean shaven.
	   ``The discriminatory international rules obstruct our players
from competing in tournaments abroad,'' Mutmaen says. ``They are
against beards and ask us to wear minimum clothes. But Islam is
against nudity and we want to participate in sports according to
our religion.''
	   Buoyed by sheer determination, Afghan athletes work out in
practice rooms at the war-damaged stadium that have neither
electricity nor heat.
	   Sheets of plastic cover glassless windows. Doors are broken and
plaster walls and roof are in disrepair, victims of years of
fighting among rival Islamic factions after a Marxist government
was ousted in 1992.
	   ``All the wars and hardships have not ended our love for
sports,'' says Abdul Ruhad Rahimi, coach of the national wrestling
team. ``Despite all the difficulties and without even proper food,
we are trying to keep sports alive.''
	   Most of Rahimi's students cannot afford the basic energy foods
common on athletic dinner tables like eggs, milk, meat and fruits.
	   ``Don't ask us about the food,'' says Hamidullah, a 20-year-old
on the national wrestling team. ``Our strength comes from just tea
and nan (Afghan bread).''
	   Wahidullah Yaqubi, 19, who holds a black-belt in tai kwan do and
is a first-year medical student, says very few Afghan youngsters
can afford the ``luxury'' of sports.
	   ``My father is a government employee and I am among the lucky
few who can afford to come here,'' he says.
	   He pays his instructor 10,000 Afghanis a month. That's about 28
cents.
	   Members of the national wrestling and boxing teams get a
government stipend of 20,000 Afghanis a day _ only enough to buy a
piece of bread.
	   Wrestling is one of the most popular sports in Afghanistan.
	   ``Even when rockets were raining on Kabul, most of the wrestling
clubs remained opened,'' says Sher Jan, a former national wrestling
champion who runs his own club.
	   ``It is my dream to represent my country in the international
events again,'' he says. ``But for the time being, it appears
impossible.''

Ten die in minibus-truck head on collision in South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PIETERSBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Ten people were killed in a
head-on collision between a minibus and a truck near Pietersburg,
about 320 kilometers (200 miles) north of Johannesburg, police said
Sunday.
	   The accident happened on Saturday, according to police spokesman
Superintendent Phuti Setati.
	   High speeds and unregulated passenger transport systems are
blamed for high death rates on South African roads. Over the
six-week Christmas holiday period last year, more than 900 people
died.

Yeltsin to stay in hospital several more days at least
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin will remain in the
hospital for at least several more days while he recuperates from a
bout of pneumonia, his spokesman said Sunday.
	   Dmitry Yakushkin, in an interview with Echo Moscow radio, said
Yeltsin planned to hold a series of meetings at the Central
Clinical Hospital, including a working session with Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov.
	   ``Everything is going according to plan and Yeltsin is
undergoing scheduled treatment,'' Yakushkin said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   ``Doctors are insisting that the president stay inside since
pneumonia is more serious than ordinary respiratory infection,''
the spokesman said. ``Moreover, a period of infectious diseases (in
Moscow) is beginning.''
	   Yakushkin did not say when Yeltsin would be released from the
hospital, but a Kremlin spokesman said it would be at least several
days before he could return to his residence outside Moscow.
	   ``We don't know yet how long the president will stay in the
hospital, it will all depend on his health,'' the duty officer at
the Kremlin press office said. ``He's planning working meetings
during the week at the hospital, but it doesn't mean that he will
stay at the hospital all week.''
	   Yeltsin, 67, has been hospitalized since last Sunday, and is
undergoing treatment for pneumonia, the latest in a series of
ailments that have raised concerns about his ability to serve out
his term, which ends in 2000.
	   Yeltsin has rarely appeared in public in recent months, and has
said little about the country's economic crisis, the worst in the
post-Soviet era.
	   On Sunday, he signed a number of laws and decrees, including a
tribute to artist Tair Salakhov on his 70th birthday, a law on the
import and export of goods related to space exploration and a law
on ratification of an agreement with Belarus on the delivery of
Russian diamonds, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Yakushkin, in some of the frankest language ever used by the
Kremlin about an incumbent leader, said on Friday that a history of
repeated heart attacks was ``taking its toll'' on Yeltsin.
	   It was the first time that a Yeltsin aide had even admitted
openly that the president had suffered a heart attack.
	   ``In 1996, the president was working through several heart
attacks while carrying out a very active election campaign,''
Yakushkin said. The past ailments, combined with the ``emotional,
physical and psychological pressure endured by the president are
taking its toll,'' he said.

Lee wins Meiji Nyugyo Cup women's golf
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SADOHARA, Japan (AP) _ South Korea's Lee Young Me birdied the
final four holes en route to a four-under-par 68 Sunday for a
14-under-par 274 total and a two-stroke victory in the
season-ending 60 million yen (dlrs 500,000) Japan LPGA Meiji Nyugyo
Cup.
	   It was the 35-year-old Lee's second victory this season and
seventh in her career in Japan.
	   Starting the final round tied with Japan's Kaori Harada, Lee
shot a bogey on the 13th hole, leaving her two strokes behind
Harada.
	   But Lee birdied the 15th through 18th holes while Harada shot
par the final eight holes of the 6,379-yard (5,805-meter), par-72
Hibiscus Golf club course.
	   Harada had a 70 Sunday for a 276 total and second place.
	   ``It's incredible. I'm so happy to win a four-day tournament. I
tried not to get nervous after my bogey on the 13th hole,'' said
Lee, who received first prize money of 10.8 million yen (dlrs
90,000).
	   Harada collected 5.4 million yen (dlrs 45,000) for second place.
	   Fumiko Muraguchi shot a 68 and placed third with a 279 total.
	   Michiko Hattori, who last week clinched her first Japan LPGA
money earnings title in her eight-year pro career, shot a 71 for a
281 total and sixth place.
	   Hattori, the 1985 U.S. amateur champion, collected 81,570,823
yen (dlrs 679,756) this season, followed by Harada with 68,443,639
yen (dlrs 570,363) and Ku Ok-hee of South Korea with 66,123,215 yen
(dlrs 551,026).
	   Ku Ok-hee finished in 36th place with 292, shooting a 79 Sunday.

Report says China's state enterprise reform at a critical stage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Mounting losses at state enterprises threaten
China's economic development and could set the stage for a crisis
in the state banking system unless strong measures are taken, a
senior government economist is warning, according to an official
report Sunday.
	   Losses in the state sector reached more than dlrs 37 billion in
the first six months of 1998 based on ``incomplete statistics,''
the Business Weekly reported.
	   About 90 percent of the bad loans of China's state banks are
with state companies, and the banks are the biggest victims of the
collapse of state firms, the newspaper quoted Yang Qixian, vice
president of the China Society for Research on Economic System
Reform, as saying.
	   ``Such a situation will directly threaten the country's economic
security if the problems of state enterprises can't find an
appropriate solution in the next few years,'' Yang said.
	   As part of new reforms, the central government has ordered all
Communist Party and government units to break their links with the
enterprises that have been operating under them, the Business
Weekly reported.
	   The move follows a government order that the military, police
and judicial system hand over control of their enterprises to
civilian authorities by the end of the year.
	   Starting next year, more than 500 large enterprises under direct
control of government organizations will be supervised and
coordinated by a new Large Enterprise Work Committee that will be
overseen by the State Council, the report said.
	   The poor performance of the state sector has made people
cautious about spending money, thereby hurting domestic
consumption, Yang said. In addition, 90 percent of banks' bad loans
are with state companies.
	   Reform of the state sector is key because it employs more than
100 million people.
	   Vested interests in some government institutions have blocked
further reforms of the state system, the official newspaper said.
	   The enterprises have used their government connections to
solicit foreign investment and to get loans, quotas for listing on
the stock exchanges and tax breaks.

Swiss look set to reject drug legalization
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Heeding government warnings against turning their
pristine Alpine nation into a junkies' backyard, Swiss voters on
Sunday appeared set to reject legalization of hard and soft drug
consumption.
	   Polls published for Swiss television forecast a 3-1 majority
against a plan to insert a new clause into the constitution that
``the consumption, cultivation or possession of drugs, and their
acquisition for personal use, is not punishable.''
	   The anticipated rejection was in contrast to last year's
overwhelming approval of government heroin distribution to hardened
addicts.
	   The Swiss government opposed the proposal ``for a sensible drug
policy.'' Ministers said it was a health risk and would turn
Switzerland into a haven for drug tourists and traffickers and
anger neighboring European countries.
	   The government said its current policy of helping hard-core
addicts while clamping down on dealers was the best way ahead.
Switzerland has an estimated 30,000 addicts, one of Europe's
highest rates.
	   Church groups, police chiefs, social workers, doctors and other
professionals working with addicts also said the proposal should be
rejected.
	   No other European nation, not even the Netherlands, has
legalized the possession or sale of any drugs or has plans to do
so.
	   The pro-legalization lobby _ a loose coalition that gathered the
necessary 100,000 signatures to force a referendum _ claimed it
would stamp out trafficking and the black market.
	   Backers hoped for sufficient votes to persuade the government to
relax laws on soft drugs like marijuana.
	   A government survey published last week showed a rise in
cannabis consumption. It revealed that 27 percent of people aged
15-39 said they had smoked cannabis at least once. This compared
with 16 percent in 1992.

Yugoslavia border guards wound and capture Kosovo guerrilla
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav border guards wounded and
captured an ethnic Albanian guerrilla during a shootout with rebels
illegally crossing the border from Albania, Serb sources said
Sunday.
	   The Serb Media Center, which divulges information from the Serb
point of view, said Yugoslav soldiers took the wounded guerrilla to
a nearby hospital for treatment after the shootout late Saturday.
No independent confirmation was immediately possible of the clash
80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of Pristina, the provincial
capital.
	   The center, citing Yugoslav army sources, didn't identify the
wounded member of the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army but said
he was carrying a passport from Yugoslavia and another from the
Muslim-Croat part of Bosnia.
	   It was the third border clash in two days. No injuries were
reported from the previous two which allegedly involved Albanians
smuggling weapons into Kosovo.
	   Many Albanians have been supportive of the struggle for
independence of ethnic Albanians in Serbia's southern province of
Kosovo. Most weapons for the rebels have come from the black market
in Albania.
	   Many fear Kosovo could explode in a new round of fighting if no
lasting peace is forged by spring.
	   Clashes that began following a Serb crackdown on the separatists
last February claimed hundreds of lives and displaced some 300,000
people.

Report: Jackson wants to send son to British boarding school
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Superstar Michael Jackson wants to send his
21-month-old son, Prince, to be educated at an expensive British
boarding school when he reaches high school age, The Sunday
Telegraph reported.
	   The newspaper said that Jackson has sent a representative to
inspect Stowe and to inquire about booking a place for the boy at
the private school in Buckinghamshire, 50 miles (80 kms) northwest
of London.
	   The best-known past pupil of Stowe _ current fees 14,940 pounds
(nearly dlrs 25,000) a year _ is Virgin Atlantic Airways boss
Richard Branson.
	   The school declined to comment. But approval came from another
past pupil, Lord McAlpine, whose family made a fortune out of
construction and who is a former treasurer of Britain's
Conservative Party.
	   ``All (Stowe) old boys are individuals and it's just the place
for someone slightly eccentric, as I imagine this boy will be,''
said McAlpine.
	   British newspapers reported recently that another star, Madonna,
is also considering sending her daughter to an English boarding
school, Cheltenham Ladies' College.

World Cup star Petit suggests player strike; too many games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ World Cup star Emmanuel Petit says ``too much
football will kill the game'' and suggests a player strike to stop
it.
	   Petit, one of several injured Arsenal players who missed last
week's Champions League elimination by Lens, said FIFA and English
F.A. officials ``don't care what players think'' about the
increasily crammed schedule.
	   ``Too much football will kill the game,'' Petit said in an
interview in the Sunday People newspaper.
	   ``Too much alcohol kills the body. That's why too much football
will kill the game,'' he added.
	   ``What can we do,'' he asked.
	   ``Well, we could do what they did in Italy and stop playing, but
top players in England are scared of the F.A.''
	   Petit said he had talked with Arsenal teammates Dennis Bergkamp
and Patrick Vieira and they we in agreement.
	   ``Everybody thinks the same,'' he said. ``But we're
professionals and we love our jobs with a passion.
	   ``But when we play so many games we get tired and injured, and
when that happens the fans don't see the best of us. The F.A.
should do something. The only thing they do is punish players who
have a yellow or red card.''
	   ``What would I like them to do? I'd prefer them to be a little
bit more intelligent about the demands on players.''
	   The newspapers calculated England's top clubs next season _
under a revamped Champions League and UEFA Cup schedule _ could
play over 60 matches, not counting international callups.

Turkish military says Kurdish rebels downed helicopter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's General Staff acknowledged Sunday
that Kurdish rebels downed a military helicopter in southeastern
Turkey, killing 16 soldiers.
	   After the helicopter crashed Saturday near the Iraqi border,
Turkish officials said the cause was unknown. The rebels, however,
claimed responsibility.
	   On Sunday, the military issued a statement saying the helicopter
crashed after its pilot was killed by small arms fire from rebels
on the ground. In addition to the 16 who died, one soldier was
injured and one is missing, it said.
	   A memorial ceremony for the dead is scheduled Monday at Ankara's
main mosque. The country's top brass and civilian leaders are
expected to attend.
	   The Turkish army has been at war for 14 years in southeastern
Turkey with autonomy-seeking rebels of the Kurdistan Workers Party
or PKK. The PKK has downed several military helicopters in the
past.

Iranian dissident reported missing for weeks, possibly killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A political activist critical of the Iranian
government has been missing for weeks and anonymous callers to his
family have said he has been ``executed,'' a group of Iran's top
dissidents said Sunday.
	   Pirooz Davani, leader of a small group called the United Left,
``has been missing for weeks, and the security and intelligence
services have flatly told his family that they never arrested
him,'' said a statement signed by 79 of Iran's top dissidents.
	   There was no immediate comment from the government about the
statement. It comes amid a power struggle between Iran's moderate
president, Mohammad Khatami, and hard-line clerics backed by street
thugs who often have taken the law into their own hands.
	   The dissidents' statement on Davani, faxed to The Associated
Press in Tehran, follows the murder last week of another leading
dissident, Dariush Foruhar.
	   According to the statement, Davani's mother died of a heart
attack after receiving repeated anonymous phone calls saying her
son had been arrested and executed.
	   ``It has not been determined which institution, individual or
individuals captured Mr. Davani, where he was executed, or what
happened to him,'' the statement said.
	   The dissidents called on Khatami, who has promised more
political freedoms since his election last year, to order an
investigation into Davani's disappearance.
	   Khatami has demanded the killers of Foruhar, who was stabbed to
death last week at his Tehran home along with his wife, be brought
to justice. Iranian newspapers have reported several arrests in
connection with those murders.
	   The Foruhar killings coincided with the death of Majid Sharif, a
writer for the dissident publication Iran-e-Farda. His death is
still under investigation, but his family and newspapers both have
said he may have died of a heart attack.
	   Over the past year, the vigilantes linked to right-wing clerics
have attacked dissidents, liberal newspapers and even a reformist
Cabinet minister. They have also broken up pro-democracy rallies.
	   Among the dissidents who signed Sunday's statement about Davani
were Ebrahim Yazdi, head of the Freedom Movement; Iran-e-Farda
editor Ezatollah Sahabi; and Azam Taleqani, head of the Iranian
Women's Association.
	   In a letter sent to Khatami after the Foruhars' murder, the New
York-based Human Rights Watch said it ``is deeply concerned that
the murders of the Foruhars may be part of a pattern of
government-condoned repression directed against critics in Iran
which goes back many years.''

Iran says it stopped two boats smuggling goods to Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The Iranian navy has intercepted two boats
trying to smuggle goods into Iraq in violation of United Nations
sanctions, the Tehran Times reported Sunday.
	   An Iranian navy patrol stopped a boat heading for Iraq on
November 10 and escorted it to international waters, the
English-language paper said. It did not say where the boat was
coming from.
	   In another incident an Indian boat heading towards Iraq was
fined two million rials (dlrs 666) for attempted smuggling, said
the paper. It did not say when the boat was intercepted.
	   Three Iranian vessels, one Indian ship and a vessel from the
United Arab Emirates were stopped and checked by the navy before
they were allowed to move on, the paper said.
	   The United States has accused Iran of allowing ships smuggling
goods to and from Iraq to pass through its territorial waters.
	   A U.S.-led multinational naval force carries out patrols in
international waters to intercept ships trying to break the embargo
but they are not allowed to travel through Iranian territorial
waters.
	   The U.N. embargo was imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   In 1996, the U.N. agreed to start an oil-for-food deal which
would allow Iraq to sell only a limited amount of oil to purchase
badly-needed food and medicine for its 22 million people.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The West Indies fought back,
but then collapsed again to be 148 for seven wickets at tea on
Sunday, the fourth day of the first test against South Africa at
the Wanderers Stadium.
	   South Africa had a seven run lead on the first innings when it
kept the visitors to 82 for five wickets at lunch in the second
innings.
	   The morning belonged to the South African bowlers, but the West
Indies batsmen Carl Hooper _ back from an injury on Thursday _ and
Ridley Jacobs dug in and scored carefully off a tight attack.
	   Each batsman struck a six, but with the ball keeping lower and
lower with increasing frequency, there were a number of leg before
wicket decisions. It was just such a decision which broke the
partnership of 68 as Jacques Kallis trapped Hooper in front for the
third lbw of the innings, all palpably in front.
	   As so often occurs in a partnership, the other partner fell
immediately, as Jacobs was suckered by Pat Symcox into pulling
across the line, sending the ball straight into the hands of David
Terbrugge at mid-on.
	   After battling for two hours to hold an upper hand, West Indies
lost it at the very end.
	   In the morning, South African bowlers Allan Donald and Shaun
Pollock bowled a tight line and length to make scoring difficult,
as Pollock bowled Philo Wallace and Donald trapped Brian Lara for
seven.

Iraq dailies say U.S., Butler aim to stop review of arms programs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS to invasion of Kuwait in last graf. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's state-run newspapers on Sunday
accused the United States and the chief U.N. arms inspector of
blocking a review of Iraqi weapons programs in order to maintain
tough economic sanctions on the country.
	   Iraq has argued that chief inspector Richard Butler has demanded
a series of documents from Iraq to block the comprehensive review,
which Iraq maintains would show it has fulfilled U.N. demands to
eliminate its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The daily Babil, owned by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's son
Odai, said the documents issue ``is meant to picture Iraq as not
cooperating with the international community.''
	   The comprehensive review, to be conducted by the U.N. Security
Council, depends on Iraq showing it is fully cooperating with U.N.
arms inspectors since their return to Baghdad in mid-November after
the latest Iraq-U.N. crisis.
	   Iraq has since gone out of its way to picture itself as
cooperative.
	   On Sunday, the Iraqi New Agency quoted the head of the country's
monitoring directorate a saying U.N. inspection teams carried out
15 ``announced and surprise visits'' on Saturday.
	   The visits were carried out by 12 inspection teams using
helicopters in some work, INA quoted Hussam Mohammed Amin as
saying. Amin's group provides the Iraqi escorts for U.N. teams on
their visits to the field.
	   Amin also was quoted as saying a team of nuclear inspectors
collected soil samples from 12 sites around Baghdad. He told INA
that a team of chemical inspectors completed its work and left
Iraq.
	   U.N. officials in Baghdad could not be immediately reached about
Amin's report, but they rarely comment on details of the
inspections.
	   A front-page editorial in the daily Al-Thawra also said the
documents demanded by Butler were an impediment to the Security
Council's promised review.
	   The paper of the ruling Baath Party said that after U.N.
inspectors failed to find weapons that ``do not exist,'' Butler has
``started demanding documents which also do not exist or have no
relations to the disarmament procedures.''
	   After Butler asked for a dozen documents on Iraqi weapons
earlier this month, Iraq said all relevant papers in its possession
had been turned over.
	   The inspectors must certify Iraq's lethal weapons programs have
been ended before trade sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait can be lifted. The sanctions include a ban on
free export of oil, which has ruined Iraq's economy.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ South Korea's Kang Wook-soon fired a
4-under-par 67 Sunday and won the U.S. dlrs 300,000 Perrier Hong
Kong Open Golf Championship by two strokes over Edward Fryatt of
England.
	   Kang, who was runner-up last year, shot five birdies and a bogey
on the 6,727-yard, par-71 Composite Course of the Hong Kong Golf
Club for a total of 12-under-par 272.
	   The South Korean, who was also a runner-up in the Alfred Dunhill
Masters in Hong Kong in 1996, collected U.S. dlrs 50,000.
	   Kang said he felt ``very comfortable with the course as there
are a lot of trees just like in my country.''
	   Frayatt shot a 68 for the third consecutive round to finish at
274.
	   One stroke behind were three players - American Mark Brooks, the
1996 PGA Championship winner, England's Chris Williams, and
Swaziland's Paul Friedlander.
	   Both Brooks and Friedlander shot a 1-under-par 70 on Sunday.
Williams had a 67.
	   Overnight leader, Hsieh Chin-sheng of Taiwan, could manage only
a 2-over-par 73 and dropped to 6th place at 276.
	   Fran Quinn of the United States scored a hole-in-one on the 15th
for a 6-under-par 65. Quinn, who got a dlrs 20,000 BMW motorcycle
for his hole-in-one, tied for 11th with four other players at 277.
	   American John Daly, the 1991 PGA Championship winner, had a 71
to finish in 19th place with five other players at 279.
	   Last year's champion Frank Nobilo of New Zealand had a
disastrous 75, finishing 61st with three other players at 288.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Armed with a win in crucial provincial
elections, India's opposition leader Sonia Gandhi said Sunday her
Congress Party was aiming for federal power but would wait for the
shaky ruling coalition to collapse on its own.
	   The Congress Party this week won enough seats to form
governments in three states _ the central Madhya Pradesh, the
western desert province of Rajasthan, and New Delhi where the
federal capital is located. It lost its government to a regional
party in the tiny northeastern state of Mizoram.
	   The main rivals, Congress and Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party _ each controlled two states
heading into Wednesday's election.
	   ``I feel that the message is quite clear. We have gained a lot
of strength, but we have to get down to work,'' Gandhi told the
private STAR television network.
	   But when asked whether her party would seek a vote of
no-confidence against the government when parliament opens Monday,
she added : ``We ought not to rush into certain situations. I
wouldn't like to do so.''
	   Top decision-makers of both parties were scheduled to meet
Sunday evening to decide future strategy.
	   Wednesday's vote was the first electoral test of the BJP since
it came to power this year. It was also expected to be an indicator
of the popularity of the Congress Party's new leader, Sonia Gandhi,
widow of slain former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and torchbearer
of the dynasty that has ruled India for most of its 51 years of
independence.
	   Wednesday's election result has been widely interpreted as a
rebuff from voters for the eight-month, 19-party coalition headed
by Vajpayee. Exit polls showed voters were angry with the
government over soaring prices of vegetables and grains.
	   Admitting defeat for his party, Vajpayee said Saturday that
voters appeared to want a change, but added that the results would
have no bearing on the stability of his coalition.

Australia's Ben Walsh wins Asian Formula 2000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Ben Walsh of Australia won the
Asian Formula 2000 Series overall auto race title with two
victories in Sunday's final rounds held at the Johor Circuit in
Pasir Gudang, in peninsular Malaysia's southern Johor state.
	   Walsh's two straight wins in rounds 13 and 14 gave him the title
with 225 points to push Malaysian hopeful Ng Wai Leong into second
place overall with 176 points.
	   In Sunday's races, Wai Leong had to settle for second on both
occasions while 16-year-old Indonesian Fino Saksono was third in
both races.
	   Walsh won the first race in 19:18.11 with the victory good
enough for the Australian to win the overall title. Wai Leong was a
close second in 19:18.22 while Fino finished in 19:26.95.
	   In the second race Walsh won again in a close battle with Wai
Leong. Again it was another close battle between the Australian and
the Malaysian before Walsh came out on tops in 19:13.36.
	   Wai Leong had to be satisfied with another runner-up spot in
19:13.70 while Fino did well again to finish third in 19:28.18,
beating some of the more experienced racers along the way.
	   Third overall was Thailand's H. Nattaphong who did not race
Sunday.
	   The 18-year-old Thai skipped the races to sit for his exams. But
his 159 points total earned from previous races were good enough
for him to finish third overall.
	   In the Asean 1600 Touring Cars Invitational Challenge 1998,
Georges Ramirez of the Philippines took the overall title with 74
points after finishing third and second respectively in Sunday's
Rounds 5 and 6.
	   Malaysia's Timothy Schulz took second place overall with 53
points with third place going to Louis Ramirez of the Philippines
with 47 points.
	   Another Malaysian Mashlino Mohd Buang was fourth overall with 40
points.

World Cup star Petit suggests player strike; too many games

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ World Cup star Emmanuel Petit says ``too much
football will kill the game'' and suggests a player strike to save
it.
	   Petit, one of several injured Arsenal players who missed last
week's Champions League elimination by French side Lens, said FIFA
and English F.A. officials ``don't care what players think'' about
the increasily crammed schedule.
	   ``Too much football will kill the game,'' Petit said in
interviews in Sunday's People and News of the World newspapers.
	   ``Too much alcohol kills the body, too much cocaine kills the
body. And too much football kills football,'' he added.
	   Petit, who has torn stomach muscles and is likely to be out six
weeks, said it was no coincidence there ``were seven Arsenal
players at the World Cup and it is hardly surprising we are injured
now.''
	   ``What can we do?'' he asked.
	   ``Well, we could do what they did in Italy and stop playing, but
top players in England are scared of the F.A,'' he said, referring
to a 1996 player strike in Italy.
	   Petit said he had talked with Arsenal teammates Dennis Bergkamp
and French international Patrick Vieira and they we in agreement.
	   ``Everybody thinks the same,'' he said. ``But we're
professionals and we love our jobs with a passion.
	   ``But when we play so many games we get tired and injured, and
when that happens the fans don't see the best of us. The F.A.
should do something. The only thing they do is punish players who
have a yellow or red card.''
	   ``What would I like them to do? I'd prefer them to be a little
bit more intelligent about the demands on players.''
	   The newspapers calculated England's top clubs next season _
under a revamped Champions League and UEFA Cup schedule _ would
play over 60 matches, not counting internationals.
	   UEFA, the governing body of European soccer, is planning to
expand its Champions League and UEFA Cup competitions, countering a
bid by a breakaway Super League that had promised millions of
dollars in extra revenue to Europe's top teams.
	   In a separate matter, World Cup champion France refused to play
in the Confederations Cup in Mexico in January, forcing FIFA to
postpone it until next summer.
	   France has also balked at playing in the summer, contending
there are too many games and players aren't available. Mexico,
Bolivia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, New Zealand and the United
States are also entered in the Confederations Cup.

Swiss reject drug legalization
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with proposal rejected; ADDS second poll. Will be led
with more results &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Heeding government warnings against turning their
pristine Alpine nation into a drug haven, Swiss voters rejected
proposals Sunday to legalize consumption of heroin and other
narcotics.
	   With a majority of results declared by mid-afternoon, not a
single canton (state) accepted the proposal. For it to pass, it
needed a majority of the 26 cantons and an absolute majority of
votes.
	   Polls published for Swiss television forecast a 75 percent vote
against the proposed constitutional amendment that ``the
consumption, cultivation or possession of drugs, and their
acquisition for personal use, is not punishable.''
	   The rejection was in contrast to the overwhelming approval given
last year to state distribution of heroin to hardened addicts.
	   The government opposed the misleadingly-worded proposal ``for a
sensible drug policy.'' Ministers said it was a health risk and
would turn Switzerland into a haven for drug tourists and
traffickers and anger neighboring European countries.
	   The government said its current policy of helping hardcore
addicts while clamping down on dealers was the best way ahead.
	   Church groups, police chiefs, social workers, doctors and other
professionals working with addicts also said the proposal should be
rejected.
	   No other European nation, not even the Netherlands, has
legalized the possession or sale of any drugs or has plans to do
so.
	   The pro-legalization lobby _ a loose left-wing coalition which
gathered the necessary 100,000 signatures to force a referendum _
claimed it would stamp out trafficking and the black market.
	   Backers hoped that sufficient votes in their favor would
convince the government to relax laws on soft drugs like cannabis.
	   Switzerland has an estimated 30,000 hard drug addicts in its
population of 7 million _ one of Europe's highest rates.
	   A government survey published last week showed a rise in
cannabis consumption. It revealed that 27 percent of people aged
15-39 said they had smoked cannabis at least once. This compared
with 16 percent in 1992.
	   Voters looked set to give the go-ahead to government plans to
spend 30.5 billion francs (dlrs 22.1 billion) over 20 years
modernizing the national rail network and linking it to high-speed
lines in neighboring countries.
	   The plan centers on building two huge new tunnels through the
Alps to provide a route for north-south European cargo traffic
between Germany and Italy and to provide speedy passenger train
service.
	   The public already previously approved the tunnels, but the
government wanted ot tp gove the go-ahead to its finance package.

Zoeggler wins luge as Germans dominated at own track
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALTENBERG, Germany (AP) _ Italy's Armin Zoeggeler captured
Sunday's men's singles luge world cup race as the top Germans were
shut out from the podium at their own track.
	   Zoeggeler soared to his 10th career triumph at Altenberg in one
minute, 51.484 for his two heats, edging fellow Italian Norbert
Huber at 1:51.568 and Austria's Markus Prock at 1:51.627.
	   But surprisingly, none of the usually strong Germans cracked the
top six.
	   George Hackl, three-time Olympic champion and last week's winner
at Igls, Austria, needed a strong second heat just to finish ninth.
	   "This course isn't for drivers with back problems," Hackl said
as fast starters grabbed all the podium starts. "I started so
slowly on this flat course that I didn't even need to bother to go
downhill anymore. Besides that, I made two driving mistakes."
	   Hackl, known for his driving skills and not his starts, had been
operated on for ruptured discs two years ago. He bounced back to
grab silver at the 1996 World Championships.
	   Zoeggeler and Prock shared the lead in the overall standings
with 155 points while Hackl slipped to third with 145.
	   On Saturday, German women swept the top four spots in women's
singles while the American men failed to repeat their commanding
performance at Igls in doubles.
	   After the Americans grabbed the top two spots last week, they
had to settle for a bronze by Chris Thorpe and Gordy Sheer. The
world champions, Tobias and Markus Schiegl, won in 1:25.322.
	   Germany's Barbara Niedernhuber shattered the course record for a
heat in winning the women's singles. She blazed to a new record of
53.858 seconds in her first run, breaking the old mark of 54.78 by
fellow German Sylke Otto by almost a second, winning in a a
combined time of one minute 47.823 seconds.

	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed
bin Talal has signed a 1.7 billion riyal contract (dlrs 450
million) with Riyadh-based El-Seif Engineering Contracting
Establishment for the construction of his landmark skyscraper, his
office said Sunday.
	   When the 30-story, 300-meter (990 feet) building is completed in
the year 2000, it will be the tallest structure in the Middle East,
the statement said.
	   Alwaleed is one of the world's richest men, with a fortune
estimated at more than dlrs 12 billion.
	   The Kingdom Center, which got its name from Alwaleed's flagship
Kingdom Holding Co., is expected to house the prince's corporate
headquarters and provide space for some of his other holdings, such
as a Four Seasons Hotel and a Saks Fifth Avenue store.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Trading at the Kuwait Stock Exchange was abruptly
halted soon after it started Saturday when the bourse received a
bomb threat, which turned out to be a hoax, Al-Watan daily reported
Sunday.
	   The newspaper said police evacuated the building and searched
it, but found nothing. The threat was made by telephone to the
secretary of the exchange's director-general, Hisham al-Obaibi, and
the caller was speaking with a Kuwaiti accent, the daily said.
	   Bomb scares are not uncommon in Kuwait, but this was the first
ever at the stock exchange. The exchange's index has in recent
weeks fallen to two-year lows, and a controversy developed over a
proposal to pump liquidity into the market by allowing investment
companies to give out loans for buying stocks.
	   Dealers did not return to the exchange after the security check
Saturday, Al-Watan said.
 &UR; ___
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Qatar's Ras Laffan Liquefied
Natural Gas Co. will sign an agreement in mid-December to provide
7.5 million metric tons a year of liquefied natural gas to India's
Petronet, Qatar's oil minister said Sunday.
	   The minister, Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Attiyah, made the remarks at
a news conference on the sidelines of Gastech '98, which opened
Sunday in Dubai.
	   Petronet awarded Ras Laffan the tender in September. The project
is to supply 5 million metric tons a year of LNG to Dahej, Gujarat,
and 2.5 million metric tons a year to Cochin in Kerala state on a
long-term basis. Deliveries are expected to start in 2002.
	   Ras Laffan and Mobil Oil, which owns 25 percent of the Qatari
company, also plan to work with Petronet to invest and participate
in the development of receiving, storage and regasification
infrastructure in India.
	   State-owned Qatar General Petroleum Corp. owns 63 percent of Ras
Laffan. Stakes also are held by Japan's Itochu Corp. and Nissho
Iwai. Nominees of South Korea's Korean Gas Corp. own the rest.
	   Petronet is a joint venture of state-run oil companies Indian
Oil Corp., Bharat Petroleum, the Oil and Natural Gas Corp. and the
Gas Authority of India.
	   ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan agreed to resume flights to the
Israeli town of Haifa on the Mediterranean coast twice a week, an
official said Sunday.
	   The flights, canceled a year ago due to a shortage of
passengers, will be scheduled every Sunday and Wednesday, said
Ahmed Quntar, director-general of Royal Wings, the regional arm of
Royal Jordanian Airlines.
	   He added that the new flights expect to receive some Arab
passengers transiting between Europe and the Arab Gulf states.

Syrian to elect new parliament Monday and Tuesday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Some eight million Syrians are eligible
to vote for a new 250-seat parliament to be elected Monday and
Tuesday from among 7,350 candidates.
	   Two-thirds of the seats in the National Assembly, or parliament,
are allotted to the National Progressive Front, a coalition of
seven parties led by the Baath Party which has ruled Syria since
1963.
	   The allotment of seats was the same in the previous four-year
term which ended in September. The Baath gets 135 seats, and 32 go
to allied parties. Independents run for the remaining 83 seats.
	   The assembly has limited legislative power, with effective
control held by President Hafez Assad, who came to power in a
bloodless coup in 1970.
	   Businessmen and industrialists are expected to gain more
influence in the new parliament following government efforts to
encourage more investment in the private sector.
	   Women, who held 24 seats in the previous parliament, also are
expected to increase their numbers. More than 800 women are
running.
	   Campaigning began Oct. 29 with candidates putting up posters and
banners in almost all cities. the campaigning is based mainly on
individual candidates' promises to improve conditions, not on party
programs. The campaign ended Saturday.
	   Polls will be open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. (0600gmt-1800gmt)
Monday and from 8 a.m. to noon (0600gmt-1000gmt) Tuesday. No
results are expected before Thursday.

Ninety percent of orangutans at refugee center have human diseases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 90 percent of orangutans in a
refuge center in Indonesia's East Kalimantan have contracted human
diseases, the official Antara news agency reported Sunday.
	   The longhaired apes at the Wanariset Samboja refuge on the
island of Borneo suffered from ailments such as hepatitis,
influenza, intestinal worms and tuberculosis, Antara said.
	   It quoted the center's chief, Boem Purnama, as saying that by
using sophisticated medical equipment workers were able to save
some of the orangutans, including one found early this year with
Hepatitis C.
	   About 200 orangutans were being quarantined at the center, which
early this year released 17 males and 19 females into the Meratus
forest, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) northwest of the center.
	   During the last year devastating fires that engulfed about
500,000 hectares (1.2 million acres) of forest had killed at least
120 orangutans while driving several rare animals and flora to the
point of extinction.
	   The fires, many set by farmers to clear land, also produced a
choking smoke haze over much of Southeast Asia.
	   In the past, biologists estimated that 20,000 orangutans lived
in the wilds of Borneo, but the figure has dwindled to around 2,000
because much of their habitat has been destroyed by development and
fires.
	   East Kalimantan is the Indonesian portion of the island of
Borneo, the third largest island on Earth, which is also home to
the nation of Brunei and the Malaysian province of Sarawak.

Newcomer Elofsson stars in Swedish victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUONIO, Finland (AP) _ Per Elofsson, a 21-year newcomer, passed
Tor Arne Hetland of Norway during the last kilometer and gave
Sweden victory in the season's first cross-country ski World Cup
relay Sunday.
	   Elofsson finished 0.8 seconds ahead of Hetland after trailing
almost a minute going out on the last 10-kilometer leg in the 4 x
10K freestyle relay.
	   In the women's 4x5 kilometer relay, Russia's foursome of Olga
Danilova, Anfisa Resztsova, Larisa Lazutina and Nina Gavrilyuk was
superior. Stefania Belmondo lifted Italy past Norway's Maj Helen
Sorkmo before the finish to take second.
	   Elofsson, a world junior champion, won the men's individual 10K
freestyle Saturday ahead of Norway's Bjorn Dahlie, the world's
greatest winter Olympian.
	   On Sunday, Norway placed Dahlie on the third leg in order to
build up an advantage for Hetland. But Elofsson came from a
53-second deficit to win for his team, for which Anders Bergstrom,
Magnus Ingesson and Mathias Fredriksson skied the other legs.

Indian prime minister says political shakeup won't derail reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With India-Politics &QL; 
 &UR; By NEELESH MISRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ With stunning defeat in four state
elections casting a shadow on his government, Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee reassured foreign business owners Sunday that
political shakeups would not affect planned measures to open
markets and reduce barriers to outside investment.
	   ``The volatility of Indian democracy will have no fundamental
impact on the process of economic reforms in the country,''
Vajpayee told hundreds of Indian and foreign business leaders at an
economic summit organized by the World Economic Forum.
	   The government had ``depoliticized the economic agenda,'' he
said.
	   Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party suffered a series of
embarrassing setbacks in the elections to four state assemblies _
it lost hold of governments in New Delhi, site of the federal
capital, and the western Rajasthan state. The BJP also failed to
dislodge the ruling Congress Party in the central state of Madhya
Pradesh.
	   The poor showing in Wednesday's elections was expected to
increase difficulties within the 19-party governing coalition,
though several of its partners on Sunday assured their support to
Vajpayee's Hindu nationalist government.
	   Sonia Gandhi, president of the main opposition Congress Party,
said Sunday that her group would wait for the coalition to crumble
on its own, rather than make an immediate attempt to regain power.
	   Indian business leaders said that domestic and foreign investors
were apprehensive about the prospects for economic reforms
announced over the past two months.
	   Dhruv Sawhney, former president of the Confederation of Indian
Industry, said the several important economic bills _ including a
proposal to partly open the insurance sector to foreign investors _
awaited parliamentary approval.
	   ``One does not know their fate with this political
uncertainty,'' Sawhney was quoted as saying by Press Trust of
India.
	   The government has also announced plans to bring patent laws in
line with international norms, to eliminate red tape for
incorporating new businesses, to facilitate business ownership of
property, and to speed approval of foreign investment in local
projects.
	   At the conference, Vajpayee promised seven to eight percent
growth in the country's gross domestic product, low inflation and
new jobs.
	   ``Look at the inherent strengths of India and the inherent
opportunities it offers for mutual benefit,'' he said. ``These
opportunities will grow irrespective of political vagaries.''
	   India's economy is currently struggling. The trade deficit
widened to dlrs 5 billion during the first half of the fiscal year,
compared with dlrs 2.5 billion from April to September last year,
according to the Commerce Ministry.
	   Exports fell 5 percent to dlrs 2.8 billion in September, the
latest month reported, from dlrs 2.9 billion in September 1997.
Imports for the same month rose more than 20 percent, according to
government estimates.

Schroeder builds ties with French leaders at summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Still new on the block, Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder is nurturing German ties with France during a summit
starting Monday that both sides hope will refresh Europe's key
partnership.
	   Big projects are on the table: 11 countries are introducing a
single currency, the euro, on Jan. 1, requiring Europe to pull
together economically as never before.
	   And with Schroeder leading the first center-left German
government in 16 years, French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin now has
a potential ally in seeking common European ways to fight
unemployment _ the continent's No. 1 problem.
	   But atmosphere matters at least as much as nitty-gritty topics
at the twice-yearly German-French gatherings, which help guide
Europe's drive for greater unity.
	   For Schroeder, the two-day summit in Potsdam outside Berlin is
his first.
	   He and President Jacques Chirac _ a conservative who appeals to
Schroeder's centrist leanings _ have warmed to each other in two
previous meetings, soothing French fears that Schroeder would seek
closer ties with British Prime Minister Tony Blair at the expense
of Paris.
	   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine praised the new German
government last week, saying it was more practical and less
sentimental than that of Helmut Kohl, Schroeder's predecessor.
	   Kohl, who experienced World War II as a teenager, championed
European unity and the German-French axis as a reconciliation
between former battlefield enemies. But Vedrine said the
partnership lacked drive during Kohl's latter years in power.
	   ``I always thought the French could communicate more easily with
a Germany governed by Schroeder,'' Brigitte Sauzay, a former
interpreter for the late French President Francois Mitterrand who
now advises Schroeder, said in a newspaper interview.
	   Both sides indicated a main topic will be Germany's demand for
lower contributions to the European Union budget. Also on the
agenda is administrative reform of the trade bloc to allow a first
batch of former Soviet bloc countries to join early next century.
	   The debut of Europe's central bank, which will set interest rate
policy for the euro, is also expected to come up.
	   Schroeder is the point man because Germany takes over the EU's
rotating six-month presidency Jan. 1.
	   With a dozen Cabinet ministers taking part on both sides, the
summit is a get-acquainted session for the new German government.
The leaders are expected to issue a final declaration Tuesday.
	   A high point will be Monday's banquet hosted by Schroeder at the
Babelsberg film studios, from where Marlene Dietrich launched her
stardom with ``The Blue Angel.''

Spain admits to modest role in the trafficking art looted by the
</HEADLINE>
Nazis &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain under the rule of dictator Gen.
Francisco Franco played only a minor role in trafficking art stolen
by the Nazis from Holocaust victims, according to a government
report quoted in a Sunday newspaper.
	   The report will be presented at an upcoming conference in
Washington to discuss what to do about billions of dollars worth of
art looted by the Nazis that has since found its way into public
and private collections around the world, leading daily El Pais
said.
	   The paper said the report recognizes that Franco's government
protected five alleged art smugglers from extradition, and that a
further 15 operated in Spain.
	   But this gave Spain only a ``modest'' role in the looted art
network, as there were an estimated 2,000 art traffickers working
in Europe as a whole, the report concluded according to El Pais.
	   The report details the protection given to Alois Miedl, a
wealthy German banker who had good contacts with collectors around
the world and a personal friendship with Hitler's right-hand-man
Herman Goering.
	   Miedl entered Spain in 1944 with 22 paintings _ including a Van
Dyck, two Corots and a David _ allegedly stolen from the collection
of Dutch Jewish millionaire Jacque Goudstikker.
	   In the years that followed Franco refused to bow to pressure to
extradite Miedl from the Dutch government, aided by the allies.
	   The whereabouts of the paintings is now a mystery, El Pais said.
	   Spain is among the 44 nations and 13 nongovernmental
organizations to take part in the four-day Washington conference
due to start Monday and expected to draft guidelines regarding how
to deal with art that may have been stolen by the Nazis.
	   The Nazis, beginning in 1933 in Germany, looted an estimated
dlrs 9 billion to drls 14 billion in art and other assets from Jews
in 20 countries or regions they occupied. The current value of the
assets is estimated at drls 90 billion to dlrs 140 billion.
	   Switzerland's two largest commercial banks have recently agreed
to pay dlrs 1.25 billion to Holocaust survivors and their heirs for
lost assets.

Report: Official wants Miyazawa to stay on as finance minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A top Japanese government official has reportedly
said he wants former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to reconsider
his intention to resign as finance minister.
	   ``It is not easy to find his (Miyazawa's) replacement,
considering his caliber,'' Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Muneo
Suzuki said on a Sunday television program, Kyodo News agency
reported.
	   ``I for one would like him to stay on and devote himself to
efforts to restore the nation's economy,'' Suzuki said.
	   Miyazawa, 79, told a news conference Friday that he would step
down as finance minister _ possibly by the end of this year _ after
turning over leadership of his faction in the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party to a younger protege and completing work on the
fiscal 1999 budget.
	   Japan is battling its deepest recession since the end of World
War II. When Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi took office this summer,
he turned to Miyazawa for his long experience in finance and
economics.
	   Miyazawa's return as head of the powerful ministry was heralded
by some commentators. Others, however, criticized the move, blaming
him for fueling Japan's asset-inflated economic ``bubble'' in the
late 1980s, the eventual collapse of which is still adversely
affecting the nation's economy.

Israeli Cabinet ministers call for reprisals against Lebanon

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Cabinet meeting underway in graf 4; Netanyahu
comments, grafs 5-6 &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Cabinet ministers called Sunday for
military strikes against Beirut's power and water supplies in
retaliation for the killing of Israeli soldiers by Islamic
guerrillas in south Lebanon.
	   Seven Israeli soldiers have been killed in the past two weeks by
the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia in the security zone which
Israel occupies in south Lebanon to protect its northern border.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a European trip to
England and Spain to deal with a growing debate in Israel over the
losses in Lebanon and calls for a unilateral Israeli withdrawal.
	   The 12-member Cabinet security committee was meeting Sunday in
Jerusalem to hear military and security chiefs report on the
Lebanon situation after Netanyahu returned from visiting soldiers
wounded in the latest fighting.
	   ``We are looking for an arrangement in which we can achieve that
objective of protecting northern Israel without our presence in
Lebanon,'' Netanyahu said Sunday. But he said Cabinet members would
discuss minimizing Israeli troop casualties, not withdrawal.
	   ``As long as we don't have a way of leaving Lebanon in an
arrangement that will guarantee the safety of northern Israel, our
main objective is to protect Israeli soldiers,'' he said.

Iraq dailies say U.S., Butler aim to stop review of arms programs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to RAISE background and to CORRECT Iraq invading
Kuwait sted Iraq. No Pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's state-run newspapers on Sunday
accused the United States and the chief U.N. arms inspector of
blocking a review of Iraqi weapons programs in order to maintain
tough economic sanctions.
	   Iraq denies the existence of documents that chief inspector
Richard Butler says are related to its chemical and biological
weapons program. It says Butler made the demand to block the
comprehensive review, which Iraq claims would show it has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The daily Babil, owned by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's son
Odai, said the documents issue ``is meant to picture Iraq as not
cooperating with the international community.''
	   The comprehensive review, to be conducted by the U.N. Security
Council, depends on Iraq's full cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors. The inspectors must certify Iraq has eliminated its
lethal weapons programs before ruinous sanctions can be lifted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
limit exports of oil and have ruined Iraq's economy.
	   Iraq promised full cooperation on Nov. 14, after the United
States and Britain threatened airstrikes because Iraq had ended all
cooperation with U.N. arms experts.
	   Since then Iraq has gone out of its way to show it is
cooperating.
	   On Sunday, the Iraqi New Agency quoted the head of the country's
monitoring directorate a saying U.N. inspection teams carried out
15 ``announced and surprise visits'' the day before.
	   The visits were carried out by 12 inspection teams using
helicopters in some work, INA quoted Hussam Mohammed Amin as
saying. Amin's group provides the Iraqi escorts for U.N. teams on
their visits to the field.
	   Amin also was quoted as saying a team of nuclear inspectors
collected soil samples from 12 sites around Baghdad. He told INA
that a team of chemical inspectors completed its work and left
Iraq.
	   U.N. officials in Baghdad could not be immediately reached about
Amin's report, but they rarely comment on details of the
inspections.
	   A front-page editorial in the daily Al-Thawra also said the
documents demanded by Butler were an impediment to the Security
Council's promised review.
	   The paper of the ruling Baath Party said that after U.N.
inspectors failed to find weapons that ``do not exist,'' Butler has
``started demanding documents which also do not exist or have no
relations to the disarmament procedures.''
	   After Butler asked for a dozen documents on Iraqi weapons
earlier this month, Iraq said all relevant papers in its possession
had been turned over.

Zoeggler wins luge as Germans dominated at own track
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Corrects Hackl's overall points and first name &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ALTENBERG, Germany (AP) _ Italy's Armin Zoeggeler captured
Sunday's men's singles luge world cup race as the top Germans were
shut out from the podium at their own track.
	   Zoeggeler soared to his 10th career triumph at Altenberg in one
minute, 51.484 for his two heats, edging fellow Italian Norbert
Huber at 1:51.568 and Austria's Markus Prock at 1:51.627.
	   But surprisingly, none of the usually strong Germans cracked the
top six.
	   Georg Hackl, three-time Olympic champion and last week's winner
at Igls, Austria, needed a strong second heat just to finish ninth.
	   "This course isn't for drivers with back problems," Hackl said
as fast starters grabbed all the podium starts. "I started so
slowly on this flat course that I didn't even need to bother to go
downhill anymore. Besides that, I made two driving mistakes."
	   Hackl, known for his driving skills and not his starts, had been
operated on for ruptured discs two years ago. He bounced back to
grab silver at the 1996 World Championships.
	   Zoeggeler and Prock shared the lead in the overall standings
with 155 points while Hackl slipped to fourth with 139.
	   On Saturday, German women swept the top four spots in women's
singles while the American men failed to repeat their commanding
performance at Igls in doubles.
	   After the Americans grabbed the top two spots last week, they
had to settle for a bronze by Chris Thorpe and Gordy Sheer. The
world champions, Tobias and Markus Schiegl, won in 1:25.322.
	   Germany's Barbara Niedernhuber shattered the course record for a
heat in winning the women's singles. She blazed to a new record of
53.858 seconds in her first run, breaking the old mark of 54.78 by
fellow German Sylke Otto by almost a second.
	   Niedernhuber won in a a combined time of one minute 47.823
seconds.

Swiss reject drug legalization
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Heeding government warnings against turning their
pristine Alpine nation into a drug haven, Swiss voters rejected
proposals Sunday to legalize consumption of heroin and other
narcotics.
	   With a majority of results declared by mid-afternoon, not a
single state accepted the proposal. For it to pass, it needed a
majority of the 26 states and an absolute majority of votes.
	   Polls published for Swiss television forecast a 75 percent vote
against the proposed constitutional amendment that ``the
consumption, cultivation or possession of drugs, and their
acquisition for personal use, is not punishable.''
	   The rejection was in contrast to the overwhelming approval given
last year to state distribution of heroin to hardened addicts.
	   The government said that the amendment was misleadingly worded
and did not represent a ``sensible'' drug policy. Ministers said it
was a health risk and would turn Switzerland into a haven for drug
tourists and traffickers and anger neighboring European countries.
	   The government said its current policy of helping hard-core
addicts while clamping down on dealers was best.
	   Church groups, police chiefs, social workers, doctors and other
professionals working with addicts also said the proposal should be
rejected.
	   No other European nation, not even the Netherlands, has
legalized the possession or sale of any drugs or has plans to do
so.
	   The pro-legalization lobby _ a loose left-wing coalition that
gathered the necessary 100,000 signatures to force a referendum _
claimed it would stamp out trafficking and the black market.
	   Backers hoped that sufficient votes in their favor would
persuade the government to relax laws on soft drugs like marijuana.
	   Switzerland has an estimated 30,000 hard drug addicts in its
population of 7 million _ one of Europe's highest rates.
	   A government survey published last week also showed a rise in
cannabis consumption, with 27 percent of people ages 15-39 saying
they had smoked marijuana at least once, compared with 16 percent
in 1992.
	   Voters looked set to give the go-ahead to government plans to
spend dlrs 22.1 billion over 20 years modernizing the national rail
network and linking it to high-speed lines in neighboring
countries.
	   Two new tunnels through the Alps to provide a route for
north-south European cargo traffic between Germany and Italy and to
provide speedy passenger train service.
	   The public already approved the tunnels, but the government also
wanted voters to approve the project's finance package.

China's Jiang Zemin visits northern Japan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Jiang in Hokkaido in 11th graf &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos SEN101-106
 &UR; By KATSUMI KASAHARA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SENDAI, Japan (AP) _ After days of controversy over historical
issues, Chinese President Jiang Zemin left behind the bustle of
Tokyo on Sunday to tour farms and visit a Chinese writer's memorial
in northern Japan.
	   Jiang and his wife, Wang Yeping, laid wreaths on a pristine day
at a monument to Chinese writer and social critic Lu Xun in the
northeastern Japanese city of Sendai.
	   Grandchildren of Lu and Genkuro Fujino, Lu's professor at
Sendai's Tohoku University where the writer studied in 1904, shook
hands with Jiang at the ceremony. Lu is one of China's most popular
and influential authors.
	   Jiang also visited Tohoku University and stood at the lectern of
a classroom where Lu studied.
	   Jiang's trip to the rural north on the fifth day of his historic
visit to Japan marked a break from the diplomatic snafus that
characterized his stay in Tokyo.
	   On Friday, protesters shouted anti-Chinese slogans while Jiang
delivered a speech urging Japan to remind its youth of the horrors
it committed during World War II. Three students were arrested in
scuffles with security guards.
	   Scores of demonstrators, protesting China's nuclear weapons
program and human rights abuses, were dragged away by police.
	   Japan's omission of a full written apology for its brutal
invasion of China has led observers to question whether Jiang's
visit has succeeded in its aim of achieving a full reconciliation
between the two Asian giants. Jiang's repeated references to
Japan's past militarism in recent days have indicated lingering
mistrust of Tokyo.
	   Editorials Sunday in Hong Kong newspapers branded Jiang's visit
a diplomatic failure and said Beijing over-estimated its ability to
secure a full apology for World War II.
	   ``Japan chose to be confrontational with China because it does
not want to see China becoming a major international powerhouse,''
the Chinese-language Ming Pao said.
	   Later, Jiang boarded a plane to Japan's northernmost main island
of Hokkaido, where he visited flower growers and ranchers near the
city of Sapporo, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   Sendai is 302 kilometers (189 miles) northeast of Tokyo, while
Sapporo is 829 kilometers (514 miles) north of the capital.
	   Jiang's trip is the first of a Chinese head of state to Japan
since World War II. The Chinese president departs Monday for
Beijing.

Turkish leader warns against political vacuum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ One of Turkey's leading politicians warned
Sunday that a political vacuum could cripple the domestic battle to
keep Islamists at bay and in the fight abroad for the extradition
of a Kurdish rebel leader.
	   In the midst of Turkey's uphill battle to get Italy to hand over
a Kurdish rebel leader, the government collapsed Wednesday under
the weight of corruption scandals. No party has a majority to
govern alone in the deeply divided parliament.
	   Acting Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit on Sunday called on Turkey's
two center-right parties, led by arch-rivals acting Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz and former Premier Tansu Ciller, to join him in a
governing coalition.
	   ``To deal with internal and foreign questions, Turkey needs, as
soon as possible, a solid and healthy government,'' Bulent Ecevit
told reporters.
	   Ecevit, leader of the Democratic Left Party, warned that the
Islamists might return to power if secular parties don't cooperate.
The military last year forced out the country's first Islamic-led
government.
	   The Islamic party, Virtue, is the largest party in parliament.
	   The military gets a chance Monday to have its say when it meets
with President Suleyman Demirel and the acting cabinet. It is up to
Demirel to name a new premier.
	   Ecevit also said a political vacuum could hamper Turkey's
campaign to get Italy to extradite Abdullah Ocalan.
	   Ocalan leads the autonomy-seeking Kurdistan Workers Party, or
PKK, which has been at war with the Turkish army in the southeast
for 14 years. Italy is refusing to extradite Ocalan because he
could face the death penalty.
	   Ocalan has asked for political asylum, which has enraged Turkey.
But Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema suggested Italy might instead
expel the rebel leader, who tried to enter Italy using a false
passport.
	   ``Asylum has to be examined with great seriousness because
Ocalan is accused of grave crimes and is accused of carrying out
terrorist acts even in Germany,'' D'Alema told Italian state
television on Saturday night.
	   Ocalan was arrested at the Rome airport on Nov. 12 after
arriving from Moscow. Turkey and Germany both have warrants out on
him.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Cabinet ministers called Sunday for
military strikes against Beirut's power and water supplies in
retaliation for the killing of Israeli soldiers by Islamic
guerrillas in south Lebanon.
	   Seven Israeli soldiers have been killed in the past two weeks by
the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia in the security zone which
Israel occupies in south Lebanon to protect its northern border.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a European trip to
England and Spain to deal with a growing debate in Israel over the
losses in Lebanon and calls for a unilateral Israeli withdrawal.
	   The 12-member Cabinet security committee was meeting Sunday in
Jerusalem to hear military and security chiefs report on the
Lebanon situation after Netanyahu returned from visiting soldiers
wounded in the latest fighting.
	   ``We are looking for an arrangement in which we can achieve that
objective of protecting northern Israel without our presence in
Lebanon,'' Netanyahu said Sunday. But he said Cabinet members would
discuss minimizing Israeli troop casualties, not withdrawal.
	   ``As long as we don't have a way of leaving Lebanon in an
arrangement that will guarantee the safety of northern Israel, our
main objective is to protect Israeli soldiers,'' he said.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The West Indies fought back,
but then collapsed again to be 148 for seven wickets at tea on
Sunday, the fourth day of the first test against South Africa at
the Wanderers Stadium.
	   South Africa had a seven run lead on the first innings when it
kept the visitors to 82 for five wickets at lunch in the second
innings.
	   The morning belonged to the South African bowlers, but the West
Indies batsmen Carl Hooper _ back from an injury on Thursday _ and
Ridley Jacobs dug in and scored carefully off a tight attack.
	   Each batsman struck a six, but with the ball keeping lower and
lower with increasing frequency, there were a number of leg before
wicket decisions. It was just such a decision which broke the
partnership of 68 as Jacques Kallis trapped Hooper in front for the
third lbw of the innings, all palpably in front.
	   As so often occurs in a partnership, the other partner fell
immediately, as Jacobs was suckered by Pat Symcox into pulling
across the line, sending the ball straight into the hands of David
Terbrugge at mid-on.
	   After battling for two hours to hold an upper hand, West Indies
lost it at the very end.
	   In the morning, South African bowlers Allan Donald and Shaun
Pollock bowled a tight line and length to make scoring difficult,
as Pollock bowled Philo Wallace and Donald trapped Brian Lara for
seven.

Chinese-language Ming Pao said.
	   But the meals delivered were too small and of ``substandard or
unacceptable quality'' according to a High Court document filed
against the German-based caterer, the paper said. Some contained
sand, pencil lead and wood chips, and a cockroach was found in one
meal, it said.
	   Lufthansa did not immediately return a call for comment Sunday.
Officials at the caterer were not available for comment either.
	   Nutritional Food Production claimed it had lost contracts
totaling 11 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 5.6 million), the
report said. It is seeking 3.3 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
423,000) in estimated lost gross profits and an unspecified amount
in damages, it said.

Italy beats Yugoslavia for third straight world title

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Italy became the first men's team ever to win a
third straight world title Sunday, defeating Yugoslavia 15-12,
15-5, 15-10 in the World Volleyball Championships final.
	   In another final-round match, Cuba beat Brazil 12-15, 15-6,
15-11, 15-12 for the bronze medal in the 24-team men's competition
that started Nov. 13.
	   In the 16-team women's contest held earlier this month, Olympic
champion Cuba also defended its world title. China placed second,
followed by Russia and fourth-place Brazil.
	   Italy's conquest in men's volleyball under its coach at the
time, Julio Velasco, began in 1990 when it overpowered Cuba for its
first world championship in Rio de Janeiro. It retained the title
in 1994 in Greece.
	   After numerous trophies, Velasco's era ended at the 1996
Olympics with the team losing the gold-medal match to the
Netherlands. Current coach Paulo Bebeto, a Brazilian, has since led
the team.
	   On Sunday, the Italians led throughout, except for a brief 2-1
deficit in the second set, before a capacity crowd of 12,000 at
Tokyo's Yoyogi Stadium.
	   The first set saw the score tied four times, at 5, 6, 9 and 12.
Andrea Giani, Andrea Gardini and Marco Brachi led the Italians,
edging their opponents in attacking, retrieving the ball, serving
and blocking.
	   The only time Yugoslavia mounted a real challenge came when the
match was almost over. It saved seven match points as it battled to
stay in the game. At one point, an excited Italian fan ran onto the
court believing his team had won.
	   Team captain, Gardini, had to point and show the man the giant
scoreboard which still read Italy 14, Yugoslavia 10.
	   The victory was revenge for Italy's three straight losses to the
Yugoslavian squad since June last year, first in a World League
match and then in the European Championships six weeks later. The
Italians also lost their quarterfinal round-robin match against
Yugoslavia last week.
	   It also was a happy farewell for Bebeto, who has announced this
is his last game in charge of the national team.
	   ``Finally the tournament is over,'' Bebeto said after Samuele
Papi tipped in the championship point.
	   ``The team has played 12 games here, and some were good and some
others were not so good,'' said Gardini. ``But tonight's game, I
think, was a masterpiece.''
	   Yugoslav coach Zoran Gajic agreed Italy deserved the gold medal.
``The Italians sure were superior in speed and power,'' he said.
	   In the match for the bronze, this year's World League champion
Cuba downed Brazil. The Cubans got off to a slow start but quickly
regained their rhythm in the second set with Angel Dennis and Pavel
Pimienta leading the team in attacking and defense.
	   Dennis collected four points and 23 side-outs, while Pimienta
and team captain Ihosvany Hernanadez combined for 15 block points
and one side-out.
	   Brazil had to play without its ace wing-spiker Gilberto Godoy
Filho, who was suffering from a strained left ankle.
	   ``It was a very tight game,'' said Cuban coach Juan Diaz Marino.
``Our goal was to reach a high level today and keep our game at
that level. We blocked particularly well, which allowed us to score
many points.''
	   Brazilian team captain Nalbert Bitencourt said, ``I think we
only played at 50 percent today after we put too much effort into
the semi-final against Italy.''
	   In the contest for fifth place, 1982 world champion Russia never
was threatened seriously as it beat the Netherlands 15-7, 15-12,
15-12.
	   Despite the win, Russian coach Guennadi Chipouline was not
satisfied. ``It is very regrettable that we missed a medal. Our
players didn't perform as well as I had expected.''
	   The Dutch lacked their usual speed and power with spiker Richard
Schuil and setter Misha Latuhihin sitting on the bench due to
injuries they suffered the last couple of days.
	   Bulgaria defeated Spain 15-12, 15-7, 12-15, 15-11 for seventh
place. ``What was good about our team, I think, was that we had a
high blocking against Spain's spikes,'' said Bulgarian coach
Gueorgui Vassilev.
	   The United States finished ninth with a straight-set victory of
16-14, 15-12, 15-10 over Ukraine.
	   ``I'm really glad the tournament is over. But overall, I'm
pretty pleased,'' said American team captain Lloy Ball. ``We could
have stopped playing once we knew we were no longer fighting for
medals, but we carried on trying.''
	   Argentina beat Canada 15-7, 15-10, 15-6 for 11th place with
Marcos Milinkovic leading Argentina's offense and defense, scoring
seven points and 13 sideouts.
	   It was the last career game for Argentina's retiring setter and
captain Javier Weber. ``I feel somewhat sentimental to retire after
14 long years playing for the national team,'' he said. ``I am glad
to win my last game, but, of course, I feel sad to retire.''

Police launch patrols to save credibility

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Police will begin regular patrols in some
areas of the city in the latest effort to curb rising crime and
rebuild public confidence in a force shaken by mishaps and
scandals.
	   About 250 additional officers have been assigned to patrol areas
of Athens with the highest reported rates of crime beginning
Monday. Plans call for introducing foot patrols, common in places
such as Britain and the United States but untested in Greece.
	   ``The public must feel confidence in the police force,'' Public
Order Minister Philipos Petsalnikos said Saturday. ``This is not a
measure which will disappear in a few days, these policemen will be
around for a long time.''
	   Police credibility has been repeatedly battered over the last
two months by corruption scandals and embarrassing bungles. They
have cost the police chief and public order minister their jobs and
led to the indictment of senior officers.
	   Petsalnikos, appointed a month ago, launched the measure to
fight bank robberies and other forms of street crime, still rising
despite police initiatives.
	   He also plans to scrutinize police officers' income
declarations, amend promotion procedures and create an internal
affairs bureau watchdog group.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The West Indies fought back,
but then collapsed again to be 148 for seven wickets at tea on
Sunday, the fourth day of the first test against South Africa at
the Wanderers Stadium.
	   South Africa had a seven run lead on the first innings when it
kept the visitors to 82 for five wickets at lunch in the second
innings.
	   The morning belonged to the South African bowlers, but the West
Indies batsmen Carl Hooper _ back from an injury on Thursday _ and
Ridley Jacobs dug in and scored carefully off a tight attack.
	   Each batsman struck a six, but with the ball keeping lower and
lower with increasing frequency, there were a number of leg before
wicket decisions. It was just such a decision which broke the
partnership of 68 as Jacques Kallis trapped Hooper in front for the
third lbw of the innings, all palpably in front.
	   As so often occurs in a partnership, the other partner fell
immediately, as Jacobs was suckered by Pat Symcox into pulling
across the line, sending the ball straight into the hands of David
Terbrugge at mid-on.
	   After battling for two hours to hold an upper hand, West Indies
lost it at the very end.
	   In the morning, South African bowlers Allan Donald and Shaun
Pollock bowled a tight line and length to make scoring difficult,
as Pollock bowled Philo Wallace and Donald trapped Brian Lara for
seven.

Spain admits to modest role in the trafficking art looted by the
</HEADLINE>
Nazis &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain under the rule of dictator Gen.
Francisco Franco played only a minor role in trafficking art stolen
by the Nazis from Holocaust victims, according to a government
report quoted in a Sunday newspaper.
	   The report will be presented this week at a Washington
conference on the billions of dollars worth of art looted by the
Nazis that has since found its way into public and private
collections around the world, leading daily El Pais said.
	   The report recognizes that Franco's government protected five
alleged art smugglers from extradition, and that 15 others operated
in Spain, the newspaper said.
	   But this gave Spain only a ``modest'' role in the looted art
network, since an estimated 2,000 art traffickers worked throughout
Europe, the report said, according to El Pais.
	   The report details the protection given to Alois Miedl, a
wealthy German banker who had good contacts with collectors around
the world and a personal friendship with Hitler's right-hand-man
Herman Goering.
	   Miedl entered Spain in 1944 with 22 paintings _ including a Van
Dyck, two Corots and a David _ allegedly stolen from the collection
of Dutch Jewish millionaire Jacques Goudstikker.
	   In the years that followed Franco refused to bow to pressure to
extradite Miedl from the Dutch government, aided by the allies.
	   The whereabouts of the paintings is now a mystery, El Pais said.
	   Spain is among the 44 nations and 13 nongovernmental
organizations to take part in a four-day Washington conference
starting Monday and is expected to draft guidelines regarding how
to deal with art that may have been stolen by the Nazis.
	   The Nazis, beginning in 1933 in Germany, looted an estimated
dlrs 9 billion to dlrs 14 billion in art and other assets from Jews
in 20 countries or regions they occupied. The current value of the
assets is estimated at dlrs 90 billion to dlrs 140 billion.
	   Switzerland's two largest commercial banks have recently agreed
to pay dlrs 1.25 billion to Holocaust survivors and their heirs for
lost assets.

Portugal holds concerts for babies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Forget about ``Mary Had a Little Lamb''
or ``Rockabye Baby'' _ it's time to get children hooked on
classics, according to one music professor who is conducting a
series of concerts for babies.
	   The audience _ age limit 6 _ sit on the floor or snuggle up in
their cots while musicians stroll around the room playing Bach,
Mozart or Debussy, the Portuguese daily Diario de Noticias reported
Sunday.
	   The concerts, running until May in Leiria, 120 kilometers (75
miles) north of the capital Lisbon, aim to both acquaint very young
children with classical music and test their reaction to it.
	   ``Music is like language, sounds have a grammar of their own.
The sooner children penetrate this world, the better they'll
understand it,'' conductor Paulo Lameiro told the newspaper.
	   Lameiro's venture _ unprecedented in Portugal _ was inspired by
U.S. professor Edwin Gordon's experiments on music psychology,
according to Diario de Noticias.
	   And there is also the talent-spotting angle.
	   ``In each thousand children, there is one with the same aptitude
as Mozart. The challenge is finding that child,'' Lameiro added.

Juve, in free-fall, loses at Bologna for first time since '74
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Bologna did all its scoring in the opening half hour
Sunday and routed free-falling Juventus of Turin 3-0 for its first
home win in 24 years over the Italian League's two-time defending
champion.
	   Michele Paramatti, veteran striker Giuseppe Signori and Davide
Fontolan found the target early for Bologna, while Juventus was
shut out for the third straight game since top striker Alessandro
Del Piero was lost for the season with a knee ligament injury.
	   But Juve did not lose much ground in the standings, because
league leader Fiorentina and AC Milan were also both victims of
poor outings.
	   Fiorentina settled for its first draw of the season, 0-0 at
Bari, while Milan was trampled 4-0 by AC Parma as Argentine striker
Hernan Crespo scored two goals to raise his tally to seven in four
games.
	   Internazionale of Milan continued its slow crawl up the
standings by rallying with two goals in the last 15 minutes to beat
lowly Salernitana 2-1. Argentine midfielders Diego Simeone _ off an
assist from Roberto Baggio _ and Javier Zanetti saved Inter after
Salernitana took the lead on David Di Michele's first career goal.
	   Despite seeing its league-best attack silenced, Fiorentina held
onto first place with 22 points. Parma jumped three spots up to
second with 19 points, one ahead of Juventus and Milan.
	   Inter and Bologna, which boasts a nine-game unbeatean streak,
are both another point back.
	   Elsewhere Sunday, Japanese midfielder Hidetoshi Nakata tallied
twice to lead Perugia past Piacenza 2-0; Empoli _ docked two
standings points by the league's disciplinary commission this week
for allegedly trying to influence a referee earlier this season _
beat Vicenza 1-0; Udinese edged Cagliari 2-1, and Sampdoria of
Genoa and last-place Venezia drew 0-0.
	   At night, Italian Cup holder Lazio of Rome looked to extend its
four-game derby winning streak against AS Roma.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ With stunning defeat in state elections
casting a shadow on his government, Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee reassured foreign business Sunday that political shakeups
would not affect planned measures to open markets.
	   ``The volatility of Indian democracy will have no fundamental
impact on the process of economic reforms in the country,''
Vajpayee told hundreds of Indian and foreign business leaders at an
economic summit organized by the World Economic Forum.
	   The government had ``depoliticized the economic agenda,'' he
said.
	   Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party suffered a series of
embarrassing setbacks in the state elections _ losing hold of
governments in New Delhi, site of the federal capital, and the
western Rajasthan state. The BJP also failed to dislodge the ruling
Congress Party in the central state of Madhya Pradesh.

Ten die in minibus-truck head on collision in South Africa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS details throughout; no pick up &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PIETERSBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Ten people were killed in a
head-on collision between a minibus and a truck near Pietersburg,
about 320 kilometers (200 miles) north of Johannesburg, police said
Sunday.
	   The accident happened on Saturday on a secondary road to
Duiwelskloof, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Pietersburg,
according to police spokesman Superintendent Phuti Setati.
	   Eight people died on the scene and two others died later at the
Mankweng Hospital, Setati said.
	   Four people who were injured were admitted to provincial
hospitals.
	   The truck driver was slightly injured. It was not clear if all
the dead were passengers in the minibus.
	   The cause of the accident was unknown, Setati said.
	   High speeds _ in excess of 120 kilometers an hour (75 miles an
hour) _ and drunken driving are blamed for high death rates on
South African roads, where nearly a third of the fatalities occur
to pedestrians.
	   A major means of transport for many poor South Africans are
minibuses called taxis, and President Nelson Mandela's government
has been trying to incorporate them into a regulated system of
licensing. But taxi fleet owners have resisted the procedures.
	   Over the six-week Christmas holiday period last year, more than
900 people died in road accidents.

Grenada foreign minister resigns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ Grenadian Foreign Minister Raphael
Fletcher resigned Sunday, citing differences with Prime Minister
Keith Mitchell over an audit of government finances.
	   ``This is something that grows, and there comes a time when you
feel you cannot take any more. I reached that point,'' Fletcher
told a local radio station.
	   In addition to Fletcher's resignation, government backbencher
Grace Duncan hss confirmed that she will move to the opposition
side of the table when parliament sits on Friday, eliminating the
ruling New National Party's two-seat majority in the House of
Representatives.
	   Duncan was banished from the Cabinet in 1997 over a disagreement
with Mitchell.
	   NNP leaders planned a meeting late Sunday to discuss Fletcher's
resignation.
	   Fletcher said he recently had asked Mitchell about an audit of
the Ministry of Communications and Works, which is headed by a
longtime friend of Mitchell's, Gregory Bowen.
	   The audit found cost overruns and payment of ``exorbitant''
salaries and fees for work on some projects where some government
friends and supporters were hired.
	   ``When I asked the question of the prime minister, he said that
was a private matter. It cannot be a private matter when the issue
surrounds the actions of government,'' Fletcher said.

ROME: against AS Roma.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Bologna 3, Juventus 0 &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   At Bologna, Juventus (5-3-3) clearly missed injured French
midfielder Didier Deschamps and suspended Uruguayan center back
Paolo Montero. Paramatti slipped in unmarked to head in Signori's
free kick just three minutes after kickoff, and Signori made it 2-0
himself four minutes later.
	   The most glaring defensive lapse came in the 28th, when Ciro
Ferrara gave the ball away deep in his own end, allowing Fontolan
to score with a shot under the crossbar after a nice exchange with
Swedish striker Kennet Andersson.
	   Bologna improved to 4-5-2.
 &UR; Bari 0, Fiorentina 0 &QC; 
	   At Bari, it was the hosts (2-8-1) who produced the better
scoring chances, though South African striker Phil Masinga was
never able to convert. Fiorentina (7-1-3) entered the game with a
league-leading 22 goals _ 11 by Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta
_ but had trouble in attack against Bari's five-man defensive
line.
 &UR; Parma 4, Milan 0 &QC; 
	   At Parma, Enrico Chiesa opened the scoring in the 25th minute,
Crespo tallied in the 36th and 60th, and French midfielder Alain
Boghossian fixed the final score in injury time as Parma improved
to 5-4-2. Milan fell to 5-3-3.
 &UR; Inter 2, Salernitana 1 &QC; 
	   At Milan, Di Michele sent a diagonal shot into the net in the
43rd minute after Inter's Dutch winger Aron Winter gave up the
ball. But Inter rallied to win, much as it did Wednesday, when
Baggio scored twice late to give the team a 3-1 Champions League
victory over Spain's Real Madrid. Inter is 5-2-4, Salernitana _
which had won three of four _ is 3-1-7.
 &UR; Perugia 2, Piacenza 0 &QC; 
	   At Perugia, Nakata hit the mark in the 20th and 50th minutes,
both off assists from Croat midfielder Milan Rapajic as the hosts
raised their record to 4-3-4 and dropped Piacenza to 3-2-6.
 &UR; Udinese 2, Cagliari 1 &QC; 
	   At Udine, Paolo Poggi knocked in a rebound in the 32nd minute
and Brazilian striker Marcio Amoroso headed in the second _ his
eighth on the year _ in the second half for Udinese (4-4-3).
Tiziano De Patre pulled one back late for the Sardinians (4-2-5).
 &UR; Empoli 1, Vicenza 0 &QC; 
	   At Empoli, striker Marco Carparelli slotted in a 10-meter (yard)
low shot in the 31st minute for Empoli (3-4-4). Vicenza (2-4-5) had
Uruguay's Marcelo Oterio expelled in the 60th.

Saddam's half-brother heading for Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Ending weeks of speculation on whether he would
join the ranks of dissidents, the half-brother of Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein left Switzerland on Sunday, bound for Jordan and
ultimately Iraq.
	   Jordanian officials said Barzan al-Tikriti was due to arrive in
Amman on a Royal Jordanian flight from Geneva at 6.40p.m. local
time, on his way to Iraq. Under U.N. sanctions there are no direct
flights to Baghdad.
	   Al-Tikriti, 46, who headed Iraq's mission at the United Nations
in Geneva for 10 years, was among 30 Iraqi ambassadors and other
diplomats recalled to Baghdad over the summer.
	   But he delayed his return, citing the illness of his wife,
Ahlam, who had been under treatment for breast cancer in
Switzerland. She died earlier this month.
	   Although Al-Tikriti denied wanting to join the Iraqi opposition,
there were consistent rumors from the Iraqi opposition movement
that he wanted to go into exile. That would have proved a major
blow to Saddam.
	   He had until the end of November to leave Geneva under Swiss
laws allowing U.N. diplomats to stay on for three months after the
end of their tenure.

Jewish leader warns against quick fix to Holocaust restitution
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
 &UR; With AP Photo

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Jewish leader Sunday cautioned countries
attending an international conference on Holocaust-era assets to
remain patient, noting that full restitution of lost Jewish
property could take ten years.
	   Jewish Agency chairman Avraham Burg, who will head the World
Jewish Restitution Organization's delegation to the Washington
conference, said that the task of identifying and recovering
property looted during the Holocaust was greater than conference
members were willing to admit.
	   ``This committee shouldn't try to solve the problems quickly and
go home,'' Burg said at a news conference Sunday. ``We're talking
about a process that will take at least a decade.''
	   The four-day conference was to open Monday with a speech by U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Delegations from 42 nations
will discuss looted art, insurance, communal property and opening
of files belonging to private companies and public agencies.
	   Burg accused some nations of trying to strike deals for partial
restitution rather than see a full investigation into millions of
dollars worth of Jewish assets looted by the Nazis. He said others,
including the Vatican, which will not attend the conference, have
refused to cooperate outright.
	   ``We know of a church near Prague that has 3,000 embroidered
Torah scroll curtains that we can't get to,'' he said, adding that
the Vatican holds four tons of silver religious articles looted
from Jewish communities in Galicia, which stradles the
Polish-Ukraine border. France's Louvre museum, he said, has 2,000
works of art stolen from Holocaust victims.
	   Meanwhile, Jewish humanitarian groups, lawyers and concentration
camp survivors were battling over distribution of the dlrs 1.25
billion paid by Swiss banks to settle Holocaust-related lawsuits.
	   Burg said the WJRO would demand authority to negotiate on behalf
of individual Jewish claimants and the Jewish people as a whole at
an as yet unscheduled hearing before a U.S. Federal District Court
judge in Brooklyn, N.Y. to determine disbursement arrangements.
	   The WJRO has hit upon a disbursement formula in which assets
traced to individuals would be turned over to survivors or family
members, while non traceable assets and restitution money would be
used for Holocaust education and to help needy survivors and Jewish
communities in the Diaspora.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   A very complex and potentially wet and windy weather pattern is
forecast for the local region through Monday and may affect the
region throughout the week. A middle to upper level trough has
moved from the eastern U.S. to a position from Hispaniola northeast
across the Atlantic this morning with an associated cold front from
the south central Bahamas northeast into the central Atlantic.
	   A broad and elongated surface trough has developed southeast of
both of these features and can be seen on satellite imagery with
numerous showers and thunderstorms extending from the Netherlands
Antilles northeastward across the Leeward Islands and northeast
into the central Atlantic. This surface trough will be a focus for
very deep moisture over the next several days with widespread
shower and thunderstorm activity. Northeast winds occurring west of
this surface trough have built into our local area during the past
24 hours and will increase Sunday night to produce breezy
conditions, scattered to numerous showers and building coastal
seas.
	   Northeast winds and ample moisture across our local area Sunday
are expected to combine with an unstable atmosphere produce by the
upper trough to our northwest to produce widespread showers with
widely scattered thunderstorms. As the winds increase look for
showers to begin increasing across the local Atlantic and move
southwest over our islands. Afternoon thunderstorm clusters will
develop over southwest interior Puerto Rico to produce heavy
rainfall and flash flooding potential. Showers and thunderstorms
may become very numerous across the Virgin Islands through Monday
as this area remains closest to the surface trough and the deepest
moisture.

Shearer again says he's staying at Newcastle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEWCASTLE, England (AP) _ Alan Shearer has again denied rumors
he's set to leave Newcastle.
	   Shearer, who signed with Newcastle for a record
15-million-pounds (dlrs 24.75 million) two years ago, tried Sunday
to squash speculation he's leaving St. James' Park, which manager
Ruud Gullit suggested on Saturday.
	   ``I couldn't understand why he (Gullit) said it and we had a
chat on Friday,'' Shearer said. ``I just said, `Look this
speculation has got to end.'
	   ``It's got to stop somewhere. The chairman says I'm not going,
the manager says I'm not for sale and I say I'm staying. I really
don't know where the speculation comes from and, as far as I'm
concerned and the club is concerned, we'd like to put an end to it
all.''
	   ``For the third time this season, I've had to come out and say
that I'm staying at Newcastle.''
	   Shearer, who is out with an injury, said this was the last time
he would repeat his intentions to stay.
	   ``I won't be happening again because I'm not going to do it
again. I'm sick of doing it and I shouldn't have to do it.''
	   Asked if he would be start next season with Newcastle, he
replied, ``Yes I will.''

Nation of Islam leader meets Gadhafi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Louis Farrakhan, the controversial leader of
the Nation of Islam, met with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on
Sunday and congratulated him on his recovery from a hip injury,
state-run Libyan radio reported.
	   Improved health will enable Gadhafi to ``carry on his leading
role in the service of Islamic causes in the world,'' Farrakhan was
quoted as saying by the radio, which was monitored by the British
Broadcasting Corp.
	   The report did not indicate in which Libyan city the meeting
took place.
	   Gadhafi underwent surgery last July after injuring his hip,
reportedly while exercising.
	   The visit was Farrakhan's fifth to Libya in the past three
years. He most recently visited in December 1997.
	   It was not immediately clear how Farrakhan arrived to Libya or
how long he would stay.
	   Most visitors arrive by ferry from Malta or travel overland from
Egypt or Tunisia because U.N. sanctions imposed in 1992 ban air
travel to and from the country.
	   Farrakhan has called repeatedly for an end to the sanctions,
which were imposed to try and force Gadhafi to surrender two
Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   Citing the sanctions and U.S. regulations, the Treasury
Department prohibited Farrakhan from accepting a dlrs 250,000 prize
he was awarded by Gadhafi in September 1996 for human rights work.
The Treasury also barred his group from accepting Gadhafi's offer
of a dlrs 1 billion gift for Nation of Islam activities.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa on Sunday rolled
over the West Indies tail to dismiss them for 170 in their second
innings, with Shaun Pollock grasping a 100 test wicket feat like
his father did in the 1960s.
	   Rain ended the match early.
	   The action on the fourth day of the first Test at Wanderers
stadium left South Africa just 164 runs short to win the first test
match.
	   The West Indies had fought back to be 148 for five wickets just
before tea, but then South Africa's patience and good line paid
dividends.
	   Carl Hooper and Ridley Jacobs had dug in and scored carefully
off a tight attack when Jacques Kallis trapped Hooper leg before
wicket, one of four such decisions in the innings. The tourists had
already been held to 82 for five wickets at lunch.
	   Pollock was again the chief destroyer, taking four wickets for
49. By coincidence, he attained 1,000 career runs and 100 test
wickets in the same test.
	   His father, Peter Pollock, took a 100 test wicket mark back in
the 1960s. Only one other father-son team has ever done that _
Lance and Chris Cairns of New Zealand.
	   South Africa's target seems achievable.
	   But the type of leg before wicket decisions which went against
the West Indies on Sunday, with increasing numbers of low balls
hurled on the pitch, could weigh against South Africa on Monday.
	   South African bowlers proved the value of sustained accuracy and
a persistently nagging length. It was the Allan Donald- Pollock
combination which struck early as Pollock bowled Philo Wallace and
Donald trapped Brian Lara for seven.
	   After Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Stuart Williams and Clayton
Lambert were gone, Hooper and Jacobs rebuilt the innings.
	   For a long while, it looked as if the West Indies might have
pulled the game beyond the reach of the home side.
	   But after the Kallis blow to dismiss Hooper, the other partner
fell immediately, as Jacobs was suckered by Pat Symcox into pulling
across the line, sending the ball straight into the hands of David
Terbrugge at mid-on.
	   The West Indies went to tea at 148 for seven
	   After that, the remaining three wickets did not look like
providing too much resistance.
	   Before the South Africans were able to start their chase for the
required runs, a storm broke over Johannesburg, making play for the
rest of the day impossible.

Nation of Islam leader meets Gadhafi

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Louis Farrakhan, the controversial leader of
the Nation of Islam, met with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on
Sunday and congratulated him on his recovery from a hip injury,
state-run Libyan radio reported.
	   Improved health will enable Gadhafi to ``carry on his leading
role in the service of Islamic causes in the world,'' Farrakhan was
quoted as saying by the radio, which was monitored by the British
Broadcasting Corp.
	   Later, state-run television showed Gadhafi _ dressed in a brown
robe and holding a cane _ meeting Farrakhan at his ceremonial tent
in the Libyan capital Tripoli. The broadcast was monitored in
Cairo.
	   Gadhafi underwent surgery last July after injuring his hip,
reportedly while exercising.
	   The visit was Farrakhan's fifth to Libya in the past three
years. He most recently visited in December 1997.
	   It was not immediately clear how Farrakhan arrived to Libya or
how long he would stay.
	   Most visitors arrive by ferry from Malta or travel overland from
Egypt or Tunisia because U.N. sanctions imposed in 1992 ban air
travel to and from the country.
	   Farrakhan has called repeatedly for an end to the sanctions,
which were imposed to try and force Gadhafi to surrender two
Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   Citing the sanctions and U.S. regulations, the Treasury
Department prohibited Farrakhan from accepting a dlrs 250,000 prize
he was awarded by Gadhafi in September 1996 for human rights work.
The Treasury also barred his group from accepting Gadhafi's offer
of a dlrs 1 billion gift for Nation of Islam activities.

Schroeder's government at odds over energy taxes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Energy taxes emerged as a new source of friction
in Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's government over the weekend,
adding to disarray that has marked the new leader's debut.
	   In comments published Sunday, leaders of Schroeder's Social
Democrats warned their government ally, the Greens party, to bury
calls for a greater hike in gasoline prices than agreed with
Schroeder.
	   Gerhard Glogowski, the Social Democratic governor of Lower
Saxony, said both sides had ``a clear agreement'' on an increase of
six pfennigs (3.5 cents) per liter next year. ``That's the way it
will have to stay,'' he told Welt am Sonntag newspaper.
	   Schroeder, in office less than five weeks, has failed to chart a
clear course between pro-market economic modernization and defense
of the social welfare state.
	   While his ambitious finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine, proposes
pumping up the economy and creating jobs by putting more money in
average earners' pockets, some Greens have openly called for bolder
tax cuts to help business.
	   Schroeder himself added to the confusion by wavering on tax
policy.
	   The Greens co-leader in parliament, Kerstin Mueller, touched off
the latest debate by threatening car-loving Germans with further
rises in gasoline prices in the future.
	   The Social Democrats' parliamentary leader, Peter Struck,
responded by calling the idea ``completely wrong'' and demanding
``an immediate end to the debate.''
	   The government has agreed on a first set of higher taxes on
energy, also including natural gas, electricity and heating oil.
	   Seen as a way to promote conservation, the taxes are being used
to finance a cut in high social security taxes paid by employers
that add to the cost of German products and hurt competitiveness.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Jewish leader Sunday cautioned countries
attending an international conference on Holocaust-era assets to
remain patient, noting that full restitution of lost Jewish
property could take ten years.
	   Jewish Agency chairman Avraham Burg, who will head the World
Jewish Restitution Organization's delegation to the Washington
conference, said that the task of identifying and recovering
property looted during the Holocaust was greater than conference
members were willing to admit.
	   ``This committee shouldn't try to solve the problems quickly and
go home,'' Burg said at a news conference Sunday. ``We're talking
about a process that will take at least a decade.''
	   The four-day conference was to open Monday with a speech by U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Delegations from 42 nations
will discuss looted art, insurance, communal property and opening
of files belonging to private companies and public agencies.
	   Burg accused some nations of trying to strike deals for partial
restitution rather than see a full investigation into millions of
dollars worth of Jewish assets looted by the Nazis. He said others,
including the Vatican have refused to cooperate outright.

Zimbabwean Price wins Zimbabwe Open at nine under par

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Zimbabwe's Nick Price on Sunday won the
Zimbabwe Open, shooting a final round of a nine-under-par 63 on the
Royal Harare golf course for a 72-hole total of 17-under-par, or
271.
	   South Africa's Tjaart van der Walt was second, five shots back
on 276 after a closing 68.
	   South African Hennie Walters, who led by one shot on Saturday,
took third with 278 after a 71.
	   Price, who started the day in second place, raced to the lead
after two birdies in the first three holes. Then an eagle three at
the 560 yard (meter) sixth extended the gap to three shots.
	   Turning in 30, he made three more birdies on the home stretch.
	   Price left Zimbabwean compatriots Tony Johnstone and Mark
McNulty wallowing in his wake. They both finished on 281.
	   In winning his home country tournament, Price became the first
player to successfully defend the title. He took the first prize of
dlrs 15,000, a minuscule purse by the usual standards of the
world's eighth-ranking golfer.
	   ``There's nothing quite like winning at home, and a national
championship is a national championship,'' Price said.
	   The home win left a confident Price as a top contender in the
Million Dollar golf tournament teeing off Thursday at neighboring
South Africa's Sun City resort.

Moderate Tamil parties welcome rebels' talk offer, government
</HEADLINE>
cautious &QL; 
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's main political party on
Sunday welcomed the Tamil Tiger rebels' offer for peace talks, but
the government seemed cautious.
	   ``The long awaited response has now come out,'' Joseph
Pararajasingham, one of the top leaders of the Tamil United
Liberation Front, said in a statement. The TULF, a political party,
urged the government to respond positively.
	   There was no official statement from the government, but the
state-run Sunday Observer said the government was cautious about
the talks offer.
	   ``Government officials would not take (a) definite position on
the Tiger leader's statement,'' the paper said. ``They argued that,
given the fluid situation of the conflict, the government needed to
be flexible on its stance on various aspects.''
	   But hope for an end to hostilities was marred Sunday when Tamil
Tiger guerrillas attacked a Sri Lankan army patrol and killed eight
soldiers in the eastern town of Trincomalee, 230 kilometers (140
miles) west of Colombo.
	   The Tamil rebel commander on Friday said he was ready for peace
talks to end the 15-year war that has killed more than 57,000
people and disintegrated this island nation off India's southern
coast.
	   ``We have not closed the door for peace. We are open to the
civilized method of resolving conflict through rational dialogue,''
Velupillai Prabhakaran, leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, said in his annual broadcast over the clandestine Voice of
Tigers.
	   ``We aspire to live in peace fully with freedom and dignity,
without the interference of anyone, in our own soil in our
motherland, where we were born and bred,'' he said. ``We, too, are
human beings.''
	   Last year, by contrast, Prabhakaran told his followers that
liberation was not a gift, but is ``achieved by shedding blood and
through hard struggle.''
	   Prabhakaran founded the Tigers in 1976 and commands the
organization alone and unchallenged.
	   Rebels say that Tamils, who are 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 18.5
million people, are discriminated against and can only prosper in a
homeland not dominated by the Sinhalese, who make up 76 percent of
the population.
	   On Sunday, Prabhakaran said he preferred third-party mediation,
and would not accept preconditions such as disarming.
	   In the past, the government has demanded the Tigers relinquish
some weapons before talks could begin and has said it would accept
an outside facilitator, but not third-party mediation.
	   The government has been skeptical about previous peace signals
from the Tigers, known as the LTTE, since the rebels abruptly ended
a three-month cease-fire and broke off peace talks in 1995.
	   Douglas Devananda, a former rebel leader who now heads the Eelam
Peoples Democratic Front, said his group was in favor of starting
peace talks as soon as possible.
	   ``Now again the LTTE leader has said that the doors are open for
talks. Even the government leaders also say that the doors are open
for talks. So why can't the two sides start talking,'' Devananda
said in a statement.

Swiss reject drug legalization

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with final results; RECASTS and ADDS byline &QL;

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Heeding government warnings against turning their
pristine Alpine nation into a drug haven, Swiss voters Sunday threw
out proposals to legalize consumption of heroin and other
narcotics.
	   Some 74 percent of voters rejected the proposed constitutional
amendment that ``the consumption, cultivation or possession of
drugs, and their acquisition for personal use, is not punishable.''
	   Twenty-six percent _ or 454,404 people _ voted in favor.
	   To the government's relief, voters also gave the go-ahead to a
finance package of 30.5 billion francs (dlrs 22.1 billion) to link
Switzerland to Europe's high speed train network and build two vast
Alpine rail tunnels.
	   The project is key to a planned transport accord between the
European Union and non-member Switzerland. EU ministers meet Monday
for more discussions on the deal.
	   The Swiss electorate is summoned to the polls three or four
times a year over a huge range of subjects _ complex new corn laws
and labor laws were also voted on Sunday. Turnout was only 37
percent.
	   Last year the Swiss achieved a world first in voting
overwhelmingly in favor of state distribution of heroin to hardened
addicts.
	   But they balked at the prospect of a drugs free-for-all.
	   The government opposed the plan, saying it was a health risk and
would turn Switzerland into a haven for drug tourists and
traffickers and anger neighboring European countries.
	   The government said its current policy of helping hardcore
addicts while clamping down on dealers was the best way ahead.
	   Church groups, police chiefs, social workers, doctors and other
professionals working with addicts held similar views.
	   Felix Gutweiler, a pioneer of the heroin distribution program,
said the outcome clearly showed that the Swiss population rejected
extreme solutions to the drug problem.
	   No other European nation, not even the Netherlands, has
legalized the possession or sale of any drugs or has plans to do
so.
	   The pro-legalization lobby _ a loose left-wing coalition which
gathered the necessary 100,000 signatures to force a referendum _
claimed it would stamp out trafficking and the black market.
	   Backers hoped that sufficient votes in their favor would
convince the government to relax laws on soft drugs like cannabis.
	   Switzerland has an estimated 30,000 hard drug addicts in its
population of 7 million _ one of Europe's highest rates.
	   A government survey published last week showed a rise in
cannabis consumption. It revealed that 27 percent of people aged
15-39 said they had smoked cannabis at least once. This compared
with 16 percent in 1992.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Schroeder quotes. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Energy taxes emerged as a new source of friction
in Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's government over the weekend,
adding to disarray that has marked the new leader's debut.
	   In comments published Sunday, leaders of Schroeder's Social
Democrats warned their government ally, the Greens party, to bury
calls for a greater hike in gasoline prices than agreed with
Schroeder.
	   Gerhard Glogowski, the Social Democratic governor of Lower
Saxony, said both sides had ``a clear agreement'' on an increase of
six pfennigs (3.5 cents) per liter next year. ``That's the way it
will have to stay,'' he told Welt am Sonntag newspaper.
	   Schroeder, in office less than five weeks, appealed for patience
during a labor union meeting Sunday.
	   He said his government was moving ``step by step'' but did not
lack courage, he told delegates of the powerful IG Metall
industrial union.
	   Schroeder has failed to chart a clear course between pro-market
economic modernization and defense of the social welfare state.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain under the rule of dictator Gen.
Francisco Franco played only a minor role in trafficking art stolen
by the Nazis from Holocaust victims, according to a government
report quoted in a Sunday newspaper.
	   The report will be presented at an upcoming conference in
Washington to discuss what to do about billions of dollars worth of
art looted by the Nazis that has since found its way into public
and private collections around the world, leading daily El Pais
said.
	   The paper said the report recognizes that Franco's government
protected five alleged art smugglers from extradition, and that a
further 15 operated in Spain.
	   But this gave Spain only a ``modest'' role in the looted art
network, as there were an estimated 2,000 art traffickers working
in Europe as a whole, the report concluded according to El Pais.
	   The report details the protection given to Alois Miedl, a
wealthy German banker who had good contacts with collectors around
the world and a personal friendship with Hitler's right-hand-man
Herman Goering.
	   Miedl entered Spain in 1944 with 22 paintings _ including a Van
Dyck, two Corots and a David _ allegedly stolen from the collection
of Dutch Jewish millionaire Jacques Goudstikker.
	   In the years that followed Franco refused to bow to pressure to
extradite Miedl from the Dutch government, aided by the allies.
	   The whereabouts of the paintings is now a mystery, El Pais said.
	   Spain is among the 44 nations and 13 nongovernmental
organizations to take part in the four-day Washington conference
due to start Monday and expected to draft guidelines regarding how
to deal with art that may have been stolen by the Nazis.
	   The Nazis, beginning in 1933 in Germany, looted an estimated
dlrs 9 billion to dlrs 14 billion in art and other assets from Jews
in 20 countries or regions they occupied. The current value of the
assets is estimated at dlrs 90 billion to dlrs 140 billion.
	   Switzerland's two largest commercial banks have recently agreed
to pay dlrs 1.25 billion to Holocaust survivors and their heirs for
lost assets.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Manchester United got the winning goal in the 77th
minute from Nicky Butt Sunday at Old Trafford to beat Leeds 3-2 and
move back into second place a point by leaders Aston Villa.
	   With the victory, Manchester United has 28 points _ one fewer
than Villa's 29. Villa played a 2-2 draw Saturday at Nottingham
Forest.
	   In late matches Sunday, Middlesbrough was at Arsenal and
Blackburn played at Liverpool. In the Scottish League Cup, Rangers
faced St. Johnstone at Celtic Park.
	   Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink gave Leeds a 1-0 edge in the 29th, but
the Reds went up 2-1 on goals by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Roy
Keane. Harry Kewell leveled for Leeds in the 52nd, setting the
stage for Butts' winner.
	   In other Premier League games Saturday: Charlton 1, Everton 2;
Chelsea 1, Sheffield Wednesday 1; Coventry 1, Leicester 1;
Newcastle 3, Wimbledon 1; Southampton 0, Derby 1; West Ham 2,

	   In his first match with Newcastle after a 7-million pound (dlrs
11.5 million) transfer from Everton, Duncan Ferguson scored twice
at St. James' Park in a 3-1 come-from behind win over Wimbledon.
	   Chelsea was held to a disappointing 1-1 home draw with Sheffield
Wednesday, but the Blues still equaled a club record of 19 games
without a loss.

Jewish leader warns against quick fix to Holocaust restitution
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Jewish leader Sunday cautioned countries
attending an international conference on Holocaust-era assets to
remain patient, noting that full restitution of lost Jewish
property could take ten years.
	   Jewish Agency chairman Avraham Burg, who will head the World
Jewish Restitution Organization's delegation to the Washington
conference, said that the task of identifying and recovering
property looted during the Holocaust was greater than conference
members were willing to admit.
	   ``This committee shouldn't try to solve the problems quickly and
go home,'' Burg said at a news conference Sunday. ``We're talking
about a process that will take at least a decade.''
	   The four-day conference was to open Monday with a speech by U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Delegations from 42 nations
will discuss looted art, insurance, communal property and opening
of files belonging to private companies and public agencies.
	   Burg accused some nations of trying to strike deals for partial
restitution rather than see a full investigation into millions of
dollars worth of Jewish assets looted by the Nazis. He said others,
including the Vatican have refused to cooperate outright.
	   ``We know of a church near Prague that has 3,000 embroidered
Torah scroll curtains that we can't get to,'' he said, adding that
the Vatican holds four tons of silver religious articles looted
from Jewish communities in Galicia, which stradles the
Polish-Ukraine border. France's Louvre museum, he said, has 2,000
works of art stolen from Holocaust victims.
	   Meanwhile, Jewish humanitarian groups, lawyers and concentration
camp survivors were battling over distribution of the dlrs 1.25
billion paid by Swiss banks to settle Holocaust-related lawsuits.
	   Burg said the WJRO would demand authority to negotiate on behalf
of individual Jewish claimants and the Jewish people as a whole at
an as yet unscheduled hearing before a U.S. Federal District Court
judge in Brooklyn, New York, to determine disbursement
arrangements.
	   The WJRO has hit upon a disbursement formula in which assets
traced to individuals would be turned over to survivors or family
members, while untraceable assets and restitution money would be
used for Holocaust education and to help needy survivors and Jewish
communities in the Diaspora.

Saddam's half-brother heading for Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Ending weeks of speculation on whether he would
join the ranks of dissidents, the half-brother of Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein left Switzerland on Sunday, bound for Jordan and
ultimately Iraq.
	   Jordanian officials said Barzan al-Tikriti was due to arrive
Sunday night in Amman on his way to Iraq. Under U.N. sanctions,
there are no direct flights to Baghdad.
	   Al-Tikriti, 46, who headed Iraq's mission at the United Nations
in Geneva for 10 years, was among 30 Iraqi ambassadors and other
diplomats recalled to Baghdad over the summer.
	   But he delayed his return, citing the illness of his wife,
Ahlam, who had been under treatment for breast cancer in
Switzerland. She died earlier this month.
	   Although Al-Tikriti denied wanting to join the Iraqi opposition,
there were consistent rumors from the movement that he wanted to go
into exile. That would have proved a major blow to Saddam.
	   He had until the end of November to leave Geneva under Swiss
laws letting U.N. diplomats stay on for three months after the end
of their tenure.

German aide hints at prisoner swap with Iran
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with foreign ministry spokesman. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany could swap prisoners convicted of an
Iranian-ordered murder in Berlin for a German sentenced to death in
Iran, a German official was quoted Sunday as saying.
	   Germany will not be blackmailed, but it could order the release
of four men held for the 1992 assassination of Kurdish Iranian
dissidents ``for overriding state interests,'' Gerd Poppe, the
Foreign Ministry's human rights commissioner, told the newspaper
Der Tagesspiegel.
	   Iran has suggested in return it could waive the death sentence
of German businessman Helmut Hofer, 56, convicted by a Tehran court
of having sex with an unmarried Iranian woman.
	   ``I don't consider political presents appropriate,'' Poppe said.
``We simply must find a compromise satisfactory for all involved.''
	   But Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann said Poppe's
comments were ``abstract'' and did not signal an offer by Germany.
	   Hofer was sentenced in January, when German-Iranian ties were
still recovering from strains caused by the Berlin court ruling
last year implicating senior Iranian officials in the Berlin
slayings.
	   Kazem Darabi, an Iranian secret agent residing in Berlin, is
serving a life sentence for multiple murder in the case, along with
a Lebanese man. Two other Lebanese were convicted as accessories.

Feyenoord derby win lengthens league lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A late Julio Ricardo Cruz winner
gave Feyenoord a 2-1 victory Sunday in the Rotterdam derby at
Sparta, and a four point-lead over Ajax.
	   Second-placed Ajax lost ground after going 3-0 down during a
disasterous first 45 minutes at Vitesse Arnhem, and departing
pointless despite reducing the deficit to 3-2.
	   Goals from Greek striker Nikos Machlas, midfielder Arco
Jochemsen and Scot Booth confirmed Vitesse's feared reputation and
unbeaten home record as Ajax was reduced to the role of spectator.
	   The champion showed more backbone after the break but a Danny
Blind strike and a Frank de Boer penalty only made the result look
flatteringly close.
	   Ajax (9-4-3) may trail Feyenoord (11-2-1) by only four points
but the Rotteradam side has played two games less.
	   Feyenoord started the game resolutely and went ahead through Jon
Dahl Tomasson on 16 minutes but struggling Sparta raised some
fighting spirit for the derby and equalized through Erik Tammer.
	   Ivory Coast Feyenoord sub Bonaventure Kalou launched a brilliant
solo run with two minutes to go, and Cruz gratefully finished off
the move with a tap-in.
	   Sunday's other scheduled fixture saw FC Utrecht down Willem II
Tilburg 2-0.
	   An unfit pitch after an early-morning inspection meant
Saturday's postponed NEC Nijmegen-RKC Waalwijk match still could
not be played and had to be put off a second time.

Swiss reject drug legalization

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Heeding government warnings against turning their
pristine Alpine nation into a drug haven, Swiss voters on Sunday
threw out proposals to legalize consumption of heroin and other
narcotics.
	   Some 74 percent of voters rejected the proposed constitutional
amendment that ``the consumption, cultivation or possession of
drugs, and their acquisition for personal use, is not punishable.''
	   Twenty-six percent _ or 454,404 people _ voted in favor,
according to the Federal Chancellory, which is collating the state
results.
	   The government opposed the plan, saying it was a health risk and
would turn Switzerland into a haven for drug tourists and
traffickers and anger neighboring European countries.
	   To the government's relief, voters also gave the go-ahead to a
finance package of 30.5 billion francs (dlrs 22.1 billion) to link
Switzerland to Europe's high speed train network and build two vast
Alpine rail tunnels.
	   The project is key to a planned transport accord between the
European Union and nonmember Switzerland. EU ministers meet Monday
for more discussions on the deal.
	   The Swiss electorate is summoned to the polls three or four
times a year over a huge range of subjects _ complex new corn laws
and labor laws were also voted on Sunday. Turnout was only 37
percent.
	   Last year the Swiss voted overwhelmingly in favor of state
distribution of heroin to addicts.
	   But they balked at the prospect of a drug free-for-all.
	   The government said its current policy of helping hard-core
addicts while clamping down on dealers was the best way ahead.
	   Church groups, police chiefs, social workers, doctors and other
professionals working with addicts held similar views.
	   Felix Gutweiler, a pioneer of the heroin distribution program,
said the outcome clearly showed that the Swiss population rejected
extreme solutions to the drug problem.
	   No other European nation, not even the Netherlands, has
legalized the possession or sale of any drugs or has plans to do
so.
	   The pro-legalization lobby _ a loose left-wing coalition which
gathered the necessary 100,000 signatures to force a referendum _
claimed it would stamp out trafficking and the black market.
	   Backers hoped that sufficient votes in their favor would
persuade the government to relax laws on soft drugs like cannabis.
	   Switzerland has an estimated 30,000 hard drug addicts in its
population of 7 million _ one of Europe's highest rates.
	   A government survey published last week showed a rise in
cannabis consumption. It revealed that 27 percent of people aged
15-39 said they had smoked cannabis at least once. This compared
with 16 percent in 1992.

String of reforms met with strikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Customs officers will begin a five-day
walk-out Monday, ahead of a month of strikes against wide ranging
government reforms.
	   Stoppages will also begin Monday by workers at railways and some
of Athens' transit services, while doctors, tax officials and
school teachers all have strike plans of their own.
	   The customs strike could lead to shortages of gasoline and
heating oil.
	   The protests are against a string of government reforms
introduced this fall. These include pension and health fund
mergers, changes to school and university systems and efforts to
streamline public transport.
	   The Socialist government is under pressure to push through the
measures as part of its effort to qualify for European Economic and
Monetary Union.
	   Greece is the only country of the 15-member European Union which
failed to qualify for the first round of EMU, with the government
vowing to be ready to join the single currency club by 2001.
Britain, Denmark and Sweden opted out of joining in the first
round.

Yeltsin to stay in hospital several more days at least
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS thruout with Yavlinsky predicting
presidential elections to be held soon. ADDS byline. &QL;

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin will stay in the hospital
for at least several more days while he recuperates from a bout of
pneumonia, his spokesman said Sunday.
	   A prominent liberal leader predicted that Russia would hold
presidential elections ``very soon.''
	   Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin, in an interview with
Echo Moscow radio, said Yeltsin planned to hold a series of
meetings at the Central Clinical Hospital in the next few days,
including a working session with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   ``Everything is going according to plan and Yeltsin is
undergoing scheduled treatment,'' Yakushkin said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has been hospitalized since Nov. 22 with the latest
in a series of ailments that have raised concerns about his ability
to serve out his term, which ends in 2000.
	   Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the moderately liberal Yabloko
party, said Sunday that the country is coming to the end of a
``very difficult period'' _ Yeltsin's second term as Russian
president, which began in 1996.
	   Yavlinsky, who lost in the first round of the 1996 elections and
is expected to run again in the next presidential election, has
refused to join colleagues who have called for Yeltsin's
resignation. However, without saying why, he said he expected the
election to be held soon, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Yavlinsky added that he thought Yeltsin's era ``ended a long
time ago.''
	   Yeltsin has rarely appeared in public in recent months, and has
said little about the country's economic crisis, the worst in the
post-Soviet era.
	   On Friday, Yakushkin, in some of the frankest language ever used
by the Kremlin about an incumbent leader, said a history of
repeated heart attacks was ``taking its toll'' on Yeltsin.
	   It was the first time that a Yeltsin aide had even admitted
openly that the president had suffered a heart attack. Doctors had
previously acknowledged that Yeltsin had a heart attack at the end
of the 1996 campaign.
	   On Sunday, Yakushkin said doctors are treating Yeltsin's
pneumonia with caution.
	   ``Doctors are insisting that the president stay inside since
pneumonia is more serious than an ordinary respiratory infection,''
the spokesman said. ``Moreover, a period of infectious diseases is
beginning.''
	   Yakushkin did not say when Yeltsin would be released from the
hospital, but a Kremlin spokesman said it would be at least several
days before he could return to his residence outside Moscow.
	   ``We don't know yet how long the president will stay in the
hospital; it will all depend on his health,'' the duty officer at
the Kremlin press office said. ``He's planning working meetings
during the week at the hospital, but it doesn't mean that he will
stay at the hospital all week.''
	   On Sunday, Yeltsin signed a number of laws and decrees,
including a tribute to artist Tair Salakhov on his 70th birthday, a
law on the import and export of goods related to space exploration
and a law on ratification of an agreement with Belarus on the
delivery of Russian diamonds, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.

Strong earthquake in Indonesia prompts tsunami warning

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A strong earthquake struck on or near a small
Indonesian island Sunday, prompting the U.S. Geological Survey to
issue a tsunami warning for the western Pacific.
	   The earthquake, with a preliminary magnitude of 7.6, was bigger
than the quake that spawned a giant wave that killed more than
2,000 people in Papua-New Guinea in July, U.S.G.S. spokeswoman
Carolyn Didonato said.
	   A tsunami can occur within seconds or hours of such a quake, and
the biggest threat is to the many smaller Indonesian islands, she
said. The government agency received no immediate reports of
damage, she added.
	   The epicenter was on or near the island of Taliabu, about 230
miles (370 kilometers) south of Manado Sulawesi island. It occurred
at 10:11 p.m. local time (1311 GMT).

Palestinians angered over prisoners

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) - A stormy session between negotiators
ended Sunday with a Palestinian official walking out and others
saying the latest Mideast accord was in jeopardy, mainly over
Israel's refusal to release so-called security prisoners.
	   The Palestinians are furious over the prisoner issue and
tensions between the parties have been building since Israel set
free 250 prisoners, including 150 common criminals, 10 days ago.
	   ``This is a crisis situation and we have asked for American
intervention,'' said senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, who
was flying to Washington late Sunday to join Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat for meetings with Clinton administration officials on
the issue.
	   The Palestinians had expected Israel to release military and
political prisoners who fought against the Israeli occupation, but
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said no one jailed for murder or
other violent acts would be among 500 prisoners still to be
released as part of the latest peace accord.
	   ``I have no intentions, even the slightest of the slightest, to
release murderers or to release Hamas members,'' Netanyahu told
army radio, referring to the radical Islamic group.
	   ``Hamas is at war with us and each Hamas member who is freed
will join the ranks of murderers. To me, it doesn't matter who they
murdered. It's important that murderers be behind bars and locks,''
he said.
	   In Sunday's negotiating session in the Palestinian city of
Jericho, Palestinian official Hassan Asfour stormed out of the
meeting with Israeli Cabinet Secretary Dan Naveh.
	   ``We felt that the Israeli government has no intention of
dealing with the issues seriously,'' Asfour said.
	   Erekat said he expected Israel to hand over another 150 security
prisoners in place of the criminals set free in the first release.
	   ``We did not go to Washington to negotiate the release of car
thieves,'' Erekat told The Associated Press. He said the sides had
agreed in talks in Washington on terms for releasing prisoners, but
Israel was not adhering to them.
	   Implementation of the U.S.-brokered land-for-peace accord would
be difficult to continue under the present circumstances, Erekat
said.
	   Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority has come under intense
pressure from its citizens, who charge that negotiators are going
soft on the prisoner issue. The matter is especially sensitive
because few Palestinian families have been unaffected by it, and
had expected peace deals to bring their relatives home.
	   Among other Palestinian grievances raised at Sunday's meeting
was increased Jewish settlement activity, Israeli confiscations of
Arab-owned land for roads and a decision by Israel's Cabinet to
hand-over no more than 1 percent of the West Bank in any future
withdrawal.
	   In the West Bank village of Ein-Yabrud, Israeli troops separated
Jewish settlers who tried to take over an Arab-owned home and
Palestinian villagers after the two sides pelted each other with
stones. The Israeli army declared the house and its surroundings a
closed military area, forcing both sides to evacuate.
	   And in the village of El-Khader near Bethlehem, Israeli
bulldozers were forced to halt work ripping up village land to make
way for a bypass road for Jewish settlers, while Palestinian
farmers there challenged an expropriation notice in an Israeli
court.
	   The Palestinians have accused Israel of violating the Mideast
peace agreement by confiscating large quantities of Palestinian
land for new bypass roads for Jewish settlements which will be
isolated as a result of Israeli troop withdrawals.
	   Israel also demolished the home of two Palestinian families in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem. Jerusalem police spokeswoman
Sigal Toledo said the house was built without a permit. The
two-story building housed two families, including owner Sharif
Abdullah, a U.S. citizen.
	   Also Sunday, the Israeli army prevented Palestinian officials,
including Cabinet ministers and legislators, from traveling from
the Gaza Strip to the West Bank across Israeli territory.
	   The VIPs, including Justice Minister Freih Abu-Meidein, were
stopped at the Erez checkpoint on the northern edge of the Gaza
Strip.
	   The Israeli army spokesman said the blockade was in retaliation
for the refusal of the Palestinian police to allow Israeli trucks
carrying cement and other building materials to reach the isolated
Jewish settlement of Netzarim on the southern outskirts of Gaza
City.
	   The Palestinians said new construction in the settlement would
be a violation of the agreement. The Israelis said stopping the
trucks was a breach of the accord.

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Some eight million Syrians are eligible
to vote for a new 250-seat parliament to be elected Monday and
Tuesday from among 7,350 candidates.
	   Two-thirds of the seats in the National Assembly, or parliament,
are allotted to the National Progressive Front, a coalition of
seven parties led by the Baath Party which has ruled Syria since
1963.
	   The allotment of seats was the same in the previous four-year
term which ended in September. The Baath gets 135 seats, and 32 go
to allied parties. Independents run for the remaining 83 seats.
	   The assembly has limited legislative power, with effective
control held by President Hafez Assad, who came to power in a
bloodless coup in 1970.
	   Businessmen and industrialists are expected to gain more
influence in the new parliament following government efforts to
encourage more investment in the private sector.
	   Women, who held 24 seats in the previous parliament, also are
expected to increase their numbers. More than 800 women are
running.
	   Campaigning began Oct. 29 with candidates putting up posters and
banners in almost all cities. the campaigning is based mainly on
individual candidates' promises to improve conditions, not on party
programs. The campaign ended Saturday.
	   Polls will be open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. (0600gmt-1800gmt)
Monday and from 8 a.m. to noon (0600gmt-1000gmt) Tuesday. No
results are expected before Thursday.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Only about one quarter of 12.7
million eligible voters have registered in South Africa's five
northern provinces, election officials said Sunday.
	   The estimate of about 3 million registered voters came from
Johann Kriegler, chairman of the Independent Electoral Commission,
after three days of registration.
	   Kriegler told journalists that only about 1.25 million names had
reached the IEC headquarters in Pretoria by Sunday afternoon. It
was not clear how the estimate of 3 million was reached.
	   Kriegler denied it was a low turnout.
	   ``It was not a bad result. These figures are a cause for
satisfaction,'' said Kriegler.
	   South Africa's first attempt to create a national voters' roll
has been plagued by lack of staff, confusion over where voters
should go to register, and closure of some of the announced
registration stations.
	   The original plan to register the country's 24 million voters
over the past three day period were dropped last week. The
remaining four provinces will open polling stations for
registration next weekend.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Manchester United got the winning goal in the 77th
minute from Nicky Butt Sunday at Old Trafford to beat Leeds 3-2 and
move back into second place a point by leaders Aston Villa.
	   Defending league and F.A. Cup champion Arsenal salvaged a 1-1
draw Sunday with Middlesbrough on a goal in the 89th by Nicolas
Anelka after Brian Deane had given Middlesbrough a lead in the
sixth minute.
	   Aston Villa leads with 29 points followed by Manchester United
(28). Villa played a 2-2 draw Saturday at Nottingham Forest. West
Ham holds third place (26) followed by Arsenal (25), Chelsea (24),
Middlesbrough (23) and Leeds (23).
	   In Glasgow, Scotland, league-leading Rangers defeated St.

St. Johnstone.
	   In a late match Sunday, last-place Blackburn played struggling
at Liverpool.
	   In Manchester United's win, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink gave Leeds a
1-0 edge in the 29th. Bu Manchester United went up 2-1 on goals by

Chelsea 1, Sheffield Wednesday 1; Coventry 1, Leicester 1;
Newcastle 3, Wimbledon 1; Southampton 0, Derby 1; West Ham 2,

11.5 million) transfer from Everton, Duncan Ferguson scored twice
at St. James' Park in a 3-1 come-from behind win over Wimbledon.
	   Chelsea was held to a disappointing 1-1 home draw with Sheffield
Wednesday, but the Blues still equaled a club record of 19 games

Juve, in free-fall, loses at Bologna for first time since '74

	   ROME (AP) _ Bologna did all its scoring in the opening half hour
Sunday and routed free-falling Juventus of Turin 3-0 for its first
home win in 24 years over the Italian League's two-time defending
champion.
	   Michele Paramatti, veteran striker Giuseppe Signori and Davide
Fontolan found the target early for Bologna, while Juventus was
shut out for the third straight game since top striker Alessandro
Del Piero was lost for the season with a knee ligament injury.
	   But Juve did not lose much ground in the standings, because
league leader Fiorentina and AC Milan were also both victims of
poor outings.
	   Fiorentina settled for its first draw of the season, 0-0 at
Bari, while Milan was trampled 4-0 by AC Parma as Argentine striker
Hernan Crespo scored two goals to raise his tally to seven in four
games.
	   Internazionale of Milan, without injured Brazilian star Ronaldo,
continued its slow crawl up the standings by rallying with two
goals in the last 15 minutes to beat lowly Salernitana 2-1.
Argentine midfielders Diego Simeone _ off an assist from Roberto
Baggio _ and Javier Zanetti saved Inter after Salernitana had taken
the lead on David Di Michele's first career goal.
	   Despite seeing its league-best attack silenced, Fiorentina held
onto first place with 22 points. Parma jumped three spots up to
second with 19 points, one more than Juventus and Milan.
	   Inter and Bologna, which boasts a nine-game unbeaten streak, are
both another point back.
	   Elsewhere Sunday, Japanese midfielder Hidetoshi Nakata tallied
twice to lead Perugia past Piacenza 2-0; Empoli _ docked two
standings points by the league's disciplinary commission this week
for allegedly trying to influence a referee earlier this season _
beat Vicenza 1-0; Udinese edged Cagliari 2-1, and Sampdoria of
Genoa and last-place Venezia drew 0-0.
	   At night, Italian Cup holder Lazio of Rome looked to extend its
four-game derby winning streak against AS Roma.
 &UR; Bologna 3, Juventus 0 &QC; 
	   At Bologna, Juventus (5-3-3) clearly missed injured French
midfielder Didier Deschamps and suspended Uruguayan center back
Paolo Montero. Paramatti slipped in unmarked to head in Signori's
free kick just three minutes after kickoff, and Signori made it 2-0
himself four minutes later.
	   The most glaring defensive lapse came in the 28th, when Ciro
Ferrara gave the ball away deep in his own end, allowing Fontolan
to score with a shot under the crossbar after a nice exchange with
Swedish striker Kennet Andersson.
	   Bologna improved to 4-5-2.
 &UR; Bari 0, Fiorentina 0 &QC; 
	   At Bari, it was the hosts (2-8-1) who produced the better
scoring chances, though South African striker Phil Masinga was
never able to convert. Fiorentina (7-1-3) entered the game with a
league-leading 22 goals _ 11 by Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta
_ but had trouble in attack against Bari's five-man defensive line.
 &UR; Parma 4, Milan 0 &QC; 
	   At Parma, Enrico Chiesa opened the scoring in the 25th minute,
Crespo tallied in the 36th and 60th, and French midfielder Alain
Boghossian fixed the final score in injury time as Parma improved
to 5-4-2. Milan fell to 5-3-3.
 &UR; Inter 2, Salernitana 1 &QC; 
	   At Milan, Di Michele sent a diagonal shot into the net in the
43rd minute after Inter's Dutch winger Aron Winter gave up the
ball. But Inter rallied to win, much as it did Wednesday, when
Baggio scored twice late to give the team a 3-1 Champions League
victory over Spain's Real Madrid. Inter is 5-2-4, Salernitana _
which had won three of four _ is 3-1-7.
 &UR; Perugia 2, Piacenza 0 &QC; 
	   At Perugia, Nakata hit the mark in the 20th and 50th minutes,
both off assists from Croat midfielder Milan Rapajic as the hosts
raised their record to 4-3-4 and dropped Piacenza to 3-2-6.
 &UR; Udinese 2, Cagliari 1 &QC; 
	   At Udine, Paolo Poggi knocked in a rebound in the 32nd minute
and Brazilian striker Marcio Amoroso headed in the second _ his
eighth on the year _ in the second half for Udinese (4-4-3).
Tiziano De Patre pulled one back late for the Sardinians (4-2-5).
 &UR; Empoli 1, Vicenza 0 &QC; 
	   At Empoli, striker Marco Carparelli slotted in a 10-meter (yard)
low shot in the 31st minute for Empoli (3-4-4). Vicenza (2-4-5) had
Uruguay's Marcelo Otero expelled in the 60th.

Corretja beats Moya to win ATP Championship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Alex Corretja rallied from a two-set
deficit and beat fellow Spaniard Carlos Moya in five sets Sunday to
capture the ATP Tour World Championship, his first major title.
	   In the first all-Spanish final in the history of the
season-ending championship, Corretja outlasted his good friend 3-6,
3-6, 7-5, 6-3, 7-5 to avenge his loss to Moya in the final of the
French Open.
	   The four-hour victory was worth dlrs 1.36 million and propelled
Corretja three places up to No. 3 in the final 1998 computer
rankings, a career high.
	   Moya will finish the year ranked fifth. He won two titles in
1998.
	   Corretja's victory was the first Spanish triumph in the event
since Manuel Orantes won what was then called the Masters in 1976
in Houston, Texas.
	   Moya, 22, opened the match with a break of serve and did it
again to win the first set, smashing a volley on his fourth set
point.
	   Another break of serve in the second game was enough for Moya to
win the first set.
	   Corretja, 24, finally gained a break of his own when he hit a
deep-angled forehand winner to take a 3-1 lead in the third.
	   His advantage did not last long, however, ending in a
double-fault in the very next game.
	   Moya saved another break point with an ace to hold for 4-4.
	   Corretja, who had upset top-ranked Pete Sampras in the
semifinals, was in trouble again in the 11th game, but hit a
sizzling backhand passing shot down the line to hold serve. In the
next game, Moya's forehand sailed into the net, giving Corretja the
set.
	   A double-fault by Moya gave Corretja a 5-3 lead and he served
out the fourth set.
	   Corretja fell down 1-3 in the fifth, but broke right back. A
forehand by Moya that sailed long gave Corretja another break, a
5-4 lead and a chance to serve out the match. He wasted one match
point and then dropped his serve.
	   But Moya could not hold serve either and Corretja finally ended
the drama on his second match point in the next game.
	   It was Corretja's first win over Moya in four matches this year.
	   Moya beat Corretja in the quarterfinals of the Monte Carlo
tournament, before winning the major clay court event. At the U.S.
Open, Moya also beat Corretja before losing in the semifinals.
	   Coming into this elite tournament that brings together the top
eight players of the year, Moya had lost all five of his indoor
matches of the year. He had not reached a final on any other
surface than clay.
	   But he seems to thrive in the event, having reached the
semifinals in his first appearance last year. He beat big-serving
Tim Henman in Saturday's semifinals.
	   Corretja has a better indoor record, having won the tournament
in Lyon, France in October, becoming the first Spanish player to
win an indoor title since that Orantes victory in the 1976 Masters.

German villagers vote on future of transsexual mayor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   QUELLENDORF, Germany (AP) _ Residents of this eastern German
village voted Sunday on whether to keep their mayor after he
announced plans for a sex change.
	   Norbert Lindner, 40, was elected to a seven-year term in 1996
but shocked many villagers last summer when he began wearing
women's clothes and calling himself Michaela. Village board members
then voted for a ballot on the mayor's ouster.
	   Lindner has since become an international celebrity.
Transsexuals from Germany and France converged on the village of
1,048 inhabitants Sunday to show support for the mayor, who
appealed for tolerance.
	   ``I think society as a whole has some catching up to do,'' he
told reporters.
	   Lindner, a member of the reformed East German communists, said
he plans to start sex change surgery Thursday. He said he would
leave Germany if voted out of office.
	   Vote results were expected later Sunday.

South Africa holds West Indies to 170 in second innings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with action at stumps &QL;

 &UR; By MIKE GREEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa rolled over the
West Indies tail to dismiss them for 170 on Sunday in their second
innings, with Shaun Pollock grasping a 100 test wicket feat like
his father did in the 1960s.
	   Rain ended the match early.
	   The action on the fourth day of the first Test at Wanderers
stadium left South Africa just 164 runs short to win the first test
match.
	   The West Indies had fought back to be 148 for five wickets just
before tea, but then South Africa's patience and good line paid
dividends.
	   Carl Hooper and Ridley Jacobs had dug in and scored carefully
off a tight attack when Jacques Kallis trapped Hooper leg before
wicket, one of four such decisions in the innings. The tourists had
already been held to 82 for five wickets at lunch.
	   Pollock was again the chief destroyer, taking four wickets for
49. By coincidence, he attained 1,000 career runs and 100 test
wickets in the same test.
	   His father, Peter Pollock, took a 100 test wicket mark back in
the 1960s. Only one other father-son team has ever done that _
Lance and Chris Cairns of New Zealand.
	   South Africa's target seems achievable.
	   But the type of leg before wicket decisions which went against
the West Indies on Sunday, with increasing numbers of low balls
hurled on the pitch, could weigh against South Africa on Monday.
	   South African bowlers proved the value of sustained accuracy and
a persistently nagging length. It was the Allan Donald- Pollock
combination which struck early as Pollock bowled Philo Wallace and
Donald trapped Brian Lara for seven.
	   After Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Stuart Williams and Clayton
Lambert were gone, Hooper and Jacobs rebuilt the innings.
	   For a long while, it looked as if the West Indies might have
pulled the game beyond the reach of the home side.
	   But after the Kallis blow to dismiss Hooper, the other partner
fell immediately, as Jacobs was suckered by Pat Symcox into pulling
across the line, sending the ball straight into the hands of David
Terbrugge at mid-on.
	   The West Indies went to tea at 148 for seven
	   After that, the remaining three wickets did not look like
providing too much resistance.
	   Before the South Africans were able to start their chase for the
required runs, a storm broke over Johannesburg, making play for the
rest of the day impossible.

Swiss reject drug legalization, back rail modernization
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By CLARE NULLIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Heeding government warnings against turning their
pristine Alpine nation into a drug haven, Swiss voters Sunday threw
out proposals to legalize consumption of heroin and other
narcotics.
	   Some 74 percent of voters rejected the proposed constitutional
amendment that ``the consumption, cultivation or possession of
drugs, and their acquisition for personal use, is not punishable.''
	   ``I'm very satisfied. It's an endorsement of government
policy,'' declared Interior Minister Ruth Dreifuss, who has
introduced more cautious measures to give heroin to long-term
addicts.
	   The pro-legalization lobby said it was disappointed that only 26
percent backed it, but vowed to press ahead with a campaign to
decriminalize soft drugs like cannabis.
	   To the government's relief, 64 percent of voters gave the
go-ahead to a finance package of 30.5 billion francs (dlrs 22.1
billion) to link Switzerland to Europe's high speed train network
and build two vast Alpine rail tunnels.
	   This is key to a planned transport accord between the European
Union and non-member Switzerland. EU ministers meet Monday for more
discussions on the deal.
	   Under the Swiss system, 100,000 signatures on a petition is
enough to force a referendum. The electorate thus goes to the polls
three or four times a year over a huge range of subjects _ they
approved complex new corn laws and labor legislation Sunday.
Turnout was only 37 percent, reflecting weariness with the nation's
direct democracy.
	   Last year the Swiss achieved a world first in voting
overwhelmingly in favor of state distribution of heroin to hardened
addicts. Government studies showed this cut crime and misery
associated with the drug scene.
	   At the same time as helping addicts, authorities tried to clamp
down on dealing and close once notorious open drug scenes in big
cities like Zurich.
	   Dreifuss and other ministers said the legalization plan was a
health risk and would turn Switzerland into a haven for drug
tourists and traffickers and anger neighboring European countries.
	   Church groups, police chiefs, social workers, doctors and other
professionals working with addicts held similar views.
	   ``The outcome shows that the Swiss population rejects extreme
solutions to the drug problem,'' said Felix Gutwiller, a pioneer of
the heroin distribution program.
	   Francois Reusser, from the pro-legalization lobby, blamed the
scale of the defeat on the fact that it included both hard and soft
drugs.
	   No other European nation, not even the Netherlands, has
legalized the possession or sale of any drugs or has plans to do
so.
	   Switzerland has an estimated 30,000 hard drug addicts in its
population of 7 million _ one of Europe's highest rates. But in
contrast to other countries, the death rate is falling.
	   A government survey published last week showed a rise in
cannabis consumption. It revealed that 27 percent of people aged
15-39 said they had smoked cannabis at least once. This compared
with 16 percent in 1992.
	   Given Switzerland's pioneering role on drug issues, the vote was
closely watched in other countries.
	   ``When 26 percent of voters support controlled legalization of
drugs, it does suggest some crumbling in what is claimed to be
global consensus on the war on drugs,'' said Ethan Nadelmann,
director of the New York based Lindesmith Center Drug Policy Unit,
which favors more relaxed laws.
	   ``People around the world should keep their eye on Switzerland
as it's done a good job of showing the proper path for policy
reform.''

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Cabinet ministers called Sunday for
military strikes against Beirut's power and water supplies in
retaliation for the killing of Israeli soldiers by Islamic
guerrillas in south Lebanon.
	   Seven Israeli soldiers have been killed in the past two weeks by
the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia in the security zone which
Israel occupies in south Lebanon to protect its northern border.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a European trip to
England and Spain to deal with a growing debate in Israel over the
losses in Lebanon and calls for a unilateral Israeli withdrawal.
	   The 12-member Cabinet security committee was meeting Sunday in
Jerusalem to hear military and security chiefs report on the
Lebanon situation after Netanyahu returned from visiting soldiers
wounded in the latest fighting.
	   ``We are looking for an arrangement in which we can achieve that
objective of protecting northern Israel without our presence in
Lebanon,'' Netanyahu said Sunday. But he said Cabinet members would
discuss minimizing Israeli troop casualties, not withdrawal.
	   ``As long as we don't have a way of leaving Lebanon in an
arrangement that will guarantee the safety of northern Israel, our
main objective is to protect Israeli soldiers,'' he said.
	   Some 80 people opposed to Israel's presence in south Lebanon
demonstrated outside the Cabinet meeting Sunday, holding signs
which read ``No more casualties,'' and ``Get out of Lebanon.''
	   ``Our children are in the army, we are very worried about them.
We want them home. My son is on the way to Lebanon and I don't want
him to go'' said Hanna Nachtuni, a member of the Four Mothers group
of parents of Israeli soldiers serving in the buffer zone.

Israeli jets hit guerrilla bases in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes struck suspected
guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon on Sunday for the second
consecutive day to avenge attacks on Israeli outposts, Lebanese
security officials said.
	   Two Israeli jets fired two air-to-surface missiles on hills
between the villages of Toulin and Qabrigha, 23 kilometers (14
miles) southeast of the port city of Tyre, the officials said. They
spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the 6:20 p.m.
(1620 GMT) raid on the area, which Lebanese guerrillas have used in
the past as a base.
	   On Saturday, Israeli warplanes struck suspected guerrilla
hideouts in the south, a day after two Israeli soldiers were killed
in a roadside bombing near Tyre that was claimed by the Lebanese
guerrilla group Hezbollah.
	   The latest raid came as Israeli Cabinet ministers called for
military strikes against Beirut's power and water supplies to
retaliate for Hezbollah attacks.
	   Seven Israeli soldiers have been killed in the past two weeks by
the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
	   Hezbollah has led a guerrilla war to try to oust an estimated
1,500 Israeli soldiers and their 2,500 allied militiamen from the
self-styled ``security zone'' that Israel set up in southern
Lebanon in 1985 to protect against cross-border guerrilla attacks.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a European
trip to deal with the growing debate in Israel over the losses in
Lebanon and mounting calls for a unilateral Israeli withdrawal.
	   Sunday's air strike came shortly after Hezbollah guerrillas
claimed responsibility for mortar and rocket attacks on positions
held by Israel and its allied South Lebanon Army militia in the
south. No casualties were reported.

Italian man charged with killing family, missing since 1989
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ In the summer of 1989, the Carretta family set out
in their camper for a vacation. They were never heard from again.
	   On Sunday, the eldest son, Fernando, was arrested in Rome on a
warrant accusing him of murdering his father, mother and younger
brother.
	   Carretta, 36, surfaced last week in London, where he'd been
living since the family vanished. But he offered no explanation for
his own silence during the nearly 10-year search for theCarrettas.
And he said he knew nothing of their whereabouts.
	   On Sunday, he flew to Rome, where he was arrested at the
airport. The ANSA news agency said he returned voluntarily.
	   Giuseppe Carretta, 62, his wife Marta Chezzi, 58, and younger
son Nicola, 32, were last seen the night of Aug. 4, 1989, leaving
their home in in the northern Italian city of Parma in their
camper. The camper was found, empty and abandoned on Nov. 19, 1989,
in Milan.
	   Italian newspapers were full of speculation about the
disappearances, including rumors that Giuseppe Carretta, an
accountant, has embezzled a fortune and had fled to the Caribbean
or South America, but no trace of the family was found.
	   Suspicion also focused on Fernando, who bought a pistol just
before the family disappeared. But he, too, remained missing and
the investigation was eventually closed.
	   Carretta surfaced by accident, when he was stopped in London
during a routine police check. He was listed as a missing person
and British authorities contacted their Italian counterparts,
reports said.
	   Italian newspapers said Carretta was living modestly in a
one-room apartment in a blue-collar neighborhood of London and
worked as a messenger for an express delivery service. Carretta
told interviewers he was estranged from his family and left home
because of family problems several days before the family vanished.
	   He was arrested on a warrant alleging triple homicide issued
several days ago by the prosecutor in Parma.

Corretja beats Moya to win ATP Championship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, more details &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Alex Corretja rallied from a two-set
deficit and beat fellow Spaniard Carlos Moya in five sets Sunday to
capture the ATP Tour World Championship, his first major title.
	   In the first all-Spanish final in the history of the
season-ending championship, Corretja outlasted his good friend 3-6,
3-6, 7-5, 6-3, 7-5 to avenge his loss to Moya in the final of the
French Open.
	   ``Carlos, I'm sorry, I know how you feel right now,'' Corretja
said.
	   The four-hour victory was worth dlrs 1.36 million and propelled
Corretja three places up to No. 3 in the final 1998 computer
rankings, a career high.
	   Moya, who squandered a 3-1 lead in the fifth set, will finish
the year ranked fifth. He won two titles in 1998.
	   Corretja's victory was the first Spanish triumph in the event
since Manuel Orantes won what was then called the Masters in 1976
in Houston, Texas.
	   Corretja said he was dedicating his victory to his recently
deceased uncle and aunt.
	   Moya, 22, opened the match with a break of serve and did it
again to win the first set, smashing a volley on his fourth set
point.
	   Another break of serve in the second game was enough for Moya to
win the first set.
	   Corretja, 24, finally gained a break of his own when he hit a
deep-angled forehand winner to take a 3-1 lead in the third.
	   His advantage did not last long, however, ending in a
double-fault in the very next game.
	   Moya saved another break point with an ace to hold for 4-4.
	   Corretja, who had upset top-ranked Pete Sampras in the
semifinals, was in trouble again in the 11th game, but hit a
sizzling backhand passing shot down the line to hold serve. In the
next game, Moya's forehand sailed into the net, giving Corretja the
set.
	   A double-fault by Moya gave Corretja a 5-3 lead and he served
out the fourth set.
	   Corretja fell down 1-3 in the fifth, but broke right back. A
forehand by Moya that sailed long gave Corretja another break, a
5-4 lead and a chance to serve out the match. He wasted one match
point, when Moya hit a volley winner after a long rally, and then
dropped his serve.
	   But Moya could not hold serve either and the drama ended on
Corretja's second match point in the next game when Moya's forehand
sailed long.
	   Corretja gained the biggest victory of his career and his ninth
title, fifth in 1998.
	   It was Corretja's first win over Moya in four matches this year.
	   Moya beat Corretja in the quarterfinals of the Monte Carlo
tournament, before winning the major clay court event. At the U.S.
Open, Moya also beat Corretja before losing in the semifinals.
	   Coming into this elite tournament that brings together the top
eight players of the year, Moya had lost all five of his indoor
matches of the year. He had not reached a final on any other
surface than clay.
	   But he seems to thrive in the event, having reached the
semifinals in his first appearance last year. He beat big-serving
Tim Henman in Saturday's semifinals.
	   Corretja has a better indoor record, having won the tournament
in Lyon, France in October, becoming the first Spanish player to
win an indoor title since that Orantes victory in the 1976 Masters.

Britain says no deal with Chile over Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain denied Sunday that it is negotiating a
deal to free Gen. Augusto Pinochet in return for a pledge from
Chile to strip the former dictator of immunity and made him stand
trial at home on charges of genocide and torture.
	   A spokesman for Home Secretary Jack Straw, who has until Dec. 11
to decide whether to block proceedings to extradite Pinochet to
Spain, said the decision would be based on judicial, not political
grounds.
	   ``We are not negotiating a deal,'' said a Home Office spokesman,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity. ``The Home Secretary
will consider what decision he will take in his role as
quasi-judicial arbiter under the terms of the Extradition Act.''
	   Meanwhile, the tug-of-war over 83-year-old Pinochet intensified
with human rights activists dismissing as a ``cruel joke'' on
victims the virtual pledges by Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel
Insulza to have general tried.
	   Two British newspapers, The Sunday Times and The Observer,
reported Sunday that Britain and Chile are close to a compromise
deal.
	   The argument underlined the dilemma for Straw since a ruling
last week by Britain's highest court, the House of Lords, that
Pinochet has no immunity from arrest. He was arrested Oct. 16 on a
Spanish warrant during a regular visit to London.
	   A Chilean government report says some 3,000 people were killed
or disappeared at the hands of Pinochet's secret police during his
1973-1990 rule after he toppled an elected Marxist president.
	   However, the Chilean government wants him back because it is
fearful that fury among Pinochet supporters threatens the country's
new democracy.
	   If Straw blocks extradition, the Labor Party government will
likely attract international criticism, as well as provoking
outrage among many rank-and-file Labor legislators. If he allows
the proceedings to go ahead, it will upset relations with Chile, a
trading partner and a longtime ally.
	   Insulza, himself an exile during Pinochet's rule, acknowledged
Sunday that coming to Britain and Spain to lobby for the general
was ``not an easy job.''
	   ``My feelings toward him are not very favorable. Unfortunately
this is not the point,'' Insulza said on Sky TV.
	   Insulza has said 14 law suits are pending against Pinochet in
Chile and that he has no immunity. He said Sunday the Chilean
government ``will do even more to make sure the investigation goes
forward.''
	   However, Pinochet granted himself immunity while in power, and
also has immunity as a senator-for-life. He remained
commander-in-chief of the army until March.
	   The New York-based group Human Rights Watch said only Chile's
supreme court could remove Pinochet's immunity, was very unlikely
to do so, and even if it did, Pinochet would probably go before a
court of military supporters he appointed.
	   ``When you add these things up, there is virtually no chance he
will be prosecuted and absolutely no chance he would actually be
convicted,'' Human Rights Watch spokesman Reed Brody told The
Associated Press.
	   Pinochet remained under police guard at a north London hospital
where he has recuperated from back surgery.
	   Some lawyers argue that unless Straw blocks extradition on
compassionate grounds _ Pinochet's age and physical or mental
condition _ he is obliged to send him to Spain in terms of the
extradition agreements and a U.N. convention outlawing torture
wherever it takes place.

Turkish leader warns against political vacuum
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yilmaz meeting Demirel &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ One of Turkey's leading politicians warned
Sunday that a political vacuum could cripple the domestic battle to
keep Islamists at bay and the fight abroad for the extradition of a
Kurdish rebel leader.
	   In the midst of Turkey's uphill battle to get Italy to hand over
a Kurdish rebel leader, the government collapsed Wednesday under
the weight of corruption scandals. No party has a majority to
govern alone in the deeply divided parliament.
	   Acting Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit on Sunday called on Turkey's
two center-right parties, led by arch-rivals acting Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz and former Premier Tansu Ciller, to join him in a
governing coalition.
	   ``To deal with internal and foreign questions, Turkey needs, as
soon as possible, a solid and healthy government,'' Bulent Ecevit
told reporters.
	   Ecevit, leader of the Democratic Left Party, warned that the
Islamists might return to power if secular parties don't cooperate.
The military last year forced out the country's first Islamic-led
government.
	   The Islamic party, Virtue, is the largest party in parliament.
	   The military gets a chance Monday to have its say when it meets
with Demirel and the acting cabinet. It is up to Demirel, who met
Sunday with Yilmaz for a second time, to name the new premier.

Archibald, Parini win giant slaloms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SESTRIERE, Italy (AP) _ Jeff Archibald edged Nicolas Huet by
five hundredths of a second Sunday in a Snowboard World Cup giant
slalom to pick up his first career victory.
	   Italy's Margerita Parini won the women's race, taking a
commanding lead of nearly two seconds after the first run and
holding off Olympic champion Karine Ruby in the second.
	   Archibald, of Ogden, Utah, and France's Huet shared the
provisional lead after both clocking 56.30 seconds in the men's
first run, but the American's second run of 55.80 was just enough
to give him the win.
	   Richard Richardson of Sweden finished third in the season's
opening giant slalom at this resort in Italy's western Alps with a
total time of 1:52.33, 0.23 seconds off the pace.
	   Huet and Ruby, also French, captured parallel slalom races in
Sestriere on Saturday.
	   Ruby nearly added another triumph Sunday with a sparkling second
run of 59.42 for a total time of 2:01.93. But Parini put together
two consistent rides of 1:00.36 and 1:00.79 to notch her fourth
career World Cup win with a combined 2:01.15.
	   France's Isabelle Blanc was third in 2:03.07.
	   Former world champion Sondra Van Ert of the United States was
sixth Sunday in 2:04.41.

AEK trounces Aris 6-0, takes lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Demis Nikolaidis scored a hat trick as AEK
Athens hammered Aris Salonica 6-0 at home Sunday to take the lead
in the first division soccer league.
	   AEK is atop the standing with 26 points, one ahead both
crosstown Panathinaikos and Olympiakos Piraeus.
	   But AEK's lead will be temporary if Panathinaikos wins in the
last game of the 11th round against Xanthi in the northern town
with the same name Monday.
	   Olympiakos, which beat Kavala 4-1, was handed three extra points
last week by a sports judge for an interrupted game against PAOK in
Salonica.
	   The referee had stopped the Nov. 1st game when angry PAOK
supporters entered the pitch and clashed with police soon after he
canceled a goal scored by the hosts in the 82nd minute.
	   The judge also stripped PAOK of three points and ordered the
club to play five home-games away.
	   PAOK appealed the decision.
	   Ukrainian Oleg Blochin, who made his debut as AEK's coach, saw
his players dominating the game, never permitting the visitors to
threaten goalie Ilias Atmatzidis.
	   The Athens club took an early lead with an own goal by
Panayiotis Katsiaros in the 3rd minute.
	   After wasting two scoring chances, Christos Maladenis netted his
team's 2nd goal off a pass form Harris Kopitsis in the 32nd.
	   Seven minutes into the second period, Nikolaidis headed in AEK's
third goal.
	   In the 57th, Toni Sawevski took a corner kick, but the ball
slipped through the hands of goaltender Theofanis Katergiannakis to
make it 4-0.
	   Nikolaidis netted his team's fifth goal in the 77th and sealed
AEK's easy victory with his 12th goal of the season in the 81st.
	   Aris had to play the last 29 minutes with 10 players because of
Manolis Mitsopoulos' expulsion with two yellow cards in the 71st.
	   Olympiakos, playing at home before 10,000 spectators, controlled
the match throughout.
	   Ifeanyi Udeze made things still easier for the hosts when he saw
the second yellow card in the 30th, forcing Kavala to play with 10
players for the rest of the game.
	   In one Olympiakos attack in the 10th minute, midfielder Andreas
Niniadis fired a shot at Kavala's goalie Panayiotis Logaras. The
ball deflected on a defender and Alecos Alexandris, who gained it,
gave his team the lead.
	   Alexandris came close to a second goal in the 31st, but his
powerful shot went wide, scraping past Logaras' left upright.
	   Five minutes later, Luciano made it 2-0 off a pass from Stelios
Yiannacopoulos.
	   Olympiakos' goalkeeper Dimitris Eleftheropoulos made a brilliant
save to a shot by Giorgos Nassiopoulos in the 43rd. But he could
not do the same one minute later when the Kavala striker narrowed
the difference.
	   Predrag Djordjevic converted a penalty in the 62nd to make the
score 3-1 and Luciano stretched it to 4-1 with a blistering
left-footed drive from 20 meters (yards).

Rangers win Scottish League Cup over St. Johnstone 2-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ The first trophy of the Scottish soccer
season _ the League Cup _ went Sunday to Rangers with new coach
Dick Advocaat getting much of the credit.
	   Rangers defeated St. Johnstone 2-1 at Celtic Park with Jorg
Albertz getting the winner after Stephane Guivarc'h scored early
for Rangers with Nick Vasovic getting St. Johnstone's goal.
	   Rangers last season failed to win a trophy for the first time in
recent memory and were also dethroned by Celtic as league champions
after nine straight titles.
	   Dutchman Advocaat arrived from PSV Eindhoven over the summer and
has spent 31 million pounds (dlrs 51 million) on player transfers.
	   In addition to leading the Scottish Premier League, Rangers are
also bidding to reach the quarterfinals of Europe's UEFA Cup after
a third-round, first-leg 1-1 draw last week against Italy's Parma.

Swiss reject drug legalization, back rail modernization

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Heeding government warnings against turning their
pristine Alpine nation into a drug haven, Swiss voters Sunday threw
out proposals to legalize consumption of heroin and other
narcotics.
	   Some 74 percent of voters rejected the proposed constitutional
amendment that ``the consumption, cultivation or possession of
drugs, and their acquisition for personal use, is not punishable.''
The results were released by the Federal Chancellory, which is
collating the results from each canton.
	   ``I'm very satisfied. It's an endorsement of government
policy,'' declared Interior Minister Ruth Dreifuss, who has
introduced measures to give heroin to long-term addicts.
	   The pro-legalization lobby said it was disappointed that only 26
percent backed it, but vowed to press ahead with a campaign to
decriminalize marijuana and other so-called soft drugs.
	   Last year the Swiss achieved overwhelmingly voted in favor of
state distribution of heroin to addicts. Government studies showed
this cut crime and misery associated with the drug scene.
	   At the same time as helping addicts, authorities tried to clamp
down on dealing and close once notorious open drug scenes in Zurich
and other cities.
	   Dreifuss and other ministers said the legalization plan was a
health risk and would turn Switzerland into a haven for drug
tourists and traffickers and anger neighboring European countries.
	   Church groups, police chiefs, social workers, doctors and other
professionals working with addicts held similar views.
	   ``The outcome shows that the Swiss population rejects extreme
solutions to the drug problem,'' said Felix Gutwiller, a pioneer of
the heroin distribution program.
	   No other European nation, not even the relatively liberal
Netherlands, has legalized the possession or sale of any drugs or
has plans to do so.
	   Switzerland has an estimated 30,000 drug addicts in its
population of 7 million _ one of Europe's highest rates.
	   A government survey published last week showed a rise in
cannabis consumption. It revealed that 27 percent of people aged
15-39 said they had smoked cannabis at least once. This compared
with 16 percent in 1992.
	   Given Switzerland's pioneering role on drug issues, the vote was
closely watched in other countries.
	   ``People around the world should keep their eye on Switzerland
as it's done a good job of showing the proper path for policy
reform,'' said Ethan Nadelmann, director of the New York based
Lindesmith Center Drug Policy Unit, which favors more relaxed laws.
	   To the government's relief, 64 percent of voters gave the
go-ahead to a finance package of 30.5 billion francs (dlrs 22.1
billion) to link Switzerland to Europe's high speed train network
and build two vast Alpine rail tunnels.
	   This is key to a planned transport accord between the European
Union and non-member Switzerland. EU ministers meet Monday for more
discussions on the deal.
	   Under the Swiss system, 100,000 signatures on a petition is
enough to force a referendum. The electorate thus goes to the polls
three or four times a year, and turnout was only 37 percent.

Russian wheat crop down 43 percent this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia produced 43 percent less wheat this year
than in 1997, but still has enough to feed its people next year, a
news agency reported Sunday.
	   The report corresponds to previous government estimates that the
Russian grain crop would be down sharply this year because of
drought and other problems.
	   However, it raises questions about the need for food aid that
the Russian government has agreed to receive from the United States
and the European Union. The U.S. aid is to include 1.7 million tons
of wheat.
	   Interfax, citing an unidentified Agriculture and Food Ministry
official, said Russia had harvested 25.6 million tons of wheat this
year, has 5 million tons left on farms and 4.8 million tons left
over from last year's bumper crop _ a total of 35.4 million tons.
	   The government estimates that the country needs 25.7 million
tons for food and 9.4 million tons for animal fodder, or a total of
35.1 million tons. That would appear to leave a surplus of 300,000
tons.
	   However, U.S. officials have said too little of Russia's grain
reserves are of sufficient quality for human consumption, and that
some of the Russian grain will be exported to surrounding countries
_ exports that the United States considers vital to Russia's
economy.

Britain says no deal with Chile over Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: FIXES typo to read `make' in lede; RAISES reference to
tug-of-war; edits to conform; UPPICKS 7th graf pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain denied Sunday that it is negotiating a
deal to free Gen. Augusto Pinochet in return for a pledge from
Chile to strip the former dictator of immunity and make him stand
trial at home on charges of genocide and torture.
	   However, the tug-of-war over 83-year-old Pinochet intensified
with human rights activists dismissing as a ``cruel joke'' on
victims the virtual pledges by Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel
Insulza to have general tried.
	   A spokesman for Home Secretary Jack Straw, who has until Dec. 11
to decide whether to block proceedings to extradite Pinochet to
Spain, said the decision would be based on judicial, not political
grounds.
	   ``We are not negotiating a deal,'' said a Home Office spokesman,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity. ``The Home Secretary
will consider what decision he will take in his role as
quasi-judicial arbiter under the terms of the Extradition Act.''
	   Two British newspapers, The Sunday Times and The Observer,
reported Sunday that Britain and Chile are close to a compromise
deal.
	   The argument and conflicting reports underlined the dilemma for
Straw since a ruling last week by Britain's highest court, the
House of Lords, that Pinochet has no immunity from arrest. He was
arrested Oct. 16 on a Spanish warrant during a regular visit to
London.

Porsche to skip next motor racing season
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ German automaker Porsche said Sunday it will skip
a season of motor racing competition to work on quality after a
string of poor race results.
	   The decision means Porsche, a record 16-time winner, won't
compete in the 1999 edition of the 24-hour race at Le Mans, France.
It will also skip next year's American Le Mans Series.
	   Porsche will enter both competitions in 2000, a company
statement said.
	   Board member Horst Marchart said the team's poor recent
performance in the GT championship, where Porsche trailed rivals
Mercedes and BMW, were a key reason making a break necessary.
	   ``The team and the drivers made mistakes, and the technology was
not always reliable,'' he said. ``There are no excuses.''

US lawyer warns Austrian firms to cooperate or face lawsuits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Austrian companies that profited from
slave laborers during WWII must cooperate with restitution efforts,
or face lawsuits, a New York-based attorney representing Holocaust
victims said.
	   ``If those (companies) who are responsible have a conscious,
they will realize they have an outstanding debt with each person
they used as a forced laborer,'' Ed Fagan told the Austria Press
Agency in Vienna Sunday. ``There is not much time left to bring
this to justice.''
	   Six weeks ago, Fagan offered to meet with three leading Austrian
companies believed to have profited from the use of slave labor
under the Nazi regime. So far none of the three _ VOEST, known then
as Hermann-Goering-Werke, Steyr-Daimler-Puch or Lenzinger
Zellstoffwerke _ have responded to the invitation.
	   Fagan warned that if the companies failed to cooperate with him,
they would be facing lawsuits in the near future.
	   ``Many of the survivors are already very old, so this can't wait
much longer,'' Fagan told APA, citing the case of a former
Steyr-Werke forced laborer who recently suffered from a brain
tumor. ``We will not allow these companies to deny responsibility
because victims have died,'' he said.
	   Fagan has been the lead attorney in several lawsuits against
German banks and companies filed in New York on behalf of Holocaust
victims. As many as 9 million people were used by the Nazis as
slave laborer, many of the them from eastern Europe.
	   While some people have criticized Fagan for trying to profit
from the Holocaust, many survivors support his cause.
	   Paul Frenkel is one of them. He was forced to work for a German
company during the war. ``As payment, my whole family was wiped
out,'' Frenkel said. ``We received nothing, while former SS
troopers receive pensions.''
	   ``We are not looking to get rich,'' said Jack Bresler, a
Polish-born survivor of Dachau and Auschwitz concentration camps,
who was also used as a slave laborer in Germany. He said its not
right that companies who became rich through slave laborers have
not had to compensate survivors in any way.
	   ``The war didn't end for us in 1945,'' Bresler said. ``We won't
forget it until we are dead.''

Nation of Islam leader meets Gadhafi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Louis Farrakhan, the leader of a U.S. Muslim
group, met with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on Sunday and
congratulated him on his recovery from a hip injury, state-run
Libyan radio reported.
	   Improved health will enable Gadhafi to ``carry on his leading
role in the service of Islamic causes in the world,'' Farrakhan was
quoted as saying by the radio, monitored by the British
Broadcasting Corp.
	   Later, state-run television showed Gadhafi _ dressed in a brown
robe and holding a cane _ meeting Farrakhan at his ceremonial tent
in the Libyan capital, Tripoli. The broadcast was monitored in
Cairo.
	   Gadhafi underwent surgery last July after injuring his hip,
reportedly while exercising.
	   The visit was Farrakhan's fifth to Libya in the past three
years. The leader of the U.S.-based Nation of Islam most recently
visited in December 1997.
	   It was not immediately clear how Farrakhan arrived in Libya or
how long he would stay. Most visitors arrive by ferry from Malta or
travel overland from Egypt or Tunisia; U.N. sanctions imposed in
1992 ban air travel to and from the country.
	   Farrakhan repeatedly has urged an end to the sanctions, which
were imposed to try to force Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans
wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie,
Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   Citing the sanctions and U.S. regulations, the Treasury
Department prohibited Farrakhan from accepting a dlrs 250,000 prize
he was awarded by Gadhafi in September 1996 for human rights work.
The Treasury also barred his group from accepting Gadhafi's offer
of a dlrs 1 billion gift for Nation of Islam activities.

Manchester United beats Leeds 3-2 to take second place

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Manchester United got the winning goal in the 77th
minute from Nicky Butt Sunday at Old Trafford to beat Leeds 3-2 and
move back into second place a point behind leaders Aston Villa.
	   Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink gave Leeds a 1-0 edge in the 29th. But
Manchester United went up 2-1 on goals by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and
Roy Keane. Harry Kewell leveled in the 52nd, setting the stage for
Butt's winner.
	   Defending league and F.A. Cup champion Arsenal salvaged a 1-1
draw Sunday with Middlesbrough on a goal in the 89th by Nicolas
Anelka after Brian Deane had given Middlesbrough a lead in the
sixth minute.
	   In Sunday's other Premier League match, struggling Liverpool
ended a three-game home losing streak with a 2-0 win over
last-place Blackburn on goals by Paul Ince (30th) and Michael Owen
(33rd).
	   Aston Villa leads with 29 points followed by Manchester United
(28). Villa played a 2-2 draw Saturday at Nottingham Forest. West
Ham holds third place (26) followed by Arsenal (25), Chelsea (24),
Middlesbrough (23) and Leeds (23). Liverpool moved into eighth
place (22).
	   Blackburn, which fired coach Roy Hodgson a week ago and is
playing under caretaker manager Tony Parkes, remained winless away
from home this season with only one point from the last seven
games. Rovers have nine points in 15 matches, good for 20th place
in the 20-team league.
	   In Glasgow, Scotland, league-leading Rangers defeated St.
Johnstone 2-1 Sunday on goals by Stephane Guivarc'h (6th) and Jorg
Albertz (37th) to win the League Cup. Nick Dasovic (8th) scored for
St. Johnstone.
	   In other Premier League games Saturday: Charlton 1, Everton 2;
Chelsea 1, Sheffield Wednesday 1; Coventry 1, Leicester 1;
Newcastle 3, Wimbledon 1; Southampton 0, Derby 1; West Ham 2,
Tottenham 1.
	   West Ham improved to 26 points _ its best start in a decade _
with its 2-1 home win over Tottenham on two early goals by Trevor
Sinclair.
	   In his first match with Newcastle after a 7-million pound (dlrs
11.5 million) transfer from Everton, Duncan Ferguson scored twice
at St. James' Park in a 3-1 come-from behind win over Wimbledon.
	   Chelsea was held to a disappointing 1-1 home draw with Sheffield
Wednesday, but the Blues still equaled a club record of 19 games
without a loss.
	   On Sunday in England's first division, West Brom defeated Wolves
2-0 and Oxford United won 3-1 at Norwich.
	   On Saturday in the first division, first-place Sunderland
bounced back from its first loss of the season, thrashing Sheffield
United 4-0. Sunderland leads with 43 points. Ipswich moved into
second with 38 points following a 3-0 win over Crewe.
	   On Saturday in Scotland's Premier League, Kilmarnock defeated
Dumfermline 3-0 to move up to 28 points behind leading Rangers (30
points). Celtic is third with 26 points after a 2-0 win over
Motherwell. In the day's other Premier League match, Dundee United
beat Aberdeen 3-0.

Report: Bin Laden operated terrorist network based in Albania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Albania says it has uncovered a terrorist network
operated by Osama Bin Laden, the Islamic fundamentalist accused of
masterminding the August embassy bombings in Africa, and that it's
members have infiltrated other parts of Europe, The Sunday Times
reported.
	   The newspaper quoted Fatos Klosi, the head of Shik, the Albanian
intelligence service, as saying that Bin Laden's network had sent
units to fight in Kosovo, the neighboring Serbian province.
	   ``Egyptians, Saudi Arabians, Algerians, Tunisians, Sudanese and
Kuwaitis _ they come from several different organizations,'' Klosi
was quoted as telling The Sunday Times.
	   He said he believed terrorists had already infiltrated other
parts of Europe from bases in Albania through a traffic in illegal
immigrants, who have been smuggled across the Mediterranean to
Italy in huge numbers.
	   Interpol believes more than 100,000 blank Albanian passports
were stolen in riots last year, providing ample opportunity for
terrorists to acquire false papers, the newspaper said.
	   Apparent confirmation of the Bin Laden's activities came earlier
this month during the murder trial of Claude Kader, 27, a French
national and self-confessed member of Bin Laden's Albanian network,
the newspaper said. Kader claimed during the trial that he had
visited Albania to recruit and arm fighters for Kosovo, and that
four of his associates were still at large.
	   Bin Laden is believed to have established an Albanian operation
in 1994 after telling the government that he was head of a wealthy
Saudi humanitarian agency wishing to help in Albania, the newspaper
reported.

Nation of Islam leader meets Gadhafi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Louis Farrakhan, the leader of a U.S. Muslim
group, met with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on Sunday and
congratulated him on his recovery from a hip injury, state-run
Libyan radio reported.
	   Improved health will enable Gadhafi to ``carry on his leading
role in the service of Islamic causes in the world,'' Farrakhan was
quoted as saying by the radio, monitored by the British
Broadcasting Corp.
	   Later, state-run television showed Gadhafi _ dressed in a brown
robe and holding a cane _ meeting Farrakhan at his ceremonial tent
in the Libyan capital, Tripoli. The broadcast was monitored in
Cairo.
	   Gadhafi underwent surgery last July after injuring his hip,
reportedly while exercising.
	   The visit was Farrakhan's fifth to Libya in the past three
years. The leader of the U.S.-based Nation of Islam most recently
visited in December 1997.
	   It was not immediately clear how Farrakhan arrived in Libya or
how long he would stay. Most visitors arrive by ferry from Malta or
travel overland from Egypt or Tunisia; U.N. sanctions imposed in
1992 ban air travel to and from the country.
	   Farrakhan repeatedly has urged an end to the sanctions, which
were imposed to try to force Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans
wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie,
Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   Citing the sanctions and U.S. regulations, the Treasury
Department prohibited Farrakhan from accepting a dlrs 250,000 prize
he was awarded by Gadhafi in September 1996 for human rights work.
The Treasury also barred his group from accepting Gadhafi's offer
of a dlrs 1 billion gift for Nation of Islam activities.
	   His Nation of Islam is a black nationalist group that says it is
guided by the Koran. It is not considered a true Muslim sect by
others who practice Islam.
	   Farrakhan's message to America's black community is one of
self-reliance, discipline, spirituality and separatism. Over the
years, he has said that whites and blacks should live separately,
that Jews are ``bloodsuckers'' who have a ``gutter religion,'' and
that whites are ``subhuman.''
	   He accuses news media of taking his comments out of context.

Corretja beats Moya to win ATP Championship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES fourth graf to show final was the longest on the tour
this year, adds prize money for Moya in fifth graf &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Alex Corretja captured the ATP Tour
World Championship on Sunday for his first major title, rallying
from two sets down to beat Carlos Moya in an all-Spanish final.
	   Corretja outlasted his good friend 3-6, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3, 7-5 in
the season-ending event to avenge his loss to Moya in the final of
the French Open.
	   ``Carlos, I'm sorry, I know how you feel right now,'' Corretja
said.
	   The four-hour victory was the longest final on the tour this
year and worth dlrs 1.36 million. It propelled Corretja three
places up to No. 3 in the final 1998 computer rankings, a career
high.
	   Moya, who squandered a 3-1 lead in the fifth set, collected dlrs
660,000 and will finish the year ranked fifth. He won two titles in
1998.
	   It was the first all-Spanish final in the history of the event
and the first Spanish triumph since Manuel Orantes won what was
then called the Masters in 1976 in Houston, Texas.
	   Corretja said he was dedicating the victory to his recently
deceased uncle and aunt.
	   Moya, 22, opened the match with a break of serve and did it
again to win the first set, smashing a volley on his fourth set
point.
	   Another break of serve in the second game was enough for Moya to
win the first set.
	   Corretja, 24, finally gained a break of his own when he hit a
deep-angled forehand winner to take a 3-1 lead in the third.
	   His advantage did not last long, however, ending in a
double-fault in the very next game.
	   Moya saved another break point with an ace to hold for 4-4.
	   Corretja, who had upset top-ranked Pete Sampras in the
semifinals, was in trouble again in the 11th game, but hit a
sizzling backhand passing shot down the line to hold serve. In the
next game, Moya's forehand sailed into the net, giving Corretja the
set.
	   A double-fault by Moya gave Corretja a 5-3 lead and he served
out the fourth set.
	   Corretja fell down 1-3 in the fifth, but broke right back. A
forehand by Moya that sailed long gave Corretja another break, a
5-4 lead and a chance to serve out the match. He wasted one match
point, when Moya hit a volley winner after a long rally, and then
dropped his serve.
	   But Moya could not hold serve either and the drama ended on
Corretja's second match point in the next game when Moya's forehand
sailed long.
	   Corretja gained the biggest victory of his career and his ninth
title, fifth in 1998.
	   It was Corretja's first win over Moya in four matches this year.
	   Moya beat Corretja in the quarterfinals of the Monte Carlo
tournament, before winning the major clay court event. At the U.S.
Open, Moya also beat Corretja before losing in the semifinals.
	   Coming into this elite tournament that brings together the top
eight players of the year, Moya had lost all five of his indoor
matches of the year. He had not reached a final on any other
surface than clay.
	   But he seems to thrive in the event, having reached the
semifinals in his first appearance last year. He beat big-serving
Tim Henman in Saturday's semifinals.
	   Corretja has a better indoor record, having won the tournament
in Lyon, France in October, becoming the first Spanish player to
win an indoor title since that Orantes victory in the 1976 Masters.

Sutherland, psychologist who wrote of own illness, dies at 71

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to restore cycle designator &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Stuart Sutherland, a British psychologist who
turned his own experience of manic depression into his best known
work, has died. He was 71.
	   Sutherland died Nov. 8 at home in Brighton, the south England
town where in 1964 he founded the internationally respected
Laboratory of Experimental Psychology at the University of Sussex.
News reports said he died from a heart attack.
	   Sutherland, who graduated from Cambridge University with degrees
in classics and psychology, wrote a string of academically
impressive publications.
	   But it was his book ``Breakdown,'' first published in 1976, that
had the widest influence.
	   The frank account of his illness, which eventually was
successfully treated with the drug lithium, was the inspiration for
a play, ``Melon,'' by Simon Gray, which ran in London's West End.
The work also broke new ground for airing personal agony.
	   Sutherland described how his illness developed a pattern of
being depressed every summer, when he could do nothing, followed by
hypomania each winter, when he felt tremendous, but endangered his
health and home life with wildly optimistic and extravagant
behavior. He would arrive home, for example, with cases of
expensive champagne.
	   He said his family told him they found him more tolerable when
depressed than when hypomanic.
	   ``At least I would listen to others in my depressions, even if I
did not have much to say myself, while the absolute conviction of
being right and the egocentricity induced by hypomania made it
almost intolerable for others,'' wrote Sutherland.
	   Norman Stuart Sutherland, who was born March 26, 1927, studied
zoology for a doctorate and his work ``Shape Discrimination in
Animals,'' published 1959 by Britain's Experimental Psychology
Society led to an appointment at Oxford University.
	   He was a visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in the early 60s before founding the unit at Sussex
University where he assembled a remarkable team of scientists.
	   His publications included the ``Macmillan Dictionary of
Psychology'' and ``Irrationality: The Enemy Within,'' as well as a
novel, ``Men Change Too.''
	   In 1966 he married Josie Fogden, who survives him with their two
daughters.

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A stormy negotiating session ended
Sunday with a Palestinian official walking out and others saying
the latest Mideast accord was in jeopardy, mainly over Israel's
refusal to release military and political prisoners.
	   During the negotiating session to work out details of last
month's Wye peace accord, the Palestinians became furious over the
so-called security prisoner issue.
	   ``This is a crisis situation and we have asked for American
intervention,'' said senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, who
was flying late Sunday to Washington to join Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat for meetings with Clinton administration officials on
the issue.
	   Tensions between the parties have been building since Israel
released 250 prisoners, including 150 common criminals, two weeks
ago.
	   The Palestinians had expected Israel to release military and
political prisoners who fought against the Israeli occupation, but
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said no one jailed for murder or
other violent acts would be among 500 prisoners to be released as
part of the latest peace accord.
	   ``I have no intentions, even the slightest of the slightest, to
release murderers or to release Hamas members,'' Netanyahu told
army radio, referring to the radical Islamic group.
	   ``Hamas is at war with us and each Hamas member who is freed
will join the ranks of murderers. To me, it doesn't matter who they
murdered. It's important that murderers be behind bars and locks,''
he said.
	   In Sunday's negotiating session in the Palestinian city of
Jericho, Palestinian official Hassan Asfour stormed out of the
meeting with Israeli Cabinet Secretary Dan Naveh.
	   ``We felt that the Israeli government has no intention of
dealing with the issues seriously,'' Asfour said.
	   Erekat said he expected Israel to hand over another 150 security
prisoners in place of the criminals set free in the first release.
	   ``We did not go to Washington to negotiate the release of car
thieves,'' Erekat told The Associated Press. He said the sides had
agreed in talks in Washington on terms for releasing prisoners, but
Israel was not adhering to them.
	   Implementation of the U.S.-brokered land-for-peace accord would
be difficult to continue under the present circumstances, Erekat
said.
	   Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority has come under intense
pressure from its citizens, who charge that negotiators are going
soft on the prisoner issue. The matter is especially sensitive
because many Palestinian families are affected by it and had
expected peace deals to bring their relatives home.
	   Among other Palestinian grievances raised at Sunday's meeting
was increased Jewish settlement activity, Israeli confiscation of
Arab-owned land for roads and a decision by Israel's Cabinet to
hand over no more than 1 percent of the West Bank in any future
withdrawal.
	   In the West Bank village of Ein-Yabrud, Israeli troops separated
Jewish settlers who tried to take over an Arab-owned home and
Palestinian villagers after the two sides pelted each other with
stones. The Israeli army declared the house and its surroundings a
closed military area, forcing both sides to evacuate.
	   And in the village of El-Khader near Bethlehem, Israeli
bulldozers were forced to halt work ripping up village land to make
way for a bypass road for Jewish settlers, while Palestinian
farmers there challenged an expropriation notice in an Israeli
court.
	   The Palestinians have accused Israel of violating the Mideast
peace agreement by confiscating large quantities of Palestinian
land for new bypass roads for Jewish settlements which will be
isolated as a result of Israeli troop withdrawals.
	   Also Sunday, the Israeli army prevented Palestinian officials,
including Cabinet ministers and legislators, from traveling from
the Gaza Strip to the West Bank across Israeli territory.
	   The Israeli army spokesman said the blockade was in retaliation
for the refusal of the Palestinian police to let Israeli trucks
carry building materials to an isolated Jewish settlement outside
Gaza City.
	   The Palestinians said new construction would be a violation of
the agreement.

Lawyers' Union creates fund for Lockerbie defense
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Libyan Lawyers' Union has created a fund
to help pay for the defense of two Libyans charged in the 1988
Lockerbie bombing case, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported
Sunday.
	   Mohammed al-Ellagi, head of the union, was quoted as saying that
a number of Arab lawyers have volunteered their expertise or
pledged money to help cover the legal costs of the suspects, Abdel
Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah.
	   Al-Ellagi did not say how much money the Lawyers' Union hoped to
collect.
	   Libya has accepted in principle a joint U.S.-British offer to
try the Libyans in the Netherlands under Scottish law and with
Scottish Judges.
	   But Tripoli still is trying to get assurances about the
suspects' handling in the Netherlands. And, if convicted, it wants
the men jailed in Libya rather than Scotland.
	   The men are wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am flight over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   In September, Libya appointed a new legal team headed by Kamal
Mahjoub, a former Libyan foreign minister. The defense team had
been headed by a private attorney, Ibrahim Legwell.
	   Lawyers from Egypt have said they will participate in the
suspects' defense, and Libyan officials said attorneys also will
come from Malta, the United States and Europe.

Telecom Italia May Give Up Majority Control In Digital TV Deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Telecom Italia may give up majority control
in a deal to create a digital platform in Italy or exit from pay TV
altogether, Italian press reports said over the weekend.
	   This could mean a bigger piece of the digital pie for Australian
media giant Rupert Murdoch.
	   Murdoch's News Corp. is close to signing a digital-TV deal with
Telecom Italia that would create a company to compete with Canal
Plus' Italian unit, Telepiu.
	   Murdoch said that Telecom Italia would hold 51 percent of the
new company, his News Corp. Europe 39 percent, and France's TF1 10
percent.
	   But Franco Bernabe, Telecom Italia new chief executive, is
rethinking the company's participation in digital television. He
was meeting with Murdoch Sunday and Monday to work out a deal,
reports said.
	   Bernabe is considering lowering Telecom Italia's participation
below 51 percent to lighten Telecom's financial burden. Under this
proposal, Telecom would cede 20 percent or 30 percent to Murdoch or
another partner, reports said.
	   This would enable Telecom Italia to focus on network management
and commercial activity, the Italian daily Corriere della Sera
reported.
	   Corriere said this could open the door to new partners,
including Italian publisher Rizzoli-Corriere della Sera and
Germany's privately held Wissenschaftlicher Springer Verlag.
	   Telecom Italia may also get out of pay television, which has
lost money in Italy so far.
	   Meanwhile, reports said the government may limit on soccer TV
rights, are seen as the key to success in Italy's nascent digital
television market. Murdoch is negotiating for exclusive rights to
the matches of all 38 of Italy's Serie A and B club for the next
five years.

Israeli jets hit guerrilla bases in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes struck suspected
guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon on Sunday for the second
consecutive day to avenge attacks on Israeli outposts, Lebanese
security officials said.
	   Two Israeli jets fired two air-to-surface missiles on hills
between the villages of Toulin and Qabrigha, 23 kilometers (14
miles) southeast of the port city of Tyre, the officials said. They
spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the 6:20 p.m.
(1620 GMT) raid on the area, which Lebanese guerrillas have used in
the past as a base.
	   On Saturday, Israeli warplanes struck suspected guerrilla
hideouts in the south, a day after two Israeli soldiers were killed
in a roadside bombing near Tyre that was claimed by the Lebanese
guerrilla group Hezbollah.
	   The latest raid came as Israeli Cabinet ministers called for
military strikes against Beirut's power and water supplies to
retaliate for Hezbollah attacks.
	   Seven Israeli soldiers have been killed in the past two weeks by
the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
	   Hezbollah has led a guerrilla war to try to oust an estimated
1,500 Israeli soldiers and their 2,500 allied militiamen from the
self-styled ``security zone'' that Israel set up in southern
Lebanon in 1985 to protect against cross-border guerrilla attacks.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a European
trip to deal with the growing debate in Israel over the losses in
Lebanon and mounting calls for a unilateral Israeli withdrawal.
	   Sunday's airstrike came shortly after Hezbollah guerrillas
claimed responsibility for mortar and rocket attacks on positions
held by Israel and its allied South Lebanon Army militia in the
south. No casualties were reported.

Former rivals gear up for round-the-world launch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARRAKECH, Morocco (AP) _ Their rivalry now behind them, Virgin
boss Richard Branson and Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett are
putting the final touches to a joint bid to circle the globe in a
hot air balloon.
	   Officials at the Menara military airport in Marrakech, who
requested anonymity, said Sunday that their balloon was in place
and that preparations were advanced.
	   If conditions are right, the launch is expected to take place
this week.
	   ``If we make this, I think we'll all earn a place in aviation
history,'' Fossett said Sunday in an interview with Britain's Sky
News.
	   He said he was looking forward to some company since he usually
flies solo.
	   ``It's different, but it's enjoyable being part of a team. I
like the guys I'm flying with, and I think we're going to have a
great time,'' he said.
	   ``Fortunately, these are pretty mellow guys. They've done this
before. They know how to keep cool and not aggravate each other. I
think we're going to get along well together.''
	   Fossett broke his own distance record in August, traveling more
than 15,200 miles (24,320 kilometers) before a storm damaged his
balloon, sending it plunging into the sea off Australia.
	   Branson, the flamboyant tycoon whose Virgin company name adorns
everything from record stores and clothing to an airline, has
failed to accomplish the feat in four attempts.
	   Branson's previous attempts have been hampered by weather. The
only time he managed to take off _ in January 1997 _ his balloon
crash-landed in the Algerian desert.
	   The two former rivals will be accompanied by Swedish balloonist
Pers Lindstrand in the Virgin Global Challenger. They also have a
backup balloon in case their main one is damaged.

Iranian navy to hold maneuvers starting Monday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Iranian navy will hold exercises _ some
involving missiles _ starting Monday in the Gulf, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported Sunday.
	   IRNA said the five days of maneuvers, code-named Unity 77, would
involve some 50,000 troops.
	   The agency, in a report monitored by the British Broadcasting
Corp., said the exercises would extend from the central Gulf to the
Strait of Hormuz and into the Gulf of Oman.
	   The report quoted Isa Galverdi, a commander of the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps, as saying that the guards as well as
army and air force units would participate.
	   ``In these exercises, 160 naval vessels and 120 aircraft will
take part, and the latter will conduct 350 sorties,'' Galverdi
said.
	   He said the war games would involve missile-launching units of
the Revolutionary Guards and that mock ``electronic warfare will be
carried out over a wide area.''
	   Among the maneuvers' goals will be assessing the country's
defense against chemical, biological and nuclear attacks, the
report said.
	   It will be the largest military exercise by Iran since
September, when some 70,000 Iranian troops held war games near the
border with Afghanistan to show Iran's displeasure over the Taliban
militia's detention of a number of Iranians.

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS to third GS of season, Parini's fifth career win.
UPDATES with season standings. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SESTRIERE, Italy (AP) _ Jeff Archibald edged Nicolas Huet by
five hundredths of a second Sunday in a Snowboard World Cup giant
slalom to pick up his first career victory and move atop the season
standings.
	   Italy's Margerita Parini won the women's race, taking a
commanding lead of nearly two seconds after the first run and
holding off Olympic champion Karine Ruby in the second.
	   Archibald, of Ogden, Utah, and France's Huet shared the
provisional lead after both clocking 56.30 seconds in the men's
first run, but the American's second run of 55.80 was just enough
to give him the win.
	   Richard Richardson of Sweden finished third in the season's
third giant slalom at this resort in Italy's western Alps with a
total time of 1:52.33, 0.23 seconds off the pace.
	   Archibald moved atop the overall standings with 1,600 points,
140 ahead of Austria's Stefan Kaltschuetz. Canadian Jasey Jay
Anderson, the 1997 world champion, is another 10 points behind.
	   Huet and Ruby, also French, captured parallel slalom races in
Sestriere on Saturday.
	   Ruby nearly added another triumph Sunday with a sparkling second
run of 59.42 for a total time of 2:01.93. But Parini put together
two consistent rides of 1:00.36 and 1:00.79 to notch her fifth
career World Cup win with a combined 2:01.15.
	   France's Isabelle Blanc was third in 2:03.07.
	   Former world champion Sondra Van Ert of the United States was
sixth Sunday in 2:04.41.
	   Parini and Ruby are even in the season giant slalom standings
with 2,400 points apiece, with Italian Lidia Trettel third with
1,670 and Blanc next with 1,390.

German villagers dump transsexual mayor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with mayor dismissed, RECASTS with more details on
Lindner. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   QUELLENDORF, Germany (AP) _ Residents of this eastern German
village voted to dismiss their mayor Sunday after he announced he
was becoming a woman.
	   Norbert Lindner, 40, was elected to a seven-year term in 1996
but shocked many villagers last summer when he began wearing
women's clothes and calling himself Michaela. Village board members
voted to hold a ballot on the mayor's ouster.
	   Lindner's celebrity has since spread far beyond the village of
1,048 inhabitants, where transsexuals from Germany and France
converged Sunday to show support for the mayor.
	   But the burghers of Quellendorf voted 482-235 to oust Lindner,
despite his appeal for tolerance.
	   ``I think society as a whole has some catching up to do,'' he
told reporters.
	   Lindner, a father of two children whose wife has left him, said
he plans to start sex change surgery Thursday. A member of the
reformed East German communists, he had said he would leave Germany
if voted out of office.

Charles and other royals to lose right to sit House of Lords
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince Charles, along with his father, brother and
two royal cousins, will lose his right to sit in the House of Lords
under the Labor Party government's planned purge of Britain's
unelected upper chamber, Buckingham Palace said Sunday.
	   Not that anyone will be missing much: Charles has not been to
the Lords since making a maiden speech in June 1974.
	   And then he joked that _ apart from his mother, Queen Elizabeth
II, who opens each annual session of Parliament _ it was about 100
years since a member of the royal family gone to the chamber.
	   The move will come in terms of a bill to be introduced soon
removing the 600-year-old right of the 759 aristocrats with
inherited titles to vote in Lords, where they sit alongside some
500 peers with lifetime titles, mainly retired politicians.
	   ``Formal advice has been received from the government on reforms
and in line with established constitutional practice, the queen has
accepted that advice,'' a spokesman for Buckingham Palace said.
	   Taking ``advice'' is British parlance for the fact that queen is
the titular head of state and does not have political power.
	   The other members of the royal family currently entitled to sit
in the Lords are Prince Philip, Charles' father who also the Duke
of Edinburgh, Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, who is the queen's
second son, and the Duke of Kent and the Duke of Gloucester.
	   The dukes of Kent and Gloucester are first cousins of the queen
_ sons of younger brothers of the queen's father, King George VI.
	   Liam Fox, spokesman for the Conservative Party, which opposes
the Lords' bill because the government has not said what the
new-look Lords will be, complained that removing the royals ``has
the symbolic effect of reducing the role for the monarchy in
Parliament.''

Russia holds first Mother's Day, to most mothers' surprise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ It came as a surprise to most people, but Sunday
was Mother's Day in Russia.
	   The new holiday was created earlier this year by President Boris
Yeltsin. But it was preceded by absolutely no fanfare or commercial
hoopla, and many people only learned about it on Sunday when
government officials were quoted on radio and television hailing
the holiday.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Valentina Matviyenko, the highest ranking
woman in the Russian government, used the holiday as an occasion to
call for improved government support for women. She noted that the
birth rate in Russia has fallen in the past few years, and the
health of women and children has been declining.
	   ``Mother's Day is expected to promote the unification of
progressive forces in society to solve such important problems ...
as the support for motherhood and the consolidation of the
family,'' she said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Russia already has a holiday honoring women. Every March 8,
sons, husbands and lovers buy flowers for the significant women in
their lives to mark International Women's Day.
	   Then, many women grumble, they go back to taking women for
granted for another year.

Iranian dissident reported missing for weeks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A political activist critical of the Iranian
government has been missing for weeks and anonymous callers to his
family have said he has been ``executed,'' a group of Iran's top
dissidents said Sunday.
	   Pirooz Davani, leader of a small group called the United Left,
``has been missing for weeks, and the security and intelligence
services have flatly told his family that they never arrested
him,'' said a statement signed by 79 of Iran's top dissidents.
	   There was no immediate comment from the government.
	   The dissidents' statement on Davani, faxed to The Associated
Press in Tehran, follows the murder last week of another leading
dissident, Dariush Foruhar.
	   The disappearance comes amid a power struggle between Iran's
moderate president, Mohammad Khatami, and hard-line clerics backed
by street thugs who often have taken the law into their own hands.
	   Over the past year, the vigilantes linked to right-wing clerics
have attacked dissidents, liberal newspapers and even a reformist
Cabinet minister. They have also broken up pro-democracy rallies.
	   According to the statement, Davani's mother died of a heart
attack after receiving repeated anonymous phone calls saying her
son had been arrested and executed.
	   ``It has not been determined which institution, individual or
individuals captured Mr. Davani, where he was executed, or what
happened to him,'' the statement said.
	   The dissidents urged Khatami, who has promised more political
freedoms since his election last year, to order an investigation
into Davani's disappearance.
	   Khatami has demanded the killers of Foruhar, who was stabbed to
death last week at his Tehran home along with his wife, be brought
to justice. Iranian newspapers have reported several arrests in
connection with those murders.
	   The Foruhar killings coincided with the death of Majid Sharif, a
writer for the dissident publication Iran-e-Farda. His death is
still under investigation, but his family and newspapers both have
said he may have died of a heart attack.
	   In a letter sent to Khatami after the Foruhars' murder, the New
York-based Human Rights Watch said it ``is deeply concerned that
the murders of the Foruhars may be part of a pattern of
government-condoned repression directed against critics in Iran
which goes back many years.''

Communist-era prosecutor vows to fight extradition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OXFORD, England (AP) _ An elderly communist-era prosecutor
denied Sunday that she organized the execution of a Polish war
hero, and vowed to fight attempts by Poland to have her extradited
from Britain.
	   Historians say Helena Wolinska, 79, is responsible for the 1952
arrest and subsequent execution of Gen. Emil Fieldorf, a World War
II resistance hero, on allegedly fabricated evidence.
	   She failed to appear in Poland on Oct. 15 to testify at the
investigation of Fieldorf's death.
	   Col. Tadeusz Krysicki, head of the Warsaw Military Prosecutor's
Office, said it was seeking a temporary arrest warrant for
Wolinska, which he called a requirement for any further steps
toward her extradition.
	   ``The problem is that everybody is now dead, and I am the only
person alive to blame,'' Wolinska said Sunday. ``Now they have
found a live person, they are using any ammunition available. I
couldn't expect a fair trial in Poland. I am already sentenced
there.''
	   Wolinska, who is married to Wlodzimierz Brus, emeritus professor
of modern Russian and East European studies at Oxford University,
has lived in Britain since 1972.
	   Fieldorf, known by the alias Nil, led the Polish underground
Home Army that fought the Nazis during World War II. After the war,
he refused to collaborate with the secret service of the new
communist regime.
	   He was charged by Wolinska in 1952 with killing Soviet soldiers
and leftist resisters during the war, and was hanged in 1953.
Historians say Wolinska fabricated the charges.
	   ``I did not charge him,'' Wolinska contended. ``This is such a
lie that even the Polish press did not write it. I was chief
prosecutor at the time, but it wasn't my case. I was in the army
part of the jurisdiction, and Fieldorf was tried in the civil
courts.''
	   If formally charged and convicted of denying Fieldorf his
freedom, Wolinska could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison.

Iran says it stopped two boats smuggling goods to Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The Iranian navy has intercepted two boats
trying to smuggle goods into Iraq in violation of U.N. sanctions, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
	   An Iranian navy patrol stopped a boat heading for Iraq on Nov.
10 and escorted it to international waters, the English-language
Tehran Times said. It did not say where the boat was coming from.
	   In another incident, an Indian boat heading toward Iraq was
fined about dlrs 650 for attempted smuggling, the paper reported.
It did not say when the boat was intercepted.
	   The United States has accused Iran of allowing ships smuggling
goods to and from Iraq to pass through its territorial waters.
	   A U.S.-led multinational naval force carries out patrols in
international waters to intercept ships trying to break the embargo
but is not allowed to travel through Iranian waters.
	   The U.N. embargo was imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, which touched off the Gulf War.

Porsche to skip 1999 endurance season

 &UR; EDS: REPEATING to CORRECT style on slug. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ German automaker Porsche said Sunday it will skip
next year's endurance auto racing season to improve quality after a
string of poor results.
	   The decision means Porsche, a record 16-time winner of the 24
Hours of LeMans, won't compete in the 1999 race and also will not
run in next year's inaugural American Le Mans Series.
	   Porsche will enter both competitions in 2000, a company
statement said.
	   Board member Horst Marchart said the team's poor recent
performance in the GT championship, where Porsche trailed rivals
Mercedes and BMW, were a key reason making a break necessary.
	   ``The team and the drivers made mistakes, and the technology was
not always reliable,'' he said. ``There are no excuses.''

Corretja beats Moya to win ATP Championship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Alex Corretja captured the ATP Tour
World Championship on Sunday for his first major title, rallying
from two sets down to beat Carlos Moya in an all-Spanish final.
	   Corretja outlasted his good friend 3-6, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3, 7-5 in
the season-ending event to avenge his loss to Moya in the final of
the French Open.
	   ``Carlos, I'm sorry, I know how you feel right now,'' Corretja
said.
	   The four-hour victory was the longest final on the tour this
year and worth dlrs 1.36 million. It propelled Corretja three
places up to No. 3 in the final 1998 computer rankings, a career
high.
	   ``I was very strong mentally, even when I was two sets down I
was still thinking that I could win the match,'' Corretja said,
hugging the glass trophy. ``I learned a lot from the defeat in
Paris.''
	   Corretja said he also kept thinking of the 1984 final of the
French Open, when Ivan Lendl, his tennis role model, came back from
two sets down to defeat John McEnroe.
	   Moya, who squandered a 3-1 lead in the fifth set, collected dlrs
660,000 and will finish the year ranked fifth. He won two titles in
1998.
	   It was the first all-Spanish final in the history of the event
and the first Spanish triumph since Manuel Orantes won what was
then called the Masters in 1976 in Houston, Texas.
	   Corretja said he was dedicating the victory to his recently
deceased uncle and aunt.
	   Corretja, 24, finally gained his first break when he hit a
deep-angled forehand winner to take a 3-1 lead in the third set.
	   ``That was the key of the match,'' Moya said. ``He started
playing better and better and I wasn't able to use my chances.''
	   Corretja's advantage did not last long, however, ending in a
double-fault in the very next game.
	   Moya saved another break point with an ace to hold for 4-4.
	   Corretja, who had upset top-ranked Pete Sampras in the
semifinals, was in trouble again in the 11th game, but hit a
sizzling backhand passing shot down the line to hold serve. In the
next game, Moya's forehand sailed into the net, giving Corretja the
set.
	   A double-fault by Moya gave Corretja a 5-3 lead and he served
out the fourth set.
	   Corretja fell down 1-3 in the fifth, but broke right back. A
forehand by Moya that sailed long gave Corretja another break, a
5-4 lead and a chance to serve out the match. He wasted one match
point, when Moya hit a volley winner after a long rally, and then
dropped his serve.
	   But Moya could not hold serve either and the drama ended on
Corretja's second match point in the next game when Moya's forehand
sailed long.
	   Corretja then joined his brothers and friends from Barcelona in
doing a ``dive'' next to the court.
	   ``It was the first time in my life that I come back after two
sets down,'' he said. Once before, in 1994 in Wimbledon, his
opponent retired, ``so it doesn't count,'' Corretja said.
	   Corretja's first win over Moya in four matches this year earned
him the ninth career title and the fifth of 1998.
	   Moya, 22, said the loss was a ``big disappointment.''
	   ``I was so close and I had many chances. But he played better on
big points,'' Moya said.
	   He beat Corretja in the quarterfinals of the Monte Carlo
tournament, before winning the major clay court event. At the U.S.
Open, Moya also beat Corretja before losing in the semifinals.
	   Coming into this elite tournament that brings together the top
eight players of the year, Moya had lost all five of his indoor
matches of the year. He had not reached a final on any other
surface than clay.
	   But he seems to thrive in the event, having reached the
semifinals in his first appearance last year. He beat big-serving
Tim Henman in Saturday's semifinals.
	   Corretja has a better indoor record, having won the tournament
in Lyon, France in October, becoming the first Spanish player to
win an indoor title since that Orantes victory in the 1976 Masters.

Italy's foreign minister to Moscow, will discuss Kurdish rebel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's foreign minister flew to Moscow on Sunday
for talks with Russian officials on the Kurdish rebel leader now
seeking asylum in Italy.
	   Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini's visit was scheduled before
Abdullah Ocalan was arrested in Rome when he arrived on a flight
from Moscow, but the Ocalan affair is expected to dominate his
talks Monday with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov.
	   Dini told La Stampa newspaper that he hoped to find out about
the events leading up to Ocalan's journey to Rome and ``above all
what was the Russian position on his decision to come to Italy.''
	   Turkey wants Ocalan extradited to stand trial on terrorism and
other capital crimes, but Italian law forbids extradition when the
suspect faces the death penalty. Ocalan is also wanted in Germany,
but it won't extradite him because it fears problems with its
Turkish and Kurdish immigrant population.
	   That leaves Italy stuck with Ocalan, a controversial figure who
leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has been waging a
guerrilla war for autonomy in southeastern Turkey for 14 years.
	   The Ocalan affair has badly soured Italy's relations with NATO
ally and trading partner Turkey.
	   An Italian lawmaker revealed last week that he had gone to
Moscow to accompany Ocalan to Rome. He said Russian officials met
him at the airport and took him to the rebel leader, who flew to
Italy on a false passport later in the day.
	   Ocalan has applied for political asylum in Italy, but Italian
Premier Massimo D'Alema suggested Italy might instead expel the
rebel leader.
	   ``Asylum has to be examined with great seriousness because
Ocalan is accused of grave crimes and is accused of carrying out
terrorist acts even in Germany,'' he told Italian state television
on Saturday night.
	   If Ocalan is expelled, Italy might opt to send him back from
where he came: Russia.

Report: International TV crew trapped on arctic island
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An international television crew that was shooting
a documentary film about polar bears has become stuck on a remote
arctic island and is quickly running out of food, a news agency
said Sunday.
	   The crew, whose members are from Russia, Japan and Australia,
has been holed up in a cabin on Wrangel Island, off Russia's far
northeast coast and about 550 kilometers (350 miles) east of
Alaska, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The crew arrived on the island on Sept. 2 and had intended to
leave on Oct. 15, but was delayed by bad weather, the news agency
said. The weather has also kept Russia's Emergency Situations
Ministry from being able to carry out a helicopter rescue.
	   The crew is said to have only a two-day supply of buckwheat
left, ITAR-Tass said. Residents of a village about 130 kilometers
(80 miles) from the hut have been trying to drive a snow tractor to
the film crew with emergency supplies, but have made very slow
progress because of the weather.
	   The temperature has been hovering around minus 30 Celsius (minus
22 Fahrenheit), with a strong wind. The crew has a diesel
generator, a computer, a cellular phone and has access to e-mail,
but is running out of fuel, the report said.
	   ITAR-Tass identified the Japanese crewmember as Tatsuhiko
Kobayashi, an employee of NHK, the Japanese television company. It
did not identify the others.

Israeli jets hit guerrilla bases in south Lebanon

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes struck suspected
guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon on Sunday for the second
consecutive day to avenge attacks on Israeli outposts, Lebanese
security officials said.
	   An Israeli jet fired two air-to-surface missiles on hills
between the villages of Toulin and Qabrigha, 23 kilometers (14
miles) southeast of the port city of Tyre, the officials said. A
second Israeli jet provided cover, they said.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the 6:20 p.m.
(1620 GMT) raid on the area, which Lebanese guerrillas have used in
the past as a base.
	   Shortly after the raid, a member of the Israeli-allied South
Lebanon Army militia was wounded when the Lebanese guerrilla group
Hezbollah attacked his post with artillery and mortar fire, the
security officials said. They spoke on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   Israeli warplanes have attacked suspected Hezbollah bases in the
south almost daily since Nov. 8. There have been no reports of
casualties from the raids.
	   On Saturday, Israeli jets struck suspected guerrilla hideouts in
the south, a day after two Israeli soldiers were killed in a
roadside bombing near Tyre that was claimed by Hezbollah.
	   The latest air raid came as Israeli Cabinet ministers called for
military strikes against Beirut's power and water supplies to
retaliate for Hezbollah attacks that have killed seven Israeli
soldiers in the past two weeks.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, warned Sunday that any attack on
Lebanon's utilities would draw retaliation.
	   ``The resistance (Hezbollah) is ready more than at any time
before to carry out strikes similar to those that may be launched
by the Israeli enemy against the infrastructure in Lebanon,''
Mohammed Fneish, a Hezbollah representative in Parliament, told the
guerrilla group's Al-Manar television.
	   He said Hezbollah's response ``will be painful.''
	   Meanwhile, Washington urged all sides to show restraint,
state-run Beirut Radio reported.
	   The radio said the appeal came in a letter from U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright to Prime Minister Rafik Hariri that was
delivered by the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon, David Satterfield.
	   Hezbollah has led a guerrilla war to try to oust an estimated
1,500 Israeli soldiers and their 2,500 allied militiamen from the
self-styled ``security zone'' that Israel set up in southern
Lebanon in 1985 to protect against cross-border guerrilla attacks.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a European
trip to deal with the growing debate in Israel over the losses in
Lebanon and mounting calls for a unilateral Israeli withdrawal.
	   Sunday's air strike came shortly after Hezbollah guerrillas
claimed responsibility for mortar and rocket attacks on positions
held by Israel and its allied South Lebanon Army militia in the
south. No casualties were reported in the incident.

self-styled ``security zone'' that Israel set up in southern
Lebanon in 1985 to protect against cross-border guerrilla attacks.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a European
trip to deal with the growing debate in Israel over the losses in
Lebanon and mounting calls for a unilateral Israeli withdrawal.
	   Sunday's airstrike came shortly after Hezbollah guerrillas
claimed responsibility for mortar and rocket attacks on positions
held by Israel and its allied South Lebanon Army militia in the
south. No casualties were reported in the incident.

Kofi Annan in Algeria to complete Western Sahara mission
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
arrived in Algeria Sunday where he was to meet with Polisario Front
rebels to discuss the future of the Western Sahara.
	   Annan, who did not speak to reporters on arrival, was to meet
with the rebels, who are fighting for the desert territory's
independence, in their refugee camps on Monday in Tindouf,
southwest Algeria.
	   Earlier this month, Annan cut short a North African swing in
which he met with officials, including Morocco's King Hassan II and
Moroccan Prime Minister Abderrahmane Youssoufi, to discuss plans
for a referendum on the Western Sahara.
	   Annan had to leave prematurely as a result of the standoff
between Iraq and the United Nations, and canceled the trip to
Tindouf.
	   The Western Sahara dispute is over who is eligible to vote in
the referendum, which could be held next year. Morocco and the
Polisario Front rebels both claim the Western Sahara.
	   The United Nations has been working since 1991 to hold the
referendum on the vast desert area along the Atlantic Ocean, which
Morocco claims is part of its kingdom. The region was colonized by
Spain until 1975.
	   While in Morocco on Nov. 8, Annan said neighboring countries,
like Mauritania, could contribute to resolving the nearly
quarter-century-old dispute.
	   To date, 147,249 people have been declared eligible to take part
in the referendum. But the eligibility of another 65,000 is
contested.
	   Annan will return to Algiers on Thursday and will meet with
President Liamine Zeroual, officials said.

<TEXT>
	   ALMOLOYA DE JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) _ The imprisoned brother of
former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has won a
limited legal victory with a judge agreeing to dismiss one of the
several criminal charges he faces.
	   Judge Humberto Venancio Penda ruled late Saturday there was
insufficient reason to pursue a second charge of illegal enrichment
against Raul Salinas.
	   The charge presented last week accused Salinas of illegally
acquiring more than 43 million pesos (dlrs 4.3 million), apparently
while he served as a mid-level bureaucrat during his brother's
1988-94 term.
	   Salinas, who had asked the judge to dismiss corruption charges
Thursday, cheered the ruling as ``great news,'' according to his
lawyers Raul Cardenas Rioseco and Raul Guerrero Palma.
	   The lawyers said the second charge had been ``illegal'' since
authorities had never asked Salinas to demonstrate the origin of
money.
	   Guerrero Palma said his client, who says he is innocent of all
charges, ``reiterated his confidence in the justice system.''
	   Salinas, jailed in a maximum-security prison west of Mexico City
since early 1995, is accused of corruption and of masterminding the
1994 assassination of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the
secretary-general of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party
and Salinas' former brother-in-law.
	   Mexican authorities said last month they had discovered 289
secret bank accounts, 123 homes, ranches, apartments and land
holdings under Salinas' name or those of an alias or business
partner.
	   About 85 of the accounts were in foreign banks, totaling dlrs
55.7 million. In Mexico, bank holdings discovered so far amount to
some dlrs 94.6 million.
	   Prosecutors haven't identified the source of Salinas' money, but
have said it is well beyond what he could have earned in his
position with a government food distribution company.
	   Last month, Swiss prosecutors ordered the seizure of another
separate dlrs 114 million dollars in Salinas' offshore accounts,
saying they are the illegal profits of protection payments made by
Mexican and Colombian drug lords.
	   Salinas' lawyers have appealed the Swiss decision, which will
send the case to Switzerland's supreme court.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A strong earthquake shook a small and
remote island in eastern Indonesia, killing at least five people,
police said Monday.
	   Dozens of houses were badly damaged and frightened residents of
Mangole Island fled their homes when the quake struck at 10:11 p.m.
(1311 GMT) Sunday.
	   The number of injuries was not immediately known and the search
for casualties was continuing on the island about 1,900 kilometers
(1,180 miles) east of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
	   ``People are now gathering in a football field. There was a lot
of panic. They are too afraid to sleep because there might be
aftershocks,'' local police Sgt. Yopi Sariwating said by telephone
from Mangole, where five people were killed when the roof of a
plywood factory collapsed.
	   Several landslides had been reported around the island of about
9,000 people and electricity had been cut, Sariwating said.
	   The U.S. Geological Survey in Washington said the quake had a
preliminary magnitude of 7.6 and was centered near or on near the
island of Taliabu in the Maluku Sea, about 230 miles (370
kilometers) south of the city of Manado on the island of Sulawesi.
	   The survey issued a tsunami warning for the Western Pacific.
	   Indonesian seismologists were not immediately available for
comment.
	   Mangole is part of the Maluku archipelago. There were no
immediate reports of damage on other neighboring islands.
	   In December 1992, a magnitude 7 earthquake caused a tsunami that
killed about 2,500 people on the nearby island of Flores.
	   In July, more than 2,000 people were killed when a tsunami hit
the northern coast of neighboring Papua New Guinea.
	   Earthquakes are common in Indonesia, which lies astride the
so-called Pacific ``Ring of Fire'' _ a line of volcanically active
areas that stretches from Central America to the west coast of
North America and across to Japan, through Southeast Asia, the
South Pacific and New Zealand.

<TEXT>
	   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) _ Five Russian policemen were shot and
killed Sunday in Dagestan by gunmen who are believed to have come
across the border from neighboring Chechnya, police said.
	   Another officer was wounded in the attack Sunday morning,
regional police spokesman Magoumed Khanov said. He said the
officers were part of a mobile force on patrol near the Chechen
border when they were ambushed.
	   The dead officers were shot in the head at point-blank range,
investigators said after examining powder burns on their faces.
Authorities said they believe at least five people took part in the
attack, and then fled over the border into Chechnya, the ITAR-Tass
news agency said.
	   One of the attackers was apparently injured, and left a trail of
blood leading away from the scene of the shooting, police said.
	   The five victims were all from the far northern city of
Murmansk, authorities said. The leader of the Murmansk government,
Anatoly Malinin, called it ``a tragedy for the whole region,''
ITAR-Tass said.
	   Dagestan, in southern Russia, has been plagued by violence
spilling over from Chechnya, which fought a bloody independence war
with Russia in 1994-96, as well as by its own conflicts among
various religious and ethnic groups battling for power.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Saddam Hussein's half-brother on Sunday
insisted he was not at odds with the Iraqi president and said media
reports suggesting he had joined the opposition were ``mere
fabrications.''
	   Barzan al-Takriti spoke with reporters on his arrival here from
Switzerland en route home. The trip ended weeks of speculation that
al-Takriti had fallen out with Saddam and was seeking political
asylum in Europe.
	   Iraqi Embassy officials said al-Takriti was expected to leave
Amman later Sunday for the 12-hour road trip across the desert to
the Iraqi capital Baghdad. Air travel to and from Iraq is
prohibited under U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
	   Al-Takriti, 46, who headed Iraq's mission to the United Nations
in Geneva for 10 years, was among 30 Iraqi ambassadors and
diplomats recalled to Baghdad over the summer.
	   There had been recurring rumors from Iraqi exiles that
al-Takriti was seeking to defect _ rumors that he denied.
	   His defection would have been a major blow to Saddam, whose
inner circle has been weakened by the defection of a number of
aides and family members in recent years.
	   In Amman, al-Takriti lashed out at the Western press, accusing
it of trying to undermine Saddam, whom he described as a ``human
being, a revolutionary and a leader of a nation.''
	   He stressed he also had ``no political differences whatsoever''
with Saddam and ridiculed suggestions that he would be executed by
the Baghdad regime once he gets back home.
	   ``These are mere fabrications,'' he said. ``I was not a refugee
or a deportee, but an ambassador for my country abroad and with a
mission to run and daily contacts maintained with Iraq.''
	   Defectors have not fared well in Iraq.
	   Saddam's sons-in-law _ Saddam Kamel al-Majid and his brother,
Lt. Gen. Hussein Kamel al-Majid _ were killed by family members in
February 1996 after they returned to Iraq from Jordan, where they
had fled in August 1995.
	   Their defections led to extensive disclosures about Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction, which the country is required to
eliminate under U.N. resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War over
the Kuwaiti occupation.
	   Al-Takriti had until the end of November to leave Geneva under
Swiss laws that allow U.N. diplomats to stay on for three months
after the end of their tenure.
	   He said he delayed his trip home because his wife, Ahlam, was
being treated in Switzerland for breast cancer. She died of the
disease earlier this month.
	   Al-Takriti was wearing a black tie in mourning for her death.
	   He was especially angered by reports in Arab newspapers
suggesting he would defect with billions of dollars from Saddam's
private funds abroad.
	   ``Saddam Hussein is not a banker,'' he told reporters. ``To say
that I have a financial dispute with the ruling family in Iraq is
nonsense because our brothers there are not businessmen running a
firm.''

AEK trounces Aris 6-0, takes lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Demis Nikolaidis scored three second-half
goals and AEK Athens routed Aris Salonica 6-0 Sunday to move atop
the Greek first-division league standings.
	   AEK improved to 8-2-1 and 26 points, one ahead both crosstown
Panathinaikos and Olympiakos Piraeus.
	   Panathinaikos can return to the lead when it plays its
11th-round match against Xanthi on Monday.
	   In other games Sunday, it was: Iraklis 4, Ethnikos 0; Ionikos 3,
Apollon 0; Olympiakos 4, Kavala 1; Panionios 5, Paniliakos 2; PAOK
3, Panelefsiniakos 1; and Proodeftiki 0, OFI 1.
	   Ethnikos Asteras beat Verria 4-0 on Saturday.
	   Olympiakos was handed three extra points last week by a sports
judge for an interrupted game against PAOK in Salonica.
	   The referee had stopped the Nov. 1 game when angry PAOK
supporters entered the pitch and clashed with police after he
disallowed a goal scored by PAOK in the 82nd minute. The judge also
stripped PAOK of three points and ordered the club to play five
home-games away.
	   PAOK has appealed the ruling.
	   In Athens, Ukrainian Oleg Blochin had a successful debut as
AEK's coach, watching his team dominate Aris, which never
threatened keeper Ilias Atmatzidis.
	   AEK led after only three minutes when Aris' Panayiotis Katsiaros
scored an own goal in the third minute. It doubled its lead in the
32nd when Christos Maladenis converted his third chance off a pass
from Harris Kopitsis.
	   Nikolaidis headed in AEK's third goal in the 52nd, and Toni
Sawevski's corner kick slipped through the hands of goalkeeper
Theofanis Katergiannakis for an ``Olimpico'' five minutes later.
Nikolaidis added his final two goals in the 77th and 81st minutes,
giving him 12 on the season.
	   AEK's task was made easier over the final 29 minutes when Aris
had to play a man down due to the second yellow card and exulsion
of Manolis Mitsopoulos.
	   At Pireaus, Brazilian midfielder Luciano de Souza scored once in
each half and Olympiakos used a home crowd of 10,000 and a man
advantage for the final 60 minutes to easily dominate Kavala.
	   Alecos Alexandris scored off a deflection of an initial shot by
Andreas Niniadis in the 10th minute, and the 11-on-10 advantage
enabled Olympiakos to cruise.
	   Ifeanyi Udeze was shown his second yellow card in the 30th, and
six minutes later Luciano converted a pass from Stelios
Yiannacopoulos.
	   Olympiakos' goalkeeper Dimitris Eleftheropoulos made a dramatic
save to stop Giorgos Nassiopoulos in the 43rd, but the Kavala
striker scored nevertheless a minute later.
	   Predrag Djordjevic converted a penalty in the 62nd and Luciano
added his second on a 20-meter left-footed drive to complete the
scoring.

Woman from Grand Cayman sets freediving record in Florida
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OCALA, Florida (AP) _ A 25-year-old woman from Grand Cayman
captured the freshwater freediving record by plunging 185 feet down
a sinkhole in 2:05.
	   ``It's not much of a spectator sport,'' joked Tayna Streeter
after her record-setting dive Saturday. ``I mean, first she's gone
two minutes then she's back. Tada! What a show.''
	   Streeter only discovered her freediving ability one year ago.
Since then, she has captured the American record in the women's
saltwater free-diving by diving to 175 feet, the world women's
record in saltwater free-diving at 220 feet and the ``no limits''
dive, in which Streeter dove in a weighted sled to 370 feet.
	   Streeter's non-stop drive to set new records has left her a
little breathless.
	   ``I'm physically in really good shape but I'm a little worn out.
... I think I'll take a break and ride this wave a while,'' said
Streeter, an American born in the Caymans.
	   Streeter, social secretary to the governor of the Cayman
Islands, said she never pictured herself a world record holder.
``Not even this time last year did I imagine I would be doing
this,'' she said.
	   Streeter, who has attempted the world record three times since
March, spent the morning at Hal Watt's Forty Fathom Grotto, a
technical diving center where there is 250-feet sinkhole.

Russia asks empathy and money from IMF
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's finance minister asked Sunday for a
little empathy and a lot of cash from the International Monetary
Fund.
	   ``Money is not the main thing we need from the IMF, although we
need that too,'' Mikhail Zadornov said, according to the Interfax
news agency. ``We, above all, expect understanding from the IMF,
and a program to relieve Russia's debt _ that is, dlrs 17.5
billion.''
	   Russia has been hoping the IMF would release the next
installment of a dlrs 22.6 billion loan package that was frozen in
August after the government effectively devalued the ruble and
defaulted on its foreign debt.
	   Those actions helped plunge the country into its worst financial
crisis since Soviet times.
	   Government officials have taken various tacks in asking for the
money. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov tried exasperation on
Saturday, when he complained about the demands of ``young boys''
from the IMF, but said Russia would grudgingly give in to them.
	   The IMF has demanded that Russia adopt a budget that is
acceptable to fund officials before any more of the loan is
released.
	   Zadornov said he hoped the IMF would not only release the next
loan installment, but help Russia restructure its foreign debt _
and perhaps persuade some creditors to let Russia off the hook.
	   ``Without the consent of the IMF, creditors won't agree to
defer, or possibly partly write off, Russia's external debt,''
Zadornov said on Russian television, according to Interfax.
	   Another government financial officer, Alexander Pochinok, was
quoted as saying Sunday that the draft 1999 budget calls for
increasing military salaries more than 60 percent as of Jan. 1, and
raising other government salaries in April.
	   Most Russians have lost roughly two-thirds of the value of their
income since August, when the ruble fell sharply against
international currencies.

Lawyers' Union creates fund for Lockerbie defense

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Libyan Lawyers' Union has created a fund
to help pay for the defense of two Libyans charged in the 1988
Lockerbie bombing case, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported
Sunday.
	   Mohammed al-Ellagi, head of the union, was quoted as saying that
a number of Arab lawyers have volunteered their expertise or
pledged money to help cover the legal costs of the suspects, Abdel
Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah.
	   Al-Ellagi did not say how much money the Lawyers' Union hoped to
collect. The union is a professional organization licensed by the
Libyan government.
	   Libya has accepted in principle a joint U.S.-British offer to
try the Libyans in the Netherlands under Scottish law and with
Scottish Judges.
	   But Tripoli still is trying to get assurances about the
suspects' handling in the Netherlands. And, if convicted, it wants
the men jailed in Libya rather than Scotland.
	   The men are wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am flight over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   In September, Libya appointed a new legal team headed by Kamal
Mahjoub, a former Libyan foreign minister. The defense team had
been headed by a private attorney, Ibrahim Legwell.
	   Lawyers from Egypt have said they will participate in the
suspects' defense, and Libyan officials said attorneys also will
come from Malta, the United States and Europe.
	   Also Sunday, Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora died in the
Lockerbie bombing, said he would travel to the Netherlands soon to
see the site proposed for the trial, The British Press Association
reported.
	   The trial is to be held at Camp Zeist, a Dutch air base 32
kilometers (20 miles) southeast of Amsterdam. The camp had been
used as a U.S. Air Force base from 1954 to 1993.
	   Libya has objected to the site, saying it was not a suitable
location for the trial because of its military history.
	   Swire also said he wanted to establish contacts with the mayor
of the nearby Dutch town and determine the possibility of renting a
house for the British victims' families to use during the trial,
the Press Association said.
	   Swire, who heads the UK Families Flight 103, said he expected
the trial to start ``within weeks,'' the agency said.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Cabinet ministers called Sunday for
military strikes against Beirut's power and water supplies in
retaliation for the killing of Israeli soldiers by Islamic
guerrillas in south Lebanon.
	   Seven Israeli soldiers have been killed in the past two weeks by
the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia in the security zone that
Israel occupies in south Lebanon to protect its northern border.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a European trip to
England and Spain to deal with a growing debate in Israel over the
losses in Lebanon and calls for a unilateral Israeli withdrawal.
	   The 12-member Cabinet security committee was meeting Sunday in
Jerusalem to hear military and security chiefs report on the
Lebanon situation after Netanyahu returned from visiting soldiers
wounded in the latest fighting.
	   ``We are looking for an arrangement in which we can achieve that
objective of protecting northern Israel without our presence in
Lebanon,'' Netanyahu said Sunday. But he said Cabinet members would
discuss minimizing Israeli troop casualties, not withdrawal.
	   ``As long as we don't have a way of leaving Lebanon in an
arrangement that will guarantee the safety of northern Israel, our
main objective is to protect Israeli soldiers,'' he said.
	   Other ministers Sunday supported attacks on civilian facilities
to retaliate for the stepped-up guerrilla campaign. But there was
no widespread support for the one-sided withdrawal in the 18-member
Cabinet.
	   ``The way to make them want this is to let Beirut wake up in the
morning without water and electricity and then, believe me, they
(the Lebanese) will send forces (to restrain Hezbollah) and so will
the Syrians,'' said Avigdor Kahalani, the minister in charge of
national police.
	   The idea of a one-sided pullback has the support of Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon, a former general who was the architect of
the 1982 Lebanon invasion. He has called for a staged withdrawal
from Lebanon but added that the Lebanese government would be held
responsible for preventing Hezbollah attacks from the areas which
Israel has evacuated.
	   Army and intelligence chiefs, who met Saturday night, were
unanimous in saying withdrawal would be a dangerous gamble unless
Syria, which has 40,000 troops in Lebanon, guarantees that
Hezbollah will not attack the civilian towns in northern Israel
after the withdrawal, Israel radio said.
	   Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, the armed forces chief of staff, said
Friday that unilateral withdrawal would lead to more bloodshed, not
less, and the victims would be civilians as well as soldiers.
	   Hezbollah receives all its arms and other supplies from Iran
through Damascus airport, and Israel believes that Syrian forces in
Lebanon could stop the Hezbollah attacks if the Syrian government
wished, Kahalani said.
	   Should Lebanon fail to prevent these attacks, Sharon has argued
that the ``rules of the game'' would have to change and that Israel
could target Lebanese power stations, water pumping facilities,
bridges and roads.
	   However, there was concern in the armed forces that Israeli
airstrikes against power stations and other facilities would lead
to an escalation of the conflict.
	   Israeli warplanes have attacked suspected Hezbollah bases in the
south almost daily since Nov. 8. There have been no reports of
casualties from the raids.
	   Israeli warplanes struck suspected guerrilla bases Saturday and
Sunday in southern Lebanon to avenge attacks on Israeli outposts,
Lebanese security officials said.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties.
	   On Sunday, about 80 protesters demonstrated outside the Cabinet
meeting, holding signs which read ``No more casualties,'' and ``Get
out of Lebanon.''
	   ``Our children are in the army, we are very worried about them.
We want them home. My son is on the way to Lebanon and I don't want
him to go'' said Hanna Nachtuni, a member of the Four Mothers group
of parents of Israeli soldiers serving in the buffer zone.

Writer with links to Muslim Brotherhood freed from jail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Egyptian writer who was jailed for
belonging to the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood was released Sunday
after completing his three-year sentence, security officials said.
	   Representatives from the Egyptian Journalists' Syndicate
accompanied reporter Mohsen Radi from the Torah Prison, just
outside Cairo, to his home, the officials said. They spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   The syndicate's chairman, Makram Mohammed Ahmed, had been
assured by Interior Minister Habib el-Adly that Radi would not be
arrested again after his release.
	   Egyptian security officials often keep Muslim militants in
custody indefinitely by rearresting them after they complete their
prison terms.
	   Radi, who wrote on a free-lance basis for the Islamic-oriented
Al-Shaab newspaper, was charged in 1995 with belonging to the
Brotherhood, which is an outlawed group.
	   The government had long tolerated the Brotherhood, but began
cracking down after accusing the group several years ago of
supporting Muslim extremists who were trying to bring down the
government by force.
	   The Brotherhood, which was founded in 1928 and boasts thousands
of supporters, has said it wants to create an Islamic state through
peaceful means.

Report: International TV crew trapped on arctic island
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to CORRECT direction to west sted east &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An international television crew that was shooting
a documentary film about polar bears has become stuck on a remote
arctic island and is quickly running out of food, a news agency
said Sunday.
	   The crew, whose members are from Russia, Japan and Australia,
has been holed up in a cabin on Wrangel Island, off Russia's far
northeast coast and about 550 kilometers (350 miles) west of
Alaska, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The crew arrived on the island on Sept. 2 and had intended to
leave on Oct. 15, but was delayed by bad weather, the news agency
said. The weather has also kept Russia's Emergency Situations
Ministry from being able to carry out a helicopter rescue.
	   The crew is said to have only a two-day supply of buckwheat
left, ITAR-Tass said. Residents of a village about 130 kilometers
(80 miles) from the hut have been trying to drive a snow tractor to
the film crew with emergency supplies, but have made very slow
progress because of the weather.
	   The temperature has been hovering around minus 30 Celsius (minus
22 Fahrenheit), with a strong wind. The crew has a diesel
generator, a computer, a cellular phone and has access to e-mail,
but is running out of fuel, the report said.
	   ITAR-Tass identified the Japanese crewmember as Tatsuhiko
Kobayashi, an employee of NHK, the Japanese television company. It
did not identify the others.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Cabinet ministers called Sunday for
military strikes against Beirut's power and water supplies in
retaliation for the killing of Israeli soldiers by Islamic
guerrillas in south Lebanon.
	   The Cabinet took no decision however to change Israel's 13-year
presence in south Lebanon.
	   Seven Israeli soldiers have been killed in the past two weeks by
the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia in the security zone which
Israel occupies in south Lebanon to protect its northern border.
	   The latest deaths fueled public calls for a reassessment of
policy towards Lebanon. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short
a European trip to England and Spain to deal with a growing debate
in Israel over the losses in Lebanon and calls for a unilateral
Israeli withdrawal.
	   The 12-member Cabinet security committee met in Jerusalem for
four hours Sunday to hear military and security chiefs report on
the Lebanon situation after Netanyahu returned from visiting
soldiers wounded in the latest fighting.
	   Military officials told ministers they did not recommend a
one-sided withdrawal from south Lebanon without some kind of
negotiated arrangement with the Lebanese government, Israel's
Channel 2 TV reported.
	   The Cabinet took no decisions regarding Israel's presence in
south Lebanon but agreed to tour the area to better understand the
security situation, Channel 2 said.
	   Before the meeting, Netanyahu said Cabinet members would discuss
minimizing Israeli troop casualties, not withdrawal.
	   ``We are looking for an arrangement in which we can achieve that
objective of protecting northern Israel without our presence in
Lebanon,'' Netanyahu said before the meeting.
	   ``As long as we don't have a way of leaving Lebanon in an
arrangement that will guarantee the safety of northern Israel, our
main objective is to protect Israeli soldiers,'' he said.
	   With heavy losses, a growing number of the Israeli public and
officials support a unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon. But those
opposed, including Netanyahu, argue that such a move would lead to
more bloodshed, not less, and the victims would be civilians as
well as soldiers.
	   Meanwhile, fighting between Israeli troops and Hezbollah
guerrillas continued in south Lebanon Sunday.
	   Israeli warplanes struck suspected guerrilla bases after attacks
earlier in the day on Israeli outposts, an Israeli army spokesman
said.
	   Army and intelligence chiefs, who met Saturday night, were
unanimous in saying withdrawal would be a dangerous gamble unless
Syria, which has 40,000 troops in Lebanon, guarantees that
Hezbollah would not attack towns in northern Israel.
	   The idea of a one-sided pullback has the support of Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon, a former general who was the architect of
the 1982 Lebanon invasion. He has called for a staged withdrawal
from Lebanon but added that the Lebanese government would be held
responsible for preventing Hezbollah attacks from the areas which
Israel has evacuated.
	   Should Lebanon fail to prevent these attacks, Sharon has argued
that the ``rules of the game'' would have to change and that Israel
could target Lebanese power stations, water pumping facilities,
bridges and roads.
	   In Beirut, Hezbollah responded with a warning that any attack on
Lebanon's utilities would draw a painful retaliation.
	   ``The resistance (Hezbollah) is ready more than at any time
before to carry out strikes similar to those that may be launched
by the Israeli enemy against the infrastructure in Lebanon,''
Mohammed Fneish, a Hezbollah representative in Parliament, told the
guerrilla group's Al-Manar television.
	   The escalating rhetoric drew a call for restraint from the
United States in the form of letters sent by U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright to the leaders of Israel, Lebanon and
Syria, Israel TV reported.
	   In Jerusalem, some 80 people opposed to Israel's presence in
south Lebanon demonstrated outside the Cabinet meeting Sunday,
holding signs which read ``No more casualties,'' and ``Get out of
Lebanon.''
	   ``Our children are in the army, we are very worried about them.
We want them home,'' said Hanna Nachtuni, a member of the Four
Mothers group of parents of Israeli soldiers serving in the buffer
zone.

Mallorca loses to Athletic Bilbao but stays atop the Spanish
</HEADLINE>
league &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A sixth minute goal from Ismael Urzaiz gave
lower-half Athletic Bilbao victory Sunday over Mallorca that
despite the defeat remained top of the Spanish league after 12
rounds.
	   Under relentless rain on a sodden pitch Urzaiz' low-level shot
went through the legs of Mallorca's star Argentine 'keeper Carlos
Roa and made him joint top scorer with seven goals this season
along with Racing Santander's Victor Sanchez.
	   Roa narrowly escaped letting in another two goals over the next
five minutes from dangerous scrambles in the mud, although he
redeemed himself with several flying saves during the remainder of
the match.
	   With both teams slipping and sliding and the ball movements
unpredictable, the play was energetic but uncoordinated until the
downpour relented after the break, and a relatively smooth
end-to-end game developed.
	   Mallorca narrowly missed equalizing when a goal from Mallorca's
Leonardo Biagini of Argentina was disallowed on a close offside
call.
	   Unchanged on 22 points, Mallorca now leads second-placed Celta
by one point and has two more than Atletico Madrid that grabbed the
No. 3 spot with a 1,0 victory over FC Barcelona in Saturday's only
match.
	   With smaller clubs snatching the limelight, the two perennial
powerhouses of Spanish soccer are on the verge of crisis. Barcelona
lies at No.5 in the table with 19 points, and Real Madrid in eighth
position with 18 points _ although with a game in hand.
	   Meanwhile, Sunday also saw No. 2 Celta kept to a 2-2 draw by
Valencia, currently at No. 6.
	   Romanian Gabi Popescu put Valencia ahead in the 21th minute but
Russia's Alexander Mostovoi equalized for Celta 10 minutes later.
	   After the break Celta took the lead when Juan Sanchez scored in
the 55th, but a goal from Adrian Ilie, another of Valencia's three
Romanians, leveled out the final scoreline with 24 minutes still to
play.
	   In other matches Sunday, Valladolid was defeated at home by
Deportivo La Coruna 1,0; Betis notched up a 1,0 home victory over
Tenerife; Villarreal beat Alaves 2,0; Zaragoza overcame Oviedo 1,0;
Racing Santander fell to visiting Real Sociedad 1,0; and
Extremadura defeated Espanyol 1,0.
 &UR; Valladolid 0, Deportivo La Coruna 1 &QC; 
	   Pedro Recende ``Pauleta'' of Portugal scored the only goal of
the match in the 5th minute, earning Deportivo La Coruna its first
away victory of the season.
	   The match took Deportivo to fourth place in the table with 20
points and left Valladolid firmly in the bottom half with 15.
 &UR; Betis 1, Tenerife 0 &QC; 
	   Nigerian international Finidi George scored the game's only goal
in the 56th minute, enough to give Betis victory and keep the team
moving up the table it was trailing just a few rounds ago.
	   Betis now lies at No. 9 with 18 points and Tenerife lies in last
place with 10.
 &UR; Villarreal 2, Alaves 0 &QC; 
	   Alberto Saavedra Brazo scored Villarreal's first goal in the
44th minute and Gerado Garcia Moreno added the second in the 66th
giving the home team victory over fellow division newcomer Alaves.
 &UR; Zaragoza 1, Oviedo 0 &QC; 
	   An early goal for Zaragoza in the 6th minute headed home by Sabo
Milosovic of Bosnia set the 1-0 scoreline that remained
unchallenged for the rest of the mid-table battle.
 &UR; Racing Santander 0, Real Sociedad 1 &QC; 
	   A 66th minute goal scored by Yugoslav Darko Kovacevic was enough
to give Real Sociedad victory and equal Racing's 16 points.
	   Real Sociedad's Juan Gomez of Argentina was shown a red card in
the final minutes of the game.
 &UR; Extremadura 1, Espanyol 0 &QC; 
	   Espanyol's Ivan Helguera suffered the dubious claim to fame of
scoring the only goal of the match in the 35th minute _ an own-goal
that won Extremadura the match and took the club off the bottom of
the table.
	   Real Madrid's 12th-round match against Salamanca has been
rescheduled for Jan. 6 because of its trip to Tokyo to play the
Brazilian team Vasco da Gama in the World Club Championship on Dec.
1.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Saddam Hussein's half-brother on Sunday
insisted he was not at odds with the Iraqi president and said media
reports suggesting he had joined the opposition were ``mere
fabrications.''
	   Barzan al-Tikriti spoke with reporters on his arrival here from
Switzerland en route home. The trip ended weeks of speculation that
al-Tikriti had fallen out with Saddam and was seeking political
asylum in Europe.
	   Iraqi Embassy officials said al-Tikriti was expected to leave
Amman later Sunday for the 12-hour road trip across the desert to
the Iraqi capital Baghdad. Air travel to and from Iraq is
prohibited under U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
	   Al-Tikriti, 46, who headed Iraq's mission to the United Nations
in Geneva for 10 years, was among 30 Iraqi ambassadors and
diplomats recalled to Baghdad over the summer.
	   There had been recurring rumors from Iraqi exiles that
al-Tikriti was seeking to defect _ rumors that he denied.
	   His defection would have been a major blow to Saddam, whose
inner circle has been weakened by the defection of a number of
aides and family members in recent years.
	   In Amman, al-Tikriti lashed out at the Western press, accusing
it of trying to undermine Saddam, whom he described as a ``human
being, a revolutionary and a leader of a nation.''
	   He stressed he also had ``no political differences whatsoever''
with Saddam and ridiculed suggestions that he would be executed by
the Baghdad regime once he gets back home.
	   ``These are mere fabrications,'' he said. ``I was not a refugee
or a deportee, but an ambassador for my country abroad and with a
mission to run and daily contacts maintained with Iraq.''
	   Defectors have not fared well in Iraq.
	   Saddam's sons-in-law _ Saddam Kamel al-Majid and his brother,
Lt. Gen. Hussein Kamel al-Majid _ were killed by family members in
February 1996 after they returned to Iraq from Jordan, where they
had fled in August 1995.
	   Their defections led to extensive disclosures about Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction, which the country is required to
eliminate under U.N. resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War over
the Kuwaiti occupation.
	   Al-Tikriti had until the end of November to leave Geneva under
Swiss laws that allow U.N. diplomats to stay on for three months
after the end of their tenure.
	   He said he delayed his trip home because his wife, Ahlam, was
being treated in Switzerland for breast cancer. She died of the
disease earlier this month.
	   Al-Tikriti was wearing a black tie in mourning for her death.
	   He was especially angered by reports in Arab newspapers
suggesting he would defect with billions of dollars from Saddam's
private funds abroad.
	   ``Saddam Hussein is not a banker,'' he told reporters. ``To say
that I have a financial dispute with the ruling family in Iraq is
nonsense because our brothers there are not businessmen running a
firm.''

Support of major party may not help candidate derail ex-coup

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Venezuela's political establishment is
closing ranks around a U.S.-educated businessman running for
president, but it may be too late to keep former coup leader Hugo
Chavez from winning.
	   Democratic Action, one of Venezuela's two major traditional
parties, dumped its candidate over the weekend and threw its
support behind independent Henrique Salas Romer, a Yale-educated
former state governor who is in second place in opinion polls for
the Dec. 6 race.
	   But many Venezuelans may see it as backroom, old-style
deal-making instead of an effort to head off what party leaders
fear is an impending dictatorship.
	   ``They have made fools of themselves'' partly because they spent
months attacking Salas, said political scientist Anibal Romero, a
former visiting professor at Harvard University.
	   He predicted the move will backfire by tainting Salas's
reputation as an independent and dispersing the party's vote.
Chavez ``will win overwhelmingly. I think it's going to be a
landslide,'' he said.
	   But others said Democratic Action's support still could push
Salas past Chavez.
	   ``Democratic Action is a powerful party,'' said political
scientist Amalio Belmonte.
	   The election is polarizing Venezuela between millions of poor
people inspired by Chavez's tough anti-corruption talk, and the
middle and upper-classes who fear he will impose a leftist
dictatorship.
	   Various polls show Chavez from 5 to 12 percentage points ahead
of Salas, though they were conducted before Democratic Action
switched candidates.
	   Chavez, 44, led a failed coup attempt in 1992 and is barred from
entering the United States.
	   Salas, 62, has tried keep his distance from the traditional
parties, which many Venezuelans blame for squandering the world's
largest oil reserves outside the Middle East.
	   He and hundreds of supporters, including former Miss Universe
Alicia Machado, trotted through the streets of Caracas on horseback
Sunday during a 20-kilometer (12-mile) campaign march.
	   The candidate repeated that he had accepted Democratic Action's
support, but made no deals to promise party members government
posts if he wins.
	   ``This is an alliance for Venezuela, against corruption and
against violence,'' Salas said Saturday night after meeting with a
group of Democratic Action governors who are supporting him.
	   Chavez says the agreement ``unmasked'' Salas Romer as a tool of
the traditional parties.
	   For the past two weeks, Venezuela's political elite has been
trying to agree upon a consensus candidate to oppose Chavez.
	   The effort failed, and Democratic Action held a raucous meeting
Friday night in which they dumped Luis Alfaro Ucero as their
candidate. The next day delegates voted to back Salas.
	   Alfaro is refusing to quit the race, though, and may remain on
the ballot as the party's official candidate. Party leaders said
Sunday they will petition the National Electoral Council this week
to remove Alfaro from the ballot.
	   Venezuelans ``are not going to elect between two democratic
alternatives, but rather they are going to choose between democracy
and dictatorship,'' party president Carlos Canache Mata told
reporters.
	   Many members of Venezuela's other major traditional party, the
social Christian COPEI, also want to dump their candidate, former
Miss Universe Irene Saez, and back Salas.
	   Saez says she won't quit, though the party is expected to make a
final decision this week.

Russia asks empathy and money from IMF
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS last 2 grafs with 3 grafs to UPDATE with more details on
1999 budget. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's finance minister asked Sunday for a
little empathy and a lot of cash from the International Monetary
Fund.
	   ``Money is not the main thing we need from the IMF, although we
need that too,'' Mikhail Zadornov said, according to the Interfax
news agency. ``We, above all, expect understanding from the IMF,
and a program to relieve Russia's debt _ that is, dlrs 17.5
billion.''
	   Russia has been hoping the IMF would release the next
installment of a dlrs 22.6 billion loan package that was frozen in
August after the government effectively devalued the ruble and
defaulted on its foreign debt.
	   Those actions helped plunge the country into its worst financial
crisis since Soviet times.
	   Government officials have taken various tacks in asking for the
money. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov tried exasperation on
Saturday, when he complained about the demands of ``young boys''
from the IMF, but said Russia would grudgingly give in to them.
	   The IMF has demanded that Russia adopt a budget that is
acceptable to fund officials before any more of the loan is
released.
	   Zadornov said he hoped the IMF would not only release the next
loan installment, but help Russia restructure its foreign debt _
and perhaps persuade some creditors to let Russia off the hook.
	   ``Without the consent of the IMF, creditors won't agree to
defer, or possibly partly write off, Russia's external debt,''
Zadornov said on Russian television, according to Interfax.
	   Another government financial officer, Alexander Pochinok, was
quoted as saying Sunday that the draft 1999 budget assumes that
Russia will receive the remaining dlrs 17.5 billion in loans from
the IMF, World Bank and Japan.
	   Pochinok also said the budget calls for a 2.75 percent deficit,
projects inflation at 30 percent for the year and assumes a
relatively stable ruble, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   He said it calls for increasing military salaries more than 60
percent as of Jan. 1, and raising other government salaries in
April. Most Russians have lost roughly two-thirds of the value of
their income since August, when the ruble fell sharply against
international currencies.

Kaiserslautern wins sixth straight to join chase of Bayern Munich
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAISERSLAUTERN, Germany (AP) _ FC Kaiserslautern blasted Schalke
4-1 Sunday to stretch its victory streak to six matches while
jumping to third in the Bundesliga.
	   Kaiserslautern, now four points back of Bayern Munich, broke
open a 1-1 match with a fierce second-half attack that produced
three goals in seven minutes.
	   Uwe Rosler scored in the 67th minute, Janos Hrutka in the 71st
and Olaf Marschall in the 74th.
	   Kaiserslautern joined second-place Bayer Leverkusen in hot
pursuit of Bayern Munich while spoiling the 45th birthday of
Schalke's Dutch coach, Huub Stevens.
	   His struggling club, UEFA Cup champions just two years ago,
tumbled into 16th place and the demotion zone.
	   Munich, despite playing well, keeps losing ground to red-hot
Kaiserslautern and Leverkusen, which has climbed to within two
points riding a wave of 12 matches without a loss.
	   Visiting Schalke's lone bright spot came when oft-injured
striker Martin Max equalized in the 34th after Marian Hristov's
ninth-minute goal.

Republican governors visit sites, Israeli officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A delegation of U.S. Republican governors
wrapped up a day of sightseeing and visits with Israeli officials
Sunday on a trip organized by a conservative Jewish organization.
	   Governors Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts, Marc Racicot of
Montana, Michael Leavitt of Utah and George W. Bush of Texas are on
the trip, organized by the National Jewish Coalition.
	   In interviews with The Associated Press, Cellucci and Racicot
see the trip as an opportunity to learn more about the Middle East
peace process and bolster ties with the Jewish state.
	   ``We consider Israel a very valued trading partner and I think
it's important for me to know more about the political situation
here and in the region,'' said Celluci.
	   The Massachusetts governor will also devote time to winning part
of a $2.5 billion defense contract for U.S. made F-16 or F-15
fighter jets. A Massachusetts company, Raytheon, of Lexington,
makes an advanced radar system that could be purchased for either
plane.
	   Cellucci noted that Massachusetts was the first state to open a
trade office in Israel. He had visited Israel previously on a 1993
trade mission. He said that foreign aid to Israel and participation
in the peace negotiations with Palestinians is worthwhile for the
United States.
	   ``I believe that foreign aid that helps a country like Israel
which is a major ally, a major trading partner, is absolutely worth
the investment,'' Cellucci said. ``I would think that the United
States, because of the technology we have and the strength of our
economy would be a major beneficiary of a strong stable regional
economy here in the Middle East.''
	   Racicot said he wanted to learn more about the region and to
promote opportunities for exchange between Israel and Montana.
	   ``We have a lot of interest in each others economies. We have
some agricultural trade issues and environmental issues that are
developing technologies to invest in both areas,'' Racicot said.
``There's constant searching out and probing by the states for new
opportunities.''
	   Sunday's scheduled events included meetings with Israeli
President Ezer Weizman and Yuli Edelstein, minister of immigration
and absorption as well as a visit to Jerusalem's walled Old City
and the ancient desert site of Masada. Also scheduled are visits to
Israel's Holocaust memorial, Jewish settlements in the West Bank,
the Golan Heights and meetings with other Israeli officials. It was
not clear whether the governors would meet with Palestinian
officials during their stay.
	   Organizers of the trip have shunned media coverage of the events
and have kept the governors' itinerary under wraps. Several events
including an appearance at Brigham Young University's Jerusalem
campus Sunday, will not be public.
	   At the meeting with Weizman, Bush said he was visiting Israel to
``listen and learn.''
	   ``I am not here for any political purpose,'' Bush told
reporters. ``I'm here to learn more, not only about Israel, but
about the history of my religion.''
	   Bush who was visiting Israel with his wife Laura, said he was on
a private trip. He will reimburse the NJC for his travel expenses,
his office said.
	   The trip is ``an opportunity to give them an introduction to the
issues and the complexities of the region.'' Matt Brooks, executive
director of NJC, told The Jerusalem Post newspaper.
	   Brooks declined to give more detailed comment on the the trip,
saying he didn't want to bring on a barrage of media attention and
that the governors needed time to contemplate and formulate their
opinions
	   ``You can't do that when they've literally just gotten in the
country for a couple hours and everyone wants to interview them
about their thoughts. So we're going to hold off until after the
trip. then I'll be happy to talk to you all,'' Brooks said.
	   The National Jewish Coalition is a Washington, D.C.-based
organization of Jewish Republicans involved in lobbying and
educational activities. Among its goals are a unified Jerusalem
under Israeli control and maintaining at least current levels of
U.S. aid to Israel.

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Saddam Hussein's half-brother on Sunday
insisted he was not at odds with the Iraqi president and said media
reports suggesting he had joined the opposition were ``mere
fabrications.''
	   Barzan al-Tikriti spoke with reporters on his arrival in Amman
from Switzerland en route home. The trip ended weeks of speculation
that al-Tikriti had fallen out with Saddam and was seeking
political asylum in Europe.
	   Iraqi Embassy officials said al-Tikriti was expected to leave
Amman later Sunday for the 12-hour road trip across the desert to
the Iraqi capital Baghdad. Air travel to and from Iraq is
prohibited under U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
	   Al-Tikriti, 46, who headed Iraq's mission to the United Nations
in Geneva for 10 years, was among 30 Iraqi ambassadors and
diplomats recalled to Baghdad over the summer.
	   There had been recurring rumors from Iraqi exiles that
al-Tikriti was seeking to defect _ rumors that he denied.
	   His defection would have been a major blow to Saddam, whose
inner circle has been weakened by the defection of a number of
aides and family members in recent years.
	   In Amman, al-Tikriti lashed out at the Western press, accusing
it of trying to undermine Saddam, whom he described as a ``human
being, a revolutionary and a leader of a nation.''
	   He stressed he also had ``no political differences whatsoever''
with Saddam and ridiculed suggestions that he would be executed by
the Baghdad regime once he gets back home.
	   ``These are mere fabrications,'' he said. ``I was not a refugee
or a deportee, but an ambassador for my country abroad and with a
mission to run and daily contacts maintained with Iraq.''
	   Defectors have not fared well in Iraq.
	   Saddam's sons-in-law _ Saddam Kamel al-Majid and his brother,
Lt. Gen. Hussein Kamel al-Majid _ were killed by family members in
February 1996 after they returned to Iraq from Jordan, where they
had fled in August 1995.
	   Their defections led to extensive disclosures about Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction, which the country is required to
eliminate under U.N. resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War over
the Kuwaiti occupation.
	   Al-Tikriti had until the end of November to leave Geneva under
Swiss laws that allow U.N. diplomats to stay on for three months
after the end of their tenure.
	   He said he delayed his trip home because his wife, Ahlam, was
being treated in Switzerland for breast cancer. She died of the
disease earlier this month.
	   Al-Tikriti was wearing a black tie in mourning for her death.
	   He was especially angered by reports in Arab newspapers
suggesting he would defect with billions of dollars from Saddam's
private funds abroad.
	   ``Saddam Hussein is not a banker,'' he told reporters. ``To say
that I have a financial dispute with the ruling family in Iraq is
nonsense because our brothers there are not businessmen running a
firm.''

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ The first trophy of the Scottish soccer
season _ the League Cup _ went Sunday to Rangers with new coach
Dick Advocaat getting much of the credit.
	   Rangers defeated St. Johnstone 2-1 at Celtic Park with Jorg
Albertz getting the winner after Stephane Guivarc'h scored early
for Rangers with Nick Dasovic getting St. Johnstone's goal.
	   Rangers last season failed to win a trophy for the first time in
recent memory and were also dethroned by Celtic as league champions
after nine straight titles.
	   Dutchman Advocaat arrived from PSV Eindhoven over the summer and
has spent 31 million pounds (dlrs 51 million) on player transfers.
	   In addition to leading the Scottish Premier League, Rangers are
also bidding to reach the quarterfinals of Europe's UEFA Cup after
a third-round, first-leg 1-1 draw last week against Italy's Parma.

million eligible voters in five northern provinces have officially
registered, officials said Sunday.
	   The estimate came from Johann Kriegler, chairman of the
Independent Electoral Commission, after three days of registration.
	   Kriegler said that about 1.25 million names had reached the IEC
headquarters via computer by Sunday afternoon, but he expected at
least 3 million names to be tallied by Thursday.
	   ``It was not a bad result. These figures are a cause for
satisfaction,'' said Kriegler.
	   South Africa's first attempt to create a national voters' roll
has been plagued by lack of staff, confusion over where voters
should register, and closure of some of the announced stations.
	   Even President Nelson Mandela and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki,
who is likely to succeed Mandela in next year's elections, were
given the wrong polling stations for their registration.
	   Mbeki returned Sunday from a conference in Paris and registered
in Pretoria.
	   The pace picked up through the weekend, after disappointment
over the small number _ 235,000 people _ who registered by late
Friday, when only 80 percent of the registration stations had
opened.
	   By Sunday, all but 129 of 6,147 registration stations had
opened.
	   ``This is the spirit we need to strengthen our democracy,'' the
IEC said.
	   A statement thanked the people of South Africa for their
patience and for giving the IEC ``the opportunity to cut its
teeth'' over the weekend.
	   The original plan to register the entire electorate of 24
million voters at one time was scrapped due to logistical problems.
Soldiers and civil servants will continue to help registering the
remaining 12 million voters in four provinces next Thursday to
Saturday.

Serbian government lashes out at U.S. plan for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top Serbian official reiterated
Sunday the country's rejection of a U.S.-drafted plan for Kosovo as
``short-sighted and perfidious,'' leading to full secession of the
troubled province that Serbia vows to keep.
	   Milovan Bojic, Serbian vice premier blasted the proposed
solution for Kosovo, drafted by U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, which
envisages loosening Kosovo's ties with Serbia's central authorities
while keeping it formally within its borders.
	   ``Hill's plan is an indirect way to full secession of Kosovo
from Serbia,'' he said. ``Putting out the fire cannot be done by
chopping up (Serbia),'' Bojic said in an interview with state-run
Serbian TV Sunday.
	   Ethnic Albanians form a 90-percent majority in Kosovo and seek
independence, but have indicated they might temporarily settle for
less - broad self-rule within the Yugoslav federation, consisting
of Serbia and Montenegro.
	   Bojic said the Serbs' counter-proposal, granting a smaller
degree of autonomy for Kosovo is the only solution. Under that
plan, Kosovo would have its own institutions, including a
parliament with a balance of representatives of ethnic communities,
an Ombudsman to protect human rights, but largely remain under the
state control.
	   The Albanians have rejected the Serb proposal.
	   ``The biggest problem on the path (to implement the Serb plan)
could be the insistence by the West and the United States to accept
Hill's plan which is short-sighted and perfidious,'' Bojic said.
	   Hundreds have died and estimated 300,000 people fled their homes
when the long-standing crisis in Kosovo turned this year into an
open war between ethnic Albanian separatists and government forces.

Israeli Cabinet ministers call for reprisals against Lebanon

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Cabinet ministers on Sunday called for
military strikes on Beirut's power and water supplies in
retaliation for the killings of Israeli soldiers by Islamic
guerrillas in south Lebanon.
	   The Cabinet, however, made no decisions over changing Israel's
13-year presence in south Lebanon.
	   Seven Israeli soldiers have been killed in the past two weeks by
the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia in an Israeli-controlled zone
of southern Lebanon.
	   The deaths prompted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to cut
short a European trip to England and Spain to deal with the growing
debate over Israel's policy in Lebanon and increasing calls for a
unilateral Israeli withdrawal.
	   The 12-member Cabinet security committee met in Jerusalem for
four hours Sunday to hear military and security chiefs report on
the Lebanon situation after Netanyahu returned from visiting
soldiers wounded in the latest fighting.
	   Military officials recommended against a one-sided withdrawal
from south Lebanon without some kind of negotiated arrangement with
the Lebanese government, Israel's Channel 2 TV reported.
	   The Cabinet made no decisions but agreed to tour southern Israel
to better understand the security situation, Channel 2 said.
	   Netanyahu said Cabinet members would discuss minimizing Israeli
troop casualties, not withdrawal.
	   ``We are looking for an arrangement in which we can achieve that
objective of protecting northern Israel without our presence in
Lebanon,'' Netanyahu said before the meeting.
	   ``As long as we don't have a way of leaving Lebanon in an
arrangement that will guarantee the safety of northern Israel, our
main objective is to protect Israeli soldiers,'' he said.
	   With heavy losses, a growing number of the Israeli public and
officials support a unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon. But those
opposed, including Netanyahu, argue that such a move would lead to
more bloodshed among civilians and soldiers.
	   Meanwhile, fighting between Israeli troops and Hezbollah
guerrillas continued in south Lebanon Sunday.
	   Israeli warplanes struck suspected guerrilla bases after attacks
earlier in the day on Israeli outposts, an Israeli army spokesman
said.
	   Army and intelligence chiefs, who met Saturday night, were
unanimous in saying withdrawal would be a dangerous gamble unless
Syria, which has 40,000 troops in Lebanon, guarantees that
Hezbollah would not attack towns in northern Israel.
	   The idea of a one-sided pullback has the support of Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon, a former general who was the architect of
the 1982 Lebanon invasion. He has called for a staged withdrawal
from Lebanon but added that the Lebanese government would be held
responsible for preventing Hezbollah attacks from the areas which
Israel has evacuated.
	   Should Lebanon fail to prevent these attacks, Sharon has argued
that the ``rules of the game'' would have to change and that Israel
could target Lebanese power stations, water pumping facilities,
bridges and roads.
	   In Beirut, Hezbollah responded with a warning that any attack on
Lebanon's utilities would draw a painful retaliation.
	   ``The resistance (Hezbollah) is ready more than at any time
before to carry out strikes similar to those that may be launched
by the Israeli enemy against the infrastructure in Lebanon,''
Mohammed Fneish, a Hezbollah representative in Parliament, told the
guerrilla group's Al-Manar television.
	   The escalating rhetoric drew a call for restraint from U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to the leaders of Israel,
Lebanon and Syria, Israel TV reported.
	   In Jerusalem, some 80 people opposed to Israel's presence in
south Lebanon demonstrated outside the Cabinet meeting Sunday,
holding signs which read ``No more casualties,'' and ``Get out of
Lebanon.''

No challengers for Schmitt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LILLEHAMMER, Norway (AP) _ Martin Schmitt of Germany has no
challengers as the best ski jumper in the world. In the second
competition for the season Sunday, he won his second World Cup
victory with 239.9 points, 16.4 points ahead of Finland's Janne
Ahonen.
	   Schmitt jumped 122.5 and 123 meters in the K120 hill. No one
else was in Schmitt's class. Ahonen's two 117.5-meter jumps were
shorter, and his style points did not make up the loss.
	   Schmitt set a new hill record in Lysgardsbakken with 136 meters
Saturday, but the referees decided on slower speed in Sunday's
competition.
	   Japan's Kasuyoshi Funaki had the second longest jump with 118.5
meters in the final legs. Funaki is known for his classical
jumping, and one referee gave 20.0 in style points, while the rest
gave 19.5.
	   Still, Funaki had to settle for third, finishing with 218.8
points after a first leg 109.5 meter jump.
	   Norway's Kristian Brenden surprised the best jumpers in the
first leg with a 118-meter jump, but placed fourth with 202.9
points after a final 107.7 meter jump.

Separatists optimistic as campaigning ends for Quebec election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Showing confidence on the last day of
campaigning, Quebec's pro-independence premier toured opposition
districts Sunday in hopes his party can increase its majority and
build momentum for a new referendum on seceding from Canada.
	   Lucien Bouchard, favored to return to power in Monday's
provincial election, urged supporters of his Parti Quebecois to
work for a high turnout of separatist voters.
	   He closed the 33-day campaign with a swing through six districts
around Montreal, five of them won narrowly by the anti-separatist
Quebec Liberal Party in the last election in 1994.
	   Liberal leader Jean Charest, who wants Quebec to abandon the
threat of secession, insisted he still had a chance of victory. But
he has spent the campaign's final days trying to shore up support
in Liberal districts rather than venturing into separatist areas.
	   In 1994, the popular vote was split almost evenly between the
two parties, yet the Parti Quebecois won 77 of the legislature's
125 seats because its support was spread more evenly across the
mostly French-speaking province. Pollsters say the separatists
could do as well this time, perhaps topping the record 80 seats
they won in 1981.
	   A decisive separatist victory on Monday could accelerate the
push for a referendum on secession, while a narrow win might prompt
a more cautious approach. A surprise loss to Charest would derail
the separatist cause for years.
	   Twice before, separatists have been defeated in secession
referendums, by a big margin in 1980 and narrowly in 1995.
	   Bouchard, not wanting a third defeat, says he would call for
another referendum only when convinced the separatists would win.
In the meantime, he says he would press for more autonomy for all
10 provinces, particularly in regard to control over social
programs.
	   He expressed hope that the widespread anti-separatist animosity
in the rest of Canada would subside after the election, even if his
party won.
	   ``If I was the person who is described in English Canada I would
be the first to detest myself _ a dangerous man, negative,
ungrateful,'' he said.
	   ``Afterwards, things should become more normal, and we will be
able to resume a healthier dialogue.''
	   Charest said voters should not trust Bouchard's promises to
cooperate with other provinces.
	   ``If someone chooses to vote for the Parti Quebecois they're
giving a mandate to the government of Quebec to enter into a new
period of confrontation and conflict with the rest of the
country,'' he said.
	   The latest round of polls by three Quebec polling firms show
support for the Parti Quebecois at about 47 percent and the
Liberals at about 41 percent, with most other voters backing a
third party led by 28-year-old Mario Dumont.
	   The polls indicate many Quebeckers support Bouchard even though
they do not favor secession. Several polls have suggested that more
than 60 percent of voters do not want a referendum on independence
during the next government's five-year term in office.
	   ``There is a lot more fear of the Parti Quebecois in the rest of
Canada than in Quebec,'' said Gilles Therrien, head of the SOM
polling firm. ``The party has been there for a long time and has
yet to carry out independence against anyone's will. I don't think
they'll start now.''

Marseille held by PSG as Bordeaux goes top
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Marseille hit the post twice but failed to break
down stubborn defensive resistance from Paris Saint-Germain on
Sunday, as the duel between France's two greatest rivals ended
goalless.
	   Meanwhile, Bordeaux sneaked a 1-0 win against Lens to go one
point clear at the top.
	   In a stormy match, PSG got a slice of luck in the 24th minute,
when Marseille's William Gallas was first to a Laurent Blanc
header, but saw his close range shot strike the underside of the
crossbar.
	   In the 42nd minute, Marseille striker Florian Maurice, playing
against old club, hit the post with a snap shot from 10 meters
(yards).
	   At that point, the already niggly match boiled over.
	   Play was held up for several minutes as PSG coach Artur Jorge
remonstrated with the referee, and several players from each side
angrily faced up to each other.
	   A firework was also thrown on to the pitch.
	   Near the end Robert Pires slipped ball past PSG goalkeeper
Bernard Lama, but PSG defender Christian Woerns stretched
brilliantly to knock the ball behind for a corner.
	   Bordeaux won with a 59th minute goal from Johan Micoud, bringing
Lens back to earth after its fine 1-0 win at Arsenal in the
Champions League on Wednesday.
	   Micoud collected a fine pass from Ali Benarbia and lobbed
goalkeeper Guillaume Warmuz for the matchwinner.
	   Bordeaux's Nisa Saveljic was sent off in the 81st minute for a
tackle from behind on Pascal Nouma, and Lens' Daniel Moreira hit a
post late in the match, but Bordeaux held on for three vital
points.
	   In Saturday's games, third-placed Rennes lost more ground on the
top two teams when it lost 3-2 at home to Nantes, leaving it 11
points off the top

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A sixth-minute goal from Ismael Urzaiz and
rainy, muddy conditions on Sunday enabled Athletic Bilbao to upset
Mallorca, which despite the 1-0 defeat remained top of the Spanish
first division.
	   Under relentless rain on a sodden pitch, Urzaiz' low-level shot
slipped through the legs of Argentine keeper Carlos Roa for his
seventh goal and gave him a share of the league's scoring lead with
Racing Santander's Victor Sanchez.
	   With worsening mud making footing treacherous, Roa nearly
allowed two more goals over the next five minutes, but he redeemed
himself with several dramatic saves later in the match.
	   With both teams slipping and sliding and ball movement
unpredictable, play was energetic but uncoordinated until the
downpour relented after halftime.
	   Mallorca was denied the equalizer when a goal bu Leonardo
Biagini of Argentina was disallowed for an offside call.
	   The loss left Mallorca with a 6-4-2 record, 22 points and
one-point lead over Celta, which reminained in second after a 2-2
draw with Valencia.
	   Atletico was two more points back in third after a 1-0 victory
over FC Barcelona on Saturday.
	   In other matches Sunday, it was: Deportivo 1, Valladolid 0;
Betis 1, Tenerife 0; Villarreal 2, Alaves 0; Zaragoza 1, Oviedo 0;
Real Sociedad 1, Racing Santander 0; and Extremadura 1, Espanyol 0.
	   The results left perennial Spanish powers FC Barcelona in fifth,
three points off the lead, and Real Madrid in eighth with 18. Real
Madrid's scheduled match with Salamanca was moved to Jan. 6 to give
Real time to travel to Tokyo for the annual Toyota Cup against
Brazil's Vasco da Gama for the unofficial world club title.
 &UR; Celta 2, Valencia 2 &QC; 
	   At Vigo, Valencia got goals from two of its three Romanian
imports, including the last goal with 24 minutes to go, to earn the
draw with Celta.
	   Romanian Gabi Popescu put Valencia ahead in the 21st minute but
Russia's Alexander Mostovoi equalized for Celta 10 minutes later.
	   After the break Celta took the lead when Juan Sanchez scored in
the 55th, but a goal from Adrian Ilie in the 66th gave Valencia the
point.
 &UR; Deportivo La Coruna 1, Valladolid 0 &QC; 
	   At Valladolid, Pedro Recende ``Pauleta'' of Portugal scored the
only goal of the match in the fifth minute, earning Deportivo La
Coruna its first victory away from home this season.
	   The match moved Deportivo into fourth place with 20 points and
left Valladolid firmly in the bottom half with 15.
 &UR; Betis 1, Tenerife 0 &QC; 
	   At Seville, Nigerian international Finidi George scored the only
goal in the 56th minute to give Betis its third victory in its last
four matches.
	   The victory improved Betis to 5-2-5 and moved it into ninth
place, continuing its climb from last on Oct. 25, a day before it
dismissed Chilean Vicente Cantatore and replaced him with former
Spanish national team coach Javier Clemente. The loss dropped
Tenerife to 2-4-6 and last place.
 &UR; Villarreal 2, Alaves 0 &QC; 
	   At Villarreal, Alberto Saavedra Brazo scored a minute before
halftime and Gerado Garcia Moreno added the second in the 66th,
giving Villarreal the victory in the battle of first-division
newcomers.
 &UR; Zaragoza 1, Oviedo 0 &QC; 
	   At Zaragoza, Bosnian Sabo Milosevic headed in a cross from
defender Pablo Diaz Stella in the sixth minute and Zaragoza ended a
three-game losing streak at home. Zaragoza improved to 6-1-5 and
remained only three points off the league lead.
 &UR; Real Sociedad 1, Racing Santander 0 &QC; 
	   At Sociedad, Yugoslav Darko Kovacevic scored in the 66th minute
and Real Sociedad prevailed in a match played on a sodden field.
 &UR; Extremadura 1, Espanyol 0 &QC; 
	   At Almandralejo, Ivan Helguera scored the only goal _ an own
goal _ in the 35th minute to give Extremedura the victory and pull
it out of last place. The victory was only Extremadura's third, and
gave it 11 points, one more than Tenerife.

second World Cup ski jumping event in as many days Sunday, easily
beating Finland's Janne Ahonen with jumps of 122.5 and 123 meters
on the K120 hill.
	   Scmitt finished with 239.9 points, 16.4 points ahead of Ahonen,

record in Lysgardsbakken with a 136-meter lead.
	   Japan's Kasuyoshi Funaki had the third longest jump in the
second round with a 118.5-meter effort and recieved a perfect 20.0
in style points from one judge to finish third with 218.8 points.
	   Funaki's first jump went only 109.5 meters.
	   Norway's Kristian Brenden surprised the best jumpers in the
first leg with a 118-meter jump, but placed fourth with 202.9
points after a final 107.7-meter jump.

10-man Roma rallies with two late goals for 3-3 derby draw
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: TOPS with Lazio-Roma late match. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ AS Roma, playing with 10 men, scored twice in the
last 11 minutes Sunday night to rally for a 3-3 draw with Italian
Cup holder Lazio of Rome in a thrilling, fast-paced derby and
stayed in second place in Serie A.
	   Captain Francesco Totti assisted on Eusebio Di Francesco's goal
in the 79th minute and then netted the last himself in the 82nd as
Roma overcame Lazio veteran Roberto Mancini's two spectacular
volleyed goals and snapped a four-game losing streak against its
cross-city rivals.
	   The match, played before a full house of 80,000 at the capital's
Olympic Stadium, saw Roma defender Fabio Petruzzi expelled in the
65th, seven other players receive yellow cards, and three apparent
goals waved off in the closing 15 minutes.
	   There was also a questionable non-call, when Totti's curling
shot from the left flank in the 71st _ with his club down 3-1 _
forced Lazio 'keeper Luca Marchegiani to step back into his net
while holding the ball aloft. Replays appeared to show that the
ball had crossed the plane of the goalline.
	   Earlier Sunday, Bologna did all its scoring in the opening half
hour and routed free-falling Juventus of Turin 3-0 for its first
home win in 24 years over the league's two-time defending champion.
	   Michele Paramatti, veteran striker Giuseppe Signori and Davide
Fontolan found the target early for Bologna, while Juventus was
shut out for the third straight game since top striker Alessandro
Del Piero was lost for the season with a knee ligament injury.
	   But Juve did not lose much ground in the standings, because
league leader Fiorentina and AC Milan were also both victims of
poor outings.
	   Fiorentina settled for its first draw of the season, 0-0 at
Bari, while Milan was trampled 4-0 by AC Parma as Argentine striker
Hernan Crespo scored two goals to raise his tally to seven in four
games.
	   Internazionale of Milan, without injured Brazilian star Ronaldo,
continued its slow crawl up the standings by rallying with two
goals in the last 15 minutes to beat lowly Salernitana 2-1.
Argentine midfielders Diego Simeone _ off an assist from Roberto
Baggio _ and Javier Zanetti saved Inter after Salernitana had taken
the lead on David Di Michele's first career goal.
	   Despite seeing its league-best attack silenced, Fiorentina held
onto first place with 22 points, but now seven clubs are bunched
within five points of the lead.
	   Parma jumped three spots up to second with 19 points, the same
total Roma has. Juventus and Milan are next with 18, while Inter
and Bologna, which boasts a nine-game unbeaten streak, are both
another point back.
	   Elsewhere Sunday, Japanese midfielder Hidetoshi Nakata tallied
twice to lead Perugia past Piacenza 2-0; Empoli _ docked two
standings points by the league's disciplinary commission this week
for allegedly trying to influence a referee earlier this season _
beat Vicenza 1-0; Udinese edged Cagliari 2-1, and Sampdoria of
Genoa and last-place Venezia drew 0-0.
	   At Rome, Marco Delvecchio gave Roma (5-4-2) the lead in the 26th
minute, left-footing a shot past the diving Marchegiani off
Cameroon defender Pierre Wome's well-placed assist.
	   Mancini tied the score just three minutes later, taking Yugoslav
defender Sinisa Mihajlovic's long pass over his outside shoulder
and connecting with the ball on the run. The forward, whose 151
career goals tie him with Baggio for the most among active players,
made it 2-1 in the 57th, flicking Mihajlovic's free kick into the
net with his right heel while cutting across the goalmouth.
	   After Petruzzi was sent off, it took Lazio (3-5-3) four minutes
to capitalize on the advantage, as Chilean striker Marcelo Salas
broke behind the Roma defense and earned a penalty kick when Wome
dragged him down. Salas connected from the spot in the 69th for his
third goal of the season, and the game's outcome seemed clear.
	   But Totti led Roma's furious comeback.
	   First came his shot that should probably have been ruled good.
Then, in the 73rd, Marchegiani stretched to slap away a dangerous
30-meter (yard) blast from the 22-year-old.
	   In the 79th, Totti centered a pass that a Lazio defender failed
to clear, allowing Di Francesco to flick the ball home with his
right foot. And with eight minutes to go, Delvecchio slid the ball
across the top of the penalty area to Totti, who saw Marchegiani
far off his line and lobbed in the tying goal.

O'Meara sets Skins record with 430,000-dollar haul
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BETH HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LA QUINTA, California (AP) _ If he could, Mark O'Meara would
never let 1998 end.
	   The U.S. Masters and British Open champion, who earned a
career-high dlrs 1.78 million on the American PGA Tour and won his
first two majors, picked up a record dlrs 430,000 with a victory in
the Skins Game on Sunday.
	   O'Meara clinched his first Skins title on the 16th hole of
regulation, knocking in a 1-meter (3-foot) birdie putt worth two
skins and dlrs 140,000. That pushed his two-day total to eight
skins and dlrs 430,000 _ bettering the dlrs 370,000 Fuzzy Zoeller
won in 1986.
	   ``This year has been a tremendous year for me,'' said O'Meara,
who will play two more events in South Africa and Australia before
year's end. ``To win the Skins Game caps off so positively
everything else that has happened to me this year.''
	   O'Meara's luck ran out when the Skins Game went to a playoff for
the fifth consecutive year. He dropped out of contention for the
largest skin (dlrs 270,000) with a bogey on the first playoff hole
at Rancho La Quinta Country Club.
	   ``I still would've liked to keep going and play for that super
skin,'' said O'Meara, who had a two-day, 18-hole total of 1-over
72.
	   Instead, he plopped down cross-legged on the ninth green and
waited as Tom Lehman, Fred Couples and Greg Norman continued a
Skins record six-hole playoff.
	   Defending champion Lehman birdied the par-4, 400-yard
(360-meter) 10th hole with a 1-meter (4-foot) putt to win two skins
and dlrs 270,000 over Couples, whose birdie attempt curved around
the cup.
	   ``It seemed like it took forever,'' Lehman said. ``I didn't
think too much about the fact there was a lot of money on the line.
I didn't want to lose the playoff.''
	   Lehman finished second with seven skins and dlrs 420,000, also
bettering Zoeller's record. Couples was third with three skins and
dlrs 150,000. Norman, playing his second event since missing seven
months because of shoulder surgery, left with nothing on both days.
	   Norman was eliminated on the third playoff hole. His second shot
on No. 9 landed in water to the right of the green. He took a drop
and hit his fourth shot within 9 meters (30 feet) of the hole, but
missed the par putt.
	   That left Lehman and Couples in a match-play duel.
	   Couples, the career Skins leader with dlrs 1.34 million and 41
skins, missed four birdie putts that would have won the playoff.
The first three putts slid by the hole, and the fourth, from 3 1-2
meters (12 feett) on No. 10, curved high around the cup.
	   ``It's a big mind game,'' Lehman said. ``Freddie had four putts
to win and couldn't get it in the hole. That kind of thing wears on
you.''
	   Lehman sank his 1-meter (4-foot) effort to tie Couples'
single-hole money record. Couples also won dlrs 270,000 in 1995 on
the fifth extra hole.
	   Lehman completed a two-day, 18-hole total of 63 on the par-71
course. He was 1-under in the playoff. He shot a 61 in winning last
year.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ After a lagging start to the
country's first voter registration drive, officials on Sunday said
they were pleased that the pace picked up over the weekend.
	   About one quarter _ or 3 million _ of 12.7 million eligible
voters in five northern provinces had registered since Friday,
officials of the Independent Electoral Commission estimated.
	   ``It was not a bad result. These figures are a cause for
satisfaction,'' said commission Chairman Johann Kriegler.
	   Another 12 million voters in four other provinces will have the
chance to register over three days starting on Thursday. Original
plans to register the whole country over one three-day period were
scrapped because of logistical problems.
	   The creation of a national voters' roll, mandated by South
Africa's post-apartheid constitution, is an important step to the
country's full transition to democracy.
	   Lack of staff, confusion over where voters should register and
failure of some registering stations to open have thrown stumbling
blocks and drawn criticism from opposition parties, including the
country's former apartheid ruling party, the National Party.
	   Even President Nelson Mandela and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki,
who is likely to succeed Mandela in next year's elections, were
first given the wrong polling stations for their registration.
	   Mbeki returned Sunday from a conference in Paris and registered
in Pretoria at the right place.
	   The pace picked up through the weekend, after disappointment
over the small number _ 235,000 people _ who registered by late
Friday, when only 80 percent of the registration stations had
opened.
	   By Sunday, all but 129 of 6,147 registration stations had
opened.
	   ``This is the spirit we need to strengthen our democracy,'' the
electoral commission said.
	   About 1.25 million names had reached commission headquarters via
computer by Sunday afternoon. The commission expected at least 3
million names to be tallied by Thursday.
	   The IEC thanked the people of South Africa for their patience
and for giving the commission ``the opportunity to cut its teeth''
over the weekend.
	   In the country's first all-race balloting in 1994 that ended
apartheid, no registration was necessary and voters could vote
anywhere as part of a strategy to defuse pre-election tension.
	   The commission pointed out that there had been no violence
during the current registration.
	   No date has been set yet for the 1999 election, the first since
the 1994 vote.
	   A second round of registration will follow in January and
February.

Serbian government lashes out at U.S. plan for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top Serbian official on Sunday
warned that a U.S. plan for bringing peace to Kosovo will lead to
full secession of the troubled province.
	   Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia, has vowed to keep
Kosovo, a southern province whose ethnic Albanian majority seeks
independence. Serbia considers the region the cradle of its
civilization.
	   The U.S. plan, drafted by envoy Christopher Hill, envisages
loosening Kosovo's ties with Serbia's central authorities while
keeping it formally within its borders.
	   ``Hill's plan is an indirect way to full secession of Kosovo
from Serbia,'' said Serbian vice premier Milovan Bojic told
state-run Serbian TV Sunday. ``Putting out the fire cannot be done
by chopping up (Serbia).'' Bojic said in an interview with
state-run Serbian TV Sunday.
	   The ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's
population, have indicated they would temporarily settle for less
than full independence, such as broad self-rule.
	   Bojic said a Serbian solution granting a smaller degree of
autonomy is the only solution. The Albanians have rejected the Serb
proposal.
	   Hundreds have died and estimated 300,000 people fled their homes
when the long-standing crisis in Kosovo turned this year into an
open war between ethnic Albanian separatists and government forces.

Hariri reportedly declines to form Cabinet, igniting crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Prime Minister Rafik Hariri has declined
an informal invitation from Lebanon's new president to form the
next government, sparking a political crisis in this country as it
rebuilds from its devastating civil war.
	   Sources close to the prime minister, whose Cabinet has been in
care-taker capacity since last Tuesday's swearing in of Emile
Lahoud as president, said Hariri turned down the invitation from
Lahoud to select a new Cabinet.
	   There has been no formal announcement from Lahoud reappointing
Hariri as prime minister.
	   Although Hariri's move could be a bargaining tactic, since he
remains the front-runner for the premiership, the apparent tension
between the two powerful men could affect Lebanon's economic
stability as it recovers from the 1975-90 civil war.
	   Hariri, 53, the architect of Lebanon's multibillion dollar
postwar reconstruction program, has been in power since 1992.
	   A billionaire businessman who made his fortune in Saudi Arabia,
Hariri is credited with restoring economic confidence and
stabilizing the national currency.
	   Lahoud, 62, commander of Lebanon's army who was propelled to
power with widespread popular backing, pledged in a tough
inauguration speech to clean up the graft-riddled administration.
	   The British-trained general made his name rebuilding the army
after it disintegrated in the civil war.
	   Previous disputes among government leaders have cost the Central
Bank hundreds of millions of dollars in its efforts to stabilize
the Lebanese pound.
	   Such political disputes in Lebanon in the past were solved only
with the intervention of Syria, the main power broker in this
country. Damascus supports both Lahoud and Hariri.
	   Lahoud had been expected to issue a presidential decree last
week asking Hariri to form the next government.
	   The decree was to be issued after the president polled members
of the 128-seat Parliament on their choice for prime minister.
	   But many legislators, who in the past gave their overwhelming
support to Hariri, did not name him and, instead, left it to the
president to select a prime minister.
	   The two leaders met Friday, but no presidential decree followed.
	   The sources close to Hariri, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the prime minister's decision to bow out came because he did
not feel Lahoud was following constitutional procedures in
selecting the premier.
	   The Hariri camp argues that the president can poll Parliament
members on their choice for prime minister but cannot accept a
mandate to name a person of his choice.
	   The dispute, in fact, appears to be the opening salvo of a
struggle on how Lebanon will be governed during Lahoud's six-year
term.
	   Toward the end of former President Elias Hrawi's nine years in
office, Hariri virtually had a free hand in running the country.

 &UR; Former leader of Caribbean Community dies &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Kurleigh King, the Caribbean
Community's secretary-general from 1978 to 1983, has died of
cancer, officials in Barbados confirmed Sunday. He was 65.
	   His death Friday night came only hours before that of William
Demas, the trade group's first secretary-general, in a Trinidadian
hospital.
	   King's death in Iowa, where he had been living, was confirmed by
Winston Cox, governor of the Barbados Central Bank. King directed
the bank between 1987 and 1992.
	   Both King and Demas are credited with helping English-speaking
Caribbean countries survive recessions and establish stable
economies following independence from Britain.
	   A former director of finance and planning for the Barbadian
government, King helped build the country's economy into one of the
strongest in the Caribbean as general manager of the Barbados
Industrial Development Corp.
	   He was assistant dean of the graduate school of business at
Columbia University in New York City from 1967 to 1968.
	   King opposed devaluation of the Barbadian dollar during the
early 1990s, a position that many analysts said helped that country
survive a global recession.
	   ``The way he led the bank during the difficult years the economy
went through was a true reflection of his character and one which
gained him a lot of respect in and outside the bank,'' said Calvin
Springer, King's successor as bank president, told the Barbados
Advocate.
	   In 1983, Queen Elizabeth II and the Barbadian government awarded
King the Gold Crown of Merit of Barbados for his contribution to
Caribbean cooperation.
	   He is survived by his wife, Bernice King, and a daughter, Marcia
Muttoo.

Central bank study shows pullback from Asia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland _ The financial turbulence in Asia prompted
banks to withdraw dlrs 52 billion in funds from the region in the
first six months of the year, according to a international central
bankers' report.
	   Despite unease about the situation in Russia, commercial banks
continued to pump more money into the country until June, but then
backed off, said the Bank for International Settlements.
	   The survey published Sunday said commercial banks had far more
total assets at risk in Asia and Latin America than in Russia.
	   ``When allowance is made for the high proportion of officially
guaranteed claims on Russia, the total amount at risk for creditor
banks in the region pales in comparison with that in Asia and Latin
America,'' the BIS said in its consolidated international banking
statistics for the end of June 1998.
	   The Basel-based BIS is regarded as the central banker for
central banks.
	   Cross-border claims in Asian countries totalled dlrs 234.8
billion at the end of June, down from dlrs 378.7 billion at the end
of 1997.
	   ``Financial turbulence in the first half of 1998 was associated
with a massive withdrawal of international banking funds from
emerging countries in Asia,'' it said.
	   ``The retreat encompassed all major Asian borrowing countries
and brought the outstanding claims of BIS reporting banks on Korea
and Thailand back to their 1994-95 levels,'' the report said.
	   Commercial banks lent dlrs 15.6 billion in new money to Latin
America in the first three months _ dlrs 9.6 billion of it going to
Brazil. But then this this dried up as jitters about the Asian
crisis spread to other parts of the world.
	   The BIS reiterated its concerns about the lack of global
financial checks. It spoke of the ``herd'' phenonemon whereby banks
and other financial market players increasingly followed each
other.
	   European banks were increasingly important sources of credit, it
said. Germany banks, for instance, accounted for 17 percent of
international loans, challenging the traditional dominance of
Japanese banks with a 19 percent share.

 &UR; Caribbean Community's first leader dies &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ William Demas, the Caribbean
Community's first secretary-general, has died of renal failure in a
Trinidad hospital, officials confirmed Sunday. He was 69.
	   The Caribbean Community secretariat said Demas died Saturday at
St. Clair Medical Center in Port-of-Spain, where he was being
treated for worsening diabetes.
	   His death came only hours after the death of Kurleigh King, who
led the trade group from 1978 to 1983, in Iowa on Friday night.
	   Both men helped the collection of English-speaking states
weather recessions and build stable economies following centuries
under British rule.
	   Demas, a Trinidadian economist, headed the Caribbean Free Trade
Area beginning in 1970 and was the first leader of the group's
successor, the 15-member Caribbean Community, which was formed in
1973. He left the position in 1974.
	   ``He laid the foundation for what the rest of us are trying to
build on,'' said current Secretary-General Edwin Carrington, who is
also from Trinidad and Tobago.
	   Demas helped form the Caribbean Development Bank and was a
former chief of Trinidad and Tobago's central bank. He wrote four
books on Caribbean economics, dozens of journal and newspaper
articles, and a 1965 treatise on economic integration that became a
blueprint for many Caribbean Community policies.
	   Demas presided over the July 1973 signing in Trinidad of the
Treaty of Chaguaramas that formed the Caribbean Community.
	   Anticipating his death, Carrington and several longtime staffers
from the Caribbean Community secretariat flew to Trinidad last week
to visit Demas. Diplomats around the Caribbean expressed their
condolences.
	   ``The Caribbean has lost a son,'' said Clement Rohee, Guyana's
foreign minister.

First Arrow anti-missile missile rolls off the assembly line
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The first operational Arrow anti-missile
missile rolled off the assembly line at Israel Aircraft Industries
Sunday.
	   Israel TV said the missile, part of a jointly funded Israel-U.S.
defense project, would be used for further testing. An Israeli test
of the Arrow in September was successful. Israel is now waiting for
missile batteries to arrive and the entire project is expected to
be fully operational by mid-1999.
	   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said in the roll-out ceremony
at Israel Aircraft Industries that Israel would continue to invest
in the development of the Arrow.
	   ``More than that, we will overcome the challenge before us so
that we can strike ballistic missiles far, far from Israeli
territory,'' Mordechai said.
	   The defense establishment will not sell the Arrow until all
tests are completed, the minister added.
	   Critics have said the Arrow will only be able to shoot down
missiles close to base and not in enemy skies.
	   The project got a boost after the 1991 Gulf War when American
patriot missiles failed in many cases to destroy Iraqi Scuds fired
at Israel and Saudi Arabia. Israel hopes to use the Arrow as a
defense against threats from such countries as Iran, Iraq, Syria
and Libya.
	   Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's successful test in
July of the Shahab 3 missile, which can reach Israel with it's
800-mile (1,287-kilometer) range.
	   Iran is also developing an upgraded version of the Shahab
missile with a range of 1,200 miles (1,931 kilometers), or enough
to reach Israeli soil and U.S. troops stationed in the Gulf and
Europe.

Falcons clinch playoff spot with 21-10 victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: WILL be UPDATED with later games. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Jamal Anderson ran for a career-high 188 yards
and 44-year-old Steve DeBerg threw a 29-yard touchdown pass to
Terance Mathis as Atlanta (10-2) clinched a U.S. National Football
League playoff berth earlier than ever before with a 21-10 victory
over St. Louis on Sunday.
	   DeBerg took over in the second half for Tony Graziani, who
started in place of the injured Chris Chandler.
	   His TD pass came after the Falcons, who led 3-0 at the half,
fell behind when Tony Horne of the Rams (10-2) returned the
second-half kickoff 101 yards for a score. Anderson added a 27-yard
TD run.
	   Steve Bono replaced Tony Banks at quarterback for the Rams in
the second half after Banks, playing on an injured ankle, was
benched.
	   The game drew a crowd of 47,971, lowest since the Rams moved to
St. Louis in 1995. team purchased the remaining tickets to their
final three home games to assure their streak of all sellouts would
not end, but there were nearly 17,000 no-shows as the Rams lost for
the 11th time in 12 games at the Trans World Dome.
 &UR; Ravens 38, Colts 31 &QC; 
	   At Baltimore, Jim Harbaugh hit Floyd Turner with a 22-yard TD
pass and Priest Holmes ran 36 yards for his second touchdown that
rallied the Ravens for 17 fourth-quarter points.
	   It was the first time the Colts had played im Baltimore since
Robert Irsay moved the franchise to Indianapolis in 1984 and the
victory delighted the crowd of 68,898 who waited 14 years to root
against the Colts.
	   Indianapolis (2-10) jumped out to a 17-3 first-quarter lead and
was ahead 31-21 entering the final period. After the game,
Baltimore quarterback Jim Harbaugh gave the game ball to former
Baltimore Colts great Johnny Unitas, who rooted for the Ravens from
the sideline.
 &UR; Chiefs 34, Cardinals 24 &QC; 
	   At Kansas City, Missuri, Rich Gannon's three touchdown passes
enabled Kansas City to overcome a rash of penalties and mistakes
and snap its six-game losing streak.
	   The Chiefs (5-7), who had not lost six straight in a non-strike
year since 1985, took a 31-17 lead with 10:26 left when Derrick
Alexander scored his second TD on a 15-yard pass from Gannon. But
the Cardinals (6-6), who had moved into playoff contention by
winning three of their last four games, answered with an 80-yard
drive and made it 31-24 on Mario Bates' 1-yard plunge with 6:07
remaining.
 &UR; Jaguars 34, Bengals 17 &QC; 
	   At Cincinnati, Mark Brunell rebounded from his worst game as a
pro by throwing a touchdown pass in each quarter Sunday.
	   Jacksonville improved to 9-3 for the first time in its four
years and opened a two-game lead in the AFC Central Division, which
the Jaguars have never won. The victory came one week after Brunell
threw three interceptions, two returned for touchdowns, in a 30-15
loss in Pittsburgh.
 &UR; Jets 48, Panthers 21 &QC; 
	   At East Rutherford, New Jersey, Curtis Martin and Keyshawn
Johnson ran 60 and 35 yards for touchdowns and Vinny Testaverde
completed 16 of 21 passes for 255 yards and two touchdowns.
	   It was the fifth straight victory at home for the Jets (8-4),
the first time for that in 12 years. New York also sacked Carolina
quarterback Steve Beuerlein five times, including one for a
safety.
 &UR; Buccaneers 31, Bears 17 &QC; 
	   At Chicago, Brian Hunter caught an unusual touchdown pass just
before the end of the first half to snap a 17-17 tie and help the
Buccaneers' end their three-game losing streak. It was the fourth
straight loss for Chicago.
	   On the final play of the first half, Tampa Bay quarterback Trent
Dilfer heaved the ball into the end zone and into a scrum of
players. Tampa receiver Bert Emanuel got his hands to the ball and
tipped it toward the sidelines to Hunter. Hunter had gone out of
bounds on the play, but the 45-yard TD catch was allowed because he
had returned to the field and an eligible receiver had touched the
ball before he did.

Hariri reportedly declines to form Cabinet, igniting crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Prime Minister Rafik Hariri has declined
an informal invitation from Lebanon's new president to form the
next government, sparking a political crisis in this country as it
rebuilds from its devastating civil war.
	   Sources close to the prime minister, whose Cabinet has been in
care-taker capacity since last Tuesday's swearing in of Emile
Lahoud as president, said Hariri turned down the invitation from
Lahoud to select a new Cabinet.
	   There has been no formal announcement from Lahoud reappointing
Hariri as prime minister.
	   Although Hariri's move could be a bargaining tactic, since he
remains the front-runner for the premiership, the apparent tension
between the two powerful men could affect Lebanon's economic
stability as it recovers from the 1975-90 civil war.
	   Hariri, 53, the architect of Lebanon's multibillion dollar
postwar reconstruction program, has been in power since 1992.
	   A billionaire businessman who made his fortune in Saudi Arabia,
Hariri is credited with restoring economic confidence and
stabilizing the national currency.
	   The dispute appears to be the opening salvo of a struggle on how
Lebanon will be governed during Lahoud's six-year term.
	   Toward the end of former President Elias Hrawi's nine years in
office, Hariri virtually had a free hand in running the country.
	   Lahoud, 62, a former commander of Lebanon's army, was propelled
to power with widespread popular backing. He pledged in a tough
inauguration speech to clean up the graft-riddled administration.
	   The British-trained general made his name rebuilding the army
after it disintegrated in the civil war.
	   Similar political disputes in Lebanon in the past have been
solved only with the intervention of Syria, the main power broker
in this country. Damascus supports both Lahoud and Hariri.
	   Lahoud had been expected to issue a presidential decree last
week asking Hariri to form the next government after the president
polled members of the 128-seat Parliament on their choice for prime
minister.
	   But many legislators, who in the past gave their overwhelming
support to Hariri, did not name him and, instead, left it to the
president to select a prime minister.
	   The two leaders met Friday, but no presidential decree followed.
	   The sources close to Hariri, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the prime minister's decision to bow out came because he did
not feel Lahoud was following constitutional procedures in
selecting the premier.

At least 5 killed by strong earthquake in Indonesia

 &UR; Eds: ADDS Japan lifting tsunami alert in place for two hours after
earthquake in 8th-9th grafs &QL; 
 &UR; By IRWAN FIRDAUS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A strong earthquake shook a small and
remote island in eastern Indonesia, killing at least five people,
police said Monday.
	   Dozens of houses were badly damaged and frightened residents of
Mangole Island fled their homes when the quake struck at 10:11 p.m.
(1311 GMT) Sunday.
	   The number of injuries was not immediately known and the search
for casualties was continuing on the island about 1,900 kilometers
(1,180 miles) east of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
	   ``People are now gathering in a football field. There was a lot
of panic. They are too afraid to sleep because there might be
aftershocks,'' local police Sgt. Yopi Sariwating said by telephone
from Mangole, where five people were killed when the roof of a
plywood factory collapsed.
	   Several landslides had been reported around the island of about
9,000 people and electricity had been cut, Sariwating said.
	   The U.S. Geological Survey in Washington said the quake had a
preliminary magnitude of 7.6 and was centered near or on the island
of Taliabu in the Maluku Sea, about 230 miles (370 kilometers)
south of the city of Manado on the island of Sulawesi.
	   The survey issued a tsunami warning for the Western Pacific.
	   In Japan, the Meteorological Agency issued a tsunami alert along
the nation's Pacific coast stretching about 1,800 kilometers (1,116
miles) from Okinawa Prefecture, or state, to Tokyo.
	   But no tsumani were observed in Japan and the agency lifted the
alert a little more than two hours later.
	   Indonesian seismologists were not immediately available for
comment.
	   Mangole is part of the Maluku archipelago. There were no
immediate reports of damage on other neighboring islands.
	   In December 1992, a magnitude 7 earthquake caused a tsunami that
killed about 2,500 people on the nearby island of Flores.
	   In July, more than 2,000 people were killed when a tsunami hit
the northern coast of neighboring Papua New Guinea.
	   Earthquakes are common in Indonesia, which lies astride the
so-called Pacific ``Ring of Fire'' _ a line of volcanically active
areas that stretches from Central America to the west coast of
North America and across to Japan, through Southeast Asia, the
South Pacific and New Zealand.

Meissnitzer grabs gold to complete Austrian sweep
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: ADDS details, quotes. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LAKE LOUISE, Alberta (AP) _ Alexandra Meissnitzer completed
Austria's weekend sweep, winning Sunday's super-giant slalom that
gave her country three World Cup victories in as many days.
	   Meissnitzer, who came into the race with two previous World Cup
super-G victories, completed the slick course in 1 minute, 17.32
seconds.
	   It was three-of-three for Austria, after Renate Goetschl won
both Saturday's and Friday's downhill races. Goetschl, however,
failed to finish Sunday's super-G when she missed a gate in an area
near the end of the course known as Double Trouble. Goetschl was
ahead of Meissnitzer's pace at the time. In all, 12 racers didn't
complete the race.
	   ``I'm going to Calgary and I think maybe I'll drink a beer or
two,'' said Meissnitzer, who finished third in Friday's downhill.
``This week says we're a strong team. Lake Louise wasn't always a
good slope for us.
	   ``It just keeps getting better and better here. It's good for us
and the whole team is confident.''
	   Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg, the first skier of the day, set a
target of 1:17.75, which remained best until Meissnitzer came down
ninth out of the gate. It was good enough for second, while third
place went to Hilde Gerg of Germany with 1:17.80.
	   Just like their male counterparts, Austria's women have served
notice they are the team to beat this season.
	   The Germans have been weakened by the loss of Katja Seizinger to
injury. But her absence aside, the Austrians _ with slogan Power
Team from sponsor BMW emblazoned on the back of their uniforms _
placed at least three racers in the top 10 in each of the three
races. They have half of the top 10 on Friday, three on Saturday
and four on Sunday.
	   ``It (Power Team) is from sponsor BMW and right now it's really
good we have it on,'' Meissnitzer said. ``It's perfect right now,
but last year I thought maybe I should hide it.''

Government seeking buyer for half of Guyana Airways
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT WILKINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ The Guyanese government said Sunday it
will sell a 50 percent stake in troubled Guyana Airways.
	   Advertisements seeking a buyer for the state-owned airline will
be placed in publications around the world this week, a government
statement said.
	   Guyana Airways has a monopoly on non-stop routes from Georgetown
to Miami, New York and Toronto. It also has Caribbean routes and
flies small airplanes to isolated villages deep in Guyana's South
American forests.
	   Authorities said terms of the sale would be similar to the
privatization this year of the Guyana Electricity Corp. Under that
arrangement, the private buyers would be allowed to manage the
company.
	   The airline, which leases aircraft for its North American
routes, has suffered a string of problems in the last year.
Mechanical difficulties stranded dozens of passengers for days in
Puerto Rico and Curacao, and this spring a leased Boeing 757
clipped the wing of another aircraft at the Georgetown airport.
	   In July, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration temporarily
banned one 757 from flying to the United States while it examined
the aircraft's maintenance records. It later removed the
restriction.
	   Before the recent troubles, the airline was the only
profit-making long-haul carrier in the Caribbean. In 1997 the
company lost dlrs 2 million, its first loss in four years,
prompting a reorganization in February.
	   The government recently approved dlrs 1 million in capital
improvement loans for the company.

First Arrow anti-missile missile rolls off the assembly line
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The first operational Arrow anti-ballistic
missile rolled off the assembly line at Israel Aircraft Industries
Sunday.
	   Israel TV said the missile, part of a jointly funded Israel-U.S.
defense project, would be used for further testing. An Israeli test
of the Arrow in September was successful.
	   The entire project is expected to be fully operational by
mid-1999.
	   The defense establishment will not sell the Arrow until all
tests are completed, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said at the
ceremony at Israel Aircraft Industries.
	   Critics have said the Arrow will only be able to shoot down
missiles close to base and not in enemy skies.
	   The project got a boost after the 1991 Gulf War, when American
Patriot missiles failed in many cases to destroy Iraqi Scuds fired
at Israel and Saudi Arabia. Israel hopes to use the Arrow as a
defense against threats from such countries as Iran, Iraq, Syria
and Libya.
	   Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's successful test in
July of the Shahab 3 missile, which can reach Israel with it's
800-mile (1,300-kms) range.

Grenada's foreign minister resigns, prime minister's party loses
</HEADLINE>
majority &QL; 
 &UR; By RICHARD SIMON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ Foreign Minister Raphael Fletcher
resigned Sunday, citing differences with Prime Minister Keith
Mitchell over an audit of government finances.
	   ``This is something that grows, and there comes a time when you
feel you cannot take any more. I reached that point,'' Fletcher
told a local radio station.
	   Fletcher said he would join another defector, Grace Duncan, in
the opposition Grenada United Labor Party, robbing Mitchell's New
National Party of its majority when the House of Representatives
convenes on Friday.
	   Duncan was banished from the Cabinet in 1997 over a disagreement
with Mitchell.
	   The change reverses the 9-6 majority of the New National Party
government to 8-7 in favor of the opposition.
	   It also leaves a gaping hole in the Cabinet. In addition to the
foreign ministry, Fletcher oversaw the government's legal affairs
and local government ministries, was leader of government business
in the House of Representatives and held the unofficial post of
deputy prime minister.
	   NNP leaders planned a meeting late Sunday to discuss the
changes. They would not comment Sunday afternoon.
	   Fletcher said he recently had asked Mitchell about an audit of
the Ministry of Communications and Works, which is headed by a
longtime friend of Mitchell, Gregory Bowen.
	   The audit found cost overruns and payment of ``exorbitant''
salaries and fees for work on some projects where some government
friends and supporters were hired.
	   ``When I asked the question of the prime minister, he said that
was a private matter. It cannot be a private matter when the issue
surrounds the actions of government,'' Fletcher said.
	   The defections were welcomed by members of the Grenada United
Labor Party and the Democratic Labor Party.

Manninen solidifies World Cup lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LILLEHAMMER, Norway (AP) _ Hannu Manninen of Finland landed a
134-meter jump and solidified his World Cup lead on Sunday with a
victory in a Nordic combined sprint.
	   Manninen started four seconds behind jump portion winner Bjarte
Engen Vik of Norway, who won Saturday's conventional World Cup
event, but finished the 7.5-kilometer cross-country course in 18
minutes, 50.4 seconds, 35.3 seconds ahead of his closest rival.
	   ``Today was a very good day, and I had good skies,'' Manninen
told Norwegian TV station NRK.
	   The 20-year old Finn had the fourth longest jump ever on the
Lysgardsbakken K120 hill, but had to start behind Engen Vik.
	   Manninen quickly passed Engen Vik at the start, and they
followed each other for much of the race.
	   However, Manninen's slowly pulled away and Austrian Felix
Gottwald, who started 12th after the ski jumping following a
125-meter effort, passed Engen Vik and finished second.
	   Engen Vik finished 46.6 seconds behind Manninen in third.
	   Samppa Lajunen of Finland was fourth 56.6 seconds behind, with
American Todd Lodwick fifth, 1 minute, 13.7 seconds behind
Manninen.

Feyenoord derby win lengthens league lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Julio Ricardo Cruz scored late and
Feyenoord its Rotterdam derby at Sparta 2-1 Sunday, taking a four
point-lead over Ajax atop the Dutch first division.
	   Ajax lost ground after losing giving up three-first half goals
at Vitesse Arnhem and losing 3-2.
	   Goals from Greek striker Nikos Machlas, midfielder Arco
Jochemsen and Scot Booth extended Vitesse's unbeaten home record.
	   A goal by Danny Blind and a Frank de Boer penalty made the
result look flatteringly close.
	   Ajax (9-4-3) trails Feyenoord (11-2-1) by only four points, but
the Rotteradam side has two played two fewer games.
	   Feyenoord started quickly and took the lead on Jon Dahl
Tomasson's goal in the 16th minute but Sparta equalized through
Erik Tammer.
	   Feyenoord substitute Bonaventure Kalou from the Ivory Coast
launched a brilliant solo run with two minutes to go, and Cruz
gratefully finished off the move with a tap-in.
	   Sunday's other scheduled fixture saw FC Utrecht down Willem II
Tilburg 2-0.
	   An unfit pitch after an early-morning inspection meant
Saturday's postponed NEC Nijmegen-RKC Waalwijk match still could
not be played and had to be put off a second time.

Panamaniam party votes for popular banker as presidential nominee
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PANAMA CITY (AP) _ Members of the opposition Democratic
Christian Party voted Sunday to name banker Alberto Vallarino as
their nominee for 1999 Panama's presidential election.
	   Vallarino was the only candidate in the primary vote, open to
53,700 party members. He earlier had left the rival Arnulfista
Party after being defeated in a primary race by Mireya Moscoso.
	   In the May, 2, 1999, vote, the two candidates will face Martin
Torrijos, the son of former Panamanian strongman Gen. Omar
Torrijos, who is the candidate of the ruling Democratic
Revolutionary Party.
	   Moscoso, the second-place finisher in the 1994 presidential
race, is the widow of President Arnulfo Arias, whose government was
overthrown by Gen. Torrijos in 1968.
	   President Ernesto Perez Balladares is prohibited by law from
seeking re-election. In a referendum in August, voters rejected a
constitutional amendment that would have allowed him to seek a
second consecutive five-year term.

	   Here is a summary of news from The Associated Press. Stories
carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items below have
moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A leading Israeli Cabinet minister called for a
unilateral Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon following the
recent killings of Israeli soldiers by Islamic guerrillas. Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon called for a gradual withdrawal from Lebanon,
but said Israel should strike at Beirut's power and water supplies
if any attacks on Israeli targets continue. At a meeting of his
security Cabinet on Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Israel should remain in southern Lebanon but work on ways to
minimize troop casualties there. Israel has occupied a portion of
southern Lebanon since 1985 to prevent cross-border guerrilla
raids. (ISRAEL-LEBANON)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain denied Sunday that it is negotiating a
deal to free Gen. Augusto Pinochet in return for a pledge from
Chile to strip the former dictator of immunity and make him stand
trial at home on charges of genocide and torture. However, the
tug-of-war over 83-year-old Pinochet intensified with human rights
activists dismissing as a ``cruel joke'' on victims the virtual
pledges by Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza to have
general tried. A spokesman for Home Secretary Jack Straw, who has
until Dec. 11 to decide whether to block proceedings to extradite
Pinochet to Spain, said the decision would be based on judicial,
not political grounds. (BRITAIN-PINOCHET)
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Saddam Hussein's half-brother on Sunday
insisted he was not at odds with the Iraqi president and said media
reports suggesting he had joined the opposition were ``mere
fabrications.'' Barzan al-Tikriti spoke with reporters on his
arrival in Amman from Switzerland en route home. The trip ended
weeks of speculation that al-Tikriti had fallen out with Saddam and
was seeking political asylum in Europe. Iraqi Embassy officials
said al-Tikriti was expected to travel later Sunday to Baghdad.
Al-Tikriti, 46, who headed Iraq's mission to the United Nations in
Geneva for 10 years, was among 30 Iraqi ambassadors and diplomats
recalled to Baghdad over the summer. There had been recurring
rumors from Iraqi exiles that al-Tikriti was seeking to defect _
rumors that he denied. (SWITZERLAND-SADDAM'S BROTHER)
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Showing confidence on the last day of
campaigning, Quebec's pro-independence premier toured opposition
districts Sunday in hopes his party can increase its majority and
build momentum for a new referendum on seceding from Canada. Lucien
Bouchard, favored to return to power in Monday's provincial
election, urged supporters of his Parti Quebecois to work for a
high turnout of separatist voters. He closed the 33-day campaign
with a swing through six districts around Montreal, five of them
won narrowly by the anti-separatist Quebec Liberal Party in the
last election in 1994. Liberal leader Jean Charest, who wants
Quebec to abandon the threat of secession, insisted he still had a
chance of victory. But he has spent the campaign's final days
trying to shore up support in Liberal districts rather than
venturing into separatist areas. (CANADA-QUEBEC ELECTION)
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ In a trial opening Monday at the
Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, U.N. prosecutors will seek to
convince a three-judge panel that a man who called himself the
``Serb Adolf'' is guilty of genocide. Goran Jelisic, a 30-year-old
former Bosnian Serb mechanic, confessed in October to murdering 12
Muslims and Croats in 1992, astonishing many observers by reversing
his earlier declarations of innocence. Although his guilty pleas
mean an automatic conviction for war crimes and crimes against
humanity _ and the likelihood of a maximum life sentence _ Jelisic
has denied that the killing spree constituted genocide, the court's
most serious offense. To convict Jelisic of genocide, the tribunal
judges will have to be convinced that the murders were part of a
campaign intended to wipe out an entire ethnic group in the
northern Bosnian town of Brcko. (BOSNIA-WAR CRIMES)

 &UR; Eds: Items are on Michael Jackson, classical music concerts for
babies in Portugal, Jane Horrocks of the British TV show
``Absolutely Fabulous,'' director Gus Van Sant. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Michael Jackson wants to send his 21-month-old
son, Prince, to an expensive British boarding school when he
reaches high school age, The Sunday Telegraph reported.
	   The pop singer has sent a representative to inspect Stowe and to
inquire about booking a place for the boy at the private school in
Buckinghamshire, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of
London, the newspaper said.
	   The best-known past pupil of Stowe _ which costs nearly dlrs
25,000 a year _ is Richard Branson, the flamboyant tycoon whose
Virgin company name adorns everything from record stores and
clothing to an airline.
	   The school declined to comment. But approval came from another
past pupil, Lord McAlpine, whose family made a fortune out of
construction and who is a former treasurer of Britain's
Conservative Party.
	   ``All (Stowe) old boys are individuals and it's just the place
for someone slightly eccentric, as I imagine this boy will be,''
said McAlpine.
	   British newspapers reported recently that another American pop
superstar, Madonna, is also considering sending her daughter to an
English boarding school, Cheltenham Ladies' College.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Forget about ``Mary Had a Little Lamb''
or ``Rockabye Baby'' _ it's time to get children hooked on
classics, according to one music professor who is conducting a
series of concerts for babies.
	   The audience _ age limit 6 _ sit on the floor or snuggle up in
their cots while musicians stroll around the room playing Bach,
Mozart or Debussy, the Portuguese daily Diario de Noticias reported
Sunday.
	   The concerts, running until May in Leiria, 120 kilometers (75
miles) north of the capital Lisbon, aim to both acquaint very young
children with classical music and test their reaction to it.
	   ``Music is like language, sounds have a grammar of their own.
The sooner children penetrate this world, the better they'll
understand it,'' conductor Paulo Lameiro told the newspaper.
	   Lameiro's venture _ unprecedented in Portugal _ was inspired by
U.S. professor Edwin Gordon's experiments on music psychology,
according to Diario de Noticias.
	   And there is also the talent-spotting angle.
	   ``In each thousand children, there is one with the same aptitude
as Mozart. The challenge is finding that child,'' Lameiro added.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Jane Horrocks plays a big part in ``Little
Voice.''
	   Best known for her role as Bubble, the airhead assistant in the
British TV comedy series ``Absolutely Fabulous,'' Horrocks plays an
introverted girl in ``Little Voice'' who most think is mute _ until
they hear her dead-on impersonations of famous singers like Judy
Garland and Marlene Dietrich.
	   Originally written for the stage, it's a part based on Horrocks'
long-running personal penchant for imitating legendary singers that
was written especially for her by playwright Jim Cartwright. The
theater version was a hot ticket during its 1994 London run.
	   ``Quiet, quiet people become intriguing when they're
dramatized,'' Horrocks says in the December issue of Harper's
Bazaar.
	   The film opening Friday co-stars Michael Caine as the girl's
mother's seedy boyfriend and Brenda Blethyn as the alcoholic
mother.
	   Now that she's done professional performances of the practice
that started when she was a schoolgirl, Horrocks has had enough of
it.
	   ``I feel I can put it to rest now,'' Horrocks said. ``I'm
certainly not going to do it for the rest of my life. I can think
of nothing more dreadful.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Director Gus Van Sant is tired of people saying
his new film, ``Psycho,'' is just another lame Hollywood remake.
	   ``It's an anti-remake film,'' Van Sant says in the Dec. 7 issue
of Newsweek, which hits newsstands Monday. ``Why do people take
films that are really well done and change the dialogue and change
the shots and call it the same movie? I don't have much faith in
Hollywood's ability to do remakes. There's a remake curse.''
	   Van Sant's ``Psycho'' is more tribute than remake, since he made
the thriller the same as Alfred Hitchcock's original, copying it
nearly shot for shot and using mostly the same dialogue. The only
thing different is that his is in color. It opens Friday.
	   ``I wasn't really aware that I had crossed some bounds,'' Van
Sant said. ``Why are they asking why? For me there are many, many
reasons: The biggest reason of all is that nobody's ever done it.''

<SLUG> BC-Sports-Basketball-NBA Lockout,0610 </SLUG>
<HEADLINE>
When will it end? Maybe not until January
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It's called the January Theory, and it holds
that the lockout in the American National Basketball Association
will last at least another five weeks.
	   ``It could be that they don't meet for another month,'' player
agent Steve Kauffman said Sunday. ``I've been telling my players
for the past couple of weeks that they shouldn't expect to play
until mid-January at the earliest.''
	   With negotiations stalled and the players believing the club
owners are trying to further test their resolve, it appears that
NBA commissioner David Stern is following a lockout calendar
similar to the one employed by the North American National Hockey
League during its 1994-95 lockout, which wasn't settled until Jan.
13.
	   The ice hockey lockout included a period from Dec. 6-Jan. 7 in
which no talks were held. The sides then made ``final'' offers and
``final-final'' offers before a marathon negotiating session
settled it.
	   It would take another three weeks of lockout limbo to match that
month lull. So far, the sides in the NBA dispute have gone 10 days
since their last full bargaining session, and that 9 1-2-hour
meeting was the only one the sides had in November.
	   Currently, the owners and players are at odds over whether there
will be preconditions for a resumption.
	   About 120 players participated in a conference call Saturday and
were brought up to date on the stalemate, a union spokesman said.
	   Monday will mark the second missed payday for the players, and a
new month will begin Tuesday with the outlook bleak. Millions of
dollars have been lost, the fans are upset and the long-term damage
could be worse than expected.
	   Stern and deputy commissioner Russ Granik have staunchly refused
to set a ``drop dead'' date for saving the season, although they
have alluded to mid-December being the date.
	   That vague deadline could be extended, however, if Stern backs
off his insistence upon having the deal put on paper and ratified _
a process that could take 2-3 weeks _ before the lockout would be
lifted.
	   ``If they back off that 2-3 weeks, it's a different story. Then
the January theory makes a lot of sense,'' said Kauffman, who
represents 19 players. ``And remember, we can go from a doomsday
scenario to a settlement in a matter of 2-3 days.''
	   The lockout is essentially a strike by the owners. Under
American labor law, without a contract _ or in this case a
collective bargaining agreement, owners can prohibit _ or lock out
_ players from working until a deal is reached.
	   The collective bargaining agreement (CBA) is the ground rules
which sets things like minimum salaries, pension and health
insurance benefits, roster limits and a salary cap.
	   The biggest issue in this work stoppage is the owners insistence
on maximum salary costs and the union's refusal to accept a
``hard'' salary cap.
	   The league has a limit each team can spend on salaries, but the
so-called ``Larry Bird'' exemption allows clubs to disregard the
cap to re-sign their own free agents. It virtually makes the salary
cap an invisible ceiling.
	   Stern and Granik have said four weeks would be needed from the
time a deal was reached until the season could begin, but in
reality that window could be shrunk to three weeks _ and maybe as
few as 18-20 days _ to allow for free agent signings, trades and
training camps to take place.
	   Each team would then be able to play a 46- or 48-game season,
but only if two weeks were added on to the end of the regular
season in April.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _Brazilian authorities have launched
the first ever police station in Rio solely for victims of crime
who are over the age of 60, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The station, staffed by 16 officers, is able to devote more time
to older people than regular stations, said the O Jornal do Brasil
newspaper. A second one is planned for the Copacabana beach
district.
	   Since it opened eight weeks ago, the station has handled 43
cases, mostly involving petty crime, said the daily. Most people
have been pleased with the service.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Glowing embers showered villages near the
Popocatepetl volcano Sunday as it made three moderate explosions
and launched a plume of vapor and ash 4 kms (2.5 miles) into the
air.
	   The National Center for Disaster Prevention said the early
morning explosions were followed by several tremors, each lasting
about three minutes, which could point to increasing activity by
the volcano 50 miles (80 kms) southeast of Mexico City.
	   Still, authorities said there was no immediate risk to the
300,000 people who live on the mountain's slopes.
	   Soldiers increased patrols to keep climbers and hikers at least
4 miles (7 kms) away from the crater of the volcano, whose name
means ``Smoking Mountain'' in the Aztec language.
	   The Mexico City government said it was setting up more than 100
temporary shelters capable of housing 53,000 people in the event
that evacuations are ordered, radio reports said.

U.N. genocide trial opens for confessed Bosnian Serb killer

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ He called himself the ``Serb
Adolf,'' and his crimes were as chilling as his nickname.
	   In a trial opening Monday at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal,
U.N. prosecutors were seeking to convince a three-judge panel that
Goran Jelisic is guilty of genocide, the court's most serious
offense.
	   The 30-year-old former Bosnian Serb mechanic confessed in
October to murdering 12 Muslims and Croats in 1992, astonishing
many observers by reversing his earlier declarations of innocence.
	   Although his guilty pleas mean an automatic conviction for war
crimes and crimes against humanity _ and the likelihood of a
maximum life sentence _ Jelisic has denied that the killing spree
constituted genocide.
	   By pressing on with a genocide trial, prosecutors will be able
to call evidence about the background of Jelisic's murders,
including the involvement of more senior Serbs. The trial also will
give survivors of his ruthless campaign a chance to tell their
story in court.
	   To convict Jelisic of genocide, prosecutors must prove that the
murders _ most of them carried out with close-range shots from an
automatic pistol _ were part of a campaign intended to wipe out an
entire ethnic group in the northern Bosnian town of Brcko.
	   Jelisic, who was arrested in January by U.S. troops serving in
the NATO force in Bosnia, has pleaded guilty to a total of 31
counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The charges cover
the murders as well as three beatings and the plundering of
property.
	   In entering those guilty pleas, Jelisic told the tribunal he
wanted to ``cleanse my soul.'' He will officially be convicted of
those charges during the genocide trial.
	   Jelisic's victims were killed in or near the Serb-run Luka
prison camp, a former port complex on the banks of the Sava River.
Although most victims were men, Jelisic also clubbed one female
inmate with a police baton and then fatally shot her.
	   U.N. prosecutors say Jelisic identified himself to prisoners as
the ``Serb Adolf,'' a reference to Hitler, and bragged about the
number of Muslims he had killed.
	   Set up in 1993, the U.N. court has convicted three Muslims, two
Bosnian Croats and a Bosnian Serb of war crimes including murder,
rape and torture, but it has yet to register a genocide conviction.
	   An earlier genocide trial was halted when the defendant, Bosnian
Serb Milan Kovacevic, died of a ruptured artery in his tribunal
cell.

Dollar higher against yen, Tokyo stocks mixed in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar moved higher against the yen early
Monday amid continuing pessimism over Japan's economy. Tokyo stock
prices were mixed in light trading.
	   The dollar bought 123.42 yen in early trading, up 0.56 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its New York level of 123.07
yen late Friday. The dollar's late New York level was its highest
in more than seven weeks.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 12.63
points, or 0.08 percent, to 15,082.63 points in the first 30
minutes of trading. On Friday, the Nikkei closed down 138.38
points, or 0.91 percent.
	   In currency trading, the dollar strengthened against the yen on
Friday, when the Japanese government reported the nation's
industrial output fell 1.2 percent last month, while the jobless
rate remained at a record 4.3 percent for a third consecutive
month.
	   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange moved in a narrow range
as many investors refrained from active trading to watch
proceedings in the extra session of Japan's Parliament that started
Friday.
	   Market players also are watching developments in the coalition
between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition
Liberal Party, traders said.
	   ``Both foreign and domestic investors will be watching how
government policy develops,'' said Kenji Karikomi, general manager
of the equities department at Daiwa Securities.
	   The coalition between the LDP and the Liberal Party has
generated expectations for more economic stimulus measures because
the Liberals favor a reduction in the unpopular national
consumption tax.
	   Many opposition parties say the government's raising the sales
tax rate to 5 percent from the previous 3 percent last year is
partly to blame for Japan's continued economic doldrums.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 0.10 points, insignificant in percentage
terms, to 1,158.25. On Friday, the TOPIX closed down 6.24 points,
or 0.54 percent.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond was unquoted in early trading, compared with its Friday finish
of 1.075 percent. Its price settled at 106.27 yen on Friday.

Red Wings 4, Sharks 1
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Backup goalie Norm Maracle won his fourth
straight start and Stacy Roest scored his first goal in the North
American National Hockey League as the Detroit Red Wings beat the
San Jose Sharks 4-1 Sunday.
	   Uwe Krupp, Martin Lapointe and Darren McCarty also scored for
the Red Wings, who have won five straight after losing six of their
previous eight.
	   Maracle stopped 19 shots to cap off a homestand sweep which also
included Anaheim, Vancouver and San Jose. In the four games, he
yielded only four goals. He was only 2:30 away from his first
shutout when Jeff Norton scored for the Sharks.
	   Maracle, 6-0-1 in the NHL, is perfect since replacing Chris
Osgood, who is sidelined with a hip flexor. San Jose goalie Mike
Vernon, who won the Conn Smythe Trophy for Detroit when the Red
Wings took the 1997 Stanley Cup, had 24 saves.
 &UR; Rangers 5, Predators 1
	   In New York, Petr Nedved scored for the first time since his
holdout for more than a season, pacing the host Rangers over the
Nashville Predators.
	   Nedved, in his third game with the Rangers since being traded
from Pittsburgh, scored from the right circle at 7:40, sending New
York on the way to a 3-0 first-period lead.
	   Wayne Gretzky, Adam Graves, Brian Leetch and Kevin Stevens also
scored for the Rangers. Darren Turcotte scored for Nashville.
 &UR; Hurricanes 3, Mighty Ducks 1
	   In Greensboro, North Carolina, Nolan Pratt broke a 1-1 tie with
his first NHL goal with 11:43 left as the Carolina Hurricanes won
their third straight.
	   It was the first goal by a Carolina defenseman in 12 games and
the first by Pratt in 43 games spanning three seasons.
	   Carolina's 36 shots tied a season high for the Southeast
Division-leading Hurricanes and helped hand the Mighty Ducks their
third straight loss midway through a six-game road trip.
	   Paul Kariya, tied for the NHL scoring lead with 29 points coming
into the contest, had his league-high 11-game point streak snapped.

AIDS orphans: Fast-growing population is world's unwanted
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By KARIN DAVIES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Juliette Nyaguthie dashes into a
comfortably cluttered dirt-floor shack from a game of peak-a-boo
with her cousins and nestles in her grandmother's ample lap.
	   Their beaming smiles reflect a hard-fought success in Kenya: a 2
1-2 -year-old whose mother gave her AIDS before dying of the
disease herself has been taken in by a relative.
	   Juliette is part of the world's fastest growing and most
unwanted population of orphans _ children who have lost their
parents to an AIDS epidemic ravaging sub-Saharan Africa.
	   Nearly 8 million African children have been orphaned by the
immune-stripping disease, and at least 1 million children are
infected, according to the U.N. AIDS program.
	   Traditionally, extended families in Africa have taken in
orphaned children. But AIDS has changed tradition.
	   With many more orphans _ and fewer working-age adults to support
them _ surviving relatives are overwhelmed.
	   It is difficult to persuade people to take in a child they view
as doomed. ``People think, why should I invest in someone who is
going to die anyhow,'' said Maureen Ong'ombe, spokeswoman for the
Kenya AIDS Consortium.
	   Nearly 1,000 AIDS orphans are living and dying miserably on
Nairobi's filthy streets, aid workers estimate.
	   ``They fend for themselves, and it's survival of the fittest,''
Ong'ombe said.
	   George Tembo, director of the U.N. AIDS program in Kenya, said
initially unwanted children were rounded up and placed in
orphanages. But orphanages lacked both money and emotional support
needed to care for them.
	   Each week, samaritans bring up to four AIDS-infected children to
Nyumbani Hospice, a homey residence in suburban Nairobi. But the 53
beds already are taken.
	   To cope with the overflow, Dr. Angelo D'Agostino, Nyumbani's
founder and medical director, this year launched a foster-care
program called Lea Toto, which means ``raise a child'' in Swahili.
So far, 37 families have been persuaded to take in an AIDS-infected
orphan.
	   The foster program offers huge advantages, including a family
atmosphere, more love, and, if the child is a relative, a sense of
history, said Caroline Matsalia, coordinator of Nyumbani's
community-based program.
	   Initially, Juliette's extended family balked at taking her in.
	   ``Juliette was getting sick a lot and we didn't think we'd be
able to take care of her,'' said her aunt, Njoki Jacinta, 20.
	   But workshops at Nyumbani helped relatives learn about
Juliette's care, and with counseling they overcame prejudice
against the disease, which Kenyans blame on sexual promiscuity.
	   ``At first, it was really difficult with the neighbors and even
with some members of the family. They didn't want to be around
Juliette,'' Jacinta said. ``Now they accept Juliette as just
another kid.''
	   The family's home in Nairobi's Lunga Lunga slum is a crowded
shack of corrugated iron and scrap wood with no running water and a
shared pit latrine. It's such a poor neighborhood that a broken
doll's head and a discarded piece of wire become toys.
	   To shore up precarious circumstances, Lea Toto provides Juliette
and other foster children with free medical care, extra food to
bolster their immune systems, plus 2,500 Kenyan shillings (dlrs 42)
monthly for special expenses.
	   ``I love her so much and I want her here, but I couldn't do it
without support,'' said her grandmother, Hannah Mukami, 64.
	   Mukami said she is not afraid of Juliette's death.
	   ``I've seen so many deaths that I don't fear them anymore. I'll
love her while I can,'' she said.
	   Juliette's foster family of 14 children and five adults revels
in the progress of its newest member. Juliette can count up to four
and is learning her ABCs. They indulge her frequent requests for
baths, and to eat her favorite food _ fish.
	   ``When I see abandoned kids on the streets, I feel so sorry for
them, and so much closer to Juliette,'' her aunt said. ``That could
have happened to her.''

Boca Juniors wins Argentina's Apertura soccer championship

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Boca Juniors has chalked up its
18th Argentine league title, clinching the country's
first-divisiion Apertura soccer championship with two games left in
the season.
	   Despite playing Independiente to a 0-0 tie Sunday, Boca fans in
cars and on foot filled the downtown streets of Buenos Aires to
celebrate the first club championship since 1992.
	   Thousands gathered around the Obelisk monument in the heart of
the city, screaming ``Champion! Champion!'' Other dancing and
chanting fans pored into La Boca, the city neighborhood home to the
team and its stadium.
	   Sounds of honking car horns and drum beats could be heard
throughout the city.
	   The championship capped off a magical season thus far for Boca,
who after 17 games remain undefeated with 12 wins and five draws.
	   Boca clinched the championship even before the end of Sunday's
match following a 1-1 tie between second-place Gimnasia Esgrima de
la Plata and Rosario Central. With Boca leading by nine points in
the standings, the draw gave Boca an insurmountable lead with two
games left in the season.
	   News of the tie reached Boca's La Bombonera stadium just after
the start of the second half.
	   ``Boca is a great champion,'' said President Carlos Menem, an
admitted fan of Boca's archrival, River Plate.
	   Boca has lead the league standings all season long, benefiting
from one of the weaker campaigns in recent years. Nonetheless, new
coach Carlos Bianchi has his players performing well. And he's got
Martin Palermo, the league's leading scoring.
	   Some 2,000 police officers were on hand to monitor fan behavior
but reported only a few minor incidents.

<TEXT>
	   KENEMA, Sierra Leone (AP) _ His war room is a dimly lit
warehouse where sneak attacks and tactical retreats are conceived
on a shabby couch surrounded by posters of guns and women.
	   Lounging beside a refrigerator of beer and a battered television
set, Sierra Leone's deputy minister of defense, Chief Samuel Hinga
Norman, directs an unusual war effort.
	   On one side are Hinga Norman's volunteer militiamen, the
``Kamajors.'' Armed with a motley arsenal of slingshots to rocket
launchers and clad in anything from traditional hunters garb to
female wigs and frilly skirts for supposed fearsome looks, they are
fighting with religious fervor on behalf of Sierra Leone's
cash-strapped government.
	   Their enemy is the Revolutionary United Front, a shadowy rebel
group that gained power in a bloody coup in May 1997, only to be
toppled earlier this year by a Nigerian-led military force from
West African nations. Since then, the rebels have gone on a brutal
revenge campaign, killing randomly and hacking off limbs.
	   Almost daily, new warriors are initiated by Kamajor clerics in
secret rites that combine elements of Christianity, Islam and
tribal religions. The fighting men believe the ceremonies impart a
magical ability to repel enemy bullets and become invisible in
battle.
	   The recruits, many completely untrained, are shuttled off in
battered dump trucks and Toyota sedans to a ragged battlefront in
the lush forests of eastern and northern Sierra Leone. They aren't
paid, and get by on food and small monetary contributions from
villagers.
	   Veterans revel in tales of supposed superhero-style feats. Some
carry nicknames like ``Naked Killer'' and ``Dr. Blood'' while
others have adopted more subtle names like ``Scatto'' (scatter) and
``Penny Penny,'' referring to the way they dispatch their enemies
as if picking up coins.
	   Whether real or imagined, the Kamajors' cult-life belief in
their own invincibility is their greatest weapon.
	   Many militiamen are armed with nothing more than machetes,
although some carry machine guns, rocket launchers or other
captured weapons. Many Kamajors are young boys barely old enough to
hold a gun; others are potbellied grandfathers.
	   The Kamajors have reported few casualties, and claim those who
were killed had broken their protective spells by committing acts
forbidden to the fighters such as touching a woman or eating
bananas.
	   Before the war, Joseph Lahai was a nurse in a white uniform. Now
he wears a leather tunic with red charms sewn like rubies onto a
traditional warrior's headdress.
	   He has also dropped his birth name and goes by the battlefield
moniker Dr. Blood. ``I like to play with blood,'' he said with a
smile.
	   The war is a bloody one for Sierra Leone's 4.5 million people.
The United Nations says untold thousands of unarmed civilians have
been disemboweled, maimed, raped or burned alive this year.
	   U.N. officials also estimate more than 500,000 people have fled
their homes and many villages are charred ghost towns. The capital,
Freetown, and major centers have swelled with refugees, while other
people have fled to neighboring Liberia and Guinea.
	   The vast majority of the atrocities are blamed on the rebels,
although the Kamajors are admittedly ruthless with their enemies.
They take few prisoners and cut off heads as trophies. Aid workers
say children and women kidnapped as slaves by the rebels have been
killed indiscriminately in Kamajor ambushes.
	   The militia is bearing the brunt of the war effort while the
government tries to come up with the money and trustworthy former
soldiers to assemble a regular army. The West African intervention
force now plays mainly a security role in major population centers.
	   Hinga Norman founded the Kamajors and says the force numbers
around 20,000. A Mende tribal chief and former military captain
educated in Britain, he is a charming speaker equally comfortable
discussing 16th century European military history as his own
fighting force.
	   Recently, at his headquarters tucked behind a United Nations
food distribution center in the sleepy eastern town of Kenema, a
kickboxing movie in an Asian language that no one in the room
understood prompted a discussion between the commander and his
officers.
	   Hinga Norman believed his grizzled captains _ men who wear
talisman-studded tunics and heft rusty shotguns and cutlasses while
watching television _ could learn something from the film's
karate-chopping hero.
	   ``I wanted you all to see that, because that was about the
making of a man,'' he said.
	   Few fighters admit joining the Kamajors either for the rite of
passage or cult fame among villagers in this West African country
the size of West Virginia. Many simply want revenge.
	   Eleven-year-old Mustafa Gbesay says he joined two years ago
after rebels attacked his town and butchered his mother and poked
his grandmother's eyes out in front of him.
	   Gabriel Tommy, 16, once dreamed of becoming a Roman Catholic
priest but has settled for the Kamajor fraternity, which he say
permits him to practice his religion, carry a gun and ``make
bullets turn around and go the other way.''
	   ``I like killing the wicked men,'' Gabriel added, saying he had
killed three rebels in battle.
	   Women are taboo for the Kamajors. Several of the militiamen
jumped back in alarm to keep from brushing the arm of a woman news
photographer who accompanied them on recent military maneuvers.
	   The Kamajors also maintain a strict diet that forbids many local
foods, including bananas.
	   Some soldiers wear brightly colored headdresses and their bodies
glisten from ``liquid talismans'' used for protection. Others
prefer women's wigs and colorful frocks.
	   ``My RPG is for offense and the wig for defense,'' said a
teen-age recruit explaining his RPG-7 rocket launcher and his
coiffured black plume of hair. ``If you like to, you can try to
shoot at me, but you won't hit me.''

	   TOKPOMBU, Sierra Leone (AP) _ House after house stand empty.
Ashes swirl from blackened windows of adobe huts torched by rebels
who shot anyone who moved, doused personal belongings with gasoline
and tossed a match.
	   Spent machine gun shells and rocket shrapnel litter the scorched
ground along with evidence of shattered lives _ an aluminum cooking
pot, a broken stool, a small pink sandal.
	   Flies swarm around charred, headless corpses of rebel fighters
killed by pro-government militiamen, then mutilated and burned on
the edge of town. The sickly sweet smell of decaying bodies hangs
in the air.
	   Just a few weeks ago, Tokpombu was a quiet hilltop community
where 1,500 people toiled together, eking a living growing rice and
cassava or toiling in diamond mines _ now abandoned _ about 50
kilometers (30 miles) away.
	   Then it fell victim to a 7-year-old civil war that has visited
atrocities on many villages in this lush West African country.
	   Witnesses say rebel fighters attacked Tokpombu in the heat of a
September day, when most able-bodied men were away tending the
fields.
	   Within an hour, the attackers had killed at least a dozen
civilians and caused the rest to flee. In quick fashion, they
plundered and burned most of Tokpombu's 250 or so mud-brick houses.
	   The insurgents were still looting when a unit of the Kamajor
militia stumbled across the slaughter during a routine patrol.
	   ``We drove them out and killed about 50 of them,'' said Alicious
Koroma, a Kamajor officer raised in Tokpombu, pointing to the
incinerated bodies on the edge of town. ``We do not bury the
rebels. In fact, we cut their heads off and burn their bodies.''
	   Although the Kamajors have promised protection, Tokpombu's
residents are afraid to return. The only people in town now are
several dozen Kamajors who have transformed the few intact houses
into a base.
	   Rebels remain in the area, and skirmishes erupt almost daily.
Dozens of nearby villages and towns also have been abandoned.

Report: Bin Laden operated terrorist network based in Albania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The man accused of orchestrating the U.S. Embassy
bombings in Africa operates a terrorist network out of Albania that
has infiltrated other parts of Europe, The Sunday Times reported.
	   The newspaper quoted Fatos Klosi, the head of the Albanian
intelligence service, as saying a network run by Saudi exile Osama
Bin Laden sent units to fight in the Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   Bin Laden is believed to have established an Albanian operation
in 1994 after telling the government he headed a wealthy Saudi
humanitarian agency wanting to help Albania, the newspaper
reported.
	   Klosi said he believed terrorists had already infiltrated other
parts of Europe from bases in Albania. Interpol believes more than
100,000 blank Albanian passports were stolen in riots last year,
providing ample opportunity for terrorists to acquire false papers,
the newspaper said.
	   Apparent confirmation of Bin Laden's activities came earlier
this month during the murder trial of Claude Kader, 27, a French
national who said he was a member of Bin Laden's Albanian network,
the newspaper said.
	   Kader claimed during the trial he had visited Albania to recruit
and arm fighters for Kosovo.
	   U.S. authorities believe bin Laden, a Saudi exile and militant
Muslim, masterminded the bombings of U.S. Embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania in August that killed 224 people, including 12 Americans.
	   Three alleged co-conspirators are already jailed in New York.

Hondurans call for capital city mayor's widow to replace him

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ As she watched workers pull a
bloated body from the trash-clogged Choluteca River in the heart of
this devastated capital, tears welled up in Vilma de Castellanos'
eyes.
	   ``I just ask God to make me strong,'' she said. ``That's what my
husband would want.''
	   And, it seems, what the people of Tegucigalpa want as well.
	   Residents are pushing the grieving woman to take her late
husband's post as mayor of the capital, which was crippled by
Hurricane Mitch's fury. Carlos Castellanos was killed in a
helicopter crash while surveying the damage.
	   Now, supporters want his wife to keep alive the memory of a man
affectionately known as ``the hardworking little fat guy'' _ and
possibly to carry through his dream of becoming president, which he
seemed poised to realize.
	   ``His death left us with a great emptiness,'' said Jesus Rubio,
49, who was trying to sell the sand that buried his home. ``He was
our hope for change, and since she was his companion, there is no
one better than her to carry out what he left unfinished.''
	   An overwhelming majority of capital residents apparently agree.
	   In a country not known for honest civil servants _ the previous
mayor was jailed on corruption charges _ Mr. Castellanos seemed the
exception.
	   Already the front-runner for 2001 presidential elections, the
hefty leader forged through whipping rain into high-risk areas when
Hurricane Mitch struck, knocking on doors to evacuate residents
before the Choluteca River ripped apart his city.
	   Tegucigalpa suffered its worst flooding in 200 years during the
hurricane that killed as many as 7,000 people across the country.
In northern Honduras on Sunday, more than 7,000 survivors prepared
to evacuate their homes amid fears that more rain could produce
flooding.
	   In the capital, entire neighborhoods remain buried. More than
30,000 people are homeless, about 12,500 unemployed because of the
storm. More than a third of the city's bridges are gone. More than
200 factories no longer exist.
	   The already cash-strapped city government needs at least dlrs
350 million to get Tegucigalpa up to speed.
	   The area around the central market is a sea of putrid trash.
Bodies continue to be pulled from the debris. This week,
authorities found the decapitated body of a woman in a downtown
building. Nearby, desperate people wrestled in the muck for a pile
of muddy toys they could sell.
	   ``It's a big challenge,'' Castellanos said of the mayorship. ``I
don't claim to have all the answers, but I promise to work from my
heart.''
	   After her husband's death on Nov. 1, Castellanos quickly won her
husband's National Party nomination despite her lack of any
political experience. Castellanos had worked closely with her
husband, organizing housewives for his campaign and running a
project teaching former prostitutes how to make pinatas.
	   Thousands of people who traversed the torn-up city to attend her
husband's funeral screamed for her appointment. The federal
government says it may be weeks before it makes a decision.
	   But critics contend that if officials name Castellanos, they
will be betting the recovery of Central America's most crippled
capital on a sentimental hunch without considering who would be
best for the people.
	   ``This is ridiculous sentimentalism,'' said Juan Ramon Martinez,
a columnist for the Tegucigalpa daily La Tribuna. ``Should they
have elected Jackie Kennedy to succeed John Kennedy? Dona Vilma is
a dentist by trade, which means she might be able to relieve a
painful molar, but she's not capable of running a city.''
	   Martinez contends the move also violates the city constitution,
which he says states that acting Mayor Nahum Valladares should
become mayor. Castellanos maintains that the former mayor's
political party should make the decision.
	   While the city remains in political limbo, nobody has been able
to make a long-term recovery plan.
	   In the meantime, however, residents are taking matters into
their own hands, shoveling mud and rebuilding with the help of
international volunteers. In one middle-class neighborhood, a group
of young vigilantes patrols the streets, armed to the teeth.
	   ``Shortly after the damage when we saw people dressed as
firefighters and police looting the homes, that's when we decided
to do something,'' said Napoleon Ham, 32, who had a Glock 9 pistol
and a Barretta in holsters strapped across his chest. He also held
a friend's M-16.
	   That may work for now, said Thelma Mejilla, editor of the
Tegucigalpa daily El Heraldo.
	   ``But,'' she said, ``once the foreign aid groups pack up and go
home, we're going to see a nightmare.''

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Deutsche Bank AG is expected to announce Monday
the acquisition of Bankers Trust Corp. in a dlrs 9.5 billion deal
that will create the world's largest financial institution with
assets of more than dlrs 800 billion.
	   The Frankfurt, Germany-based Deutsche Bank has offered Bankers
Trust shareholders dlrs 93 a share. The boards from both banks met
separately Sunday to vote on the offer.
	   Bill McBride, a spokesman for the New York-based Bankers Trust,
declined to comment on the specifics of the meeting. A spokesman
for Deutsche Bank could not be reached for comment.
	   A joint statement from the two banks released last week said
that, ``while the parties have satisfactorily completed'' their
respective investigations of the merger, the banks still had to
work out final legal, structural and tax matters.
	   Bankers Trust is the eighth-largest bank in the United States
with dlrs 156 billion in assets, while Deutsche Bank is Germany's
largest with dlrs 675 billion in assets. The combined bank would
surpass both current No. 1 UBS AG of Switzerland and the recently
formed Citigroup Inc.
	   The deal would also be the largest takeover of a U.S. financial
institution by a foreign bank.
	   The merger would still have to obtain approval of both New York
state and federal banking regulators.

CNN report says Iraq still trying to build illegal missiles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Despite years of claims it has ended all programs
to build weapons of mass destruction, Iraq made a bid to acquire
prohibited missile technology last May, CNN reported.
	   In its program NewsStand, produced with Time magazine, CNN said
Sunday evening that Iraqi missile experts, escorted by Iraqi secret
police, went to the Romanian capital Bucharest to negotiate the
purchase of guidance equipment for long-range missiles.
	   Iraq is required to eliminate its long-range missiles and
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons under resolutions by the
U.N. Security Council adopted after the 1991 Gulf War that ended
Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.
	   The CNN report quoted unnamed sources and Scott Ritter, an
American ex-Marine who resigned as a U.N. arms inspector in August
who complained the U.S. government was undermining the search for
Iraq's forbidden weapons.
	   Iraq has insisted since the early 1990s that it has destroyed
all its prohibited weapons. Tough U.N. trade sanctions, imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, cannot be lifted until U.N.
inspectors certify that its weaponry has been destroyed.
	   According to the program's transcript, the Iraqi purchase in
Bucharest was blocked because spy agencies from the United States,
Romania and Israel uncovered the potential deal and monitored the
Iraqis' two-week visit.
	   ``We had the goods on the Iraqis. ... We caught them
red-handed,'' Ritter told NewsStand.
	   CNN said Romania's government cooperated in the spying
operation.
	   Iraq refused to comment on the reports until after Sunday's
broadcast, CNN said.
	   NewsStand also noted the U.N. Security Council, which set up the
arms inspection program, was never officially informed of the spy
operation in Bucharest that was approved by Richard Butler, the
chief U.N. arms inspector.
	   Ritter, who earlier had disclosed U.N. arms inspectors' dealings
with Israel's Mossad spy agency and the CIA, expressed
disappointment the Romanian operation had remained secret.
	   ``We could not present to the Security Council the most
compelling evidence'' of Iraqi non-compliance with U.N.
resolutions, Ritter said.
	   He said revealing the information would have opened up ``the
sources and methods used to collect it ... which governments did
not want to put at risk.''
	   According to NewsStand, agents learned of the plans for the
Romanian visit from an Iraqi engineer who defected. They also had
documents found at the farm of Lt. Gen. Hussein Kamel al-Majid,
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's son-in-law.
	   Iraq allowed inspection of al-Majid's chicken farm after he
defected in 1995; he later returned to Iraq and was killed. Among
the documents from his farm was a previous contract for missile
equipment with the state-run Romanian company Aerofina.

Falcons clinch playoff spot with 21-10 victory

 &UR; EDS: Recaps previous to ADD late games; WILL be UPDATED with late
game. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Jamal Anderson ran for a career-high 188 yards
and 44-year-old Steve DeBerg threw a 29-yard touchdown pass to
Terance Mathis as Atlanta (10-2) clinched a U.S. National Football
League playoff berth earlier than ever before with a 21-10 victory
over St. Louis on Sunday.
	   DeBerg took over in the second half for Tony Graziani, who
started in place of the injured Chris Chandler.
	   His TD pass came after the Falcons, who led 3-0 at the half,
fell behind when Tony Horne of the Rams (10-2) returned the
second-half kickoff 101 yards for a score. Anderson added a 27-yard
TD run.
	   The game drew a crowd of 47,971, lowest since the Rams moved to
St. Louis in 1995.  &UR; Ravens 38, Colts 31 &QC; 
	   At Baltimore, Jim Harbaugh hit Floyd Turner with a 22-yard TD
pass and Priest Holmes ran 36 yards for his second touchdown that
rallied the Ravens for 17 fourth-quarter points.
	   It was the first time the Colts had played in Baltimore since
Robert Irsay moved the franchise to Indianapolis in 1984 and the
victory delighted the crowd of 68,898 who waited 14 years to root
against the Colts.
	   Indianapolis (2-10) jumped out to a 17-3 first-quarter lead and
was ahead 31-21 entering the final period. After the game,
Baltimore quarterback Jim Harbaugh gave the game ball to former
Baltimore Colts great Johnny Unitas, who rooted for the Ravens from
the sideline.
 &UR; Chiefs 34, Cardinals 24 &QC; 
	   At Kansas City, Missouri, Rich Gannon's three touchdown passes
enabled Kansas City to overcome a rash of penalties and mistakes
and snap its six-game losing streak.
	   The Chiefs (5-7), who had not lost six straight in a non-strike
year since 1985, took a 31-17 lead with 10:26 left when Derrick
Alexander scored his second TD on a 15-yard pass from Gannon. But
the Cardinals (6-6), who had moved into playoff contention by
winning three of their last four games, answered with an 80-yard
drive and made it 31-24 on Mario Bates' 1-yard plunge with 6:07
remaining.
 &UR; Jaguars 34, Bengals 17 &QC; 
	   At Cincinnati, Mark Brunell rebounded from his worst game as a
pro by throwing a touchdown pass in each quarter Sunday.
	   Jacksonville improved to 9-3 for the first time in its four
years and opened a two-game lead in the AFC Central Division, which
the Jaguars have never won.
 &UR; Jets 48, Panthers 21 &QC; 
	   At East Rutherford, New Jersey, Curtis Martin and Keyshawn
Johnson ran 60 and 35 yards for touchdowns and Vinny Testaverde
completed 16 of 21 passes for 255 yards and two touchdowns.
	   It was the fifth straight victory at home for the Jets (8-4),
the first time for that in 12 years. New York also sacked Carolina
quarterback Steve Beuerlein five times, including one for a
safety.
 &UR; Buccaneers 31, Bears 17 &QC; 
	   At Chicago, Brian Hunter caught an unusual touchdown pass just
before the end of the first half to snap a 17-17 tie and help the
Buccaneers' end their three-game losing streak. It was the fourth
straight loss for Chicago.
	   On the final play of the first half, Tampa Bay quarterback Trent
Dilfer heaved the ball into the end zone and into a scrum of
players. Tampa receiver Bert Emanuel got his hands to the ball and
tipped it toward the sidelines to Hunter. Hunter had gone out of
bounds on the play, but the 45-yard TD catch was allowed because he
had returned to the field and an eligible receiver had touched the
ball before he did.
	   ___
	   FOXBORO, Massachusetts (AP) _ For the second time in seven days,
Drew Bledsoe flipped the winning touchdown pass with a fractured
finger and kept the Patriots in the thick of the playoff race.
	   With no time but one play left after a defensive pass
interference call in the end zone against Henry Jones, Bledsoe
threw a 1-yard pass to Ben Coates, and New England beat the Buffalo
Bills 25-21 Sunday.
	   The win moved the Patriots (7-5) into a tie with the Bills, one
game behind the New York Jets and Miami in the AFC East, as Buffalo
lost for just the second time in nine games. And Bledsoe ruined
Doug Flutie's homecoming in a stadium where he had been 10-0.
 &UR; Dolphins 30, Saints 10 &QC; 
	   Dan Marino threw three touchdown passes to O.J. McDuffie,
becoming the first player in NFL history to reach 400 career TD
passes, as the Dolphins (8-4) stayed in a tie with the Jets in the
AFC East by overcoming an early 10-3 lead by the Saints (5-7).
	   Marino hit McDuffie with a 22-yard scoring pass late in the
second quarter, then reached the milestone by hitting McDuffie with
a 4-yard TD toss on the first play of the fourth quarter. They
hooked up again on a 9-yard TD pass with 7:34 left to cap the
scoring.
 &UR; Packers 24, Eagles 16
	   GREEN BAY, Wisconsin (AP) _ The heavily-favored Packers needed
career days from running back Darick Holmes and wideout Bill
Schroeder to slip past the Philadelphia Eagles 24-16.
	   Holmes rushed for a career-best 163 yards on 26 carries and
Schroeder caught five passes for a career-high 128 yards in his
first NFL start as the Packers (8-4) held off the Eagles (2-10) in
a game that was much closer than anybody could have expected.
	   Green Bay, an 18-point favorite, trailed 13-10 in the third
quarter after third-string quarterback Koy Detmer, making his first
NFL start, guided the Eagles on two long scoring drives that he
capped with TD tosses of 16 and 4 yards to Jeff Graham.
 &UR; Redskins 29, Raiders 19
	   In Oakland, California, Trent Green threw three scoring passes
and the Washington Redskins forced three turnovers as the Redskins
spoiled Jeff George's return and won on the road for the first time
this season. The loss also hurt the chances that the Raiders (7-5)
will make the playoffs for the first time since 1993.
	   The Redskins (3-9) have won three of five after opening the
season with seven straight losses.
 &UR; Seahawks 20, Oilers 18 &QC; 
	   In Seattle, Jon Kitna threw two touchdown passes and drove the
Seattle Seahawks into position for the winning field goal with one
second left.
	   Todd Peterson kicked a 48-yard field goal after Kitna marched
the Seahawks (6-6) from their 29 to the Oilers' 30 after Al Del
Greco's 42-yard field goal put Tennessee ahead 18-17 with 33
seconds to go.
	   Kitna, replacing the benched Warren Moon at quarterback, was
24-of-39 for 298 yards and two touchdowns with one interception in
his second career start.

Nippon Express, FedEx form tie-up on international services
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Nippon Express Co. said Monday it has
reached an agreement with America's Federal Express Corp. to form a
wide-ranging alliance in international transport services.
	   Cooperation will begin in December when Nippon Express, Japan's
largest transport company, starts using FedEx's international
delivery service now linking 120,000 global cities, Nippon Express
spokesman Koichi Ohori said.
	   The tie-up will include joint use of parcel collection points
and other facilities around the world, Ohori said.
	   Under the agreement, FedEx, America's second-biggest transport
company, and Nippon Express will also share information systems to
track cargo deliveries, Ohori said.
	   Ohori said details about cooperation in domestic transport
services in Japan have yet to be finalized. FedEx has its own
network in Tokyo, Osaka and other major Japanese cities.
	   The two companies hope to save money through increased
efficiency at a time when businesses worldwide are reviewing their
logistics systems, Ohori said.
	   The two firms rank among the world's top five transport
companies, and their alliance is likely to affect the strategies of
United Parcel Service of America Inc. and other competitors, local
news reports have said.
	   Nippon Express expects that through the alliance overseas its
deliveries will be tripled from the current volume to some 70,000 a
month by the year 2000, boosting annual revenue by several billion
yen (million of dollars).

In restive Iraqi city: Assassination try or pretext?
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KARBALA, Iraq (AP) _ On the pavement outside one of Shiite
Islam's holiest sites, a sprawling mosque of Arabesque tiles with a
gold-leaf dome and minarets, a circle of white chalk marks the
chiseled concrete where a hand grenade exploded.
	   A few feet (meters) away is another chalk circle marking the
scars of another grenade, then the outline of the body of the lone
assailant who the government said was killed as he tried to
assassinate one of Iraq's most powerful officials.
	   From there, however, the story gets very murky.
	   The government announced Nov. 23 that Izzat Ibrahim, the No. 2
man in the Iraqi regime and a trusted lieutenant of President
Saddam Hussein, was targeted by ``criminal elements'' in Karbala.
It would be the first attempt on an Iraqi official since December
1996, when gunmen sprayed the car of Saddam's eldest son, Odai.
	   But the opposition cried foul, saying the incident was
fabricated to create a pretext to crack down on dissidents in the
city, the site of a bloody uprising seven years ago and still a
bastion of unrest.
	   In the city itself, asking possible witnesses about the incident
turns into a game of see no evil, hear no evil _ a sign of the fear
the government has instilled here.
	   The government said the assailant threw two grenades at Ibrahim
as he got out of a car on his way to a religious ceremony.
	   Ibrahim was reported to have escaped unharmed and he still
delivered a speech on behalf of Saddam.
	   Several bystanders and bodyguards, however, were wounded, and
the assailant was reportedly shot and killed in the street.
	   Days later, the Iraqi National Congress, a London-based
opposition group, said the attempt was orchestrated to justify a
renewed campaign of repression on central and southern Iraq, where
rebels still stage hit-and-run attacks against government forces.
	   Ibrahim, it said, was leading troops who were trying to detain
army deserters in Karbala, 60 miles (100 kilometers) south of
Baghdad, and clashes broke out between his soldiers and the young
men.
	   ``But there was no attempt against Izzat Ibrahim personally,''
the opposition insisted.
	   That suggestion seemed to be bolstered in recent days when an
Iraqi newspaper reported a crackdown in Karbala. And no group
claimed responsibility for an attack that was bold by the standards
of Iraq, where dissent _ violent or otherwise _ is considered
treason.
	   The newspaper Babil reported that 39 ``saboteurs and agents''
were arrested in the days after the incident by the Fedayeen, a
paramilitary force led by Odai whose soldiers are shown on Iraqi
television killing cats, wolves and snakes and eating their raw
meat.
	   On Sunday, the newspaper reported that American agents were
preparing to carry out sabotage in southern Iraq in the event of a
U.S. attack in Iraq's dispute earlier this month over U.N. weapons
inspections.
	   Three top Iraqi officials, including Saddam's cousin and
Ibrahim, were sent to the south to deal with the threat, it said.
	   Western diplomats in Baghdad, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said they did not doubt the attack on Ibrahim was
authentic.
	   They pointed out that the government has not needed a pretext in
the past to carry out often-brutal campaigns in the largely Shiite
south. They also did not rule out the possibility Ibrahim's
assailant acted alone.
	   The fierce reaction may also reflect a growing unease within the
government about renewed attempts by the long-divided and
often-ineffectual Iraqi opposition to unite its ranks in exile.
	   Washington has stepped up its support as well, promising dlrs 97
million for efforts to topple Saddam.
	   In Karbala itself, the mood was subdued Sunday, and no one
seemed willing to speak about the incident.
	   Along kiosks selling leather jackets, nuts, jewelry and
religious mementos across from the Imam Hussein mosque, shopkeeper
after shopkeeper insisted that at the time of the attack he was in
Baghdad, at home, asleep or had only begun working at the shop in
the past week.
	   ``I wasn't here really, I was at a wedding,'' said 71-year-old
Jaafar Abdel-Samad as he sat in front of a tea stand.
	   When he was told the attack happened in the morning _ earlier
than the usual Iraqi wedding _ he answered: ``I had to get ready
for the wedding.''
	   Another shopkeeper, unsettled by the questions, urged a
reporter, ``Please, leave this subject alone.''
	   Soon after, police led a young boy with a rag and water to the
street. He scrubbed away the chalk marking the grenades and body.

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Despite years of claims it has ended all programs
to build weapons of mass destruction, Iraq made a bid to acquire
prohibited missile technology last May, CNN reported.
	   In its program NewsStand, produced with Time magazine, CNN said
Sunday evening that Iraqi missile experts, escorted by Iraqi secret
police, went to the Romanian capital Bucharest to negotiate the
purchase of guidance equipment for long-range missiles.
	   Iraq is required to eliminate its long-range missiles and
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons under resolutions by the
U.N. Security Council adopted after the 1991 Gulf War that ended
Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.
	   The CNN report quoted unnamed sources and Scott Ritter, an
American ex-Marine who resigned as a U.N. arms inspector in August
who complained the U.S. government was undermining the search for
Iraq's forbidden weapons.
	   Iraq has insisted since the early 1990s that it has destroyed
all its prohibited weapons. Tough U.N. trade sanctions, imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, cannot be lifted until U.N.
inspectors certify that its weaponry has been destroyed.
	   According to the program's transcript, the Iraqi purchase in
Bucharest was blocked because spy agencies from the United States,
Romania and Israel uncovered the potential deal and monitored the
Iraqis' two-week visit.
	   ``We had the goods on the Iraqis. ... We caught them
red-handed,'' Ritter told NewsStand.
	   CNN said Romania's government cooperated in the spying
operation.
	   Iraq refused to comment on the reports until after Sunday's
broadcast, CNN said.
	   NewsStand also noted the U.N. Security Council, which set up the
arms inspection program, was never officially informed of the spy
operation in Bucharest that was approved by Richard Butler, the
chief U.N. arms inspector.
	   Ritter, who earlier had disclosed U.N. arms inspectors' dealings
with Israel's Mossad spy agency and the CIA, expressed
disappointment the Romanian operation had remained secret.
	   ``We could not present to the Security Council the most
compelling evidence'' of Iraqi non-compliance with U.N.
resolutions, Ritter said.
	   He said revealing the information would have opened up ``the
sources and methods used to collect it ... which governments did
not want to put at risk.''
	   According to NewsStand, agents learned of the plans for the
Romanian visit from an Iraqi engineer who defected. They also had
documents found at the farm of Lt. Gen. Hussein Kamel al-Majid,
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's son-in-law.
	   Iraq allowed inspection of al-Majid's chicken farm after he
defected in 1995; he later returned to Iraq and was killed. Among
the documents from his farm was a previous contract for missile
equipment with the state-run Romanian company Aerofina.

Australian jurists condemn restrictions on East Timor deaths probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The Australian Commission of Jurists
on Monday condemned Indonesia's latest move to restrict Australian
investigations into the deaths of five Australian-based newsmen in
East Timor in 1975.
	   An Australian defense attache set to investigate the behavior of
troops on East Timor will be guided around the disputed province by
members of the Indonesian army.
	   Meanwhile, Tom Sherman, author of a report into the 1975
incident, has been denied access to East Timor to reinvestigate the
deaths of the newsmen.
	   Rodney Lewis, from the Australian Commission of Jurists' East
Timor subcommittee, said the refusal to allow Sherman into East
Timor could be seen as a blow to the investigation.
	   ``On the one hand, it is (a blow) I suppose, because it would
have been better for him had he been able to actually go to Balibo
to see the lie of the land and to see all of the places which are
referred to by the witnesses who he spoke to and received evidence
from, in his first report,'' Lewis told Australian Broadcasting
Corp. radio.
	   ``But on the other hand, he would have been relying on the
Indonesian military for safe passage for his itinerary and travel,
for information and interviews which he would have sought.
	   ``For that reason there would be little doubt that the people to
whom he spoke would not have been able to speak freely,'' Lewis
said.
	   He said it was crucial that a fact-finding mission went to
Timor.
	   ``But it's got to go under circumstances where Timor is no
longer controlled as it has been for a generation now by the
Indonesian military,'' he said.
	   An Australian defense attache going to East Timor this week to
investigate reports of further massacres and lack of troop
withdrawals would produce the same result, he said.
	   ``I think the same thing applies,'' Lewis said.
	   ``But in this case, (it's) because his information and his
interviews are going to be regulated by the Indonesian military.''
	   Reporter Malcolm Rennie, 28, and cameraman Brian Peters, 29,
both British citizens; reporter Greg Shackleton, 27, and soundman
Tony Stewart, 21, both of Australia; and New Zealand cameraman Gary
Cunningham, 27, were killed in an attack on Balibo village on Oct.
16, 1975.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, that
year and annexed it in 1976. The half-island territory has endured
years of human rights abuse and guerrilla warfare since then.
	   Indonesia has always claimed that the reporters died in
cross-fire between Timorese rebels and pro-Indonesian militiamen.
	   But recently more witnesses have come forward to claim that
President B.J. Habibie's information minister, Lt. Gen. Mohammad
Yunus Yosfiah, was involved in the slayings. Yunus has strongly
denied the allegations.

Israeli Cabinet ministers call for reprisals against Lebanon

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Amid growing public opposition to Israel's
presence in Lebanon, the Cabinet is considering new strategies for
dealing with Lebanese guerrillas blamed for the recent killings of
Israeli soldiers.
	   Cabinet members met Sunday, discussing such options as a
unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon or launching attacks on Lebanese
power facilities. But the ministers announced no decision or plans
to change Israel's 13-year presence in south Lebanon.
	   Seven Israeli soldiers have been killed in the past two weeks by
the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia in Israel's self-declared
security zone, an area of southern Lebanon it occupies to protect
its northern border.
	   The latest deaths have fueled public calls for a reassessment of
policy toward Lebanon. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short
a European trip to deal with a growing debate in Israel over the
losses in Lebanon and calls for an Israeli pullout.
	   The 12-member Cabinet security committee met in Jerusalem for
four hours Sunday to hear military and security chiefs report on
the Lebanon situation, after Netanyahu returned from visiting
soldiers wounded in the latest fighting.
	   Military officials said they oppose a one-sided withdrawal from
south Lebanon without a negotiated arrangement with the Lebanese
government, Israel's Channel 2 TV reported.
	   Before the meeting, Netanyahu said Cabinet members would discuss
minimizing Israeli troop casualties, not withdrawal.
	   ``As long as we don't have a way of leaving Lebanon in an
arrangement that will guarantee the safety of northern Israel, our
main objective is to protect Israeli soldiers,'' he said.
	   With heavy losses, a growing number of the Israeli public and
officials support a unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon. But those
opposed, including Netanyahu, argue that such a move would lead to
more bloodshed and the victims would be civilians as well as
soldiers.
	   Meanwhile, fighting between Israeli troops and Hezbollah
guerrillas continued in south Lebanon Sunday.
	   Israeli warplanes struck suspected guerrilla bases after attacks
earlier in the day on Israeli outposts, an Israeli army spokesman
said.
	   Army and intelligence chiefs, who met Saturday night, were
unanimous in saying withdrawal would be a dangerous gamble unless
Syria, which has 40,000 troops in Lebanon, guarantees that
Hezbollah would not attack towns in northern Israel.
	   Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, a former general who was the
architect of Israel's 1982 Lebanon invasion, is perhaps the most
prominent support of a one-sided pullout.
	   Sharon has called for a staged withdrawal from Lebanon but added
that the Lebanese government would be held responsible for
preventing Hezbollah attacks that Israel has evacuated.
	   Should Lebanon fail to prevent these attacks, Sharon has argued
that the ``rules of the game'' would have to change and that Israel
could target Lebanese power stations, water pumping facilities,
bridges and roads.
	   Other ministers Sunday have called for retaliatory attacks on
civilian facilities.
	   ``Let Beirut wake up in the morning without water and
electricity and then, believe me, they (the Lebanese) will send
forces (to restrain Hezbollah) and so will the Syrians,'' said
Avigdor Kahalani, the minsiter in charge of the national police
force.
	   In Beirut, Hezbollah responded with a warning that any attack on
Lebanon's utilities would draw painful retaliation.
	   The escalating rhetoric drew a call for restraint from the
United States in the form of letters sent by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright to the leaders of Israel, Lebanon and Syria,
Israel TV reported.

Green crusaders emerge from China's polluted environment

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Li Hao rarely forgoes a chance to disparage
disposable chopsticks. Lunch or dinner, she'll whip out her
reusable pair and cajole fellow diners into giving up the throwaway
kind.
	   ``I say, `Let's use fewer disposable chopsticks, and chop down
fewer trees.' Everyone usually replies: `Oh yes, yes, you're
right,''' said Li, who abandoned a career in immunology to become
an environmental campaigner. ``I use every possible opportunity.''
	   For China's battered environment, seeds of salvation could lie
in such talk. Li and other ecologists are building the beginnings
of China's first environmental movement. Their challenge: educating
the masses to think ``green.''
	   China's green crusaders don't chain themselves to trees or
protest on streets. That would identify them as troublemakers in
the eyes of China's authoritarian government and risk a crackdown.
	   But short of attacking government policies, a small band of
activists _ some who awoke to China's environmental problems while
studying abroad _ has been allowed to form groups and campaign
publicly.
	   Although limited in size and scope, this citizens movement is a
sign of a nascent civil society in China.
	   Just two decades ago, the government controlled nearly all
aspects of people's lives, from jobs and housing to their
children's schooling. But two decades of economic reforms and
liberalization have done much to loosen the government's stifling
grip, allowing people to begin organizing for themselves.
	   Women's groups offer counseling to abused or divorced wives.
Public health campaigners use telephone hotlines to advise people
on the threat of AIDS.
	   In Beijing, one environmental group helped organize a small
neighborhood into dividing its trash for recycling and encouraged
state-run news media to give the project widespread coverage. The
same group also is urging the legislature to curb the dumping of
trash in landfills and recycle it instead.
	   A larger group, Friends of Nature, successfully lobbied Beijing
leaders to stop officials in southwestern China from clear-cutting
an old-growth forest, saving a rare monkey's habitat. The group,
which has more than 600 members, has now switched its attention to
a campaign against the poaching each of year of thousands of
Tibetan antelope for their wool.
	   It and other groups, including green clubs that have sprung up
in universities, also organize tree-planting trips to deforested
areas.
	   Li Hao works for a European-financed project that provides
educational videotapes on environmental issues to schools, state
media, government departments and even a prison. She also visits
schools and writes to newspapers to promote green issues and teach
people how to protect natural resources.
	   ``If one person in a family changes their point of view, then
the whole household will be influenced,'' she said in an interview.
``Just a few sparks on a big prairie can set the whole thing
aflame.''
	   Authorities still regularly detain and harass dissidents who try
to organize political or human rights groups. But where green
groups are concerned, the sheer scale of China's environmental
problems appears to have swayed officials into adopting a more
lenient approach.
	   Five of the 10 cities with the world's worst air pollution are
in China. All of China's major freshwater lakes are polluted. In
Beijing, the skies are often a smoky, cough-inducing gray. In the
suburbs, trash rots in heaps and discarded plastic bags hang from
trees like dead skin.
	   By advocating recycling and railing against waste, green groups
dovetail with government efforts to make people, including its own
officials, more environmentally aware and to promote sustainable
development.
	   By keeping a watchful eye on environmental concerns, ecologists
also help national leaders keep tabs on officials out in the
provinces, such as those in the southwest who had planned to log
the old forest that is home to the golden-haired monkey.
	   Government leaders have realized that ``we help them achieve
many things,'' said Liang Congjie, head of the Friends of Nature
group that brought the logging plan to the central government's
attention in 1995.
	   However, some issues, like the controversial Three Gorges Dam,
remain out of bounds. Communist leaders have staked much prestige
on the project _ which foreign ecologists fear will be a disaster _
and have stifled domestic criticism.
	   ``We know where the limitations are,'' said Liang. ``We try to
avoid the politics as much as we can, just focus on environmental
issues.''
	   The government keeps the movement in check by requiring citizens
groups to undergo strict official registration procedures and by
reviewing registrations once a year. New regulations tightening the
registration procedures were introduced in October. One Beijing
group has circumvented the rules by setting itself up as a
business, although that means it must pay tax.
	   Dai Qing, a fierce government critic and author of a banned book
attacking the Three Gorges Dam, said official restrictions limit
the effectiveness of the fledgling movement.
	   ``Without them, the hopes of changing the environmental
consciousness of the Chinese people would be even smaller than they
are now, but they have not yet played the big role we would like,''
said Dai.
	   The groups also are swimming against the public tide. China's
shops, which were sparsely stocked during the lean years before
economic reforms, now bulge with goods. Many people are too busy
consuming _ often as conspicuously as possible _ to worry about
environmental problems.
	   ``We Chinese used to be very frugal. We didn't like to throw
anything away and reused things over and over,'' Li Hao said.
``Now, the trend in society is to think: `Now, we have money. I can
throw things away.' I think this is a very bad state of mind.''

Corretja beats Moya to win ATP Championship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps previous. &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Looking for inspiration in tennis
history, Alex Corretja found the motivation to come back from two
sets down and win the biggest title of his career.
	   In the longest final of the year, Corretja beat good friend
Carlos Moya 3-6, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3, 7-5 in four hours to capture the
season-ending ATP Tour World Championship on Sunday.
	   Corretja said he kept thinking of the 1984 French Open final
when Ivan Lendl beat John McEnroe after rallying from two sets
down.
	   ``At that time Lendl was my idol. Today I was thinking, `Come
on, try to do like your idol ... try to find some energy from
somewhere and try to think about your tennis and try to push him to
see if he is going to be able to finish in straight sets,'''
Corretja said.
	   ``Even when I was two sets down, I was still thinking that I
could win this match. That's why I think I won,'' Corretja said.
	   Corretja, 23, lost this year's French Open final to Moya, one of
the three losses this year to the fellow Spaniard.
	   ``I learned a lot from that defeat. I was very strong mentally
today,'' said Moya, 24.
	   ``When I won the third set, I said to myself, 'Come on, this is
the first set you win this year against Carlos, so try to push him
and see if he can play better than you,''' Corretja said.
	   The four-hour victory was worth dlrs 1.36 million and propelled
Corretja three places up to No. 3 in the final 1998 computer
rankings, a career high.
	   ``If I am No. 3, I can be No. 1, but it will not be an obsession
with me. I don't want to change anything just to be No. 1,'' he
said.
	   In fact, Corretja beat the No. 1, Pete Sampras, in the
semifinals of the elite tournament, which brings together the top
eight players of the year.
	   ``This tournament is just unbelievable, it's a big event and I
didn't want to finish with the small trophy. I wanted this one,''
said Corretja as he hugged the big glass trophy.
	   Moya, who squandered a 3-1 lead in the fifth set, collected dlrs
660,000 and will finish the year ranked fifth. He won two titles in
1998.
	   ``Two sets up, maybe I relaxed a bit,'' Moya said. ``I thought
the match was not over. It's never over when you play against Alex.
But I had a really big advantage.''
	   ``I had many chances to beat him, but they went and he started
to play better. It's a big disappointment,'' said Moya, whose
consolation prize was dlrs 660,000.
	   It was the first all-Spanish final in the history of the event
and the first Spanish triumph since Manuel Orantes won what was
then called the Masters in 1976 in Houston, Texas.
	   Corretja won his ninth career title and finished 1998 with five
titles.

Report: Court rejects compensation suit by Dutch ex-POWs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Tokyo court on Monday rejected a compensation
suit by eight former Dutch POWs who had been forced into slave
labor by the Japanese army during World War II, a news report said.
	   The Tokyo District Court ruled that under international law
individuals in wartime compensation cases do not have the right to
sue the government, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   Court officials declined to comment on the ruling.
	   The plaintiffs had demanded dlrs 176,000 in total from the
Japanese government to compensate for physical abuses suffered in
prisoner camps in the former Dutch East Indies, now Indonesia,
which Japan invaded in the 1940s.
	   The only woman among the plaintiffs sued for being forced into
sexual slavery by Japanese troops.
	   The ruling comes a week after the same court rejected demands
for compensation from seven plaintiffs on behalf of 20,000
ex-prisoners from Britain, the United States, Australia and New
Zealand.
	   The court had turned down compensation demands in last week's
case on the same basis.
	   The Japanese government claims that the issue of compensation
for POWs was resolved in 1951 with the signing of the San Francisco
peace treaty.
	   Japan forced POWs to work in shipyards, mines and jungles in
violation of international law. They were also beaten and some were
executed. Thousands of women across Asia were forced into brothels
for Japanese troops.
	   The POW death rate at the Japanese camps was 27 percent,
compared to a 4 percent rate at Allied camps.

Chinese president concludes Japan trip
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin departed for Beijing
on Monday after meeting agricultural specialists and students in
northern Japan.
	   Jiang, who concluded a historic six-day visit to Japan, boarded
a plane in the city of Sapporo on Japan's northernmost main island
of Hokkaido.
	   Jiang's visit, the first by a Chinese head of state since World
War II, had been touted as an opportunity to bury acrimony over
Japanese wartime atrocities and form a closer economic and
political partnership.
	   But the trip hit a snag over Tokyo's decision not to include a
full written apology for Japan's brutal invasion of China during
World War II, in which Imperial Army troops committed widespread
massacres.
	   Jiang repeatedly evoked Japanese wartime militarism at public
events and in private meetings during his visit.
	   Observers also speculated that China may have been disappointed
by the vagueness of Tokyo's assurances that it does not to support
independence for Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade
province.
	   During the visit, Tokyo offered China new loans of 390 billion
yen (dlrs 3.2 billion) for 28 environmental, farming and other
development projects for 1999-2000.
	   Jiang was accompanied to Japan by his wife, Wang Yeping. Sapporo
is 829 kilometers (518 miles) northwest of Tokyo.

Falcons clinch playoff spot with 21-10 victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS score overline for Patriots-Bills game; ADDS venue for
Dolphins-Saints game. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Jamal Anderson ran for a career-high 188 yards
and 44-year-old Steve DeBerg threw a 29-yard touchdown pass to
Terance Mathis as Atlanta (10-2) clinched a U.S. National Football
League playoff berth earlier than ever before with a 21-10 victory
over St. Louis on Sunday.
	   DeBerg took over in the second half for Tony Graziani, who
started in place of the injured Chris Chandler.
	   His TD pass came after the Falcons, who led 3-0 at the half,
fell behind when Tony Horne of the Rams (10-2) returned the
second-half kickoff 101 yards for a score. Anderson added a 27-yard
TD run.
	   The game drew a crowd of 47,971, lowest since the Rams moved to
St. Louis in 1995.  &UR; Ravens 38, Colts 31 &QC; 
	   At Baltimore, Jim Harbaugh hit Floyd Turner with a 22-yard TD
pass and Priest Holmes ran 36 yards for his second touchdown that
rallied the Ravens for 17 fourth-quarter points.
	   It was the first time the Colts had played in Baltimore since
Robert Irsay moved the franchise to Indianapolis in 1984 and the
victory delighted the crowd of 68,898 who waited 14 years to root
against the Colts.
	   Indianapolis (2-10) jumped out to a 17-3 first-quarter lead and
was ahead 31-21 entering the final period. After the game,
Baltimore quarterback Jim Harbaugh gave the game ball to former
Baltimore Colts great Johnny Unitas, who rooted for the Ravens from
the sideline.
 &UR; Chiefs 34, Cardinals 24 &QC; 
	   At Kansas City, Missouri, Rich Gannon's three touchdown passes
enabled Kansas City to overcome a rash of penalties and mistakes
and snap its six-game losing streak.
	   The Chiefs (5-7), who had not lost six straight in a non-strike
year since 1985, took a 31-17 lead with 10:26 left when Derrick
Alexander scored his second TD on a 15-yard pass from Gannon. But
the Cardinals (6-6), who had moved into playoff contention by
winning three of their last four games, answered with an 80-yard
drive and made it 31-24 on Mario Bates' 1-yard plunge with 6:07
remaining.
 &UR; Jaguars 34, Bengals 17 &QC; 
	   At Cincinnati, Mark Brunell rebounded from his worst game as a
pro by throwing a touchdown pass in each quarter Sunday.
	   Jacksonville improved to 9-3 for the first time in its four
years and opened a two-game lead in the AFC Central Division, which
the Jaguars have never won.
 &UR; Jets 48, Panthers 21 &QC; 
	   At East Rutherford, New Jersey, Curtis Martin and Keyshawn
Johnson ran 60 and 35 yards for touchdowns and Vinny Testaverde
completed 16 of 21 passes for 255 yards and two touchdowns.
	   It was the fifth straight victory at home for the Jets (8-4),
the first time for that in 12 years. New York also sacked Carolina
quarterback Steve Beuerlein five times, including one for a
safety.
 &UR; Buccaneers 31, Bears 17 &QC; 
	   At Chicago, Brian Hunter caught an unusual touchdown pass just
before the end of the first half to snap a 17-17 tie and help the
Buccaneers' end their three-game losing streak. It was the fourth
straight loss for Chicago.
	   On the final play of the first half, Tampa Bay quarterback Trent
Dilfer heaved the ball into the end zone and into a scrum of
players. Tampa receiver Bert Emanuel got his hands to the ball and
tipped it toward the sidelines to Hunter. Hunter had gone out of
bounds on the play, but the 45-yard TD catch was allowed because he
had returned to the field and an eligible receiver had touched the
ball before he did.
 &UR; Patriots 25, Bills 21 &QC; 
	   In Foxboro, Massachusetts, Drew Bledsoe flipped the winning
touchdown pass with a fractured finger for the second time in seven
days and kept the Patriots in the thick of the playoff race.
	   With no time but one play left after a defensive pass
interference call in the end zone against Henry Jones, Bledsoe
threw a 1-yard pass to Ben Coates, and New England beat the Buffalo
Bills 25-21 Sunday.
	   The win moved the Patriots (7-5) into a tie with the Bills, one
game behind the New York Jets and Miami in the AFC East, as Buffalo
lost for just the second time in nine games. And Bledsoe ruined
Doug Flutie's homecoming in a stadium where he had been 10-0.
 &UR; Dolphins 30, Saints 10 &QC; 
	   In Miami, Dan Marino threw three touchdown passes to O.J.
McDuffie, becoming the first player in NFL history to reach 400
career TD passes, as the Dolphins (8-4) stayed in a tie with the
Jets in the AFC East by overcoming an early 10-3 lead by the Saints
(5-7).
	   Marino hit McDuffie with a 22-yard scoring pass late in the
second quarter, then reached the milestone by hitting McDuffie with
a 4-yard TD toss on the first play of the fourth quarter. They
hooked up again on a 9-yard TD pass with 7:34 left to cap the
scoring.
 &UR; Packers 24, Eagles 16
	   In Green Bay, Wisconsin, the heavily-favored Packers needed
career days from running back Darick Holmes and wideout Bill
Schroeder to slip past the Philadelphia Eagles 24-16.
	   Holmes rushed for a career-best 163 yards on 26 carries and
Schroeder caught five passes for a career-high 128 yards in his
first NFL start as the Packers (8-4) held off the Eagles (2-10) in
a game that was much closer than anybody could have expected.
	   Green Bay, an 18-point favorite, trailed 13-10 in the third
quarter after third-string quarterback Koy Detmer, making his first
NFL start, guided the Eagles on two long scoring drives that he
capped with TD tosses of 16 and 4 yards to Jeff Graham.
 &UR; Redskins 29, Raiders 19
	   In Oakland, California, Trent Green threw three scoring passes
and the Washington Redskins forced three turnovers as the Redskins
spoiled Jeff George's return and won on the road for the first time
this season. The loss also hurt the chances that the Raiders (7-5)
will make the playoffs for the first time since 1993.
	   The Redskins (3-9) have won three of five after opening the
season with seven straight losses.
 &UR; Seahawks 20, Oilers 18 &QC; 
	   In Seattle, Jon Kitna threw two touchdown passes and drove the
Seattle Seahawks into position for the winning field goal with one
second left.
	   Todd Peterson kicked a 48-yard field goal after Kitna marched
the Seahawks (6-6) from their 29 to the Oilers' 30 after Al Del
Greco's 42-yard field goal put Tennessee ahead 18-17 with 33
seconds to go.
	   Kitna, replacing the benched Warren Moon at quarterback, was
24-of-39 for 298 yards and two touchdowns with one interception in
his second career start.

Syria to elect new parliament this week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syrians will vote on a new parliament
this week, with businessmen and women expected to score gains.
	   About 8 million Syrians are eligible to vote for the 250-seat
National Assembly, choosing from 7,350 candidates.
	   Final results are expected Thursday at the earliest, after
balloting Monday and Tuesday.
	   Businessmen and industrialists are expected to gain more
influence in the new parliament, following government efforts to
encourage more investment in the private sector.
	   Women, who held 24 seats in the previous parliament, also are
expected to increase their numbers. More than 800 women are
running.
	   Two-thirds of the seats in the National Assembly are allotted to
the National Progressive Front, a coalition of seven parties led by
the Baath Party, which has ruled Syria since 1963.
	   The assembly has limited legislative power, with effective
control held by President Hafez Assad, who came to power in a
bloodless coup in 1970.

Australian jurists condemn restrictions on East Timor deaths probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The Australian Commission of Jurists
on Monday condemned Indonesia's latest move to restrict Australian
investigations into the deaths of five Australian-based newsmen in
East Timor in 1975.
	   An Australian defense attache set to investigate the behavior of
troops on East Timor will be guided around the disputed province by
members of the Indonesian army.
	   Meanwhile, Tom Sherman, author of a report into the 1975
incident, has been denied access to East Timor to reinvestigate the
deaths of the newsmen.
	   Rodney Lewis, from the Australian Commission of Jurists' East
Timor subcommittee, said the refusal to allow Sherman into East
Timor could be seen as a blow to the investigation.
	   ``On the one hand, it is (a blow) I suppose, because it would
have been better for him had he been able to actually go to Balibo
to see the lie of the land and to see all of the places which are
referred to by the witnesses who he spoke to and received evidence
from, in his first report,'' Lewis told Australian Broadcasting
Corp. radio.
	   ``But on the other hand, he would have been relying on the
Indonesian military for safe passage for his itinerary and travel,
for information and interviews which he would have sought.
	   ``For that reason there would be little doubt that the people to
whom he spoke would not have been able to speak freely,'' Lewis
said.
	   He said it was crucial that a fact-finding mission went to
Timor.
	   ``But it's got to go under circumstances where Timor is no
longer controlled as it has been for a generation now by the
Indonesian military,'' he said.
	   Reporter Malcolm Rennie, 28, and cameraman Brian Peters, 29,
both British citizens; reporter Greg Shackleton, 27, and soundman
Tony Stewart, 21, both of Australia; and New Zealand cameraman Gary
Cunningham, 27, were killed in an attack on Balibo village on Oct.
16, 1975.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, that
year and annexed it in 1976. The half-island territory has endured
years of human rights abuse and guerrilla warfare since then.
	   Indonesia has always claimed that the reporters died in
cross-fire between Timorese rebels and pro-Indonesian militiamen.
	   But recently more witnesses have come forward to claim that
President B.J. Habibie's information minister, Lt. Gen. Mohammad
Yunus Yosfiah, was involved in the slayings. Yunus has strongly
denied the allegations.

Dollar higher against yen, Tokyo stocks lower at midday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday trading

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks fell Monday morning as investors
monitored developments in the coalition between the ruling party
and the opposition Liberal party. The U.S. dollar rose against the
yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 91.08 points,
or 0.60 percent, ending the morning session at 14,978.31. On
Friday, the Nikkei closed down 138.38 points, or 0.91 percent.
	   The dollar bought 123.62 yen in early trading, up 0.76 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its New York level of 123.07
yen late Friday. The dollar's late New York level was its highest
in more than seven weeks.
	   Share prices declined as investors took to the sidelines to
await clarification on economic policies in the coalition between
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the Liberal Party.
	   ``Both foreign and domestic investors will be watching how
government policy develops,'' said Kenji Karikomi, general manager
of the equities department at Daiwa Securities.
	   The alliance has generated expectations for more economic
stimulus measures because the Liberals have pushed for a reduction
in Japan's unpopular consumption tax.
	   Experts say the government's raising of the sales tax rate to 5
percent from 3 percent last year was a leading factor in triggering
Japan's recession.
	   The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen at midday Monday amid
continuing pessimism over Japan's economy.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 7.12 points, or 0.61 percent, to 1,151.23.
The TOPIX closed down 6.24 points, or 0.54 percent Friday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond was unquoted at midday, compared with its Friday finish of
1.075 percent. Its price settled at 106.27 yen on Friday.

Singapore Muslim leader decries anti-Christian violence in
</HEADLINE>
Indonesia

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ One of Singapore's leading Muslim politicians
has denounced recent anti-Christian violence in neighboring
Indonesia, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   ``The acts committed by some Muslims against...Christians are
very saddening,'' Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign
Affairs Zainul Abidin Rasheed was quoted as saying by The Straits
Times. ``They should not have been committed'' and were ``a
disgrace to all Muslims.''
	   At least 14 people died in the ethnic and religious violence
last week, which sparked rioting in several parts of the Indonesian
capital. Muslim mobs attacked or burned five Protestant and Roman
Catholic schools and 22 churches.
	   Zainul called on Singapore's Muslim minority to publicly condemn
the anti-Christian violence or risk giving the impression that they
tolerated it.
	   ``Muslims must be bold enough to condemn such atrocities so that
we will not be seen as condoning these acts,'' he said while
speaking at a mosque function on Sunday.
	   Race relations and religious harmony in this predominantly
ethnic-Chinese city-state _ which is sandwiched between two much
larger Muslim countries _ are considered critical for Singapore's
stability.
	   Riots in the 60s between ethnic Chinese and ethnic Malays left
scores dead, and heightened racial and religious tension
contributed to Singapore's ouster from the Malaysian federation in
1965.

Report: Hong Kong police monitoring international pedophiles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Police are monitoring 16 suspected Hong
Kong-based pedophiles, who have allegedly been having sex with
child prostitutes in Southeast Asia but have escaped prosecution
because of a legal loophole, a newspaper report said Monday.
	   Acting Supt. Yvonne Lo of the Police Child Protection Unit told
the Hong Kong Standard that the police have been watching the
activities of the suspects _ most of them foreigners working in
Hong Kong _ for the past year.
	   But they could not press charges because Hong Kong has no law
against people who have sex with children overseas, Lo told the
paper. She said the police have been lobbying the government to
close the legal loophole, the Standard reported.
	   Almost a fifth of the estimated 1 million child prostitutes in
Asia are from mainland China. About 100,000 are from the
Philippines.

Strong earthquake kills at least five in Indonesia

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Volunteers searched for victims Monday
after a huge earthquake shook a small and remote island in eastern
Indonesia, killing at least five people and terrifying residents
who fled their damaged homes.
	   Fearing aftershocks, hundreds of people on Mangole Island ran to
the safety of a soccer field after the magnitude-6.5 quake struck
Sunday night.
	   Local police Sgt. Yopi Sariwating said the five were killed when
the roof of a plywood factory collapsed.
	   Many homes and buildings on the island of about 9,000 people
were damaged. Witnesses said large cracks had appeared in the
streets of the main town, Dofa, and elsewhere.
	   ``People are now gathering in a football field. There was a lot
of panic. They are too afraid to sleep because there might be
aftershocks,'' Sariwating said by telephone.
	   The number of injuries was not immediately known, and the search
for casualties was continuing on the island about 1,900 kilometers
(1,180 miles) east of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
	   Volunteers on Monday were at the sites of several landslides
around the island amid fears that some people might have buried.
	   One landslide destroyed a small fishing port, police said.
Electricity supplies had been cut and telecommunications with the
island were patchy.
	   Indonesia's Meteorological and Geophysics Agency said the quake
had a magnitude of 6.5.
	   It struck at 10:10 p.m. Eastern Indonesia Time (1410 GMT) Sunday
and was centered beneath the Maluku Sea, about 230 miles (370
kilometers) south of the city of Manado on the island of Sulawesi,
the agency said.
	   Earlier the U.S. Geological Survey in Washington said the quake
had a preliminary magnitude of 7.6.
	   The geological survey issued a tsunami warning for the Western
Pacific.
	   In Japan, the Meteorological Agency issued a tsunami alert along
the nation's Pacific coast stretching about 1,115 miles from
Okinawa state to Tokyo. But no major waves were observed in Japan
and the agency lifted the alert a little more than two hours later.
	   Mangole, an island dominated by the timber industry, is part of
the Maluku archipelago. The earthquake was felt on neighboring
islands, but no damage was reported.
	   In December 1992, a magnitude-7 earthquake caused a tsunami that
killed about 2,500 people on nearby Flores island.
	   More than 2,000 people were killed in July when a tsunami hit
the northern coast of neighboring Papua New Guinea.
	   Earthquakes are common in Indonesia, which lies astride the
so-called Pacific ``Ring of Fire'' _ a line of volcanically active
areas that stretches from Central America and the western coast of
North America across to Japan, Southeast Asia, the South Pacific
and New Zealand.
	   A magnitude-6 quake can cause severe damage if centered beneath
a heavily populated area while a magnitude-7 quake can cause
widespread, heavy damage.

Cycling star says she's out of money
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Controversial Australian cyclist
Kathy Watt, ranked sixth in the world, said Monday she is broke and
relying on loans to fund her Olympic campaign.
	   Her manager and partner Carey Hall said the Barcelona gold and
silver medalist was living on credit.
	   ``She'll be putting in for funding again with the Australian
Sports Commission (ASC) next week, but they've already refused her
twice,'' Hall said.
	   Watt has been ploughing through her savings which peaked in 1992
when she became the first Australian woman to win Olympic gold in
cycling.
	   In Victoria, Canada in 1994 she won three golds at the
Commonwealth Games but she then had a well-publicized fallout with
coach Charlie Walsh.
	   Watt is a go-it-alone-rider, not a team player, and Hall admits
that her confrontations with authority could have cost her
financially.
	   ``She's been blamed for everything she could be blamed for, but
really all she wants is her fair share,'' Hall said.
	   Watt's problems appear to have compounded after she broke from
the Australian Institute of Sport program to ride for a
professional European team this year, making her ineligible for AIS
funding.
	   Cycling association chief executive Graham Fredericks said Watt
had made her decision and denied there was any vindictiveness
towards her.
	   Watt, 34, claimed third place in a stage of the Tour de France
and finished 13th overall and won the national road trials. (djp)

Chinese premier vows to meet three-year reform deadline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Despite financial turmoil abroad and China's
spotty domestic economy, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji has pledged
anew to meet a three-year deadline for revitalizing state
industries, state media reported Monday.
	   Zhu said his Cabinet was determined to shut down unsalvageable
enterprises, see more workers laid off and fire managers of
companies in the red for two years straight, the reports said.
	   The tough talk comes after months of signs that the reform
program Zhu staked his 10-month-old premiership on was slowing.
Glutted markets, lower foreign investment and fears of more layoffs
dampened domestic demand, making reforms more difficult. State
enterprises lost dlrs 37 billion in the first six months of the
year alone, according to official media.
	   A massive state spending program engineered by the State
Council, Zhu's Cabinet, has started to revive economic growth, if
not consumer demand, over the past three months.
	   The premier renewed his pledge during a tour last week of
northeastern Liaoning province, part of the notorious rustbelt of
inefficient heavy industries of command communism. He noted that
some Liaoning enterprises have managed to become profitable.
	   ``If Liaoning, one of the major industrial bases in China, can
realize the objective of reform of state-owned enterprises, the
rest of the country can surely achieve the goal,'' Zhu was quoted
as saying in reports that fronted national newspapers.
	   To help large and medium state enterprises turn around by the
end of 2000, Zhu said the government will spend 8 billion yuan
(dlrs 970 million) to help laid-off workers. He ordered local
governments to set aside budgetary funds next year to aid the
unemployed.
	   Zhu, however, confirmed that at least one aspect of his
ambitious reform program _ the selling of small state enterprises _
has been jettisoned. He said the sales had led to ``great losses''
of state assets and ``that must be stopped.''
	   Small state enterprises were supposed to be a testing ground for
bolder measures under the reform program initially unveiled a year
ago. Local governments were encouraged to try bankruptcies, mergers
and share offerings, in effect privatizing the small enterprises.
	   A sharp increase in urban layoffs _ 15 million people this year
by one government economist's count _ and resistance by more
conservative Communist Party members forced Zhu to scale back the
plan.

Court rejects compensation suit by Dutch ex-POWs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with confirmation of the ruling; court saying human
rights violations had been committed &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Tokyo court on Monday rejected a compensation
suit by eight former Dutch POWs who had been forced into slave
labor by the Japanese army during World War II, lawyers for the
plaintiffs said.
	   The Tokyo District Court conceded that Japan had committed human
rights violations, but ruled that under international law
individuals in wartime compensation cases do not have the right to
sue the government.
	   The plaintiffs had demanded dlrs 176,000 in total from the
Japanese government to compensate for physical abuses suffered in
prisoner camps in the former Dutch East Indies, now Indonesia,
which Japan invaded in the 1940s.
	   The only woman among the plaintiffs sued for being forced into
sexual slavery by Japanese troops.
	   The ruling comes a week after the same court rejected demands
for compensation from seven plaintiffs on behalf of 20,000
ex-prisoners from Britain, the United States, Australia and New
Zealand.
	   The court had turned down compensation demands in last week's
case on the same basis.
	   The Japanese government claims that the issue of compensation
for POWs was resolved in 1951 with the signing of the San Francisco
peace treaty.
	   Japan forced POWs to work in shipyards, mines and jungles in
violation of international law. They were also beaten and some were
executed. Thousands of women across Asia were forced into brothels
for Japanese troops.
	   The POW death rate at the Japanese camps was 27 percent,
compared to a 4 percent rate at Allied camps.

DETROIT: streak snapped.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Flyers 6, Canucks 2 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In Philadelphia, John LeClair scored four goals and Eric Lindros
had four assists as the Philadelphia Flyers beat the Vancouver
Canucks for their sixth win in seven games.
	   LeClair broke a 2-2 tie with 5:07 left with his 17th goal and
third of the game, flicking in a rebound on Eric Lindros' miss.
Less than a minute later, Keith Jones took a pass from Lindros and
onetimed a slap shot past Garth Snow as the Flyers improved to 6-1
after an 0-5-2 winless streak.
	   LeClair, who scored two minutes into the second period and 50
seconds into the third, added his 18th goal with 1:04 left for his
second career four-goal game. The other came on Feb. 6, 1997
against Montreal.
 &UR; Sabres 6, Lightning 3
	   In Tampa, Florida, Michael Peca had two goals and Dominik Hasek
stopped 30 shots as Buffalo beat Tampa Bay, handing the Lightning
their eighth straight loss.
	   Peca's second goal, on a slap shot from the right circle, put
the Sabres up 5-3 with 6:46 left in the third period. Michael
Grosek added a goal with 2:23 to play.
	   Hasek, pulled after one period in Saturday's 6-2 loss at
Florida, was strong throughout despite allowing three goals. The
two-time Hart Trophy winner made several key point-blank stops,
including a sliding poke check during a breakaway by Alex Selivanov
and a nifty glove save on Stephane Richer.
 &UR; Blackhawks 3, Oilers 2
	   In Edmonton, Alberta, right wing Tony Amonte scored his 18th
goal of the season and the Chicago Blackhawks beat the Edmonton
Oilers for their 2,000th franchise win in the NHL.
	   Amonte, who shares the league lead in goals with Philadelphia's
John LeClair, tipped a shot from the point past goalie Mikhail
Shtalenkov at 2:18 of the second period to give Chicago a 3-1 lead.
	   The Blackhawks halted a four-game losing streak, winning for
only the second time in 16 games since Oct. 24.

Australia's trade slides heavily into the red as Asian crisis hits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Strong domestic growth and the Asian
economic crisis combined Monday to produce one of the worst set of
monthly trade figures Australia has ever seen.
	   The government statistician reported that the nation slipped 1.1
billion Australian dollars (U.S. 696 million) into the red on its
goods and services trade account in October, the worse figure since
August 1989.
	   There was also a huge extraordinary item in the latest figures
-- Australia has been importing, melting down and re-exporting vast
amounts of gold from Asian countries this year.
	   That trade has surged as hard-pressed Asians began cashing in
their savings, often held in the form of gold jewelry.
	   Once that is taken into account, Australia's trade performance
in October was probably the worst on record.
	   Treasurer Peter Costello said the latest data confirmed his
prediction that the nation's current account deficit will blow out
to 31 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 19.6 billion) this
financial year.
	   That would be 5.25 percent of the nation's gross domestic
product.
	   The Australian economy grew by 3.9 percent in the 12 months to
the end of June.
	   Costello said the figures had also been affected by low
commodity prices and the loss of Australian markets in Asia, as a
result of the region's economic woes.
	   Australia has offset its losses in Asia by increasing its export
sales to the United States and Europe.
	   But the nation has also been facing some big import bills in
recent months as high domestic produced big orders for a wide range
of consumption goods.

	   In San Diego, John Elway had four first-half turnovers but
finished with a season-high four touchdown passes as Denver
remained unbeaten after 12 games.
	   The Broncos become the fourth team in NFL history to start 12-0

	   The Broncos began the game as AFC West champions, having earned
the title when Oakland lost to Washington earlier in the day. San

Report: Landslide at gold mine kills 16 in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A landslide killed up to 16 people as
they tried to dig out gold illegally from an open cut mine, a news
report said Monday.
	   The newspaper Media Indonesia reported the diggers were working
on Saturday night when tons of rock and mud buried them.
	   Police said four bodies had been recovered but searchers feared
as many as another 12 were still buried.
	   One man was rescued and was hospitalized in a critical
condition.
	   Police said a group of people climbed into the mine's pit under
the cover of darkness, apparently to steal ore at the
government-owned Pongkor mine, near Bogor, about 80 kilometers (50
miles) southeast of Jakarta.
	   Last July a similar accident at the mine also killed 16 people.
	   Authorities complain of a rise in illegal mining by people
willing to risk their lives to beat the effects of Indonesia's
worst economic crisis in 30 years.

Report: China's Internet police step up fight against hackers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's computer police are promoting a new
security system to ward off rising attacks by hackers, the official
China Daily reported Monday.
	   The Ministry of Public Security has approved an anti-hacker
software for use on the most common computer network platforms in
China, the English-language newspaper said.
	   The ministry, charged with keeping the subversive and the
salacious out of the hands of China's computer users, has warned
that networks are vulnerable to attacks. In recent months hackers
have reportedly tampered with government websites and conducted
illegal financial trades.
	   ``China lacks feasible and reliable means to guarantee network
safety,'' the newspaper quoted ministry official Wang Shiduo as
saying.
	   Beixinyuan Automation Technology Ltd., in developing its
anti-hacker system, found that computer networks for 15 companies
in five cities were easy to breach, China Daily said.
	   The report did not say whether Beixinyuan had links to the
Ministry of Public Security, but the police have set up several
companies to develop and market anti-virus software and solutions
for computer network security.
	   Last year, the government put into effect a new criminal code
that for the first time targeted computer crimes.

U.N. chief in Algeria to complete Western Sahara mission
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ U.N. chief Kofi Annan will try this week
to resolve a bitter dispute over the Western Sahara, a vast desert
territory claimed by Morocco and rebels who want independence.
	   Annan arrived Sunday in Algeria. He was to travel to Tindouf in
southwest Algeria to meet with Polisario Front rebels on Monday.
	   Earlier this month, Annan met Morocco's King Hassan II and Prime
Minister Abderrahmane Youssoufi to discuss plans for a referendum
on the Western Sahara.
	   Rival factions are undecided over who is eligible to vote in the
referendum, which could be held next year.
	   The vote would decide the fate of the territory and its
traditionally nomadic population. Morocco is trying to keep the
mineral-rich territory from the Polisario Front, which has been
fighting for autonomy for the region.
	   While in Morocco on Nov. 8, Annan said neighboring countries,
like Mauritania, could contribute to resolving the 23-year dispute.
	   To date, 147,249 people have been declared eligible to take part
in the referendum. But the eligibility of another 65,000 is
contested.

Australian tourism set to grow 1.4 percent over year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Growth in Australia's 42 billion
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 26 million) tourism industry is
expected to stagnate over the next decade because of the Asian
economic crisis.
	   With Asian currencies so low against the Australian dollar, more
Australians are expected to holiday overseas, the Tourism
Forecasting Council predicted Monday.
	   It said growth in travel at home would grow by an average 1.4
percent a year, while outbound travel would grow by an average 4.5
percent a year.
	   ``The industry can expect continued challenging times, however,
the slow growth in the domestic sector is building on what is
already a very large market,'' chairman Frank Moore said in a
statement.
	   The rapidly changing economic conditions in Asia currently had
the largest impact on domestic tourism, Moore said.
	   ``Currency depreciation, particularly the Indonesian rupiah and
the Thai baht, has made these destinations cheaper and more
appealing to Australian travelers,'' he said.
	   About 40 percent of outbound travel from Australia was to Asia,
he said.
	   The Tourism Council Australia said the latest figures followed
research which showed the Sydney 2000 Olympics would probably not
stimulate the national domestic tourism market and highlighted the
need for a campaign to encourage Australians to holiday at home.

Australia needs 64 to win the second test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Jason Gillespie tore through the England
lower order with four wickets in six balls Monday, leaving
Australia needing to score just 64 second-innings runs to win the
second Ashes cricket test.
	   Resuming the day two runs adrift of making Australia bat again,
England was bowled out for 191 10 minutes before the lunch break on
the third day at the WACA.
	   England collapsed after a spirited 91-run stand for the sixth
wicket and lost the last five wickets for 33 runs, four of them for
two runs in successive Gillespie overs.
	   Gillespie, playing his first test since the 1997 Ashes series,
confounded critics with 5-88 after swing bowler Damien Fleming had
done the early work with 4-45.
	   Graeme Hick, on his seventh test comeback, duly completed a
deserving half century, but once he fell to Gillespie, the rest
capitulated leaving Mark Ramprakash unbeaten on 47.
	   Gillespie, who was hit for 23 in an over on the second day,
including 16 by Hick in three balls, had the right hander caught by
Ricky Ponting at third slip for 68 runs.
	   His innings included eight fours and two sixes and lasted 73
balls.
	   After brief 31-run stand between Ramprakash and Dominic Cork
(16), Gillespie pinned the latter in front of the stumps.
	   Two balls later debutant Alex Tudor offered Ian Healy a catch
behind and off the next ball, Darren Gough played half forward and
was trapped leg before wicket.
	   Gillespie, on a hat trick in his next over, was thwarted by
Ramprakash, who pushed a single and exposing No. 11 Alan Mullally.
	   A low full toss to Mullally hit the base of the stumps and
England was all out.

Strong earthquake kills at least six people in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New thruout to RAISE death toll to six, UPDATE with fears that
more might be trapped in factory wreckage. &QL; 
 &UR; By IRWAN FIRDAUS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A powerful earthquake struck a small,
remote island in eastern Indonesia at night, killing at least six
people, and volunteers spent the day Monday searching through
damaged buildings and landslides for survivors.
	   Fearing aftershocks, hundreds of people on Mangole Island ran to
the safety of a soccer field after the magnitude-6.5 quake struck
Sunday night.
	   Local police Sgt. Yopi Sariwating said five were killed when the
roof of a plywood factory collapsed.
	   The official Antara news agency quoted factory executives as
saying more of workers might still be trapped in the wreckage.
	   A local government official, who identified himself by the
single name of Karim, said the body of a sixth victim had also been
located. He gave no further details.
	   Antara said at least 15 people were seriously injured.
	   Many homes and buildings on the island of about 9,000 people
were damaged. Witnesses said large cracks had appeared in the
streets of the main town, Dofa, and elsewhere.
	   ``People are now gathering in a football field. There was a lot
of panic. They are too afraid to sleep because there might be
aftershocks,'' Sariwating said by telephone.
	   The search for casualties was continuing on the island about
1,900 kilometers (1,180 miles) east of Indonesia's capital,
Jakarta.
	   Volunteers on Monday were at the sites of several landslides
around the island amid fears that some people might have buried.
	   One landslide destroyed a small fishing port, police said.
Electricity supplies had been cut and telecommunications with the
island were patchy.
	   Indonesia's Meteorological and Geophysics Agency said the quake
had a magnitude of 6.5.
	   It struck at 10:10 p.m. Eastern Indonesia Time (1410 GMT) Sunday
and was centered beneath the Maluku Sea, about 230 miles (370
kilometers) south of the city of Manado on the island of Sulawesi,
the agency said.
	   Earlier, the U.S. Geological Survey in Washington said the quake
had a preliminary magnitude of 7.6.
	   The geological survey issued a tsunami warning for the Western
Pacific.
	   In Japan, the Meteorological Agency issued a tsunami alert along
the nation's Pacific coast stretching about 1,115 miles from
Okinawa state to Tokyo. But no major waves were observed in Japan
and the agency lifted the alert a little more than two hours later.
	   Mangole, an island dominated by the timber industry, is part of
the Maluku archipelago. The earthquake was felt on neighboring
islands, but no damage was reported.
	   In December 1992, a magnitude-7 earthquake caused a tsunami that
killed about 2,500 people on nearby Flores island.
	   More than 2,000 people were killed in July when a tsunami hit
the northern coast of neighboring Papua New Guinea.
	   Earthquakes are common in Indonesia, which lies astride the
so-called Pacific ``Ring of Fire'' _ a line of volcanically active
areas that stretches from Central America and the western coast of
North America across to Japan, Southeast Asia, the South Pacific
and New Zealand.
	   A magnitude-6 quake can cause severe damage if centered beneath
a heavily populated area, while a magnitude-7 quake can cause
widespread, heavy damage.
