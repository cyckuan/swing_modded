<HEADLINE> Chrysler Introduces New Plastic Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Chrysler Motor Co., the third
largest car maker of the U.S., is close to turn out a plastic car
body that needs no paint and could halve the price of a car.
</P>
<P>
Using common beverage bottle plastic called PET -- for
polyethylene terephthalate -- the automaker has been able to
fabricate body parts big enough that a car body could consist of
just six pieces instead of 80 or so, according to a report of the
USA Today Monday.
</P>
<P>
Color is molded throughout the plastic. That eliminates the
need for a car factory's costly, slow-paced painting process.
</P>
<P>
The paint shop is the largest single expense of building a
factory, and a bottleneck that slows production, it is said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that eliminating painting, expensive metal
stamping and forming, and gluing together six body pieces instead
of welding dozens, could cut manufacturing costs enough that a PET
car could be half the price of a conventional vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Building a PET factory could cost as little as one-third the 1
billion U.S. dollar cost of building a conventional car factory.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler says that the car would be as safe in a crash as other
cars it sells, and it is developing special techniques that would
let body shops repair minor damage cheaply and easily.
</P>
<P>
Plastic-bodied cars would use conventional metal chassis, but
Chrysler's plastic car bodies does not require a steel skeleton as
other factories often use, thus making the car bodies lighter and
less expensive.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the company is planning a PET car in 2003.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Hits High of 132.9 Yen in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar hit a high of
132.9 yen in Tokyo late Monday, reaching the 132 yen level for the
first time since May 1992.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency was quoted at 132.83-86 yen at 5 p.m.local
time, up from 132.07-10 yen at 9 a.m. in Tokyo and from 132.30-40
yen late Friday in New York.
</P>
<P>
The dollar mostly held steady in the 132 yen level, backed by
lower Tokyo stock prices and the weak Southeast Asian currencies,
dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The key Nikkei average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section at the Tokyo Stock Exchange finished the half-day session
below the psychologically important 15,000 point line, falling
more than 300 points to 14,956.84.
</P>
<P>
The persistent weakness of Southeast Asian currencies also
helped the dollar-buying mood against the yen, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
One dealer at a Japanese bank said that the Japanese yen would
probably continue to face selling pressure unless the government
implements further strong measures to boost the domestic economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Austrian and Finnish
governments have offered to host the Northern Ireland peace talks
on neutral ground, according to Irish government sources.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern was quoted
by Reuters as saying today: "There is nothing in writing, but
Austria and Finland have offered to host the talks."
</P>
<P>
"As far as I understand the invitations are open-ended," the
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland peace process has run into fresh
difficulties as violence broke out in late December when a
hardline loyalist Billy Wright was killed in a high-security
Belfast prison.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, Loyalist groups have staged several attacks
upon Catholic districts of Belfast, killing two people.
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister Ahern, as a co-sponsor of the peace talks,
said that it was time to take big steps in pushing forward the
peace talks, according to a report in the Irish Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"I do believe, despite all the atrocities and all the terrible
deeds over the last week, there is a real opportunity now to make
significant progress in the early months of 1998," Ahern said.

<P>
CANBERRA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- South Africa took a revenge of
the defending United States in a comeback 2-1 win in the Hopman
Cup tennis international mixed teams tournament Monday night in
Perth, Australia.
</P>
<P>
Wayne Ferreira and Amanda Coetzer reversed the results of last
year's final to steal the honor from the American pair of Jonathan
Stark and Chanda Rubin.
</P>
<P>
World No. 30th Rubin proved her domination of the South African
rival when she upset Coetzer 6-4, 6-3, as she did a year ago.
</P>
<P>
And the United States were clearly on the way of a nice start
for their bid for reigning the title when Stark led with a 6-3
first-game win in the following men's single.
</P>
<P>
But the third seeded South Africa steered up an astonishing
comeback and turn around the table.
</P>
<P>
Ferreira, ranked 43rd in the world and 52 places higher than
his opponent, won the next two game, 6-3, 6-4, and teamed up
Coetzer to stun the American dual 6-2, 5-7, 6-1 in the deciding
mixed doubles.
</P>
<P>
A total of eight teams will compete in two groups with a
round-robin format in the warm-up event for the Open.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Levy's Quit will not Affect Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Monday
said the resignation of Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy
should not affect the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The Middle East peace process has always continued in its
sometimes measured way despite internal political developments
affecting the government of Israel," White House spokesman Mike
McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
Levy announced his decision of resignation on Sunday after a
dispute with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over social
policy and the peace process. His move has reduced Netanyahu's
Likud-led ruling coalition to a one-vote majority in the
Knesset, the Israeli parliament.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said that "individuals and the role individual
cabinet members play in the process change from time to time but
the process continues."
</P>
<P>
The White House on Sunday announced that President Bill
Clinton will meet Netanyahu in Washington on Jan. 20 and then
hold talks two days later with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
in an attempt to revitalize the Middle East peace process that
all but died last year because of Israel's decision to build
Jewish housing units in Arab East Jerusalem in March.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev said here Monday the economic and political reforms in
his country achieved positive results in 1997.
</P>
<P>
As shown by statistics, Nazarbayev told a ceremony for the
opening of a university, Kazakhstan's gross domestic product (GDP)
grew 2.5 percent in 1997 to reach per capita 1,500 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The GDP growth is recognized by the World Bank as among the
highest in the Commonwealth of Independent States, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the annual inflation in the country stood at 12
percent, significantly lower than the government's projection of
17.5 percent, and savings by Kazakh residents rose 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
And of the total 6.2 billion dollars direct foreign investment
in Kazakhstan over the past five years, 1.7 billion dollars came
into the country in 1997, the president said.
</P>
<P>
As a market economy has taken shape, he said, it would serve as
a solid foundation for the country's further economic growth and
the implementation of its long-term development strategy.

<HEADLINE> Mail-bomber Trial to Begin in California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The trial of former math
professor Theodore Kaczynski, accused of serial killings with
mail-bombs over an 18-year period, is set to open Monday in
Sacramento, California, where police say the suspect killed two
people.
</P>
<P>
In the Sacramento trial Kaczynski is charged in a 10-count
indictment covering only four of the 16 bombings attributed to the
Unabomber -- so named by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
because his first victims were from universities and airlines.
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to present evidence trying to link
the defendant to all the bombings, which killed three people and
injured 29, news reports said.
</P>
<P>
At the height of the bombing campaign in 1995, the mysterious
terrorist held the nation hostage, disrupting air travel and
postal deliveries.
</P>
<P>
In April 1996, alerted by Kaczynski's brother, federal
authorities arrested the suspect in a Montana cabin.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Fuel Facilities Project Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Construction work on the
Sapugaskanda fuel facilities, to be carried out by a Chinese
company, was officially inaugurated in the northern suburb of the
capital city Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan Irrigation and Power Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte and
Chinese Chemical Industry Minister Gu Xiulian, who arrived here
last Friday at the invitation of President Chandrika Kumaratunga
and Ratwatte, attended the inauguration ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Under the construction project, the China Huanqiu Chemical
Engineering Corporation (HQCEC) is to build a mini-terminal and
some oil tanks for the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC).
</P>
<P>
The CPC will use a soft loan of 24 million U.S. dollars
provided by the Asian Development Bank to fund the project, the
costs of which have been estimated at around 21 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Besides helping construct the facilities, the HQCEC will also
rehabilitate other tanks which were damaged by the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam in nearby CPC oil facilities on October 20,
1995.
</P>
<P>
Ratwatte said at the ceremony that China and Sri Lanka have a
long history of cooperation in economic and cultural fields and he
hoped such cooperation could continue.
</P>
<P>
Gu Xiulian said the start of the construction work marked a
good beginning of the cooperation between the Chinese chemical
industry and the Sri Lankan energy industry.
</P>
<P>
HQCEC President He Lishan, whose company beat all the other 86
international bidders to become the sole contractor of the
project, assured the Sri Lankan side that his company will finish
the project ahead of schedule with high quality and low costs.
</P>
<P>
The construction will take about 22 months to finish.

<HEADLINE> France Calls for Protection of Algerians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- France Monday urged the Algerian
government to protect "the legitimate right" of the Algerian
people while condemning the newest "terrorist crimes" committed
against the civilians of the country.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time France has openly addressed the Algerian
government, in whose regime massacres of civilians are reported
almost every day.
</P>
<P>
Four hundred Algerians were reportedly killed from Tuesday
night to Wednesday morning, the first day of the Muslim fasting
month of Ramadan, in Relizane, of western Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The French address came one day after Germany asked the
European Union (EU) to call for an emergency meeting on Algeria
and suggested that the EU send a delegation to Algeria to discuss
with the Algerian government measures the EU can take to help
fight Islamic militants there.
</P>
<P>
"The duty of all governments is to allow its citizens to live
in peace and in security," said French Foreign Ministry spokesman
Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
The newest violence perpetuated by Islamic militants, Doutriaux
said, "cannot find any justification, and above all religious."
</P>
<P>
"The French authorities are deeply upset and angered by the
acts of savageness and barbarity which have once again struck the
Algerian people at the moment when they are celebrating the
Ramadan," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Doutriaux described the German proposal "a good idea" and
expressed support to "all initiatives susceptible of manifesting
the solidarity of the international community with the Algerian
people."
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that France "attaches the greatest
importance" to providing aid to the families of the victims of
massacres and to "what allows promote a peaceful and democratic
solution to the crisis in Algeria."

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1.8 million teenage
girls fell pregnant and aborted in Lusaka alone in the past three
years, the Zambia Association on Teenage Pregnancies and
Awareness has said.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia News Agency today quoted Chairperson of the
association Tamba Chinyembe as saying at the weekend that the
girls are mostly in the age group of between 12 and 21 years and
most of them live in high density townships of the capital city
with a population of about 250,000.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the girls have a poverty background which forces
their parents to marry off their daughters soon after puberty,
she said.
</P>
<P>
She said a survey by the association shows that most of the
girls are now aborting or having plenty of children they are
unable to look after.
</P>
<P>
Most of the girls have been going to the Matero Referral
Clinic for specialist treatment especially when they attempt
abortions, she said.
</P>
<P>
The association plans to start an education campaign in these
townships to teach teenagers on the dangers of unplanned
pregancies and abortions.
</P>
<P>
Chinyembe said the organization will call for in its campaign
reproductive health methods such as contraceptives to protect
health of the girls.

<HEADLINE> British Economy may experience Sharp Downturn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The prospect of a sharp downturn
in the British economy during 1998 is underscored by leading
forecasters.
</P>
<P>
This would be a result of high interest rates, an over-valued
sterling and the British government's tight fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
The forecasts were released on Monday by the National Institute
of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), Oxford Economic
Forecasting (OEF) and Cambridge Econometrics.
</P>
<P>
Their forecasts suggest that the economy could face another
boom-bust ride. Annual growth is projected to fall from around 3.5
per cent in 1997 to close to 2 per cent in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
If the projections prove correct, Britain will have the slowest
growth rate of all 15 EU members in 1998 after enjoying some of
the best growth conditions in previous years.
</P>
<P>
Cambridge Econometrics forecasts growth to fall to 2.5 per cent
this year, adding that further steep reductions will occur in
1999.
</P>
<P>
OEF predicts that base rates, currently at 7.25 per cent, will
rise again before falling back to about 6.75 per cent by the end
of 1998 and 6.25 per cent by mid-1999.
</P>
<P>
The Oxford forecaster says: "The turmoil in Asia is likely to
have a bigger impact on the UK than generally acknowledged.
Including Japan, Asia accounts for 11.5 per cent of UK exports and
3.5 per cent of gross domestic product."
</P>
<P>
It warns that if the continuing turmoil in Asia triggers a
worldwide collapse in share prices, Britain's growth prospect
could fall to just 1.5 per cent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The strength of the pound is also highlighted by Cambridge
Econometrics which is relatively optimistic about UK's economy in
1998.
</P>
<P>
The forecasters expect Britain's current account to swing from
2.5 billion pounds (4 billion U.S. dollars) surplus in 1997 to a
deficit of almost 6 billion pounds (9.6 billion U.S. dollars) this
year and 7 billion pounds (11.2 billion U.S. dollars) in 1999.
</P>
<P>
They also warn the danger that the Bank of England may prove
reluctant to bring interest rates down again quickly enough during
the course of this year as the slowdown becomes evident.

BRUSSELS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, has decided to grant an
emergency aid worth 7.15 million ECUs (about 8.5 million U.S.
dollars) to Niger, it was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
The food aid of 3.75 million ECUs (approximately 4.5 million

for the most disadvantaged population groups in the country, the
Commission said in a press release issued here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The other part of the aid package will be used for aid
management and the activities of the Food-Producing Office of
Niger, a local organization in charge of food aid management.
</P>
<P>
The EU has been making efforts to solve the chronic food crisis
in Niger, the Commission said, adding that it made the decision
because the national security stock of Niger has been used up.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Airspace at Risk, Say Controllers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's dismissed air traffic
controllers today said that the government is putting the country's
airspace at risk by engaging Zambian controllers who have been
undergoing training in Zimbabwe since December 23.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Air Traffic Controllers Association of Zimbabwe
(ATCAZ) said in a statement that the situation in civil aviation is far
from normal despite contrary claims by the government.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Zambians' qualifications are far below
those required for local air traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
"The Zambian airspace itself is internationally blacklisted
because of inadequate and non-standard training of controllers, the
high number of aircraft incidents and poor state of equipment," the
ATCAZ said.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government dismissed 67 air traffic controllers in
December last year after they started a strike to protest poor
working conditions and salaries.
</P>
<P>
The association said the government had already
authorized that the Zambian controllers be allowed to start operating
after only two weeks training.
</P>
<P>
"Local and more experienced controllers are taking an average of
18 months to reach the required standards of proficiency," the ATCAZ
said.
</P>
<P>
The association denied claims by the government authorities that
they had sabotaged the civil aviation equipment.

HANOI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investments in Vietnam
were down from 9.20 billion U.S. dollars in 1996 to 5.55 billion
in 1997, the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Vietnam granted licences to 336 direct foreign
investment projects worth over 4.45 billion dollars, and permitted
143 existing projects to bring in 1.1 billion more, the MPI said.
</P>
<P>
Of the contracted capital inflow, 2.95 billion dollars was
disbursed in the year, a 34 percent annual increase, or the
highest since the foreign investment law was enacted 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Investments in Vietnam's manufacturing, construction and

<HEADLINE> U.S. Construction Spending Declines in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The nation-wide construction
spending fell 0.9 percent in November, the worst decline in 11
months last year, the Commerce Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The decline, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 609
billion U.S. dollars, was recorded following four consecutive
increases, the report said.
</P>
<P>
October's increase, previously estimated at a slight 0.1
percent, was revised to a sharp 1.4 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
The spending decrease in November was led by a 3.8 percent
decline in non-residential commercial construction to a rate of
158.7 billion dollars. Meanwhile, spending on hotels, offices,
hospitals and shopping centers all declined. It was the sector's
third drop in four months.
</P>
<P>
Government construction fell 0.5 percent to a rate of 140.6
billion dollars. However, spending on highways and streets shot up
10.7 percent to an all-time high. But public housing and
redevelopment, schools, public hospitals and water and sewer
systems all declined.
</P>
<P>
Housing construction increased 0.9 percent to a rate of 268.6
billion dollars. An increase in single-family construction to a
record high and a rise in remodeling spending offset a drop in
apartment construction.

LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The London International
Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) traded a record of
209.42 million contracts in 1997, an increase of 25 percent over
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Average daily volume amounted to 827,769 futures and options
contracts, representing a daily nominal turnover of 178.8 billion
pounds (about 300 billion U.S. dollars), according to statistics
released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the record year, Chairman Jack Wigglesworth of
LIFFE said "LIFFE's position as Europe's premier exchange, with
the broadest range of contracts, meant that it was able to meet
increased demand for risk management instruments arising from
uncertainties over European Economic and Monetary Union and the
turbulence in the Far East."
</P>
<P>
This resulted in LIFFE overtaking the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange to become the world's second largest futures and options
exchange for the first time in its history, he added.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' Trade Deficit Up in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' trade deficit in the
first eight months of 1997 amounted to 826.6 million Cyprus pounds
(about 1.65 billion U.S. dollars), a 4.2 percent increase over the
same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued today by the Cypriot Department of
Statistics and Research, total imports from January to August in
1997 valued at 1.25 billion Cyprus pounds (2.5 billion dollars)
compared with 1.2 billion pounds (around 2.45 billion dollars) in
the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The country's total exports decreased to 424.6 million pounds
(849.2 million dollars) in comparison with 432.7 million pounds
(865.4 million dollars) in the first eight months of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that the European Union (EU) countries'
export to Cyprus valued at 583.1 million pounds (1.17 billion
dollars) during the period, accounting for 46.6 percent of the
total imports of this island nation.
</P>
<P>
For Cyprus' export, the EU countries absorbed 50.4 percent of
the total in the first eight months of 1997, followed by the Arab
countries with 27.3 percent, while in the 1996 January-August
period, the shares of the EU countries and the Arab countries were
59.8 percent and 17.9 percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Send Observer to Turkey-Israel-US Wargame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Despite wide criticism from other
Arab countries, Jordan decided today to send one observer for the
upcoming navy exercises in the Mediterranean which involve troops
from Turkey, Israel and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs Fayez Tarawneh today confirmed to
reporters that Jordan would not participate in the wargame
scheduled for January 7, but send there one observer instead.
</P>
<P>
Top navy officer Hussein Hasawneh will leave Amman later today
on such a mission, Tarawneh said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Arab countries' criticism against Jordan's
involvement in the exercises, Tarawneh said that Jordan made the
decision in order to defend its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The wargame did not have a combating role and Jordan treated it
as exercises for research and rescue, he said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey said earlier that the exercises were open to all the
Arab countries, but only Jordan has responded positively to its
invitation up to now.
</P>
<P>
The exercises, which are widely thought to target Syria and
Iraq, have been drawing harsh criticism from the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Syria and Iraq are spearheading an Arab campaign
against the growing military cooperation between Turkey and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkish Ambassador to Jordan Ahmet Suha Omar earlier
told semi-official Jordan Times that the wargame was "merely
rescue and search exercises ... for humanitarian reasons only."
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel started their military cooperation in 1996
when the two countries signed two military cooperation
agreements. The two sides are discussing several defense-related
projects.
</P>
<P>
After Jordan signed a peace agreement with Israel in 1994, the
two countries have conducted one joint military drill.

<HEADLINE> Arab Interior Ministers Condemn Violence, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Arab Interior Ministers
Council today strongly condemned all forms of violence and
terrorism whatever their sources.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here at the end of the council's 15th
session, which began Sunday, the council said that such terrorist
activities constitute a grave threat to security, stability and
human rights.
</P>
<P>
It also expressed deep anxiety about the mounting acts of
violence and terrorism, emphasizing that such acts ought to be
confronted with appropriate and coordinated measures among all
countries.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed the need to enhance effective inter-Arab
security action in order to maintain the security and stability of
the Arab nation as well as the territorial integrity of Arab
states.
</P>
<P>
It speld out the necessity of distinguishing between terrorism
and the right of world peoples to fight by all means for the
liberation of their lands, in accordance with U.N. principles and
international laws.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the statement called upon those countries, in
which terrorist elements or groups reside, to deny them the right
to take refuge, to obtain funds or arms, or to practice any
criminal or propaganda activities that threaten the security and
safety of the Arab states.
</P>
<P>
It also urged those countries to promote security and judicial
cooperation with the Arab states, including the handing of
criminals, thus, enhancing effective confrontation and eradication
of terrorist activities.

<HEADLINE> World Oil Prices Expected to Be Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The oil prices for 1998 will
relatively remain stable due to possible increases of supply of
oil producing countries.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported today that the surge in economic
growth in recent years has led to increasing demand for oil, a
trend that is expected to gain strength this year.
</P>
<P>
Big oil producers, particularly the Persian Gulf nations that
dominate the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, are
expected to play an even greater role than usual in determining
supply and prices, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
In November, OPEC members agreed to raise their overall
production ceiling to 27.5 million barrels a day, from 25 million
barrels, it said. The increase will not really add supply,
however, because some countries have already been cheating on
their production quotas, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The world production of oil in 1997 was estimated to be 64.94
million barrels a day, an increase of 2.6 percent over the
previous year. In the meantime, the amount turned out by OPEC
members reached 26.95 million barrels, up 3.9 percent, according
to the lastest statistics published by the Oil &AMP; Gas Journal.
</P>
<P>
The amount of oil that will actually be available will depend
much on Middle East politics, and particularly on Saudi Arabia,
whose production quota has increased the most. Saudi Arabia will
now be allowed to pump up to 800,000 more barrels of oil a day to
help meet the 75 million to 76 million barrels a day that are
expected to be needed this year -- up about 2 million barrels a
day from 1997.
</P>
<P>
Other factors pointing to the possibility of higher prices will
include the inability of producers to make substantial additions
to its reserves and growing shortages of increasingly costly
drilling equipment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, demand for gasoline has increased -- particularly in
the United States, it said.
</P>
<P>
All the guess about the course of oil prices will be
meaningless, however, if another big producer -- Iraq -- is
allowed to return fully to the world market by the United Nations,
according to analysts.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Calls for Independence From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
today called on the Zambians to be self-reliant to defend his
country's sovereignty, Zambia News Agency Zana reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the supporters of the ruling Movement for
Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) in the State House, Chiluba said that
the Zambians must be self-reliant instead of depending on donors
for all the resources.
</P>
<P>
"We will not enjoy our sovereignty if we depend on donors even for
salaries," said the president.
</P>
<P>
He strongly criticized some African and Western donors since they
interfered wantonly in Zambia's internal affairs and wanted to
dictated terms to the MMD government.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba's remarks came after foreign leaders tried to push his
government to release the detained former president and opposition
leader Kenneth Kaunda who is allegedly to be involved in the country
abortive military coup last October.
</P>
<P>
During his speech, Chiluba also warned foreign media that they
should portray the "positive" development taking success in the country
instead of always depicting the bad side.
</P>
<P>
He noted that despite the bottle necks in the implementation of
development programs, the government has scored successes in a
number of programs like the privatization of the mines and road
construction and rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
The former trade union leader, who came to power in 1991 and was
re-elected in 1996, also appealed to investors to come and invest into
the country where natural resources for agriculture and other
activities are in abundance.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Try Suspected Israeli Spy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Higher State Security Court of
Egypt today ordered an Egyptian accused of spying for Israel to be
remanded in custody for 45 extra days before putting him on trial,
the Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Samir Othman, 47, was arrested one and a half year ago in Taba,
about 360 kilometers southeast of Cairo, where he worked, on
charges of transferring military information to the Israeli
intelligence agency Mossad.
</P>
<P>
Now that this is the last renewal of the custody period, the
Higher State Security Prosecution is expected to issue an
indictment sheet within days in preparation for his trial.
</P>
<P>
Othman's papers had been referred to the Military Prosecution,
but were sent back to the State Security Prosecution. MENA gave
the reason as that the military information stolen by the
defendant is old and therefore he should stand trial before a
civil court.
</P>
<P>
The trial came five months after the same court sentenced Azam
Azam, an Israeli textile engineer accused of spying for Israel, to
15 years in prison last August.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that Azam's Egyptian colleague, Emad Abdel
Hamid, be imprisoned for life in the same case.
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old Azam and 34-year-old Hamid, arrested in
November, 1996, had pleaded innocence to charges of spying for the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab country to have a peace treaty with
Israel but ties have never been warm. The spy cases, however,
added to the tensions caused by the Mideast peace deadlock.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Inflation Rate Falls to Single Digit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria said it has successfully
curbed price increases and brought the inflation rate to 8.5
percent by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The single digit inflation rate compared to 72.8 percent in
december 1995 and 29 percent in 1996, said Head of State General
Sani Abacha, who presented the government 1998 budget last night.
</P>
<P>
In his review of the 1997 budget, Abacha said the positive
developments in the country's economy were also reflected in the
largely stable exchange rate of national currency, reduced
foreign debt stock and increased foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, Nigeria recorded a foreign debt stock of
27 billion U.S. dollars, a drop of one billion from one year
earlier, while foreign exchange reserves surged 88.4 percent
year-on-year to 7.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the government failed to meet the set goal for
economic growth in 1997, although "marked improvement" had been
made.
</P>
<P>
In a nationwide broadcast, Abacha said the estimated growth
rate of Gross Domestic Product was 3.77 percent, lower than the
target of 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector also recorded a decline from 1.02
percent in 1996 to 0.72 percent in 1997, despite a slight
improvement in capacity utilization, from 32.5 percent to 33
percent.
</P>
<P>
Abacha did not explain why the government failed to achieve
the growth target, but analysts attributed the failure partly to
the late disbursement of capital votes to the ministries and the
continued serious feul scarcity in the past year.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the 1998 budget, abacha said the growth target this
year is set at 5.5 percent and the average annual growth rate
between 1998 and 2000 will be 6.19 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
decided to hold annual nationwide surveys starting this year on
the quality of the National Health Service (NHS) treatment as part
of an initiative to raise standards, local press reports said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time such audit of the NHS will
be conducted in history.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a random sample of up to 100,000
patients will be questioned on the quality of food, the
use of painkillers after operations, the standard of
nursing care and how well they were treated by their
family doctors and consultants.
</P>
<P>
Survey results will be published every year on a health
authority basis, to show the best and worst services
offered by health authorities.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed to force an improvement in standards
and also reflects the growing move by the public and
private sector to treat patients as customers and clients
using a service, rather than people who should be grateful
for doctors sparing the time to see them.

opened Monday evening with Air Afrique a weekly special line to

Brazzaville was almost destroyed in the five-month civil war

<P>
Air France said that the flight to Brazzaville will resume as

</P>
<P>
The company can only use Airbus 320 passenger planes carrying
120 passengers each, because of the space and other restrictions
of the Pointe-Noire airport.
</P>
<P>
The limit of flight distance of Airbus 320 also requires the
plane to make a stopover in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, said the

<HEADLINE> Jordan's FM: Levy's Resignation to Affect Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The resignation of Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy will adversely affect the Middle East peace
process, Jordanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Fayez Tarawneh told
reporters today.
</P>
<P>
Levy's resignation Sunday will create a crisis in the Israeli
government and give Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu new excuses
for not implementing the agreements already signed with the
Palestinians, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Such a resignation may delay the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process for six months or even longer, Tarawneh said.
</P>
<P>
When he announced his resignation Sunday, Levy bitterly
denounced the 19-month-old Netanyahu government for both
abandoning the peace process with the Arabs and ignoring the
mounting problems of Israel's poor and unemployed people.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks suffered setbacks since
Israel began construction of Jewish settlements in controversial
Arab East Jerusalem in March, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks on the Lebanese and Syrian tracks were also
stalemated due to Netanyahu government's hardline policy.

a further period of six months until July 15, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report to the Security Council, Annan said in
accordance with resolution 1119, UNMOP continues to monitor the
demilitarization of the Prevlaka Peninsula and of the
neighboring areas in Croatia and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General said the situation in the UNMOP area of
responsibility has remained stable, occasional violations of the
demilitarization regime were fewer in number and of lesser
significance than similar violations reported in the past.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said Croatia and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia have continued to reiterate their firm commitment
to a negotiated resolution of the disputed issue of Prevlaka in
accordance with their agreement on Normalization of Relations.
</P>
<P>
Annan said but substantive negotiations have not started and
Croatian and Yugoslav officials have held out no prospect of an
end to the long-term violations in the United Nations controlled
zone.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said these provide a constant irritant in the
relations between UNMOP and the local authorities, a irritant
which should be removed.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-General said UNMOP has played an essential role
in maintaining conditions conducive to negotiations, and recent
developments at other parts of the border between Croatia and
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia raise the hope that the two
countries can solve the disputed issue of Prevlaka through
mutual negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Secretary-General recommended a further
six-month extension of UNMOP mandate until July 15, 1998.
</P>
<P>
UNMOP consists of 28 United Nations military observers headed
by a Chief Military Observer. The current mandate of the mission
expires on January 15, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Not to Seek Delay in Opening Border with Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Germany Monday denied that it wants
to delay implementing the open-border Schengen agreement with
Italy for fear that the Kurdish refugees who are streaming into
Italy from Turkey would finally slip into Germany.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of some 1,200 mostly Kurdish refugees in southern
Italian coast in the last two weeks has sparked growing alarm in
Europe, especially Germany, over a possible new immigration wave.
</P>
<P>
Police chiefs from France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the
Netherlands and Turkey are due to meet in Rome on Thursday to
discuss measures to stop the influx of Kurdish refugees.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the German Interior Ministry said that Germany
would press at the police conference for stricter adherence with
the Schengen agreement and tighter control of European external
borders.
</P>
<P>
Germany would not seek a temporary delay in implementing the
Schengen agreement under which the German-Italian border controls
would be phased out by this Spring, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, German Interior Minister Manfred Kanther
reiterated his call on Italy to tighten border controls and take
considerable tougher measures against illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
Kanther also said that Germany had already reinforced police
forces at its southern border and would send back those immigrants
who slipped illegally into Germany.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Limits Emissions to Reduce Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Himalayan kingdom of Nepal
has set the limits for vehicular emissions with a view to reducing
pollution in the country, particularly in the Kathmandu Valley,
the official RSS news agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the limits set by the Transport Management Department,
emissions produced by four-wheel petrol-running vehicles
manufactured before 1980 should not contain more than 4.5 percent
of carbon monoxide and those manufactured after 1991 not more than
three percent.
</P>
<P>
Emissions by three wheelers and two wheelers manufactured after
1991 should not contain more than 4.5 percent of carbon monoxide.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, emissions by diesel-running vehicles manufactured
before 1994 should not contain more than 75 smoke units and those
manufactured after 1995 not more than 65 units.
</P>
<P>
The limits will come into force from January 14 for four-wheel
vehicles and from mid-July for two wheelers.
</P>
<P>
Vehicular emissions, among others, are blamed for the
deteriorating environment in the Kathmandu Valley, which has the
lion's share of the vehicles in the country.
</P>
<P>
The year of 1998 has been designated as the Visit Nepal Year by

BONN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Germany Monday rejected a Greek
court ruling which demands compensation for victims of a wartime
massacre carried out by German troops, the German press agency DPA
reported.
</P>
<P>
A parliament statement said Bonn will not recognize the verdict
of the Greek state court in Levadia, stressing the government
position that such court cases contradict the immunity of state
principle and are not permissible.
</P>

The Greek court decided that the German government should pay
60 million marks (33 million U.S. dollars) in compensation to the
families of people killed by German troops in a June 1944
massacre.
</P>
<P>
The government holds that questions of reparations should not
be justified 50 years after the end of the Second World War, the
statement said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Speaker Says Israeli Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese House Speaker Nabih
Berri said today that an Israeli proposal to withdraw its troops
from Lebanon is conditional, and therefore is "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Berri made the remark during his meeting with a visiting
U.S. delegation of congressmen. He said that the U.N. Security
Council resolution 425 stipulates that Israel unconditionally
withdraw its troops from south Lebanon and Bekaa valley.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai told an
Arabic language publication that his country was prepared to
implement the resolution provided agreement is reached with
Lebanon to meet Israel's security demands.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in the past more than 10 years that
Israel officially accepted the resolution. On Sunday, a statement
from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office confirmed
the defense minister's comments.
</P>
<P>
Berri said that Netanyahu's proposal is not new as long as he
links withdrawal with any condition, adding that his pure purpose
is to separate the Syrian track in the Middle East peace talks
from the Lebanese track.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 to protect its northern border towns from across
border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' Economy to Show Improvement in 1998: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' economy is expected to
show an improvement in 1998, with a good prospect for tourism on
the island.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey jointly conducted by Cyprus'
Planning Bureau, the Central Bank and weekly newspaper Financial
Mirror, bankers and economists forecast a growth rate of 4 to 4.5
percent for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The rosy projections are based on the good performance of the
island's economy in the second half of last year.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Cypriot Finance Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou
said the economic growth rate has increased from one percent in
the first half of 1997 to 4 percent in the second half and is
expected to reach 4.5 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the revival of the economy which started in
May last year is steadily continuing with its main driving force
being tourism, offshore and other services sectors.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists visiting the island rose 8 percent for
the May-October period of last year, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Tourism, one of the main sources of income for this island
nation, accounted for nearly 20 percent of the country's gross
domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Most economists forecast that the total number of tourist
arrivals in 1998 will reach 2.1 million to 2.23 million, with
foreign exchange earnings climbing to 1.6 billion to 1.67 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
With regard to other indicators, economists believe inflation
this year will be maintained at 1997 level and unemployment rate
will become slightly lower.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Christodoulou has said that inflation and
unemployment for 1997 would be estimated at 3.5 percent and 3.3
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Local economists, however, point out that good prospects for
Cyprus' economy will be based on the condition that there are no
adverse developments on the island in 1998.
</P>
<P>
They noted that there are some destabilizing factors in the new
year, including the arrival by mid-summer of the Russian-made
anti-aircraft missiles. Turkey has warned that it will launch a
preemptive strike to destroy them before they are deployed.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Approves 1998 State Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Despite of the deepening
crisis in the coalition government, Israeli Knesset (parliament)
today approved the 1998 state budget of 207 billion shekels
(about 59 billion U.S. dollars.)
</P>
<P>
In the final third reading of the budget, the coalition
defeated the opposition by a vote of 58 to 52, with one
abstention. And in the second reading early this afternoon, the
coalition also won all the votes on the accompanying arrangements
bill of the budget.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister David Levy, who submitted his resignation
Sunday and caused an earthquake in the political spectrum of
Israel, voted against the budget with three colleagues of his
Gesher party.
</P>
<P>
However, other coalition factions and Moledet party, whose
demands related to the budget have been met by Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, today gave strong backing to Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The vote on the budget, which should have been concluded on
December 31, 1997, was delayed in a bid to buy time for
Netanyahu to win the support of Levy by meeting his demands on
allocating more resources to the developing towns and
disadvantaged neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
Although Netanyahu failed to win Levy's support, he
successfully overcame the first hurdle today after his government
was seriously weakened by the departure of five-member Gesher
party, which left the coalition in a bare majority of 61 in
the 120-seat Knesset.
</P>
<P>
In response to Levy's resignation, Netanyahu said Sunday that
he is confident his government will survive the crisis and that
early elections will not be held.
</P>
<P>
But opposition Labor party leader Ehud Barak stressed today
before the budget vote that the Netanyahu government will collapse
in a matter of weeks and early elections will be held this
year. He added that Labor will call for a non-confidence motion
against Netanyahu next week.
</P>
<P>
It was widely believed that Netanyahu must do his best to
stabilize the coalition after today's vote so that his government
could survive the imminent crisis over the issue of second
redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu today confirmed that the cabinet will work out a
detailed plan for the further withdrawal from the West Bank before
his scheduled meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton later this
month.
</P>
<P>
But it will be difficult for Netanuahu to maneuver between the
coalition, which will be dominated by extreme right wingers, and
the U.S. administration, which has reportedly pressed Israel to
withdraw no less than 10 percent of the West Bank in the further
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The National Religious Party, a faction in the coalition, today
stressed that if Netanyahu caves in to pressure and makes major
concessions to the Palestinians, it will topple the government.

<HEADLINE> US Determined to Push Mideast Peace Process Forward: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States said today
that it would continue to push the Middle East peace process
forward despite the resignation of Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process continues. This is a process about peace and
not about people," State Department spokesman James Rubin told
reporters. "The U.S. government believes it needs to move forward
based on what it thinks is best, and not based on the particular
make-up of a particular government at a particular time."
</P>
<P>
Levy announced his decision to resign from the post of the
foreign minister Sunday because of a dispute with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over social policy and the peace
process. His move has left Netanyahu's Likud-led ruling coalition
to a one-vote majority in the Knesset, the Israeli parliament.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the departure of Levy, moderate and cooperative
in resolving outstanding issues for the Middle East peace process
in accordance with interim accords agreed between the Palestinians
and Israel's former Labor government, will strengthen the right
faction's force in the coalition government and further stall the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
But Washington seems determined to pull the peace process back
on track, which has been derailed since last March as a result of
Israel's unilateral decision to build Jewish housing units in
Arab's East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry earlier also expressed such
determination of the Clinton administration, saying Levy's quit
from the Israeli government would not affect the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The Middle East peace process has always continued in its
sometimes measured way despite internal political developments
affecting the government of Israel," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
"Individuals and the role individual cabinet members play in
the process change from time to time but the process continues,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also said there had been political turmoil in the region
before and "we have still gone forward with trying to negotiate
and nudge and push for progress."
</P>
<P>
He stressed Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was convinced
that there is urgent need for progress in 1998 because in 1997
"there has been no forward movement" on peace.
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross was set to leave for
the region later in the day for the preparation of President Bill
Clinton's separate meetings with Netanyahu on January 20 and with

<HEADLINE> Turkey Slams PKK for Illegal Immigration Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today accused the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) of plotting the latest
illegal immigration to Europe, semi-official Anatolia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Turkish Interior Minister
Murat Baseskioglu said that the PKK attempted to tarnish Turkey's
reputation through the immigration tide.
</P>
<P>
"They are creating a false image that people are unable
to live in Turkey," Baseskioglu said, adding that this is a new
step adopted by the PKK following its military setbacks.
</P>
<P>
Large number of illegal immigrants from Turkey and northern
Iraq, through different ways, rushed recently to European
countries, especially Italy, causing grave concerns among the
European countries.
</P>
<P>
Baseskioglu said that the PKK wants to deceive money from
these illegal immigrants by irresponsibly promising them "a better
life" in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting against the Turkish government in
southeastern Turkey for an independent state since 1984. The
Turkish government troops have been launching cross-border
operations in northern Iraq to destroy PKK bases in the region.
</P>
<P>
The minister called on Italy and other relevant European
countries not to grant these people political asylum, adding that
such a move will encourage the immigration flood.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that, to a certain extent, bad economic
situation in Turkey can also be termed as one of the reasons for
the illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at a weekly news briefing, Turkish Foreign Ministry
spokesman Sermet Atacanli said that these immigrants did not go to
Europe due to the alleged human rights reasons.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knows that these people are leaving Turkey in
search of a better life for themselves and their families. They
are not fleeing prosecution," Atacanli said.
</P>
<P>
Indicating that some European countries have a bias against
Turkey, Atacanli stressed that the current illegal immigration has
nothing to do with human rights.
</P>
<P>
European countries have always criticized Turkey for its poor
human rights record, saying that Turkey will not achieve its aim
of becoming a European Union member unless it makes a remarkable
improvement in this issue.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said that as many as 1,200 people, mostly
Turks and Kurds from northern Iraq, were smuggled into Italy last
week.
</P>
<P>
As a country linking Asia and Europe, Turkey has been a main
springboard for the illegal immigration from some poor Asian
countries to Europe.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Issues New Emergency Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese Ministry of
Justice issued today a law on the state of emergency and
safeguarding of public safety, which was approved last week by
Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir.
</P>
<P>
According to Undersecretary of State for Justice Shawki
Hussein, the new emergency law deals with cases where the Sudanese
president is empowered to proclaim a state of emergency throughout
the country or in any region.
</P>
<P>
These cases include foreign invasion or siege, such as the
current embargo, that may threaten national unity and safety, and
crises that threaten the country's economy, such as rebellion,
illegal fighting, insurrection, rioting and natural upheavals.
</P>
<P>
The new law abolishes the 1939 law on the defense of Sudan
which has been in effect ever since the colonial era. The Ministry
of Justice is drafting regulations for enforcing the new
law, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the new law has given further power
to the Sudanese president to declare the state of emergency under
diverse circumstances without arousing any debate or opposition on
the part of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
In fact, al-Bashir's declaration of a state of emergency in
west Sudan last December to counter armed robberies has given rise
to heated debates among Sudanese parliamentarians about its
effectiveness and repercussions.

<HEADLINE> Official Logo Selected for Int'l Year of Older Persons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Department of Public
Information (DPI) of the United Nations today announced the
selection of the official United Nations logo for the
International Year of Older Persons, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The logo design, prepared by the DPI in consultation with the
Department of Economic and Social Affairs, comprises rotating
concentric lines expressing vitality, diversity and independence,
as well as movement and progression.
</P>
<P>
The reflection of vitality in the lines refers to the increased
ability of the mind and spirit of older persons, made possible by
healthy lifestyles. The experiences gained throughout life lend
themselves to the great diversity found among older persons in all
societies. This combination of vitality and diversity is seen as
heralding both "a new age for old age" and the reality of "old age
in a new age."
</P>
<P>
The concentric petals or lines draw attention to the
independence and interdependence of the generations, factors which
blend to create a dynamic and reciprocal exchange of
encouragement, enablement and caring. Such reciprocity enacted in
family, community and society at large is the animating principle
leading "towards a society for all ages," the theme of the year.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly of the United Nations designated the year
1999 as the International Year of Older Persons when it adopted
the Proclamation on Aging in 1992. The proclamation urges the
international society to facilitate the collaboration across
sectors and nations and to create a society for all ages.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Donates 29 Million Dlrs for Ex-Yugoslavia Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States announced
today that it will contribute 29 million U.S. dollars to the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to support its
activities in Bosnia, Croatia, Serbian and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by James Rubin, a spokesman for the
State Department, at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
"Because most refugees and displaced persons in the region come
from areas where their ethnic groups are minorities, the UNHCR
will concentrate on overcoming obstacles to return across ethnic
lines," Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government works closely with UNHCR and other
humanitarian organizations to facilitate repatriation, monitor the
safety of refugees and displaced persons," he added.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Rubin said the U.S. is pleased to note that the
multiethnic police force in the northern Bosnian town of Brcko
began patrolling today.
</P>
<P>
The new development came out of a decree issued by Brcko
Supervisor Bill Ferrand about two months ago that called for a
reorganized, integrated force to be functional by the first of the
year.
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased with today's beginning, and it's part of
an ongoing effort at reintegrating Brcko," added Rubin.

<HEADLINE> France Marks Centenary of Milestone Letter by Zola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- France plans to mark the centenary
of a protest letter by writer Emile Zola in which he defended a
Jewish officer wrongly condemned for treason.
</P>
<P>
Zola published the letter, entitled "J'accuse" in French, in
the newspaper L`Aurore on January 13, 1898.
</P>
<P>
The letter, addressed to the then French President Felix Faure,
reveals what now known as "Dreyfus Affair," actually one of the
biggest anti-Semitic scandals of the French army.
</P>
<P>
In what was called the "most revolutionary act of the century"
by France's socialist founding father Jean Jaures, Zola protested
the persecution against Jewish captain Alfred Dreyfus.
</P>
<P>
Dreyfus was stripped of military status, wrongly condemned by a
military tribunal for spying for the Germans, and exiled to the
French Guyana. He was rehabilitated in 1906, but his innocence was
not fully recognized by the army until 1930.
</P>
<P>
On the upcoming January 12, French President Jacques Chirac
will reveal a plaque on a house in the ninth district of Paris, in
which Zola wrote the letter, lived and died.
</P>
<P>
The National Library of France is scheduled to exhibit the
original copy of the letter and several other authentic documents
on the Dreyfus Affair.
</P>
<P>
A series of debates, seminars and ceremonies will be organized
by the Ministry of National Education, the Sorbonne University and
the Ministry of Justice.

<HEADLINE> More Britons Poisoned by Food in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain saw a record number of
food poisonings in 1997, with the annual figure passing 100,000
for the first time, the New Scientist magazine reported.
</P>
<P>
The total incidence of food poisoning last year is seven times
as high as 15 years ago. Up to 200 people may have died from what
they ate.
</P>
<P>
These are only the notified cases. According to Richard
Gilbert, an expert at the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS)
in London, the figure should be multiplied by ten to reach a true
estimate.
</P>
<P>
"So it's probably closer to 1 million." Gilbert, who is PHLS's
head of food safety policy development, was quoted by the New
Scientist as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rise of food poisoning in Britain has several causes and
changes in lifestyle is one to blame, said Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
More people now eat out than before, and consumers prefer fresh
produce, which is more likely to be contaminated if poorly stored
or handled at any point.
</P>
<P>
Consumers have also pressed for the elimination of
preservatives and other additives which used to keep bacteria out
of food.

<HEADLINE> Mao Memorial Hall Reopens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Qiu Hongbiao, a 43-year-old
businessman from the city of Shenzhen in southern Guangdong
Province, arrived at Tiananmen Square in the center of the
Chinese Capital this morning much earlier than most other visitors.
</P>
<P>
Qiu journeyed to Beijing to realize his long-cherished dream of
being in the presence of Chairman Mao.
</P>
<P>
Qiu made a special trip to Beijing last month, but the memorial
hall did not reopen, and he returned in despair.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have the opportunity to see Chairman Mao personally
when he was alive," said Qiu, "and now my wish comes true."
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 visitors, mostly from other parts of the
country, braved this morning's bone chilling winds to queue in
front of the Memorial Hall for the late Chinese leader Mao
Zedong. The throng gathered to await the reopening of the hall
following a nine-month maintenance project.
</P>
<P>
The base of the white jade statue of Mao was awash with fresh
flowers shortly after the hall opened.
</P>
<P>
The remains of the Great Leader rest peacefully in a crystal
coffin covered with a flag of the Communist Party of
China. Visitors silently viewed Mao's face and often their eyes
welled tears.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 5,000 people visited the hall in the first hour
after its reopening, including a septuagenarian couple -- Sheng
Hebang and his wife -- from central China's Henan Province. The
couple reportedly flew in here Monday for the sole purpose of
visiting the Mao memorial.
</P>
<P>
"I've followed late Chairman Mao for all my life and I love him
very much," said the old man, "We will never forget his loving
kindness."
</P>
<P>
The memorial hall was completed in May 1977 and opened to the
public on September 9, 1977, on the first anniversary of Mao's
death.
</P>
<P>
A total of 110 million people had visited the sacred memorial
by March 28, 1997, when its administrative authorities announced
that the hall would be closed for renovations from April 1 to
December 31, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Light Industry Improves Product Mix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Projections for 1997 indicate
that the output value for China's light industry sector will hit
3,190 billion yuan (384 billion US dollars), with exports for the
year ending at 53 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Yu Zhen, chairman of the China National Council of Light
Industry, said today that the structure of the sector's product
mix improved noticeably during 1997, with more brand names gaining
national prominence.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-eight of 42 famous brand names established by the
National Industry and Commerce Administration are produced by the
light industry sector.
</P>
<P>
However, China's market for light industrial goods is far from
saturated, according to Yu. He said that China only produces some
260,000 of the 1.5 million-strong consumer goods available
worldwide, with 20-30 percent of the former goods developed over
the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo sent a congratulatory letter marking

<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 6 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province led the country in patent application in 1997 for the
third year, with more than 10,000 patents applied.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Guangdong Provincial Patent Bureau show
that by the end of last November, the province had approved
6,448 patents from 11,220 applicants, up 32.7 percent and 27.1
percent respectively over the corresponding period of 1996.

Meanwhile, the province had made remarkable achievements in
transforming the patented technology into productive force, and
established some industries with their own intellectual property
rights.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey, the province last year increased its
output value by 9.1 billion yuan, its profits by some one billion
yuan, and foreign currency earnings by 90.2 million US
dollars, due to the spread of 51 pieces of patented technology.
</P>
<P>
The province had also issued laws and regulations,
including the Guangdong Province Patent Protection Ordinance, to
regulate the patent market and safeguard the inventors' and
consumers' rights and interests.

<HEADLINE> Melbourne Opens Office in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Australian city of Melbourne
opened an office today in Tianjin, one of China's four
municipalities and the largest coastal city in north China.
</P>
<P>
This office, the first of its kind opened by an Australian
local government, is jointly sponsored by the City of Melbourne,
the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT), the Taylors
Group and the Australia China Business Council of Victoria State.
</P>
<P>
The mayors of both cities attended today's opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Melbourne Mayor Ivan Deveson said that the office will promote
two-way trade and investment with Tianjin, China's third largest
city, as well as bilateral exchanges in the realm of education,
culture, and urban management.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin and Melbourne have enjoyed frequent business contacts
since the establishment of a sister-city relationship in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The RMIT has maintained long-term relations with the Chinese
government, as well as with industrial and educational departments
throughout China.
</P>
<P>
The Taylors Group signed an education and cooperation
agreement with the Tianjin No.1 Middle School in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Deveson said the office will serve as a bridge between
businesspeople from Melbourne, Victoria State and the Australian
government and business community, and will enable them to
conduct mutually beneficial trade cooperation with Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The Australia-China Business Council of Victoria State will
manage daily operations, according to Victoria State Council
President Bill O'Shea.
</P>
<P>
"Strengthening long-term business relations developed between
the cities over the years and the sister city relationship will
offer a positive environment for companies using the office,"
according to O'Shea.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that Tianjin has been and will continue to be a
magnet for foreign investment in China," said O'Shea, adding that
Tianjin is home to one of the best deepwater ports in the country.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin is home to over 10,000 foreign-funded enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Hewlett-Packard to Offer 799-dollar PCs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Hewlett-Packard (HP) Co.,
one of the largest U.S. computer makers, said Monday it would
offer Intel-based multimedia personal computers at 799 dollars.
</P>
<P>
"This is the lowest price point we have ever hit at
introduction," said Webb Mckinney, the California-based company's
General Manager of the Home Products Division.
</P>
<P>
It's also the lowest price for such product in the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
HP's 799-dollar model, known as Pavilion 3260, is designed
around a 200-megahertz Pentium processor from Intel, together with
embedded multimedia technology and 32 megabytes of memory.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts say the battle to capture home buyers of
personal computers will heat up with HP launching a 799-dollar
system on the eve of an annual trade show hosted by the Consumer
Electronics Manufacturing Association in Las Vegas later this week.
</P>
<P>
Computer systems priced below 1,000 dollars made up 7.2 percent
of the desktop units sold by U.S. retailers in the beginning of
1997, but jumped to 32.2 percent by the end of the year, according
to Computer Intelligence, a market research firm.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe similar price cuts may be announced in the
next two days by other large computer makers, such as Compaq
Computer Corp. and IBM, before they exhibit their new products in
Las Vegas, where a "price war" seems inevitable.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Tightens Up Foreign Exchange Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet Tuesday
approved a few measures aimed at preventing Thai exporters and
individuals from holding foreign currencies for a long time,
according to a Government House press release.
</P>
<P>
In order to bolster the supply of foreign currencies, the
cabinet requires that exporters bring in foreign currencies
immediately after the payment is received.
</P>
<P>
Under the previous rules, exporters have 120 days following the
shipment of their goods to bring in their foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
The 120-day deadline leaves loopholes for some exporters who
receive payment in less than 120 days.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet also requires that Thai exporters and residents who
receive foreign currencies for their goods and services should
convert or deposit the sums in banks within seven days, instead of
the previous 15 days, so as to speed up foreign currency
liquidity.

WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Two American balloonists, who
planned to start today their attempt to circle the globe by taking
a balloon without stop, decided to postpone their takeoff because
of wind problem over the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The jet stream that would have carried Dick Rutan and partner
Dave Melton across the ocean were waning and the winds around
Albuquerque were unsettled, the crew's weather forecasters said.

The launch was postponed for 10 days to two weeks and the crew
was to meet today to reassess their plan.

<P>
"You work for months to get to this point, then a few hours

upset," Melton said this morning.
</P>
<P>
"It's a letdown, but we know we'll have another try at it,"

<P>
-- President Bill Clinton announced Monday that a new surge of
money into government coffers will allow him to propose a balanced
budget this year, the first time in nearly three decades that a
president has presented Congress an annual spending plan with no
red ink.
</P>
<P>
-- House Speaker Newt Gingrich Monday proposed the creation of
a national commission to reform Social Security and said he hopes
Congress can establish a new retirement system sometime in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- In a bizarre beginning to what promises to be a highly
unusual proceeding, the trial of the accused Unabom killer,
Theodore J. Kaczynski, was halted just before it got under way on
Monday morning, when Kaczynski said he had "very important"
complaints about his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
-- In Denver, Colorado, prosecutors invoked images of the dead,
and defense lawyers invoked a biblical tale of mercy as they made
their final arguments Monday over whether Terry L. Nichols should
be executed for his role in the Oklahoma City bombing.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The FDA issued rules to regulate the advertising and
marketing practices of pharmacy benefit-management companies, many
of which have been bought up by drug makers. Critics warn
patients' health could be jeopardized if the firms use the
benefits units to push health-care providers to switch to their
products.

baby boomers -- goes on sale in March with a lower-than-expected

<HEADLINE> 40 percent S. Korean Companies to Cut Labor Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Some 40 percent of South Korean
companies are planning to cut their manpower due to the current
financial crisis, said a survey issued by the Korea Chamber of
Commerce and Industry Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
About 39.8 percent of the surveyed 376 companies and banking
institutions said they are planning to slow down their operations
while 42.5 percent said they will curtail personnel by up to 100,
and 15 percent is to cut at least 300.
</P>
<P>
Of the surveyed, 92.3 percent consented the need of workforce
reduction while 63.6 percent will opt for a smaller paycheck as
part of downsizing.
</P>
<P>
But, observers said reality will be more harsh as South Korean
financial institutions will have to go through painstaking
economic restructuring, including massive layoffs, since the
current financial crisis simply can not be solved through more
borrowing.
</P>
<P>
They predicted that the crisis caused by failure of
conglomerates and bad loans of financial institutions, will
further deepen if the country failed to attract substantial
foreign investment in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
This year, they said, will be surely worse than the previous
year for the nation, once the 11th largest economy in the world,
in many respects -- inflation and unemployment will rise and more
bankruptcies are expected to take place.

poverty. Guizhou is one of the poorest provinces in China.
</P>
<P>
Due to the development of infrastructure in Guizhou, the
average annual net income of farmers reached 1,298 yuan in 1997,
up 4.2 percent on 1996. The poverty-stricken population
in the province reduced from ten million in 1993 to 4.55 million
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 18 more townships in Guizhou were connected with
roads, 35 equipped with power facilities, 25 with telephones, and
350 satellite ground stations built to receive TV and radio
programs.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Guizhou helped the poor by encouraging them to
transform low-yield land into high-yield fields. Various training
courses were held for farmers.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou has also built many poverty-relief projects and
production bases.

<HEADLINE> Economic Institute Tunes Down German Growth Projection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A leading German economic research
institute said Tuesday that Germany's economy would grow by only
2.5 percent in 1998 instead of an early projection of 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
In its latest economic report, the Berlin-based German
Institute for Economic Research DIW also said that Germany's gross
domestic product (GDP) would increase by only 2.2 percent in 1997
compared with the government forecast of 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, unemployment in Germany is set to continue rising in
1998, with the average jobless total expected to climb to 4.51
million from 4.39 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The institute also put Germany's budget deficit in 1997 at 3.3
percent of GDP, thus missing the European Union Maastricht Treaty
target of 3.0 percent of GDP required for qualification for the
single European currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
However, Germany would be able to reduce its budget deficit to
2.7 percent of GDP in 1998, the DIW said.
</P>
<P>
It also predicted that the German mark would continue to lose
value against the U.S. dollar in 1998. But the pace of
depreciation is likely to slow down during the course of the
year.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Situation Severe in Somali Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 6 (Xinhua) -- With almost no operational
quarantines, the cholera situation in the Somali capital here is
alarming as the death rate is increasing by the day.
</P>
<P>
Local health authorities declared a state of emergency
following the spread of the disease to all sectors of the
community in the capital and elsewhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
In last week alone, more than 60 cases of death were reported
due to poorly equipped health facilities in both sides of
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Benadir Hospital, the only operational quarantine and the
largest cholera recipient facility in Mogadishu is accommodating
more than 630 cholera patients and a total of 19 deaths had been
reported, four of which died this morning.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of new cholera victims are still pouring into the
hospital which can no longer cope with the overwhelming number of
cholera patients.
</P>
<P>
Dr Abdirizak Hassan Ali, director of Benadir Hospital, told
Xinhua today that they are running short of medical supplies.
According to Dr Ali, the local Islamic organization, the Moslem
Solidarity Forum, and the International Committee of the Red
Cross are offering insufficient donations to the cholera victims.
</P>
<P>
He added that the hospital can't conduct the necessary
treatments after dark owing to the lack of fuel for the
generators on the premises.
</P>
<P>
Dr Osman Mohamud Dufle, coordinator of the Joint Health
Authority in Mogadishu, said the cholera patients are now
scattered throughout the capital, causing more hazards to the
community.
</P>
<P>
Dr Dufle noted that the spread of the disease has resulted
from the lack of quarantines, malnutrition and the poor
sanitation in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
"More than 20 percent of the cholera patients are dying," he
said, adding, "the European Union brought about 500 cartons of
infusion and the essential drugs against the cholera, but no
distribution is being made unless the international aid agencies
arrive in the capital."
</P>
<P>
It is not in the capital alone where the cholera epidemic is
tightening its grip. Six deaths are reported from Balad
district, 30 km North of Mogadishu this week. And more than 37
cholera and severe cerebral malaria deaths are reported in
Dhanawe village of Bakol region.
</P>
<P>
Both Dr Dufle and Dr Ali agreed that the security situation in
the capital is relatively Okay to allow the aid agencies to
operate. And the local health authority is appealing for the
return of the international aid agencies to help tackle the
desperate cholera situation.
</P>
<P>
Water borne diseases such as cholera, yellow fever and malaria
are claiming lives throughout the country which has no central
authority for the seventh year now since the overthrow of former
President S. Barre in 1991 plunged the country into tribal war.
</P>
<P>
The Somalis are expecting the formation of a government of
national unity in the first half of this year following the
agreement reached recently by the Somali factions in Cairo.

<HEADLINE> Remains of Veteran Revolutionary Cremated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Veteran Chinese communist Liu
Lantao passed away on December 31 at the age of 88 and his remains
were cremated today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
No ceremonial activities were conducted and the remains were
disposed of in accordance with Liu's will.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders including Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Zhu
Rongji, Li Ruihuan, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing, Li
Lanqing, Rong Yiren and Ding Guangen visited Liu during his stay
in hospital, and paid condolences to his relatives following his
death.
</P>
<P>
Liu was a dedicated fighter for the cause of communism and a
veteran proletarian revolutionary, as well as an eminent official
in charge of Party affairs of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
and the affairs of the Party's United Front.
</P>
<P>
Liu was born into a poor family in Mizhi County, northwest
China's Shaanxi province, in November 1910. He joined the
Communist Youth League of China in 1926 and the CPC in 1928.
</P>
<P>
Active in CPC revolutionary movements and battles against the
ruling Kuomintang Regime and Japanese aggressors, Liu was arrested
twice and imprisoned by the Kuomintang between 1930-1936.
</P>
<P>
He mainly worked in north China between 1936-1954, and was one
of the major senior CPC officials in the area between 1948-1954.
</P>
<P>
After 1955, Liu held numerous major positions related to the
internal affairs and international affairs of the CPC, as well as
local affairs in the northwest.
</P>
<P>
Liu was persecuted by the Gang of Four during the turmoil of
the "Cultural Revolution" (1966-1976).
</P>
<P>
He worked mainly for the United Front sector following 1979,
serving first as deputy head of the CPC Central Committee United
Front Department and then as vice-chairman of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee.
</P>
<P>
Liu was elected a member of the CPC Central Committee during
the Fourth Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, and
subsequently served as a member of the Standing committee of the
CPC Central Advisory Committee.

<HEADLINE> French Communist Daily Publishes Evidence on Crime of Papon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The French Communist Party's daily
"L`Humanite" used 11 pages in its Tuesday issue to publish
documents which can serve as evidence to prove the anti-Semitic
crimes of former Vichy official Maurice Papon.
</P>
<P>
Papon, 87, has been standing trial since last October in the
Assize Court of Bordeaux in the Gironde Prefecture, southwest
France, over charges of crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
He was accused of deporting 6,900 Jews, including many
children, from Gironde to Nazi death camps from 1942 to 1944, when
he was number two of the government of Gironde under the Vichy
collaboration regime.
</P>
<P>
One of the document published by "L`Humanite" was a letter by
the chief of Gestapo in France to the prefectural government of
Gironde, asking the latter to arrest the Communist resistance
fighters in aviation factories of the prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Another letter, dated July 10, 1943, informed Papon a planned
visit to Bordeaux by the general commissioner in charge of the
Jewish files of the Vichy regime, Louis Darquier de Pellepoix.
</P>
<P>
Another letter, dated July 7, 1944, which was after Paris was
liberated, and signed by the chief of the prefectural government
of Gironde Jean Chapel, ordered the arrest of nine Frenchmen.
</P>
<P>
Papon has denied that he master-minded the deportation of the
Jews and instead claimed that he had done his best to save the
lives of Jews and had been engaged in resistance movements against
the Germans.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Kidnapers Demand Ransom for Release of Poles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Chechen kidnapers reportedly
demanded a ransom of 3 million U.S. dollars for the release of
five Polish aid workers held hostage since December 17.
</P>
<P>
Media reports published here Tuesday said the ransom demand was
confirmed by Mohamed Mohamedov, deputy chief of the anti-terrorist
center in Chechnya, a republic of Russia.
</P>
<P>
However, in the region's capital of Grozny, a representative
for the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe said he
knew nothing about the latest development.
</P>
<P>
Mohamedov said the five Poles working for a Polish-Chechen
friendship society were safe and sound, and the Polish government
should never agree to pay the ransom.
</P>
<P>
The aid workers were held hostage by a dozen armed gangsters
and the whereabouts of the abducted were unclear because they were
often taken from one place to another, he added.
</P>
<P>
Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek said the five young
men were abducted some 30 kilometers west of Grozny, where their
minibus was found with its tires shot out.
</P>
<P>
Moscow said some 800 people had been held hostage over the past
year in the region, which fought a bloody war for full
independence from Russia during 1994-1996.
</P>
<P>
After the war, terrorism reigns the region and armed gangs
often surface to kidnap foreigners for ransom money.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall in Tokyo on Poor Economic Outlook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Tokyo Stocks continued to fall
Tuesday, the second day of new year trading, amid lingering
pessimism over the sluggish Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei average of 225 selected issues on the First Section
at the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which dropped 301.90 points Monday,
lost 60.44 points more, or 0.40 percent, to close at 14,896.40.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index, which
covers all issues on the First Section, fell 5.98 points, or 0.51
percent, to close at 1,160.65.
</P>
<P>
Volume on the First Section came to an estimated 350 million
shares, up from Monday's 156.62 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Collapsed Yamaichi Securities Co. was Tuesday's most actively
traded issue.
</P>
<P>
During the morning session, the Nikkei index tumbled below
14,775.22, the 1997 low marked on December 29, with heavy
arbitrage unwinding triggered by the major depreciation of the yen.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency briefly climed to the 134 yen level in Tokyo
for the first time since April 1992.
</P>
<P>
Deterioration of Asian currencies such as Thai baht, the
Malaysian ringgit and the Indonesian rupiah also dampened the
market sentiment, traders said.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo market was briefly buoyed in the early afternoon by
news that the Finance Ministry will announce later in the day a
set of measures to shore up the stock market.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,327 issues listed on the First Section, losers
outpaced gainers 738 to 341, with 141 issues ending unchanged.

<HEADLINE> France Attributes Exodus of Kurds to Anarchy in N. Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- French Interior Minister
Jean-Pierre Chevenement Tuesday attributed the exodus of Kurds
toward Europe to the lack of government in northern Iraq since the
end of the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
"If the northern part of Iraq had not been turned into a no
man's land... perhaps there would not be the influx of Kurds that
we are seeing," said Chevenement after holding a meeting with
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on the issue Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that since the end of the Gulf War, northern
Iraq has been subjected to all kinds of attacks, invasions and
civil wars among different factions of the Kurds and between
Kurdish forces and the government forces of Turkey and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said that the problem of Kurds did not come out "by hazard"
and is linked with other problems such as criminal immigration
trafficking networks working in Europe.
</P>
<P>
He also blamed Turkey for allowing the Kurds being smuggled out
of its coast by mafias.
</P>
<P>
"I think that when a boat quits the Turkish coast, they should
see it," he said,
</P>
<P>
The general directors of police force from several principal
European countries concerned with the Kurdish exodus, including
Turkey, will meet in Rome on Thursday to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
A boat carrying about 900 Kurds arrived in Italy from Turkey in
December, while thousands of others are trying to illegally enter
European countries through other routes.

<HEADLINE> Date, Venue Set for Mass Burial of Air Crash Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A mass burial for the 104
passengers and crew members who were killed in last month's crash
of SilkAir Flight MI185 in Palembang, Indonesia, will be held in
the Botanical Park of Palembang on January 19, Singapore
television said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The television report said this was announced by Singapore
Communications Minister Mah Bow Tan and Indonesian Transport
Minister Haryanto Dhanutirto at a joint news conference in
Palembang on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The site for the mass burial, the Botanical Park, is said to be
some two kilometers from the town's airport and the date is
exactly one month after the crash. SilkAir Flight MI185 went down
on December 19, 1997, on its way back to Singapore from Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Singapore television said the burial site was chosen because of
its accessibility and because it can be prepared faster.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a monument will be built near the crash site for
the victims, it said. Flight MI185 crashed into the Musi River
near Palembang.
</P>
<P>
The two black boxes of the ill-fated plane, the flight data
recorder and the cockpit voice recorder, had both been recovered
in the search and rescue operation which started shortly after the
mishap took place.
</P>
<P>
But no survivors were ever found, not even a single complete
body. So far about 50 percent of the plane's wreckage has been
recovered and dredging operations on the Musi River will continue
until next Wednesday as there is a need for investigators to
recover critical wreckage, the television report said.

<P>
DHAKA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- As many as 1,249 people were
killed and 16,000 others wounded in road accidents on two highways
in Bangladesh last year, said local press reports Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On the 208-kilometer-long highway linking Dhaka and Sylhel,
northeast of the capital city, at least 959 people were killed and
12,000 others injured in 1997 in road accidents.
</P>
<P>
More than 290 people were killed and 4,000 others injured in
320 accidents on the 80-kilometer-long highway between Dhaka and
Aricha, northwest of the capital, in the same year.
</P>
<P>
The two highways are the busiest routes in the country. Many
of the vehicles running on the two roads are over-loaded, and the
roads' bad condition worsens the traffic situation, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The reports attributed the high rates of accidents and
casualties to vehicle overloading, reckless and licenseless
driving, and faulty vehicles.

<HEADLINE> Levy Formally Resigns as Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy has formally quit his post before his resignation takes
effect later today, 48 hours after he tendered the resignation
letter to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Levy bode farewell to the ministry staff and workers in a
formal ceremony held at the Foreign Ministry. His resignation
will go into effect at 7:30 p.m.(local time) today.
</P>
<P>
He said that he could not remain in the current coalition
government led by Likud Party, because he came to the conclusion
that he no longer makes impact. He added that he hoped the
government would be able to correct its ways during this
difficult time.
</P>
<P>
Levy dropped a political bombshell to the country when he
announced his resignation, citing the failure of the government
to tackle worsening social problems and push forward the stalled
peace process.
</P>
<P>
In the parliamentary vote for the 1998 Budget Monday, Levy and
four members of his Gesher Party voted with the opposition against
the budget in protest against the government's policy of cutting
welfare benefits to the poor population.
</P>
<P>
Levy, a veteran politician who has served in several Likud
governments, has long been a political arch-rival with current
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Their deeply-rooted feud
originated from the 1993 battle for the Likud leadership, during
which Netanyahu defeated Levy.
</P>
<P>
The feud led to Levy's departure from the Likud to create the
Gesher Party in early 1996 before the general elections in May
that year. But following the mediation of Likud's veteran Ariel
Sharon, currently Infrastructure Minister, Levy agreed to reunite
with the Likud to attend the elections, helping sweep Netanyahu
to power.
</P>
<P>
Since assuming office in the foreign ministry, Levy had
already threatened to resign for five times before the Sunday
announcement because he felt repeatedly being sidelined by
Netanyahu in the decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
Levy's leave has pushed the Netanyahu government into a
survival crisis by reducing its majority in the 120-seat Knesset
(Parliament) to the minimal 61 seats needed to keep going. This
has fueled the speculation that the coalition could collapse at
any time soon, leading to new elections.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Launches Biggest Drainage Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan on Tuesday launched
its biggest ever drainage project in Punjab's provincial capital
of Lahore, which is aimed at minimizing drainage surplus, the
Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
</P>
<P>
The government's incentive policies for the agriculture sector
can not bear fruit if the land remains afflicted with water
logging and salinity, Minister for Water and Power Raja Nadir
Pervaiz said at the launching ceremony for the 713 million-U.S.
dollar project.
</P>
<P>
Co-financed by the Pakistani federal and provincial
governments, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, the
project is expected to evacuate all saline drainable surpluses
from the Indus Basin, which covers the provinces of Punjab and
Sindh and parts of Balochistan and the North West Frontier
Province.
</P>
<P>
Pervaiz said the performance of the agriculture sector had a
strong bearing on the national economic planning as it accounts
for more than 25 percent of the Gross Domestic Product.
</P>
<P>
The irrigated farm land, which accounts for about 80 percent of
the total cropped area of the country, has been threatened by
water-logging and salinity for almost 40 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1960s, a number of drainage projects have been set up
to control water-logging and salinity, but the performance of
these projects has been below expectations mainly because of poor
management.
</P>
<P>
The country's drainage system is seriously handicapped with a
host of problems like accumulation of incoming salts and the
continued incidence of water logging and salinity, according to
the report.

<HEADLINE> Food Poisoning Rises in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain saw a record number of
food poisonings in 1997 with the annual figure passing 100,000 for
the first time, the New Scientist magazine reported.
</P>
<P>
The total incidence of food poisoning last year is seven times
as high as 15 years ago. Up to 200 people may have died from what
they ate, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
However, these are only the reported cases. Richard Gilbert, an
expert at the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) in London,
said that the figure should be multiplied by ten to reach a true
estimate.
</P>
<P>
"So it's probably closer to 1 million." Gilbert, PHLS's head of
food safety policy development, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rise of food poisoning in Britain has several causes and
changes in lifestyle is one to blame, said Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
More people now eat out than before, and consumers prefer fresh
produce, which is more likely to be contaminated if poorly stored
or handled at any point.
</P>
<P>
Consumers have also pressed for the elimination of
preservatives and other additives which used to keep bacteria out
of food.
</P>
<P>
To clean up the nation's food, strict targets should be set by
the government for the reduction of bacteria in poultry and better
hygiene is required throughout the food chain, Gilbert said.

<P>
BAGHDAD, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today urged the
U.S. government to reconsider its anti-Iraq policy and resort to
dialogue and understanding to settle pending issues, the official
Iraqi News Agency INA reported.
</P>
<P>
The INA quoted a government spokesman as saying that the United
States should settle pending issues with Iraq in conformity with
U.N. Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman said U.S. anti-Iraq policy had isolated
itself internationally, as evidenced by the facts that the
international community rejected American threats to launch an
aggression against Iraq and its insistence to perpetuate the
sanctions against Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks in response to a statement by
U.S. State Department spokesman James Robin who admitted that
U.S. policy against Iraq has been a failure and there are states
critical to it.
</P>
<P>
Despite of such defeat, the American spokesman expressed his
administration's determination to go ahead with its policy, said
the Iraqi spokesman, warning that such obstinate position would
only throw the United Stated into further isolation.

HONG KONG, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Two seminars hosted by Hong
Kong's Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) will unfold a
publicity drive by the Council to get itself better known to the
local citizens, its chairman said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Denis Chang said the seminars, organized by the IPCC for the
first time since it was set up in 1986, offered an opportunity for
the Provisional District Board and the District Fight Crime
Committee to "get to know better the current police complaints
system and the role and functions of the IPCC."
</P>
<P>
One seminar was held on Tuesday and the other is scheduled for
next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chang said the two seminars would spearhead the IPCC's
publicity drive to increase the council's transparency and public
accountability.
</P>
<P>
The IPCC, an independent advisory body with its members coming
from various sectors of the local community and authorized by the

<HEADLINE> S. Korea, IMF Readjust Agreed Macro Economic Indicators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and the International
Monetary Fund have started to revise agreed macro economic
indicators, including the GDP growth rate, due to great financial
changes in the country, said the Ministry of Finance and Economy
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Last month, South Korea signed an agreement with the IMF for a
rescue loan of 57 billion U.S. dollars. Under the agreement with
stiff conditions, the nation has to completely restructure its
economy, open its financial market, close its ailing commercial
and merchant banks and companies, and cut its budget.
</P>
<P>
The agreed indicators were decided on a basis of the exchange
rate of one South Korean won against 1,100 dollars and yearly
interest rate of about 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministry pointed out that South Korea has to
change the indicators as the exchange rate now hovers around 1,650
won and interest rates exceed 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The GDP growth rate is expected to be revised to about 1.5
percent in the aftermath of tightened monetary policy and the
restructuring of banking institutions imposed by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The increase rate of consumer price would be adjusted to roughly
7 percent from previous 5 percent while the unemployment rate to 5
percent from the previous projection of 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The readjustment will be finished Wednesday and will be sent to
the IMF board for consideration, according to the ministry.

<HEADLINE> China Takes Steps to Control VC Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- China, a major vitamin C (VC)
exporter, has decided to take steps to tighten macro-control on VC
production and export so as to ensure this industry would go out
of its all-time low and develop in a healthy way.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Relations, China will, starting from this year, limit VC
production scope to ensure a reasonable pricing for VC exports.
</P>
<P>
China will not build new VC plants and expand the production
capacity of the existing ones, said Liu Junsheng, an official
in the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The State Pharmaceutical Administration will issue production
permit certificates for VC plants. Without the certificates, VC
plants will not be entitled to export VC, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will re-examine the business qualification
of VC export companies, and put the VC export price under strict
control. Those firms, which have lowered their export price without
official approval, will be punished.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made to expand the domestic market so as to
digest the already enlarged VC production capacity.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the measures are taken against the
international background that the VC supply is much bigger than
the demand and China's VC firms have suffered heavy losses due to
fierce competition on the international and domestic markets.
</P>
<P>
Liu said, the international VC price has dropped to
the current five US dollars per kilogram from 12 dollars two year
ago.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China exports some 20,000 tons of VC each
year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Falls to Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian currency, the
rupiah, hit a record low of 7,700 against the U.S. dollar Tuesday,
dealers here said.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah reached 7,700 per dollar at the morning trading
session before closing the day at 7,350 per dollar. The drastic
drop of the rupiah was caused by weakness in regional currencies
and continuing local corporate demand for the dollar, they said.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian currency has dropped by more than 200 percent
against the greenback from 2,361 per dollar in early July.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the Malaysian ringgit also slid to 4.33 against
the dollar from 4.055 on Monday while the Thai baht plummeted to
54 per dollar from 42.65 and the Philippine peso to its lowest
level of 44.35 per dollar from 42.65.
</P>
<P>
Many economic analysts here blamed indebted corporations for
the sharp depreciation of the rupiah against the dollar. The
government has said Indonesia's private offshore debts total 65
billion dollars, accounting for 55 percent of the country's total
debts of 118 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Out of the private debts, 10 billion dollars will mature at the
beginning of this year.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Paper Urges U.S. to Abandon Distrust, Hostile Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Pyongyang's official daily
Rodong Sinmun Tuesday urged Washington to drop its policy of
distrust and hostility toward the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
"If the United States truly wants to improve relations..., it
should discontinue mistrusting and antagonizing the DPRK and take
a step for confidence building," the paper said in a commentary.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the DPRK and the United States had a series of
talks and contacts over the past year but failed to bear desired
fruit, the commentary attributed the failure to the hostile policy.
</P>
<P>
It listed U.S. hostile activities such as spreading the fiction
of "threat from North Korea," intelligence activities against the
DPRK and the demand for the DPRK's abandonment of "terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Such activities, the newspaper commentary said, are enough for
the DPRK to doubt the true purpose of the United States to call
for improving the bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Refugees Faced with Starvation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIGALI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Congolese refugees who have
been relocated to a new site in Byumba in the northeast of Rwanda
are faced with problems of hunger and various diseases, Rwanda
Television (TVR) has reported.
</P>
<P>
"One Congolese refugee died on Sunday," a TVR crew that had
visited the estimated 16,000 ethnic Tutsi Congolese refugees at
Kageyo makeshift camp, near Byumba town had indicated.
</P>
<P>
The refugees themselves accused the UN Refugee Agency and
other humanitarian organizations of not providing them with
proper food and medical care.
</P>
<P>
"That information is baseless," claimed the UNHCR
Representative to Rwanda, Roman Urasa. "That crew never contacted
the authorities in Byumba, it only spoke to refugees."
</P>
<P>
Urasa indicated that UNHCR, in collaboration with the Rwanda
Red Cross distributed food rations for two weeks to refugees
before they left the north of Rwanda on December 22, 1997 for
Byumba.
</P>
<P>
"Each refugee receives the standard ration of 2,100 kcal per
day, we cannot change it," Urasa underlined. These rations are
made of maize, beans, and vegetable oil, he said.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources in Byumba have blamed the food shortages
in the camp to the fact that the refugees prefer to exchange food
relief with local commodities which are extremely expensive.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, what they gain in this bargaining is not enough
to cover the two week period between two distributions," they
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The decision to relocate Congolese refugees was taken
following two bloody attacks by Hutu extremists on Mudende
refugee camp, in Gisenyi, that claimed more than one thousand
lives.

BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Once a loser in competing for
domestic buyers' loyalty, the Chinese brands of household
electronics appliances now boasts a far bigger market share than
their foreign rivals, said a survey report publicized by the State
Statistical Bureau and the China Statistical Society today.
</P>
<P>
The results of the survey, which was based on the figures from

domestic brands exceeded 70 percent for eight out of ten major
household electronics products.
</P>
<P>
The market share of domestic brands of freezer, electric rice
pot, refrigerator, VCD player and household washing machine stood

SHANGHAI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The well-off residents in
Shanghai have found that they have a stronger attachment to the
Hope Project, which began in the metropolis three years ago.
</P>
<P>
To date, the residents of Shanghai, China's industrial city, have
donated over 66 million yuan to the Hope Project, funding the
establishment of 380 Hope Project schools and helping 33,000
dropouts to return to schools.
</P>

Yunnan Province, in southwest China, received 4.8 million
yuan of donation from Shanghai in 1997, which has been used in
buildinging 110 Hope Project schools and bringing back some 1,000
dropouts to schools.
</P>
<P>
Unlike three years ago, when people offer donations on impulse,
an increasing number of Shanghai residents have donated regularly
on the ground that they regard it an obligation to help those who
are in need of help.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of 1998, the city has organized four
outdoor activities in Shanghai, encouraging more public
involvement in the Hope Project.

<HEADLINE> De Bruin, Pankratov Lead Absentees from Swimming Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PERTH, Australia, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A long list of famous
absentees is certain to take some gloss off the world swimming
championships which is to open tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
After injuries forced Russian double Olympic champion Dennis
Pankratov out of the 11-day event, Michelle De Bruin, Ireland's
triple Olympic gold medalist, opted out too.
</P>
<P>
The no-shows also included local hero Kieren Perkins, holder of
three world records, flamboyant American Gary Hall, Jr., U.S.
Swimming's 1997 Swimmer of the Year, Chad Carvin, and Australia's
double Olympic silver medalist Scott Miller.
</P>
<P>
De Bruin, who stunned the world with her victories in the
women's 400-meter freestyle and 200- and 400-meter individual
medley events in the Atlanta Olympic Games, withdrew late December
from the Perth Worlds because of whiplash injuries sustained from
a car accident on October 31.
</P>
<P>
Smith said on December 22 that it was "pure heartbreak" to miss
the championships.
</P>
<P>
"I am disappointed because I might miss out on a chance of
going for a world championship title as the next world
championships is not until 2001," said Smith, 28.
</P>
<P>
Pankratov chose to skip the world championships because he
wanted to take a break.
</P>
<P>
The Russian won the 100- and 200-meter butterfly titles at the
Atlanta Games but swam poorly in the Euroean championships last
August. After a talk with his coach Viktor Avdeyenko, he decided
to have a rest.
</P>
<P>
In the European championships, Pankratov finished sixth in his
defence of his 100 meters title and failed to make the final of
the 200, an event in which he was unbeaten in major competition
since 1993.
</P>
<P>
"This (pulling out of the World) was a joint decision,"
Avdeyenko was quoted as saying last November.
</P>
<P>
Perkins, the holder of three freestyle world records, missed
out the world championships because of his own fault.
</P>
<P>
He finished third over 1,500 meters, the distance which has won
him two Olympic gold medals, finished fifth over 400 and failed to
reach the 200-meter final at the Australian world championship
trials last October.
</P>
<P>
Perkins ruled himself only 85 percent fit coming into the
trials after an eventful year, including marriage and the birth of
his daughter Georgia Jane last November.
</P>
<P>
Hall, Jr., the Olympic runner-up in both 50- and 100-meter
freestyle, is the other big name who flunked in the world
championship trials. The American who likes trash-talk and has a
hot temper failed to qualify for any individual event here and
will only compete in the 4x100 meters freestyle relay.
</P>
<P>
Carvin, who won four events the U.S. nationals, was forced out
of the Perth Worlds by a bulging disc in his lower back that has
bothered him since the world championship trials last July.
</P>
<P>
The injury is yet another setback for Carvin, who had been
troubled by cardiomyopathy, a serious disease that kept him from
the 1996 Olympic trials. In 1994, days after competing in the Rome
world championships, he had his appendix removed.

<HEADLINE> 160 Civilians Massacred in Latest Violence in Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 160 people were
massacred over the past two days in western Algeria by Islamic
militants, adding the number of people killed since the beginning
of Ramadan to more than 500, said reports from Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary estimates said that 117 people were killed from
Saturday night to Sunday in Meknassa in the region of Relizane in
western Algeria, while 43 others were killed in attacks upon
villages by Islamists.
</P>
<P>
The killing, accompanied with acts of barbarity, is taking on a
character of systematic extermination of inhabitants of whole
villages, and is reaching a climax without precedent since Algeria
plunged into violence six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Although the Algerian authorities remained silent over the
latest killings, the press called the massacres "genocide" and
said that the houses of the "gourbis," or people of misery, are
being destroyed on a daily base while men, women and babies had
their throats cut, burnt alive or mutilated.
</P>
<P>
Reports also said that whole villages, sometimes whole tribes,
are fleeing the areas they live for the centers of government
administration where it is safer.

<HEADLINE> China to Open First Environment Protection Products Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- China's first multi-functional
market exclusively for environmental protection products will open
soon in the country's leading industrial center of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Apart from engaging mainly in the trade of environmental
protection products, the market is also expected to provide

So far, more than 100 research institutions or ventures for
making environment protection products have registered with the
market, which is to occupy a floor space of 3,000 square meters,
to open boothes there.
</P>
<P>
The market is sponsored jointly by the Shanghai Environmental
Protection Bureau, Hongkou District Government and Shanghai
Environment Science Research Institute, which are expected to
collect 80 million yuan (9.6 million US dollars) to build a new
building for the market.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Wang Naidun, director of the Hongkou District
Environmental Protection Bureau, said, the market plans to collect
the latest information of the environmental protection industry
both in China and from overseas with its computer networks, now
under way, and to turn itself into a national information center
of the environmental protection industry.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Decline on Singapore Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to
decline on the Singapore market on Tuesday as the benchmark
Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) lost 56.83 points to close
at 1,439.12 points.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said stock prices plunged by 3.8 percent as the
regional currencies took another beating and market sentiment was
dealt a blow by tumbling regional currencies.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar continued its stride against all major
currencies in Asian trading where the Southeast Asian currencies
declined. The Singapore dollar lost 280 points against the U.S.
dollar to close at 1.7365.
</P>
<P>
The dealers said that while losses were across-the-board, the
property shares took the most severe beating. But some light
bargain hunting lifted the STII off its low of 1,423.25 during the
day's trading.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume was thin at 125.42 million units, worth
268.93 million Singapore dollars (about 154.56 million U.S.
dollars). Declines continued to overwhelm advances by 346 to 32,
while 233 other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Technologies Engineering was the most actively
traded counter as it registered a turnover of 8.24 million units.
It was followed by DBS (Development Bank of Singapore) Land which
had 3.58 million shares traded. RHB Capital was next with 2.99
million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Airlines (SIA) Foreign led the gainers of the day
as it rose by 30 cents to finish at 10.9 Singapore dollars.
Jardine Matheson Holdings (JMH) 500 increased by 23 cents to end
at 2.8 U.S. dollars, while JMH 400 picked up by 20 cents to close
at 5.5 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Creative 50 was the biggest loser as it
declined by 2.4 dollars to end at 33.6 Singapore dollars. Bukit
Sembawang fell by 90 cents to close at 10.1 Singapore dollars.
Roth Malaya lost 70 cents to finish at 12.3 Singapore dollars.

<HEADLINE> Macao Police Step Up Protection of Gold Shops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Macao police sent out more patrol
vehicles on Tuesday in a bid to better protect gold shops from
armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
At the request of local gold shop owners, more police cars and
policemen appeared in the downtown area where gold shops are
located.
</P>
<P>
A group of gold shop owners visited the headquarters of local
security police on Monday, saying they were deeply worried about
the recent wave of robberies of gold shops. They requested more
police presence near their shops.
</P>
<P>
A senior officer of the Security Police Department agreed to
their request while asking them to increase contacts with police
and improve their anti-theft monitoring systems.
</P>
<P>
The officer said some of the video tapes taken from the
monitoring systems of robbed shops show only the back of the
robbers and they are thus useless for police investigation.
</P>
<P>
The owners promised improvements. They say police presence is
more effective than other means such as hiring guards or buying
more insurance.
</P>
<P>
A number of armed robbery cases occurred recently, even in the
 downtown area at daytime. Losses are estimated at more than one
million patacas (about 125,000 U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Northwest China regions Join Hands in Developing Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Five provinces and autonomous
regions in northwest China are vowing each other to enhance
cooperation in designing tourist routes and increasing tourism
transportation capacity in a bid to further tapping their rich
tourism resources.
</P>
<P>
Tourist officials attending a tourism cooperation meeting cited
close geographical proximity and special tourism features as the
condition for the further cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Shaanxi, Gansu and Qinghai provinces, and Ningxia Hui and
Xinjiang Uygur autonomous regions boast unique tourism resources
of special characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Though local tourism was once hindered by relatively
less-developed economy, tourists from both at home and overseas
began to flock to the northwest in recently years to watch the
Terra-Cotta soldiers in Shaanxi, the Dunhuang Grottos in Gansu,
the grand monasteries and the grassland landscape in Qinghai, the
picturesque rivers and deserts in Ningxia, and the unique folklore
of Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
As new opportunities for the development of local tourism have
been increasing, the five regions have been holding a meeting to
discuss tourism cooperation every year since the mid 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the recent meeting called for the further
increase in the number of air flights linking Xi'an, the venue of
the Terra-cotta Soldiers, with Dunhuang.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they hold that it necessary to open an air route
connecting Urumqi, the autonomous regional capital of Xinjiang,
with Dunhuang, and Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
The representative also proposed to work in cooperation to do
promotions at markets in north America, the Middle East, and
central Asia.

<HEADLINE> China To Maintain Quick Pace In 1998: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- China's leading economists and
sociologists forecast that in 1998 the country will continue to
develop with good economic results and stable social order.
</P>
<P>
According to an annual report issued by the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences, the country will see a relatively high economic
growth rate the same as that in 1997, and there will be no sharp
pricehikes.
</P>
<P>
The report was written by a group of leading experts of the
prestigious institute, a think tank for the central government,
based on investigations, analysis and mathematical statistics.
</P>
<P>
The report says that living standards of both urban and rural
residents will be further improved, and the agricultural sector
will have a promising turnover.
</P>
<P>
It forecasts that a series of reform measures will be taken to
turn state-run enterprises into profit-making ones, adding that
publicly-owned firms will continue to dominate the economy, but
the number of private ones will increase.
</P>
<P>
It says that the year will be featured with a rapid growth of
the service industry.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment will become perhaps the biggest headache in 1998,
the report points out, saying that 11 million people will join in
the job-seeking army. Experts suggest that the government place
great emphasis on employment issue when drawing up macro-control
policies.
</P>
<P>
The report also calls for reforms in old-age insurance, medical
care and housing.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the report says, the term of the Eighth National
People's Congress will expire and new government leaders will be
elected. The report says that the government should adopt more
measures to improve its efficiency and govern the country in
accordance with law.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The president of the U.S. Ford
automaker Alex Trotman said Tuesday that the world automobile market
is suffering from a 40 percent overproduction.
</P>
<P>
"There is a 40 percent overcapacity in the world. There is above
all too much capacity in Europe, where the margin of manoeuvre in
automobile sale is becoming weaker and weaker," said Trotman in an
interview with the French economic daily La Tribune.
</P>
<P>
He said that there also exists the problem of automobile
overproduction in the United States, but the types of light trucks,
which are vehicles capable of running in all fields, are selling
well and are expected to take up 50 percent of the U.S. auto market
this year.
</P>
<P>
"The customers love the habitability of these vehicles, the high
position of driving, and the security procured by the four running
wheels," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that Ford reduced 3 billion U.S. dollars of
costs in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso Falls to Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso plunged
further to a new record low of 45.209 pesos against the U.S.
dollar in Tuesday's trading on the Philippine Dealing System
(PDS).
</P>
<P>
The peso averaged 44.810 to the greenback at mid-afternoon on
the PDS, the country's electronic currency exchange, down 3.072
pesos from Monday's reference rate of 41.738 pesos.
</P>
<P>
The peso slid from the opening, trading in a range of 44.35 to
45.209 pesos to the greenback before the market closed, on a thin
turnover of 9.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
No deals were made during the first 30 minutes of trading as
banks refused to buy the peso until financial officials relaxed
volatility limits and allowed the peso to plunge to the record
low.
</P>
<P>
The volatility bands were designed to prevent sharp currency
fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
The peso has depreciated by 71 percent since the currency
crisis hit Southeast Asian nations in early July.
</P>
<P>
"It seems to us that what is driving the currency situation is
the overall (Southeast Asian) situation," Finance Secretary
Roberto de Ocampo said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he expected the Asian currency crisis to
likely stabilize by the end of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Confident of Steady Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos said
Tuesday that the financial woes facing the Philippines currently
are temporary and the country's economic recovery will be steady
after the currency crisis settles down.
</P>
<P>
"There is widely-shared confidence -- here and abroad -- that
our financial woes are temporary, manageable and fully
surmountable," Ramos said in his sixth Report to the Nation.
</P>
<P>
When the turmoil settles down, Ramos said, the country's
"record of good housekeeping and strong economic fundamentals
should serve us well and our recovery will be steady and sure."
</P>
<P>
Despite the continuing depreciation of the country's currency,
the peso, Ramos assured the nation that the current economic
uncertainty constitutes neither a reversal of the gains the
country has made over the past five years nor a failure of the
country's growth strategy.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine peso, which fell to 45.2 to the U.S. dollar
today, has so far depreciated more than 70 percent against the
greenback since its floatation in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, however, said the country is "a victim -- not an author
-- of the storm now engulfing Asia."
</P>
<P>
"Although some enterprises have had to retrench and some
projects had to be abandoned, our financial system remains sound
and stable," he said, adding that no financial institution has so
far been closed down in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to Ramos, one major cause leading to the country's
currency crisis is "the nervous flight of investor confidence from
the region" despite the country's "good housekeeping and sound
fundamentals."
</P>
<P>
Another explanation, Ramos said, is that in the face of
competitive devaluation in the region, the peso cannot afford to
stand still.
</P>
<P>
But he said the country's economic performance in 1997 showed
that the Philippines has avoided the overheating that has built up
in other parts of East Asia.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Asian financial turmoil, the Philippines' gross
national product (GNP) grew by 6 percent in real terms for the
first three quarters of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also cited the robust growth of the country's exports,
surging investments and brisk tourism industry during the first
three quarters of 1997.
</P>
<P>
During the period, the country's merchandise exports grew by 23
percent, helping reduce the trade deficit by 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Foreign and domestic investments in the country more than
quadrupled during the period to 613 billion pesos (15 billion
dollars) from 144 million pesos (3.6 billion dollars) recorded in
the same period of 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The protesters against unemployment continued to occupy on
Monday night 18 government agencies in charge of unemployment
insurance. After one week of anti-unemployment protest, the jobless
people are dividing the unions and the government. The Confederation
Generale du Travail has strongly criticized Nicole Notat, the
general secretary of another union CFDT, who blamed the protesters
on Monday for being manipulated by the government. Meanwhile, the
Minister of Environment Dominique Voynet and the leader of the
Communist Party Robert Hue have also expressed support to the
protesters.
</P>
<P>
-- Seeing the daily massacres which are taking place in Algeria,
the United States went further on Monday than the European Union by
demanding an international investigation into the massacres,
following a mobilization of the Europeans over Algeria. The United
States began to be concerned about the violence in Algeria when the
Algerian army failed to intervene to save the civilians in a wave of
massacres in villages around Algiers last summer. Moreover, the
economic networks of Algeria lack too much transparency while the
American economic interests is Algeria are not small.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The wave of urban violence which hit France on New Year's eve
found a judicial epilogue on Monday in Strasbourg, where four youths
aged from 18 to 24 were given jail sentences for acts of violence
and burning vehicles. The mayor of Strasbourg was forced to
consider measures of prevention and crack-down after the riot on New
Year's eve in the capital of Alsace.
</P>
<P>
-- The Year of the Tiger which will begin within a few weeks
starts bad for the little dragons of Asia. The Thai Minister of
Finance Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda said on Monday that his government
wishes to renegotiate with the International Monetary Fund the
austerity plan they reached upon in August. The South Korean
President-elect Kim Dae-jung reminded the South Koreans that out of
a total 153 billion U.S. dollar foreign debt owed by Seoul, 60
percent need to be repaid in January or February.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Reserves Increase in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The South African Reserve
Bank's gold and foreign exchange reserves jumped by two billion
Rand (408 million U.S. dollars) in December, pushing the total
reserves to 28.5 billion Rand (5.82 billion dollars) by yearend,
local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reserves stood at only 10.3 billion Rand (2.1 billion
dollars) in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
The increase in reserves, which surprised economists, showed
the positive attitude of foreign investors, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The increase in December followed two months of falling
reserves as foreign investors lost appetite for risk in emerging
markets.
</P>
<P>
"The performance suggests that capital flows are once again
going in South Africa's favor," the Business Day newspaper quoted
Bertus van Zyl, a high-ranking Reserve Bank official, as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the increase in reserves did not prevent the plunge
of the Rand to a new low against the dollar at 4.9125 before
recovering slightly to 4.9095 at the end of Monday.
</P>
<P>
Van Zyl said the plunge was inevitable since the dollar was
strong on international markets.
</P>
<P>
He said it would be silly to expect the Rand to remain
unscathed while the dollar powered ahead on international
markets.

<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- China hopes that some countries
would guard against the activities by the Taiwan authorities,
making use of the current financial turmoil in southeast Asia, to
create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan", or to undermine
the relations between these countries and China.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman
Shen Guofang in response to a question concerning the recent visit
of Taiwan's "vice-president" Lien Chan to Singapore on "vacation"
at a press conference here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that Singapore, as a member of the United Nations
and a country having formal diplomatic ties with China, would
observe the related UN resolutions on the Taiwan issue and abide
by the principles set in the Sino-Singaporean joint communique on
the establishment of diplomatic relations, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
China does not oppose unofficial contacts between countries and
Taiwan but it opposes the practice of any country having
diplomatic ties with China to forge any form of official relations
or contacts with Taiwan, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Near 11-Year Lows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar plummeted
to 11-year lows Tuesday, hit hard by a surging U.S. dollar, a soft
gold price and continuing concerns about the Asian currency
crisis.
</P>
<P>
For the first time since October 30, 1986, the local unit
closed below 64 U.S. cents, finishing the session at 63.47.
</P>
<P>
That was more than 1 U.S. cent lower than Monday's close of
64.82 U.S. cents and not far off the currency's low for the day of
63.33.
</P>
<P>
After being sold heavily offshore in response to a stronger
U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen and a slump in the price of
gold, the Australian dollar continued to falter in local trading.
</P>
<P>
Its troubles began following a rise in the greenback against
the Japanese yen, led by safe-haven buying which was caused by the
uncertainty in Asia and flows into bullish U.S. Treasury markets.
</P>
<P>
The slide was then exacerbated by a sharp drop in the price of
gold which recorded an 18-year low of 281 U.S. dollars an ounce
offshore.
</P>
<P>
"The latest wave of selling has been on the back of the opening
markets in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand where those currencies
were sold aggressively at the start," Rothschild Australia manager
Paul Macarounas said.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian rupiah led Southeast Asian currencies down to
new record lows for the third straight trading session of the
year.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian ringgit, the Thai baht, the Philippine peso and
the Singapore dollar all followed suit.
</P>
<P>
"The market has just become totally obsessed with the fact that
the Asian situation is going to get a lot worse," Macquarie Bank
associate director Brent Aggar said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar also ended at 84.83 against the Japanese
yen, from 85.73 on Monday and at 1.1628 Deutsche marks, from
1.1688.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso Falls to Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso plunged
further to a new record low of 45.209 pesos against the U.S.
dollar in Tuesday's trading on the Philippine Dealing System
(PDS).
</P>
<P>
The peso averaged 44.810 to the greenback at mid-afternoon on
the PDS, the country's electronic currency exchange, down 3.072
pesos from Monday's reference rate of 41.738 pesos.
</P>
<P>
The peso slid from the opening, trading in a range of 44.35 to
45.209 pesos to the greenback before the market closed, on a thin
turnover of 9.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
No deals were made during the first 30 minutes of trading as
banks refused to buy the peso until financial officials relaxed
volatility limits and allowed the peso to plunge to the record
low.
</P>
<P>
The volatility bands were designed to prevent sharp currency
fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
The peso has depreciated by 71 percent since the currency
crisis hit Southeast Asian nations in early July.
</P>
<P>
"It seems to us that what is driving the currency situation is
the overall (Southeast Asian) situation," Finance Secretary
Roberto de Ocampo said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he expected the Asian currency crisis to
likely stabilize by the end of 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Yemen expressed its concern over
the U.S.-Turkish-Israeli military maneuvers in the Mediterranean
sea off Lebanese and Syrian coasts.
</P>
<P>
The Saba News Agency today quoted a Yemeni Foreign Ministry
spokesman as saying that the three-way naval drills are a danger
to Arab national security, and do not serve security, stability
and peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Such an action will in no way contribute to establishing the
security and peace sought by all nations of the region, and would
heighten the tension and instability the Middle East is thrown
into because of the stumbling peace process, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The joint exercises, scheduled to be held January 7, have
aroused severe criticism from Arab countries. They said the war
games are a defiance of peace efforts in the region and sounded
alarm over growing Turkish-Israeli military alliance.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed military cooperation agreements in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, which signed peace with Israel in 1994, has announced
to send the commander of its navy to observe the maneuvers billed
as for the purposes of "research and rescue" by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Bill on Full Foreign Ownership in Kuwait Finalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investors will be
able to set up independent ventures in Kuwait soon as a new bill
allowing full foreign ownership has been finalized, according to
official sources today.
</P>
<P>
A committee formed to study the draft law of foreign
investments completed its final reading of the bill last Saturday
and will relegate it to the cabinet for endorsement, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
The draft is part of a wider government strategy that is in
connection with the nation's privatization program to expand
private sector growth and an economic reform plan.
</P>
<P>
The bill allows for the first time in Kuwait any non-Kuwaiti
to hold 100 percent of a company through a license granted by the
Ministry of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors are currently allowed to own only up to 49
percent shares in companies in Kuwait and levied by high local
corporate taxes.
</P>
<P>
These have been considered two of the main stumbling blocks to
attracting foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
The bill allows foreign investors to recruit foreign manpower
if local workers are not available.
</P>
<P>
It also speaks of possible allocation of "necessary land and
real estate for the purposes of the investments" as well as
partial or complete exemption from customs duties for machines,
equipment and materials required by the investor.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, a foreign investor will be entitled to
transferring his profits and capital abroad and to another foreign
investors or national investors, provided the investments are
"environmentally sound."
</P>
<P>
Various authorities in the country hailed the draft law as a
positive first step as they think foreign investments would
introduce Kuwaiti to new technologies and create opportunities for
the private sector.
</P>
<P>
But they expressed fear that Kuwaitis would be dislodged from
their jobs as a result of the implementation of the new bill which
encourages the privatization process in the country.

<HEADLINE> Divorce up 13 percent in Ho Chi Minh City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Divorce rate in Ho Chi Minh city,
the largest city of Vietnam, increased 13 percent in 1997 over
1996, the "Vietnam News" reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Out of 4,415 couples applying for divorce, 2,865 couples
successfully obtained divorces through the courts, the
English-language Daily quoted statistics from the Ho Chi Minh city
People's court as reporting.
</P>
<P>
Judicial authorities presiding over divorce cases in Ho Chi
Minh city blame the increasing rate of divorce on disappearing
of traditional family values.
</P>
<P>
Some judges believe that Vietnam must work hard to restore
family traditions and educate the young people on love, marriage
and family.
</P>
<P>
Impatience and a lack of respect for family values can both
impede conciliation, according to district judges.
</P>
<P>
Once divorce, the "Vietnam News" said, many fathers do not
perform their obligations to bring up their children.
</P>
<P>
Divorced fathers who refuse to financially support their
children may be inadvertently forced to try and earn their
own money on city streets, the daily added.

<HEADLINE> Year-ender: Cyprus Peace Process Keeps Moving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The year 1997 witnessed some
movements toward a settlement to the protracted Cyprus problem,
but there was no breakthrough despite rounds of direct talks
between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides.
</P>
<P>
Under a proposal by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Cyprus
President, Greek Cypriot leader Glafcos Clerides and Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash met for the first time in four
years, in Troutbeck, near New York, in July to discuss ways of
solving the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
In August, the second round of direct negotiations between
Clerides and Denktash, chaired by the U.N. Secretary-General's
Special Advisor for Cyprus issue Diego Cordovez, was held in
Glion-sur-Montreaux, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately the five-day talks ended in failure as the
Turkish Cypriot side, which enjoys overall support of Turkey,
insisted on the suspension first by the European Union (EU) of its
planned accession negotiations with Cypriot government which is
protected by Greece, a staunch enemy of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Denktash charged the EU for throwing a "bombshell" into the
peace process by deciding to open accession talks with Cyprus
government next year.
</P>
<P>
In spite of failure of two rounds of direct negotiations, the
two leaders had two meetings in Nicosia, sponsored by the
U.N. Resident Representative in Cyprus Gustave Feissel, to discuss
the humanitarian issues.
</P>
<P>
They reached an agreement on solving the long-standing issue
of missing persons during wars of the two communities on the
island, which constitutes an important aspect of the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two sides would exchange information
regarding the location of graves and prepare the necessary
arrangement leading to the return of the remains of the missing
persons.
</P>
<P>
This east Mediterranean island has been divided into the Greek
Cypriot-dominated south and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since
1974 when Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern
third in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1619 Greek Cypriots and Greeks were listed as
missing persons after Turkish military intervention in 1974, while
the Turkish Cypriot side claims there are around 500 Turkish
Cypriots missing since the intercommunal clashes that broke out
in 1963.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Denktash also agreed on exchange of visits for
pilgrimage by Greek and Turkish Cypriots, who have been
prohibited to cross the 180-kilometer-long U.N.-controlled buffer
zone since 1974.
</P>
<P>
Through these talks, it appears that at present the major
obstacle to the island's peace process is the issue of Cyprus' EU
accession.

<HEADLINE> Year-ender: Cyprus Peace Process Keeps Moving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 18 (Xinhua) --
</P>
<P>
Through these talks, it appears that at present the major
obstacle to the island's peace process is the issue of Cyprus' EU
accession.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus submitted its application to the EU for full membership
in 1990 and believed that the accession cause could serve as a
catalyst for the resolution of the Cyprus problem, taking the EU
as its possible supporter vis-a-vis Turkey which has maintained
more than 30,000 troops in the Turkish-Cypriots controlled north.
</P>
<P>
The EU decided in March 1995 that the accession talks
with Cyprus would start six months after the end of the EU
Intergovernmental Conference.
</P>
<P>
However, the EU's decision was rejected by Turkey and the
Turkish Cypriot side, who maintained that Cyprus can not join the
EU before a Cyprus settlement and before Turkey becomes an EU
member.
</P>
<P>
Following an European Commission's reaffirmation on July 15
that the accession talks with Cyprus will begin in Spring
1998, Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot regime announced on July
20 a series of steps toward partial integration of the Turkish
occupied northern Cyprus with Turkey, a move apparently designed
to check the accession process.
</P>
<P>
But the EU did not give in to the Turkish integration threat
and decided in its Luxembourg summit in December to start
accession talks with Cyprus and five other central and eastern
European countries in Spring 1998.
</P>
<P>
The EU's move once again triggered furious reactions from
Denktash, who threatened to slammed the door on any further
inter-communal talks in the wake of the EU decision.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying that "the inter-communal talks have
died and under these conditions and a federation is not on the
agenda."
</P>
<P>
Denktash's statement has blocked the implementation of an
agreement reached between the two sides during visits to the
island by U.S. Presidential Emissary Richard Holbrooke and U.N.
envoy Diego Cordovez in November that direct negotiations between
the two leaders will resume next March, after the February
presidential elections in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. Resident Representative in Cyprus Gustave
Feissel, in response to the Turkish Cypriot reaction at the EU's
decision, had urged the two Cypriot sides to keep cool and adhere
to the primary objective of solving the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot President Clerides seems to be optimistic on a solution
to the Cyprus problem, saying that prospects for a Cyprus
settlement in 1998 will be good.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the U.N. and the U.S. are expected to intensify their
efforts to bring the two communities' leaders back to the
negotiating table despite Denktash's refusal to further
inter-communal talks in retaliation to the EU's decision.
</P>
<P>
But observers here noted that thorny issues concerning Cyprus
problem in the peace formulas, such as sovereignty, rotating
presidency, territorial adjustment and security for two
communities, have remained unsolved. Therefore, prospects of a
comprehensive settlement in Cyprus remain vague.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Liberalizes Shipping Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's parliament, the People's
Assembly, has approved a law allowing local and foreign private
firms to compete with state-owned shipping companies, the Egyptian
Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
The law, passed on Monday, allows the private sector to operate
maritime transport lines and provide maintenance, supply and
repairing services formerly monopolized by the state companies.
</P>
<P>
It is part of the country's drive to liberalize its economy and
increase foreign and private investment, according to Egyptian
Prime Minister Kamal El-Ganzouri.
</P>
<P>
"What we look for is enhancing public interest and spurring the
Egyptian economy to widen the prospects of development," he told
the People's Assembly on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The law came in response to a demand by a host of economic
institutions that relevant curbs be lifted, Soliman Metwalli
Soliman, minister of transport and communications, explained to
the lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
With the passage of the legislation, said Metwalli, the area
will be open to joint work and competition between public
enterprises and the private sector in an effort to provide better
services at lower costs.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the handling capacity of Egypt's
ports reached 54 million tons last year.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls on UN to End Massacres in Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran has called on the United
Nations to take immediate and constructive measures to put an end
to the massacres in Algeria, the local daily Iran News reported
today.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent on Monday to U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi expressed regret
for the "brutal and inhumane massacre of innocent Algerian women
and children and men."
</P>
<P>
He urged Annan to use all his power to bring the human tragedy
to a speedy end through contacts and consultations with all the
concerned parties.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi, who country is now the chairman of the Organization
of the Islamic Conference, also deplored the silence of the
international community over the carnage.
</P>
<P>
"What causes further concern and anxiety is the suspicious
indifference and silence of the international community and
especially the Western countries." he said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Algerians were slain last week by unidentified
militants.
</P>
<P>
About 80,000 people have been killed in the Islamic insurgency
since 1992 when the military-backed Algerian government canceled a
parliamentary election in which the Islamic Salvation Front was
poised to win.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that "such barbaric massacres run counter to
Islamic humanitarian principles, values, norms and practices, and
constitute a dangerous and painful conspiracy which distorts the
image of Islam and Muslims across the world".

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Higher on Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Banks led the Australian share
market higher again Tuesday because of the strong bond market,
with the all ordinaries index regaining lost territory since
October 22, the day before the market went on a four-trading-day
slide.
</P>
<P>
Brokers also said that there was off-shore buying in industrial
stocks and futures, with United States investors believed to be
the major buyers.
</P>
<P>
"It was a market continuation or reaction to a very strong bond
market, and it was valuation-driven buying because industrials
relative to bonds looked quite cheap," boutique funds manager and
investment house AUSBIL Partners equities director Paul Xiradis
said.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed up 41 points at 2685.3. The
stock market, however, was still well below its peak of 2779.2
reached on September 22.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the all ordinaries index surpassed the October 22
closing level of 2682.9.
</P>
<P>
The bank sector gained 150.4 points, or 2.70 percent, to 5718.9
points, with National Australia Bank leading the market overall.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Bank of Australia also closed at a record high, up
35 cents, while Westpac Banking Corp was up 24 and ANZ Banking
Group was up 19.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index gained 92.5 points at 4616.4, but the
all resources index was down 3.2 points at 1142.9.
</P>
<P>
Falls in commodity prices and the potential impact of the Asian
meltdown on commodity exports has hit resource stocks hard.
</P>
<P>
The gold index slumped 27.2 points to 1002.3, wiping out the
gains in the sector made before the New Year. Gold bullion also
hit a fresh 18-year low on Tuesday as investors appeared to agree
with the economic textbooks that the precious metal was no longer
needed as a hedge against inflation.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 317.0 million shares with a value of
895.46 million Australian dollars (582 million U.S. dollars), and
rises of 595 outnumbered falls of 539.

<HEADLINE> US to Spearhead New Initiative on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
is set to spearhead a new initiative in the Middle East peace
process, the visiting U.S. congressman Nick Rahall has said.
</P>
<P>
Rahall, who is heading a 18-member delegation of
U.S. congressmen on a three-day visit to Lebanon, made the remarks
in an exclusive interview published today by the local English
paper the Daily Star.
</P>
<P>
He said the Clinton administration was in the process of
reversing its traditional bias in favor of Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said to the paper that after the conversation he had with
Clinton during a round of golf they played, he "understood from the
president that he is going to get more personally involved in the
peace process in the remaining three years of his term. I think
that he wants to make the Middle East peace agreement a legacy of
his administration."
</P>
<P>
The West Virginia democrat added that Clinton had expressed
his frustration at being unable to rally support among Arab
nations against Iraqi president Saddam Hussein, but he fully
understands that Arab nations would not support the U.S. until
they believe that the U.S. policy is no longer backing Israel.
</P>
<P>
Rahall and some of his delegation members are of Lebanese
descent. They came to Beirut on Sunday night and had held talks
with the country's President Elias Hrawi and Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri and House Speaker Nabih Berry on bilateral relations and
regional issues, especially south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector Emerging as Major Employer in Southern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Non-government businesses in
China's Guangdong Province, mainly in the private sector, have
become a major source of employment recently.
</P>
<P>
The province now has more than 1.53 million privately-run
household businesses and larger companies, with 11.68 billion yuan
in registered capital. They employ nearly four million people,
providing a great deal of relief to the local economy, according
to a labor service official.
</P>
<P>
The demand for laborers has been dropping four percent annually
in recent years as reforms continue, and as the state-owned and
collective sectors contribute less to the national economy,
leaving 760,000 workers jobless in Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the non-government economy in electronics,
clothing, and electrical appliances is doing well and added
120,000 jobs in the first three quarters of last year, accounting
for nearly half the province's total.
</P>
<P>
In the city of Dongguan, there are approximately one million
people working in foreign-funded enterprises, while only 120,000
work in the state sector.
</P>
<P>
The province estimates that there will be 450,000 redundant
workers annually during the 1996-2000 period, putting great
pressure on the economy. However, the growing non-government
sector, especially private businesses, will certainly have a role
to play in solving this problem.

<HEADLINE> Hope Schools For Sui Nationality In Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Some 8,000 Sui Nationality
children in southwest China's Guizhou Province have moved to new
classrooms in 21 Hope schools that were completed recently.
</P>
<P>
The schools were built with the help of donations from
businesses in the city of Shenzhen, one of China's special
economic zones in Guangdong Province, south China. They are
located in Guizhou's Sandu Sui Nationality Autonomous County,
where many young people had to drop out because of poor economic
conditions.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, a group of 400,000 people in Shenzhen donated 13.3
million yuan to the Hope Project fund.
</P>
<P>
In one year, Sandu County used 10.3 million yuan to build the
21 schools, which added 23,800 sq.m. of schoolrooms.
</P>
<P>
The county also used 3 million yuan to help 3,000 youngsters
who had dropped out return to school.
</P>
<P>
Li Wenzhi, the county's Party secretary, says that the aid from
Shenzhen has helped the Sui people escape their illiterate state.
</P>
<P>
The drop-out rate in the county fell from 1995's 12 percent to
2 percent in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti PM Rules Out Cabinet Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Prime Minister
Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah has denied reports about a
cabinet reshuffle or a plan to dissolve the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
According to local media today, the crown prince also turned
down the resignation of Finance Minister Nasser Abdullah Al-Rudhan.
</P>
<P>
There will be "no dissolution of the Assembly, no cabinet
resignation and no reshuffle," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Local reports had said that a cabinet reshuffle or dissolution
of the parliament may take place because of Al-Rudhan, who
submitted his resignation to the prime minister on November 15.
</P>
<P>
Al-Rudhan said he thought of quitting the post last July after
facing interpellations by three parliament members over alleged
financial mismanagement, irregularities in handling public funds
and negligence leading to sizable losses by Kuwait Airways
Corporation and the Public Institution for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, religious groups and liberals in the 50-seat
parliament have been preparing a second grilling at the finance
minister, who has answered 168 questions in the parliament over the
past two months.
</P>
<P>
This made him angrily assert that it is difficult to work in
such an environment.
</P>
<P>
The situation, which has strained the relations between the
parliament and the cabinet, is believed to be on the brink of a
political crisis that may lead to a cabinet reshuffle or the
dissolution of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
But Sheikh Saad stressed that government decisions cannot be
based on reactions or emotions, saying that there is no discussion
of government reshuffle or dissolving the parliament.
</P>
<P>
"Al-Rudhan is a dedicated colleague who has exerted a huge
effort. I want him to continue because I am sure he is still
capable of performing," said the prime minister.

<TEXT>
<P>
PERTH, Australia, January 6 (Xinhua) -- World swimming's
governing body FINA on Tuesday has decided to retain four-year
penalties for first doping offenders.
</P>
<P>
At its Congress on the eve of the world swimming championships,
FINA president Mustapha Lafaoui called a halt to a debate on
whether to move to two-year bans.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from Australia, Britain, Barbados and Denmark spoke
for retaining four-year bans.
</P>
<P>
The IOC wants all sports to meet standard two-year bans for
first offenders because of difficulty in forcing four-year
suspensions in the face of international court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
The International Amateur Athletic Federation has changed their
bans to two years.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, FINA leaders pushed for a return to a two-year ban,
citing costly litigation and legal problems with the four-year
sanction.
</P>
<P>
But the shorter penalty was rejected when Congress delegates
from the United States, Australia and Britain spoke strongly
against it.

and investment sectors. It will introduce 10 cooperative projects
involving 30 million US dollars each.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the city has approved 3,600 overseas-funded
projects, attracting 6 billion US dollars of overseas investment,
with technology and urban infrastructure accounting for a large
number.
</P>
<P>
The city now has 14 overseas-funded projects that involve 30
million US dollars of investment each and it is expected to have
at least 1.3 billion US dollars of foreign trade for 1997, an
increase of 41 percent since 1992.
</P>
<P>
As a state-level development project, the Shenyang Economic and
Technological Development Zone has introduced 470 million US
dollars of overseas investment to set up 620 enterprises, which
can earn 400 million US dollars in foreign trade a year.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Muslim Rebel Admits Foreign Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) Tuesday admitted to have been recipient of foreign
support, including those coming from Western countries, especially
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Al Haj Murad, MILF vice-chairman for military affairs,
confirmed foreign sources have substantially contributed to their
cause for the past years, the Philippine News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we do receive foreign funding, some of which come from
American-Arab brothers," Murad was quoted by the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
Most of the state-of-the-art communications and computer
facilities found at Camp Abubakar, MILF largest camp in Central
Mindanao, were acquired through the help of generous American-Arab
donors, Murad said.
</P>
<P>
Camp Abubakar boasts of modern computer stations, facsimile
machines and internet connections as well as local and
international satellite phone facilities.
</P>
<P>
The MILF also declared to have acquired sophisticated weapons,
like a battery of mobile surface-to-air-missiles, which require
radar and computer facilities.
</P>
<P>
But the military dismissed this as "pure fantasy." However,
Romeo Padiernos, Southern Command chief of the Armed Forces of the
Philippines, admitted that if the reports are true, the army would
be placed in a difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
The rebel group also claimed to have been manufacturing its own
anti-tank weapons inside Camp Abubakar, including rocket propelled
grenades, a shoulder-fired weapon effective in short distance
encounters.
</P>
<P>
Lately, the MILF also boasted of some 180,000 fully-armed
fighters in Mindanao. The military, however, estimated the group's
strength of more than 8,000 men only, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is presently the biggest Muslim separatist
organization in the country, which broke away from the Muslim
National Liberation Front, a former Muslim group which forged
peace accord with the government in September 1996.

Dollars each into the Zimbabwe Ex-Combatants Foundation (ZECF)

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Liberalize Oil Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will this year liberalize
oil imports to help lower petroleum product prices, the Financial
Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the weekly newspaper, the country's energy
regulatory board has decided to liberalize the import of crude
oil feedstocks this year.
</P>
<P>
From now on anybody who has all the necessary requirements and
permits will be allowed to import oil feedstock, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's fuel prices are the highest in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia National Oil Company spent about 80 million U.S.
dollars on crude oil imports last year, the newspaper said,
adding that it is likely to spend less this year thanks to the
liberalization policy.

<HEADLINE> Ansett Airline to Suspend Australia-ROK Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Australia's second largest
airline Ansett announced Tuesday it would suspend its bi-weekly
flights between Australia and the Republic of Korea from February
6.
</P>
<P>
Ansett International General Manager Craig Wallace said the
economic crisis in Seoul meant that its Korean services,
inaugurated in 1996, were no longer commercially viable.
</P>
<P>
He said a sharp decline in the value of the Korean won and
restrictions on the promotion of outbound tourism from Korea had
resulted in a fall in passenger numbers.
</P>
<P>
The move follows the decision made by Qantas, Australia's
largest airline, last week to suspend its four-times-a-week
service to ROK from February 1.
</P>
<P>
Qantas Airways Ltd. said it had in the past month experienced a
drop in nearly 65 percent in demand for seats on the route,
compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The Australian tourism industry said it was concerned about the
suspension.
</P>
<P>
Australian Tourist Commission Managing Director John Morse said
the effects of the Korean economic crisis on Australia's tourism
industry were short to mid term and the long term future was
positive.
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned about the implications of this morning's
announcement by Ansett to suspend services to South Korea," Morse
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"However, we acknowledge the airlines need to make tough
commercial decisions which may not always be in the best interests
of Australia's tourism industry."
</P>
<P>
Until recent months Korea was Australia's fastest growing
tourism market which, Morse said, accounted for six percent of the
total visitor arrivals to Australia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tourism Council Australia General Manager Scott
Morrison said strong industry growth could be maintained through
new markets, such as India and China.

SHANGHAI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Exchanges between Shanghai and

</P>
<P>
They had 363 bilateral exchange programs last year, with
educational and cultural programs accounting for the majority,
according to the Taiwan Affairs Office of the Shanghai Municipal
Government.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to exchanges between institutions of higher learning,
academic seminars and lectures became more common.
</P>
<P>
Huai Opera, which is popular in northern Jiangsu Province but
which received scant attention previously, aroused the interest of
Taiwan residents when it was performed on the island.
</P>
<P>
Other cultural exchanges like the Kun Opera, puppet shows, and
exhibitions were successful on the island. And some Taiwan
organizations for the arts sent groups to Shanghai, and a music
festival was held there.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between television stations increased last year as
well, and there was a special program during the Moon Festival
with a live broadcast for television viewers on both sides of the
Taiwan Straits via satellite.
</P>
<P>
Exchanges of telecommunications personnel also took on a new
look, and some unofficial scientific and commercial organizations
established channels for future exchanges and cooperation.

DAR ES SALAAM, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President has

honor and respect" not only to Kenyans but also the entire
African continent, according to the Daily News today.

"The success has shown clearly that Kenya and other African
states do not need to be taught democracy because they know
exactly who and who to vote for in their own interests," the

<P>
Mkapa promised Tanzania's full support for Kenya in pursuit of
a more cohesive East African Co-operation, saying that Kenya's
elections will accelerate the cooperation pace in the coming five

President Daniel arap Moi, 73, was officially sworn in for his
fifth and final five-year term yesterday after winning a decisive
victory in the December 29-30 elections.

Mkapa also appealed to the Kenyans to "bury the hatchet" after
general election, striving to forge peace and unity which are
essential for national development.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Museveni, who also attended the ceremony,
pledged full co-operation in fostering the economic development
in the region.

CANBERRA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Melbourne City Council will
begin its business partnership with its sister city Tianjin by
opening an office in the Chinese port city, Lord Mayor Ivan
Deveson said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Melbourne Office is a first for Australian local
government and will promote two way business and investment
between Melbourne and Tianjin - the third largest city in China,"
Deveson said.
</P>
<P>
Melbourne is the second largest industrial and commercial city
in Australia following Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The Melbourne Office is intended to operate as a base in
Tianjin for Australian and Chinese business and government
networks, he was quoted by the Australian Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
But the news agency did not say when it would open.
</P>
<P>
A Melbourne City Council spokesman said the idea is to provide
"a foot in the door" for companies wishing to establish businesses
overseas.
</P>
<P>
"We believe Tianjin has been, and will continue to be a hotspot
for foreign investment in China," said Bill O'Sheam, president of
the Australia China Business Council (Victorian state).
</P>
<P>
"It has a switched-on government which is able to fast-track
approvals and one of the best deep-water ports in China," said the
president.
</P>
<P>
Deveson said the opening of Melbourne's office would facilitate
other exchanges between the two cities, such as artistic
scholarships and discussions on city management.

It is expected that a total of 6200 jobs will be created by

<HEADLINE> Corruption Behind Pretoria Prison Escape: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Corrupt prison officials
probably helped six dangerous awaiting-trial prisoners escape
from South Africa's Pretoria Local Prison on December 5, The Star
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The task team assigned to investigate the jail break had
passed its conclusions, along with specific recommendations to
President Nelson Mandela and the office of Justice Minister
Dullah Omar, head of the team, Stefan Grobler, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We have strong evidence of corruption, and are moving on to
the next step which is to recapture the six men," Grobler said.
</P>
<P>
The six men, all still at large, were involved in
multi-million-dollar robberies and crime syndicates.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to prove the corruption and in order to do this we
need to re-arrest the six fugitives and, through questioning, get
them to reveal their inside contacts -- people either in
correctional services or the police," Grobler said.
</P>
<P>
He said he was confident that these men will be recaptured,
but didn't say how and when.
</P>
<P>
The findings of the task team will not be made public until
they had been handled by relevant ministries, Grobler said.
</P>
<P>
Jail breaks are frequent in South Africa. A total of 678
prisoners escaped in November and December alone.
</P>
<P>
The opposition National Party called for an independent
investigation into the problems within the Department of
Correctional Services while the United Democratic Movement also
urged the government to appoint an independent commission to
investigate deficiencies in the police and correctional services.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Launch Reforms to Stabilize Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said Tuesday that the government will launch "a second generation
of reforms" to stabilize the economy and increase economic
competitiveness in the global market.
</P>
<P>
In his 1997 year-end report, Ramos said the current financial
crisis provides an opportunity for the Philippines to strengthen
the economy by "launching a second generation of reforms crucial
to our economic stability and competitiveness in the world
economy."
</P>
<P>
Addressing hundreds of government officials and foreign
diplomats, Ramos said it is just "a matter of time, of good
management, and of resolute leadership" for the country to recover
from the spreading currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
On top of the six key reform measures is the completion of the
policy environment to make the economy more competitive in the
world and more resilient against shocks and crises, Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
Under this measure, the country will enact, among other vital
bills, fisheries and land use codes, a new oil deregulation law
and an anti-corruption bill.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Nagano Gets First Big Snowfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The first major snowfall of the
winter fell on the land of Hakuba on Tuesday, just one month
before the start of the Nagano Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
It began snowing early on Tuesday, the same day a torch relay
carrying the Olympic flame got under way.
</P>
<P>
By mid-afternoon about 20 centimeters (eight inches) had
fallen in Hakuba, where the cross country and many of the Alpine
skiing events will take place.
</P>
<P>
A lack of snow in the mountain resort, 50 km (30 miles) from
Nagano, had raised concerns about preparations for the February
7-22 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"It has already snowed 20 centimetres in Hakuba and I'm
expecting about 10 more (four inches) by midnight," Nagano
Organising Committee weather official Tamahiro Kimino said.
</P>
<P>
"But I'm not sure how many snowfall days there will be for the
rest of January," Kimino said.
</P>
<P>
The torch relay started on Tuesday in three different
locations in Japan on a 33-day journey. The three flames will be
carried by a total of 1,150 runners through all 47 of Japan's
prefectures.
</P>
<P>
The three flames will be reunited in Nagano on February 6,
one day before the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
A warmer-than-normal winter so far has meant that any snow
which has fallen in Nagano city and on the lower sections of
nearby mountains has melted.
</P>
<P>
The average temperature in December in Nagano was 2.8
degrees Celsius (37 Fahreneit), compared to a normal average of
1.7 C (35 F), Kimino said.

<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A group of experts from
Beijing's universities and research institutes have become an
important part of construction planning in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Since its founding in 1987, the Beijing Urban Science Research

</P>
<P>
The research institute has cooperated with counterparts in
Tianjin, the port city to the east of Beijing, and with Hebei
Province that surrounds Beijing in organizing five symposiums that
focused on urban planning in the three areas.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that a joint planning proposal has been approved by
the State Council.

<HEADLINE> Minesweeping Operation On Sino-Vietnamese Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese troops in the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region have cleared mines from 1 million
sq.m. of land in an operation beginning on November 28 along the
Sino-Vietnamese Border.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Daxiong, deputy commander of the Guangxi Military Area
Command, said the minesweeping operation, the second since the
early 1990s when China and Vietnam restored relations, is expected
to clear 120 zones on nearly 20 million sq.m. of ground within
three years.
</P>
<P>
Some tens of thousands of mines consisting of 18 types were
removed or exploded in one month.
</P>
<P>
The operation will move on to Fangchenggang, Ningming,
Pingxiang, Jingxi and other Chinese border cities by order of the
State Council and the Central Military Commission, Qiu said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that many of the mined areas are on mountainous
slopes where people did not want to risk their lives travelling
during the past decade. The grass there is head high and even the
most advanced mine detectors are of little use, so Chinese troops
have to use explosives to remove mines buried beneath the surface.
</P>
<P>
In the minesweeping action in 1993, border defense troops in
Guangxi removed more than 600,000 mines and restored 18,000
hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
The operation also helped open 25 border trade places and nine
ports of entry for border trade between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> S. African Police to Curb Jailbreaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 6 (Xinhua) -- South African police
authorities have vowed to implement drastic measures to reduce
the number of jailbreaks and escapes from captivity by inmates.
</P>
<P>
A project has been registered to upgrade 1,410 cells, said
Crime Prevention and Response Service spokesman Lazarus
Tlomatsana Monday, adding the project was "just about to be
completed".
</P>
<P>
"Provincial commissioners have for their part prepared and
submitted contingency plans to curb escapes on ground levels.
</P>
<P>
"The police and the Center for Scientific and Industrial
Research are looking into the possible implementation of closed
circuit television monitors and movement detectors," Tlomatsana
said.
</P>
<P>
"There will be security inspections in prisons during the day
and at night. We will also see to the installation of electric
fences and X-ray scanners in some 'high risk' prisons, he said.
</P>
<P>
Police confirmed recently that 1,615 prisoners escaped from
prisons throughout the country last year.
</P>
<P>
Those who have escaped succeeded by breaking out of cells,
escaping while en route to and from court or while in transit or
during investigations and jumping fences at clinics and
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Correctional Services spokesman Russel Mamabolo said the main
contributory factor to the high number of escapes were negligency
by personnel, insufficient electronic aids, poor conditions of
building structures, overpopulation of cells and manpower
shortage of more than 6,000 staff members countrywide.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- All passengers and crew are sound
and safe after an Iranian airliner was forced to make an emergency
landing on a desert in central Iran Monday night, Iran's radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran-bound plane with 113 people - 104 passengers and
nine crew members - on board was forced to land in the desert due
to a unspecified technical failure.
</P>
<P>
The radio said the Iranian aviation authorities failed to
locate the landing place due to the darkness at night.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this morning, the helicopters searching for the plane
found it in the desert east to the ancient city of Isfahan, about
400 kilometers south of the capital.
</P>
<P>
All the 104 passengers have been moved from the plane to a
hotel in the nearby town, the radio said, and the passengers would
be transferred to Tehran by another plane this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The plane, whose type was not mentioned, was flying from
Orumiye, in the westernmost part of the country to Tehran. But due
to the bad weather, it could not land at Tehran airport and was
directed to Isfahan.
</P>
<P>
Around 22:00 local times (18:30 GMT) Monday night, the plane
disappeared from the control radar. Soon after the incident,
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami ordered relief groups to be
rushed to the desert to search and rescue the people on board.

GUANGZHOU, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A legal assistance system that
emerged in Guangzhou, the capital of China's Guangdong Province,
about two years ago, is showing signs of maturity.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong, which was in the vanguard in China's opening-up
drive, was a logical place for the Guangzhou Legal Assistance
Center, which opened in November 1995 as the country's first
center of its kind. A number of regulations on the use of legal
assistance have been developed by the city to help the development
of the center.
</P>
<P>
It has a large group of lawyers, some of them part-time, some
full-time.
</P>

In the past year, the center has dealt with 600 criminal and
civil cases, including one involving a 15-million-yuan robbery in
Guangdong's Fanyu, which put the center in the public eye.

SINGAPORE, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Share prices declined sharply
on the Singapore market on Tuesday as the benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index plunged by 63.13 points to end the morning
session of trading at 1432.82 points, the lowest level in more
than five years.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said share prices plummeted by 4.2 percent, reflecting
investors' concerns over the falling Asian currencies, which took
a tumble on Monday, with the Indonesian rupiah, Thai baht,
Malaysian ringgit and Philippine peso dropping to new record lows.
</P>
<P>
The sell-off in the stock market "is basically
currency-driven," said a dealer with a foreign brokerage house.
</P>
<P>
However, other dealers here said the thin trading conditions
had exaggerated the losses in share prices as some panicky
investors dumped their positions.

<P>
The market volume stood at 56.64 million units, valued at
124.07 million Singapore dollars (about 72.13 million U.S.
dollars). There were 296 counters that declined while only 13
stocks registered increases and a total of 302 stocks remained
steady.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Seek Review of IMF Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Thai Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda has moved ahead his planned meeting with
International Monetary Fund (IMF) officials to review the terms on
the IMF providing a 17.2 billion U.S. dollar bailout package.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin had planned to visit the United States in February for
talks with the IMF officials, but the trip has been moved to
January due to the urgency of the situation, the Bangkok Post
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On Monday the Thai currency baht broke through the major
psychological barrier of 50 baht to the U.S. dollar by hitting
51.1 baht, before rebounding to 49.8 per dollar.
</P>
<P>
The plunge of the baht on the first trading day following the
new year holiday drove the baht further near the next major
psychological notch of 51.58, at which the baht will have lost 100
percent of its value against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
When the IMF bailout package was drawn out last August, the IMF
was somewhat too optimistic about Thailand's economy and based its
terms on 33 baht to the dollar. Before July 2 last year when the
baht was allowed to float, the exchange rate was 25.79 baht to the
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
With the further fluctuation of the baht and the credit crunch,
it 1s now almost impossible for Thailand to meet the IMF condition
of maintaining a budget surplus equal to 1 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP), or about 69 billion baht (1.38 billion
dollars) in fiscal 1998, which ends on September 30, the Bangkok
Post Tuesday quotes Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai as saying on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that other issues which Tarrin will
discuss with IMF officials include Thailand's economic growth
targets for 1998 and domestic interest rate policies.
</P>
<P>
Last month, some Thai state agencies said the economy was
likely to register a negative growth in 1998, as compared to an
IMF request of between zero and one percent economic growth.
</P>
<P>
High interest rates have kept ailing investors from seeking
loans, which are essential for revitalizing businesses.
</P>
<P>
A downward revision in GDP targets could ease pressure on the
government to further slash the budget in order to generate a
surplus of one percent as agreed with the IMF before.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment in Indonesia to Reach 5.8 million in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in Indonesia with
the economy growing at an estimated 3.5 percent is predicted to
increase by 1.4 million in 1998, while in 1997 the unemployment
people totaled 4.4 million, government sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to data released by the Ministry of Manpower on
Monday, if the economy is growing by only 3.5 percent in 1998, as
economists have predicted, only 1.3 million of the 2.7 million
increase in the workforce would be get a job this year.
</P>
<P>
Thus, unemployed people would increase by 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, workers associations and employers organizations
have estimated that 800,000 workers in the property and
construction sector lost their job, while 300,000 in the textile
and garment industries have been laid off, and another 100,000 in
some other sectors have been dismissed.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have warned that unemployment rate in the country
would rise from seven percent of the total 90 million-strong
workforce in 1995 to 11 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Since the monetary crisis hit the country early July, a lot of
middle and small factories have been closed. The Indonesia rupiah
has lost more than 100 percent of its value against the U.S.
dollar in the past seven months.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Indonesia's economic growth was 7.8 percent. Some
economists predicted the growth will drop to 5 percent in 1997 and
2 to 3 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Stagflation, in which economic growth reached only 3.5 percent,
while inflation may reach two digits, will lower the purchasing
power of the people, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
To overcome all these economic ills, the ministry held that
liquidity must be enhanced, public confidence in the government
must be restored, and transparency in monetary and economic
policies would be a necessity.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Exported 138 Million Tons Of Iron In 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Brazil exported last year 138
million tons of iron, which means a 30-million-ton rise against
1996.
</P>
<P>
Iron exports were worth three billion dollars, said Monday the
Vale Do Rio Doce company, the leading Brazilian exporter of
minerals.
</P>
<P>
This year, Brazil is expected to export more than 140 million
tons of the product.
</P>
<P>
The company announced that Brazilian iron exporters are meeting
Japanese and German clients next January 12 and 13 in order to
discuss export quotas of iron as well as international prices.
</P>
<P>
Japanese buyers want to keep iron prices at similar levels to
those in 1997 (17.7 dollars per ton). But Brazil argues that the
real price for an iron ton is 18.77 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian iron producer said that during 1996, 393 million
tons of iron were traded worldwide and that amount rose in 1997 to
425 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Brazil and Australia made up 65 percent of the total world
trade of iron last year.
</P>
<P>
Iron trade could reach 450 million tons worldwide by 2000, said
sources of Vale Do Rio Doce.

<P>
The industrial output of these firms reached 958.8 billion yuan
in the first 11 months of last year, accounting for 40.9 percent

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Bottoms at 6,700 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian currency of
rupiah hit a historic low of 6,700 against the U.S. dollar Monday
on continuing corporate demand for dollar and weakness in regional
currency markets, dealers here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Spot rupiah closed at 6,600/6,700 to the dollar against the
opening of 6,000/6,100 in the morning session.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has lost more than 100 percent of its value against
the greenback since early July last year.
</P>
<P>
"People in Jakarta panicked after they saw the rupiah surpass
6,700 during the lunch break. But we could do nothing about it," a
dealer with a local private bank said.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the central bank was not seen in the spot market
Monday like it was in the previous trading days.
</P>
<P>
"The central bank's intervention in the spot market would not
even be effective now when the rupiah continues to free-fall," one
dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Dealers also said political concerns ahead of the convening of
the People's Consultative Assembly in March to elect a president
and vice president accelerated the fall of the rupiah against the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
As the rupiah weakened, stock prices on the Jakarta Stock
Exchange closed slightly higher after declining in the morning
trading session.
</P>
<P>
The composite index closed 0.18 points higher to 410.29 with
258.95 million shares changing hands in the regular market valued
at 40 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Securities analysts said they had not seen any reason for the
stock market to rise when the rupiah continued to weaken against
the dollar.

<HEADLINE> Social Security System Helps the Chinese Needy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 510,000 needy people
in Shanghai, China's largest city, have received relief with the
establishment of a new type of social security system, said
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, more than 300 million yuan of relief
funds have been issued to ensure the minimum living standards for
needy residents in the city, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Following a large-scale readjustment of economic structure in
the past few years, a comprehensive social security system aimed
at providing relief for all local needy people is taking shape in
the city.
</P>
<P>
Instead of providing relief only to a few groups of urban poor,
like disabled and childless senior citizens, the new system has
extended relief to all kinds of urban needy people, including an
increasing number of layoffs and the rural poor.
</P>
<P>
Local officials attributed its success to the system, which is
composed of an effective mechanism for identification of the poor,
a multiplicity of fund-raising channels and management, and clear
social division of work by the different agencies and
organizations concerned.
</P>
<P>
The new system is based on a so-called "send-warmth project"
sponsored by the trade unions, which focuses on helping needy
workers, particularly an ever-growing number of laid-off workers
of State-owned enterprises plagued by sluggish business, said the
paper.

<HEADLINE> Mexico's New Interior Secretary Proposes Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's new Interior
Secretary, Francisco Labastida, said on Monday that his ministry
is about to submit a strategic plan to renew and foster a peace
dialogue in the state of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
The secretary said it is necessary that the government takes on
the role of encouraging conciliation and mutual understanding in
the troubled state.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Chiapas issue cannot be settled with a
one-sided effort. All the people involved have to play their parts
in the process.
</P>
<P>
Labastida said he is holding talks with members of the
Pacification and Settlement Commission, which consists of deputies
of the National Congress and represents the government in the
suspended dialogue with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
He said he will meet leaders of several religious organizations
in Chiapas in order to outline a new plan to bring peace to the
region.
</P>
<P>
One of its main goals is to make sure nobody in the state owns
prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
He added that when people own arms, violence emerges. He said
the government could not accept that some groups be disarmed while
others were not, referring to the rebel Zapatista National
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
The Zapatista guerrillas, who waged an uprising against the
government in January 1994, demanded special treatment from the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
Labastida, who assumed his post last Saturday, said the
conflicting regions in Chiapas are plagued by land and
religion-related fights, which have caused many people to
flee their towns to live under "inhuman conditions".
</P>
<P>
The rebels and Mexican press condemned the December 22 massacre
of 45 indigenous people in Chenalho, Chiapas, saying the attack
could have been prevented by the government from happening.
</P>
<P>
The Zapatistas blamed the government for its alleged funding of
paramilitary groups which were said to have perpetrated the
bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
The massacre prompted the resignation of the former interior
secretary Emilio Chuayffet, after he was strongly criticized for
the handling of the issue.

ROME, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Mediterranean countries should
unite and collaborate with each other on the basis of mutual
understanding to cope with the threats to peace in the region,
Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov said in Naples on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Gligorov made the remark at a ceremony where he received the
Mediterranean peace award from the "Laboratorio Mediterraneo"
foundation.
</P>
<P>
He said peace in the Mediterranean continues to be at risk
because of historic rivalries and the growing gap between the rich
north and the poor south.
</P>
<P>
"Historic frustrations, instead of easing, have sharpened,
creating fertile ground for exclusivism, intolerance and
terrorism", Gligorov said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, historic rivalries in the region have created in
the Mediterranean basin the largest arsenal in the world, and no
solution has been figured out so far to the decades-long frictions.
</P>
<P>
Gligorov appealed to all nations bordering the Mediterranean to
create conditions for a stable peace through common action,
collaboration, solidarity and reciprocal understanding between all
peoples in the region.
</P>

The Macedonian president also attended a ceremony for the
signing of an agreement aimed at promoting cultural exchanges

<P>
BANGKOK, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will take
measures to repatriate all foreign laborers within three years to
ease rising unemployment among Thais, according to Minister of
Labor and Social Welfare Trairong Suwannakhiri.
</P>
<P>
Trairong was quoted by Tuesday's local newspapers as saying
that the government aimed to repatriate from 300,000 to 500,000
foreign workers -- mainly from Myanmar, South Asia and Indochina
-- per year, as it wanted to alleviate unemployment faced by Thais
because of the economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry will set a time limit in each province
where employers are allowed to hire foreign workers. Employers
will be notified about the repatriation policy ahead of the
deadline.
</P>
<P>
After the deadline, any employer found violating the order will
face three years imprisonment or a 60,000 baht (1,200 US dollars)
fine.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that with the drastic action within three
years, all foreign workers will be repatriated," he said
</P>
<P>
Only 300,000 foreign workers have registered with the Ministry
of Labor and Social Welfare out of an estimated more than one
million nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Trairong said his ministry will not renew work permits for
foreign workers.

</P>
<P>
Project Light, as it is named by officials of the State

the first of its kind in China, which is expected to provide the
project with quality wind turbines and wind-driven generators.
</P>
<P>
As part of Project Light, XBWC is expected to bring electricity
to China's poverty-stricken isolated islands, frontier guard posts
and communication hubs and thousands of remote villages as soon as
possible.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Southeast Asian Tourism Facing Hard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- After 1997 proved to be a
disastrous year for Southeast Asia's tourism, 1998 may bring some
luck to the industry, but only "hard luck."
</P>
<P>
Last year, Southeast Asia's tourism suffered a big setback when
a series of disasters hit the region, once touted as one of the
world's fastest growing and most dynamic.
</P>
<P>
First, there were the currency crises, which forced potential
tourists in Thailand, South Korea, Japan and rest of East Asia to
take belt-tightening measures, including cancellations of travel
to neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Then came the environmental hazards posed by Indonesia's forest
fires, which destroyed tens of thousands of hectares of forests
and scattered health-threatening haze over the whole Southeast
Asian region. The haze drastically affected tourism in Thailand,
Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The depression in the region's tourism surprised many people,
especially government officials, who had mis-judged the extent of
the financial crisis and had not expected the haze problem.
</P>
<P>
When a Thai financial crisis spread to other Southeast Asian
nations last July, regional currencies became 10 to 30 percent
weaker against the U.S. dollar in weeks. Government leaders then
expected that the weaker currencies, though hurting regional
economies, would make their export products more competitive and
attract dollar-holding tourists.
</P>
<P>
However, currency devaluation failed to promote the growth of
the industry as weaker currencies and plummeting stock markets
have only kept tourists from the region at home. Over the past 10
years, Southeast Asians had become rich enough to travel within
their region, and made up half of the region's tourist traffic.
The financial crisis effectively reduced the number of tourist
arrivals in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in the summer, giant forest fires in Indonesia raised
a pall of smoke over vast parts of Southeast Asia. The ecological
disaster scared away would-be tourists from the west and rest of
the world in the later part of the year.
</P>
<P>
Now the haze is over, but the crisis is still lingering in the
region. Could the situation be improved in 1998?
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the better environment and the weaker currencies
would attract long-haul visitors, but moves by Asian governments
to discourage their people to trip abroad would pose a new
challenge to the region's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
American airlines and travel agents reported recently that
plummeting currencies in Korea, Malaysia, Thailand and the
Philippines will likely promote more Americans to take advantage
of the exchange rate and vacation in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The declining value of regional currencies means the dollar
buys more of the Southeast Asian goods, including hotel rooms,
food and souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
In the last six month, currencies of Thailand, the Philippines,
Indonesia, and Malaysia declined by 30 to 60 percent while South
Korea's won has lost half of its value against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
People from other west nations are also expected to take the
advantages of the weaker currencies and travel in the region,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
However, less trips by Southeast Asians within the region will
affect the recovery of the tourism industry. Recently, governments
in the region are taking measures to discourage their people from
going abroad.
</P>
<P>
They are raising passport fees and other international travel
costs, and even openly urging people not to go abroad, as part of
efforts to protect their foreign currency reserves.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has reportedly doubled the cost of passports to 300
ringgit (78 dollars) or 600 ringgit, depending on the number of
pages requested. Thailand is considering raising international
airport taxes and discussing imposing an exit tax.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government has suspended foreign trips by
government officials, including attendance in foreign conferences,
training, cultural and social and sports activities.
</P>
<P>
Facing both new opportunities and challenges, Southeast Asian
governments launched new campaigns to promote tourism. In
Thailand, the government has just kicked off an "Amazing Thailand"
campaign that hopes to attract 17 million tourists this year.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, the government will hold an international
tourism conference "the Philippine Tourism Investment
Opportunities" at the end of this month in a bid to lure more
foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
Most of Southeast Asian governments are urging their people to
boost tourism by having domestic tours.
</P>
<P>
All these efforts will certainly help bring about an early
recovery of the industry, but the on-going financial crisis still
could dampen hopes of tourism boom this year, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Car Sales Seen to Drop in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Because of the current currency
crisis, automotive vehicle sales in the Philippines are expected
to drop by 23 percent to 109,000 units this year from 142,000
units in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Car sales will plunge by 30 percent to 53,000 units from 75,000
units, while commercial vehicle sales will drop by 15 percent to
57,000 units from 68,000 units, local press reports Tuesday quoted
industry sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mario de Grano, secretary general of the Chamber of Automotive
Manufacturers of the Philippines, said the weak market demand will
be aggravated by the continuing fall of the peso and the increase
in the tariff rate on car parts kits.
</P>
<P>
"People are expected to start buying (cars) only after the
(May) elections," De Grano said, adding that the forecast may yet
be refined when the chamber members meet to consolidate the
figures.
</P>
<P>
As of November, total motor vehicle sales reached only 135,000
units. Passenger car sales for the first 11 months of 1997 was
placed at 70,805 units while commercial vehicle sales was recorded
at 64,195 units.

<HEADLINE> Italian Economy Expects Steady Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Italy's economy is continuing to
expand and the recovery is expected to be consolidated during the
next few months, the National Institute for Economic Trends (ISCO)
said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the treasury think-tank, the strengthening of the
national economy would not put pressure on prices and inflation
would remain under control.
</P>
<P>
Although the economy was not expected to grow more than in
recent months, ISCO noted that Italian business viewed the first
quarter of 1998 with "widespread optimism".
</P>
<P>
Companies forecast that "the economy will continue to recover
at a moderate rate, while pressure on prices is expected to fall",
ISCO said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, relatively few companies intended to raise their
prices in coming months, the institute added.
</P>
<P>
Domestic demand was reported stable, while orders from abroad
were increasing slightly. Industrial production for the first
quarter was expected to remain at the high levels of 1997,
according to ISCO.
</P>
<P>
A further indication that the Italian economy was expanding
came from the national electricity board Enel, which reported on
Monday that demand for electric power had risen by 3.8 percent in
1997 compared to the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Enel said the increase in demand recorded in every month since
April 1997 had initially been confined to industrial sectors
influenced by government incentives, such as auto production.
</P>
<P>
The recovery had then spread to all sectors of the economy
except construction, with companies producing finished goods
showing particular strength and hence demanding more electricity
to drive production, Enel said.
</P>
<P>
The results had exceeded all expectations and showed a marked
improvement on the forecasts made at the start of the year,
commenting Enel Chairman Chicco Testa.
</P>
<P>
"The Italian economy has definitively joined a virtuous
circle," he added.

WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- World flight record holder
Dick Rutan and pilot Dave Melton set to launch another balloon
mission to circle the world without stop early Tuesday from New

BUENOS AIRES, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The inflation rate in
Argentina rose by 0.3 percent over 1997, reported Monday the
National Institute of Statistics and Census.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, domestic prices at wholesales dropped 0.9 percent
last year, due to a low in prices of national products like raw
materials, manufactured goods and electric power.
</P>
<P>
The institute said that retail sales prices went up due mainly
to an increase in the entertainment industry and a 4.7 surge in
the tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Last December, sectors of health, food and beverages registered
a 0.1-percent prices lift while housing and household appliances
prices kept unvariable.

<HEADLINE> Purchasing Power Of Argentine Workers Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Purchasing power of
manufacturing workers rose by 0.6 percent in November 1997,
against the same month 1996, reported Monday a study of the
Argentina University for Business.
</P>
<P>
The institution said that the increment of the workers` income
is due to the stability of prices and wages, as well as to the
expansion of credits for comsumption.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the university underlined the low inflation rate as
a favorable factor for a rising workers` purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
From November 96 to November 97, salaries rose in sectors like
automobile, cement, metallurgy and petrochemistry, the document
said.

<HEADLINE> Gene-Based Drug Treatment of Heart Disease on Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A New-York-based hospital is
using a gene-based drug to treat insufficient blood flow to the
heart muscle, believed to be the first case of medical trial in
this area in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The drug, called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was
a product of three years of research and experiment on animals,
said Ronald Crystal, M.D., Professor of Medicine at Cornell
University Medical College and Principal Investigator of the
clinical trail.
</P>
<P>
The drug would trigger new blood vessel formation in tissues
deprived of sufficient blood flow due to atherosclerousis or other
conditions.
</P>
<P>
It has been administered to the first patient in a Phase I
clinical trial as an adjunct to traditional coronary bypass
surgeries, he told a press conference at the College here today.
</P>
<P>
The trial started at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical
Center on December 17 when Dr. Todd K. Rosengart, M.D.,
Co-Principal Investigator of the trial injected the drug to the
oxygen-starved heart muscle of the first patient in the trial.
</P>
<P>
"By inserting this new gene into the heart, we are telling the
heart to detour around the obstructed arteries," Crystal said.
</P>
<P>
"At this stage, we are testing for safety and establishing an
appropriate dosage level in humans," he added.
</P>
<P>
Crystal said the Phase I would last three to four weeks and it
may take several months for them to watch on how the drug effect
develops. If it works, it will be a milestone in heart disease
treatment, he said.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Buy 15 Military Helicopters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government announced
today that it will buy 15 new search-and-rescue helicopters for
its military.
</P>
<P>
The Agusta-Westland Cormorant choppers will cost Canada a total
of 790 million dollars (553 million US dollars), Defense Minister
Art Eggleton told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
This includes 593 million dollars for the aircraft and some 200
million dollars to cover project management, training, spare parts
and logistics support.
</P>
<P>
The chopper is a cheaper version of the EH-101, whose contract
was canceled by Jean Chretien's government when it took over just
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Now Canadians will have a helicopter that can do the job at a
price they can afford," Eggleton said.
</P>
<P>
"The competitive process has resulted in a search-and-rescue
helicopter project that is approximately 40 percent less expensive
than the EH-101 order our government terminated in 1993," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
However, today's announcement was criticized by some as
embarrassing turnaround by the Canadian government, which paid the
same consortium 478 million dollars for canceling a deal for 50
EH-101 choppers.

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Plans to Seek Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Speaker Newt Gingrich of the
House of Representatives said Monday he has a plan for a "smarter,
more modern government" that includes a combined maximum 25
percent tax bite from all three levels of government.
</P>
<P>
In a speech before the Cobb County Chamber of Commerce in his
hometown of Marietta, Georgia., Gingrich said his "Goals for a
Generation" should serve as the Republican agenda for the 21st
century, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich called for a National Commission on Retirement to
review Social Security, and also urged improvements in public
schools plagued by high dropout rates and said all students should
learn to read English by the fourth grade.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said he supported gradual tax cuts so that peacetime
taxation by federal, state and local government does not take more
than 25 percent of a person's income.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Tax collection of some kind is going to be with us.
The current abusive system with the current quotas for collections
and the current infringements on personal liberty clearly can be
replaced."
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said Social Security reform would not require "painful
choices."
</P>
<P>
He said, "The power of compound interest means that young
people today ought to have a better return on their investment and
a higher value added and ought to be able to retire with more
money, not less."

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Rallies Against Major Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar rallied to a
more than five year high against the Japanese yen today as the
investors still worried about the prospect of the Asian economy.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the U.S. currency was quoted at
133.78 yen, up from 132.55 yen late Friday, its highest point
since reaching 134.45 yen on April 24, 1992.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also was changing hands at 1.8263 marks, up from
1.8043 marks Friday, and its highest since settling at 1.8335
marks on September 2.
</P>
<P>
The dollar's rise began in Asian trading after Japan's major
stock index fell by 2 percent on fears of another rocky year for
Japanese business.
</P>
<P>
The dollar extended its gains here after U.S. Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin said that a strong dollar remains in the
interest of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Also boosting the dollar was a rally in U.S. bond prices, which
pushed the long-term interest as low as 5.73 percent, a level
never reached since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The British pound settled at 1.6311 U.S. dollars, up from
1.6440 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday,
also gained against Swiss francs, French francs, Italian lire and
Canadian dollars.

<HEADLINE> Mail-bomber Suspect's Trial on Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The trial of Unabomber
suspect Theodore Kaczynski in Sacramento, California, is on hold
following a surprise meeting with the judge and his lawyers,
reportedly to air complaints about his defense, media reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The former math professor is accused of serial killings with
mail-bomb across the nation over 18 years. In the Sacramento trial
Kaczynski, 55, is charged in a 10-count indictment covering only
four of the 16 bombings attributed to the Unabomber -- so named by
the FBI because his first victims were from universities and
airlines
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Kaczynski for nearly four hours, U.S.
District Judge Garland Burrell Jr. told marshals to send the jury
of eight women and four men home until Thursday, news reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Burrell scheduled a hearing with lawyers Wednesday afternoon
and rescheduled opening statements in the high-profile case for
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Details of the private meeting weren't disclosed, but such
conferences typically allow defendants to express complaints about
federal defenders. Kaczynski also may have objected to the
presence of his brother, David, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
David Kaczynski, whose tips led to his brother's arrest, was
sitting with their mother, Wanda, behind the defense table when
Theodore Kaczynski strode into the courtroom today without
acknowledging them.
</P>
<P>
He then told the judge that he wished to make a statement.
</P>
<P>
Legal experts say Kaczysnki can ask Burrell to approve new
counsel if he believes he can no longer work with them, or even to
affirm his right to defend himself.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he forced his highly-regarded defense team to abandon
their plans to portray him as a paranoid schizophrenic after he
refused to undergo a psychiatric exam.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski has pleaded not guilty to charges related to four of
the serial attacks attributed to the Unabomber. The government is
reportedly seeking the death penalty.

<HEADLINE> EU Voices Concern Over Violence in Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
voiced its deep concern on the reported killing of hundreds of
people over the past few days, calling for an immediate end to the
violence.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 civilians have been reportedly killed in the first six
days of the holy Moslem month of Ramadan and the Armed Islamic
Group was likely to be blamed for most of those massacres.
</P>
<P>
Britain, the current EU Presidency state, said in a statement
issued here today, "The (EU) presidency is deeply concerned that
the scale of violence in Algeria has increased dramatically since
the beginning of Ramadan."
</P>
<P>
"The presidency deplores and condemns the recent appalling
attacks in the north-west of the country. The terrorists must stop
this mindless violence against innocent people," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The EU statement made it clear that it would discuss the issue
with the Algerian government and non-governmental organizations in
an effort to provide some help to the victims.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Not to Adjust Hardline Policies toward Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States would not
change its hardline policies toward Iraq despite criticism from
other countries for its way handling the Iraqi issues in the U.N.
Security Council, the State department said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to adjust our policies, because we believe
that Iraq poses a grave threat to the region," State Department
spokesman James Rubin said at a regular briefing. "
</P>
<P>
Rubin was answering a question from a reporter who thought the
United States had "lost some momentum, some drive in being able to
maintain sanctions (against Iraq) and to hold the other members of
the Security Council's feet to the fire."
</P>
<P>
But Rubin said that "the perceptions on this issue wax and
wane, and over the years there have been many times when the Unite
States was asked are we going to adjust our policy because the
enthusiasm of some other countries has waxed and waned."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the United States would stick to its present Iraq
policies as the Iraqis are "determined to thwart the will of the
international community by refusing to own up to what they have
done in the area of weapons of mass destruction, by refusing to
implement U.N. Security Council resolutions."

<HEADLINE> European Shares Up on Firm Wall Street, Strong Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe all
surged strongly and ended sharply higher today, boosted by a firm
start on Wall Street, a robust dollar and good domestic economic
news.
</P>
<P>
Britain's leading stocks hit a three-month high and closed at
the session's best levels on the first full trading day of the New
Year, with the FTSE 100 index up 69 or 1.33 percent at 5,262.5 as
Wall Street put in a strong performance and international bond
markets remained healthy.
</P>
<P>
UK and US bonds set record highs as fears of near-term interest
rate increases faded. UK financial stocks were key gainers as
banks were squeezed higher.
</P>
<P>
All three major European markets were also underlined by a
strong dollar, which soared to a 5.5-year high against the yen
today.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that European market sentiments were further
buoyed by evidence of slower economic growth in both Britain and
Germany, which ruled out near-term interest rate rises in the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares ended sharply higher on the back of
a strong dollar as the market recovered some of last week's upward
momentum.
</P>
<P>
The DAX-30 index rose by 69.44 points to close at 4,384.81, an
increase of 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The CAC-40 index in Paris rose by 32.7 points to end at
3,072.84, also supported by a robust dollar, which will boost
exports.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of France decided to leave its key intervention rate
at 3.30 percent as expected.

<HEADLINE> Britain Confident Peace in N.Ireland Still Holding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Mo Mowlam said today a shaky truce by Protestant
guerrilla groups was still holding despite a series of violence
last week.
</P>
<P>
"My assessment is that it is fragile but it is holding. I have
had no information to the contrary and on that basis we will move
forward with the ceasefire intact," Mowlam told reporters after a
day of talks with Northern Ireland's multi-party politicians.
</P>
<P>
The emergency meeting was aimed at halting the rot in the
divided province's flagging peace process, undermined by three
guerrilla killings last week.
</P>
<P>
The politicians at the meeting were all determined not to be
deflected from the need to make rapid progress in the search for
peace, she said.
</P>
<P>
"We remain on course for that objective and I want and hope
that all participants will stay with us in getting there," the
secretary added.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday Mowlam will meet representatives from IRA political
wing Sinn Fein and the main Protestant Ulster Unionist Party
(UUP), which says Mowlam should resign over the increase in
violence.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Prime Minister Tony Blair held an
hour-long meeting with pro-British UUP leader David Trimble
earlier in the day, which the prime minister's spokesman described
as constructive and positive.
</P>
<P>
"It was a useful opportunity for detailed discussion of the
talks process," he said, describing Blair as still "cautiously
optimistic" despite recent difficulties.

<HEADLINE> UN Urges End to Discrimination Against Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A UN publication says
that while there has been progress in most countries to end
discrimination against women, there is still no society in the
world where women enjoy full equality with men.
</P>
<P>
To illustrate the discrimination against women, the publication
from the United Nations Division for the Advancement of
Women presents the following fact:
</P>
<P>
-- Two thirds of the world's illiterate adults are women;
</P>
<P>
-- More boys than girls attend school;
</P>
<P>
-- Women do twice the amount of unpaid work than men do;
</P>
<P>
-- Women earn three fourths of what men earn;
</P>
<P>
-- Women's health concerns are often ignored;
</P>
<P>
-- Women are vastly under-represented in positions of power;
</P>
<P>
-- Violence against women is a global epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The publication says that since the beginning, the United
Nations has promoted equality between men and women. Over the
years, it has convened four international conferences to further
women's rights. Today there are five bodies in the United Nation
system devoted to women's issues. There is also an inter-agency
committee that is working to ensure coordination and integration
of a gender perspective into all UN programs and policies.
</P>
<P>
Most important of all, the publication says, the United Nations
has adopted several declarations and conventions which set
international standards for achieving equality between men and
women.
</P>
<P>
Foremost among them is the landmark Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the
publication says.
