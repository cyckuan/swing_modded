<HEADLINE> Families the Big Winners Under Coalition Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Low-income families and private
health insurance sectors are among the winners under the first
budget of the Australian Coalition government, according to a
budget statement today.
</P>
<P>
Among new government spendings announced today, the private
health insurance sector will receive 1.5 billion Australian dollar
(1.2 billion US dollar) worth of government subsidies in the next
four years.
</P>
<P>
The Coalition government will also allocate 1.7 billion
Australian dollars for additional assistance to low income
families in the same period.
</P>
<P>
Sports is another big winner under the 1996-97 budget,
receiving 146 million Australian dollars of additional government
fund under the "Maintain the Momentum" program in the four years
before the 2000 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Other winners include university research, youth employment
programs, national highways and airports, literacy at schools and
the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization
(CSIRO).
</P>
<P>
The Coalition government will spend 1.5 billion Australians
dollars (1.2 billion US dollars) to honor its election promises in
1996-97. The amount will be increased to 2.0 billion Australian
dollar (1.6 billion US dollars) in 1997-98 to keep its election
promises.
</P>
<P>
The Coalition made major cuts to a number of government
programs to achieve savings of 4.4 billion Australian dollars (3.4
billion US dollars) in the current fiscal year. Savings will be
increased to 7.2 billion Australian dollars (5.6 billion US
dollars) in the year of 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
The Coalition government also decided that newly arrived
migrants will have to wait two years before becoming eligible for
social security benefits. This move will reduce government
expenditures by 740 million Australian dollars (577 million US
dollars) over four years.
</P>
<P>
The biggest losers are university students and unemployed
people. Changes to the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS)
will force students to pay more for their tertiary education.
These changes are expected to achieve savings of 1.8 billion
Australian dollars (1.4 billion US dollars) for the government
over four years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, most of the existing labor market programs will be
slashed to achieve savings of 1.8 billion Australian dollars (1.4
billion US dollars) during 1996-2000.
</P>
<P>
State governments will also share the burden of budget cuts by
contributing a total of 1.6 billion Australian dollars (1.38
billion US dollars) to programs formerly funded by the federal
government over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
If the above measures were fully carried out, the Coalition
government would be able to reduce the underlying budget deficit
to 1.5 billion Australian dollars (1.2 billion US dollars) by
1997-98 and achieve a budget surplus in the following year.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit stood at 10.3 billion Australian dollars
(8.0 billion US dollars) for the fiscal year of 1995-96. The
budget released today foresaw a deficit of 5.6 billion Australian
dollars (4.4 billion US dollars) for the present fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> 10,000 Non-Formal Schools to Be Set up in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will set up 1,000
non-formal schools each month in the current fiscal year that
began on July 1, with a target to establish 10,000 such schools in
the whole year, a government official told a press conference here
today.
</P>
<P>
International donors will contribute 25 percent of the funds to
build these schools, said Pervaiz Saleh, special assistant to the
Prime Minister and chairman of Prime Minister's Literacy
Commission (PMLC).
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government's expenditure on each non-formal
school student is only one fourth of that on a formal school
student.
 The PMLC opened 1,150 schools in the last fiscal year, exceeding
its target of 1,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the literacy rate now stands
at about 35 percent in Pakistan, whose population is 131 million.

<HEADLINE> National Anti-Flood Meeting Warns: Don't Ease Your Guard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The State Anti-Flood and Drought
Headquarters today held its second meeting of the year to discuss
current anti-flooding issues. Vice Premier Jiang Chunyun presided
over the meeting in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The meeting concluded that this year's anti-flood work achieved
periodic successes, but the situation is still serious, as the
main flood season is yet to end and there must not be any
carelessness or slackness about the matter.
</P>
<P>
This year's floods were huge in volume and brought damage to a
large area. Since June disastrous floods have attacked areas of
such major rivers as Yangtze, Pearl River, Yellow, Huaihe and
Haihe, which have drawn attention from the central leadership,
according to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng have given important
instructions on the issue, while local governments in the affected
areas have carried out anti-flood arrangements by the central
leadership, and have scored certain achievements due to their
correct and timely efforts.
</P>
<P>
The meeting praised the masses and armymen who devoted
themselves to anti-flood efforts, for having secured the safety of
major rivers and reservoirs, and having largely reduced the losses
caused by the floods.
</P>
<P>
The meeting urged local governments to continue their
anti-flood work, especially in the flood-hit areas where
river-banks have been relatively weakened, to counter new floods,
and to remain vigilant on possible heavier floods and typhoons,
especially in Northeast China provinces.
</P>
<P>
Localities were also warned of facing the challenges of both
floods as well as drought, since droughts have affected some areas
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Priority should also be given to rescue and restoration
work. This year a large number of people have been stricken by
floods, the meeting heard. Local governments were urged to try
their best to help the affected people.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also asked governments in flood-hit areas to
maintain social stability and security by carrying out a
patriotic, collective and socialist education among the masses.
</P>
<P>
Local governments in the flooded areas need to allocate more
funds for rescue and restoration work, and great attention should
be paid to farming for this Autumn and next Spring, especially in
water-conservancy work, the meeting stressed.

<HEADLINE> Seventy Percent American People Work Nonstandard Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Only 31.5% percent of all
employed Americans age 18 and over work regularly during the
daytime, 35 to 40 hours a week, Mondays through Fridays, according
to a researcher at the University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
This country's much-noted trend away from manufacturing jobs
and toward more service-sector jobs has led to an increasing
number of workers with nonstandard schedules, Harriet Presser
writes in her book,"Job, Family and Gender: Determinants of
Nonstandard Work Schedules among Employed Americans in 1991."
</P>
<P>
Future growth in nonstandard hours of employment should be
especially evident among women, she writes, because seven of the
top 10 growth occupations are "disproportionately female", such as
salespeople, cashiers, office clerks and cleaners.
</P>
<P>
According to Presser, 65.4% men and 49.8% women have to work
nonstandard hours because of requirement of their job and they
could not get any other job. Only 29.5% men and 44.7% women
voluntarily work nonstandard hours for better pay, better
arrangements for family care or school education.
</P>
<P>
Although nonstandard schedules may please some workers, she
writes, they have biological and social drawbacks, and "sleep
disturbances, gastrointestinal disorders and chronic malaise"
could reduce "availability for family interaction and leisure."

<HEADLINE> Workers Strike Renders Zimbabwean Civil Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARAR, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's civil service has been
plunged into a crisis today as thousands of employees
across the country went on strike to press the government to revoke
unfavourable salary increments announced last month, the Zimbabwe
National News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The strike by nurses and other health support staff at government
hospitals also entered its second day.
</P>
<P>
Government hospitals across the country are referral centres for
smaller institutions and senior medical officers said they were
already feeling the strain from increased workload.
</P>
<P>
At the hospitals, patients were left with no food, but the army
and red cross volunteers have stepped in to assist in the wards.
</P>
<P>
There was no one to answer telephones in most government
buildings, some of which had to be closed because of absence of
manpower.
</P>
<P>
Salary increments received this year average six percent in which
transport and housing allowances were increased by 10 percent and 15
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
While the health workers are demanding a 60 percent raise,
the Public Service Association wants about 30 percent.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Prime Minister Denounces Sectarianism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government will
take strict action against spreading sectarianism and will not
allow any group or sect to disrupt the peace and security in the
country, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said today.
</P>
<P>
"We are all Muslims and cannot allow anyone to take precious
lives. That is why we have vowed to put an end to sectarian
politics," she said while talking to reporters in Rawalpindi, the
twin city of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Expressing her deep concern and grief over the spate of
sectarian violence in Punjab and Sindh provinces, she said that "a
number of arrests have been made and the government is determined
to put an iron hand on all those involved."
</P>
<P>
Twelve people were killed during a religious rally on
Pakistan's Independence Day last Wednesday in the southern port
city of Karachi.
</P>
<P>
Four days later, another 15 were killed at a religious
gathering in Punjab province.
</P>
<P>
Benazir said several groups were involved in sectarian
killings, noting that certain people stayed free even after
committing dozens of murders with no one daring to lay a hand over
them.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that this can no longer be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
"We are against sectarian politics and the groups involved need
to be combatted and a culture developed to counter such trends,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Benazir expressed the hope that, "With stringent measures
against sectarianism, such type of politics will be eliminated
from the country."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Narrows in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. overall trade
deficit fell 23 percent to 8.12 billion dollars in June, with a
much improved deficit with Japan but a widening gap with China,
the U.S. Commerce Department said today.
</P>
<P>
In June, total imports were some 77.82 billion dollars while
exports stood at 69.7 billion dollars, bringing a 23 percent drop
in deficit from a revised 10.55 billion dollars for May, according
to a report issued by the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
The decline is largely attributed to the U.S. efforts to bring
down its huge deficit with Japan. The figure is 22.3 billion
dollars for the first half of this year, a remarkable 31 percent
drop from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
While U.S. deficit with Japan has been improving, the deficit
with China rose to 15.7 billion dollars in the first six months of
1996, up 7.9 percent from a year ago, according to the U.S. data.
</P>
<P>
The 3.33 billion dollars trade deficit with China surpassed the
3.2 billion dollar deficit with Japan in June, the first time in
history.
</P>
<P>
Deficit with Canada, the U.S. biggest trade partner, ebbed by a
2.2 percent to some 2.42 billion dollars, while its deficit with
the southern neighbor Mexico declined by 6.4 percent to 1.49
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The 2.4 billion dollars improvement in the June imbalance
reflected a 3.3 percent drop in imports, the largest monthly
decline since the monthly series on goods and services began in
1992. Imports had hit an all-time high in May.
</P>
<P>
The smaller import volume reflected a big decline of 704
million dollars in demand for foreign computers and computer chips
while demand for automobiles dropped by 689 million dollars, and
demand for other consumer goods such as artwork and clothing
dipped 170 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Oil import also declined 6.8 percent to 5.63 billion dollars on
a seasonally adjusted basis.
</P>
<P>
The exports in June, 69.7 billion dollars, represented a slight
decline of 0.3 percent, or 173 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year, the U.S. trade deficit
was holding steady at an annual rate of 105.2 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Bank Going on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia will
soon offer its retail customers Internet banking service, local
media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Nova Scotia, the fourth biggest bank in Canada,
announced Monday that it will test Internet banking with its own
staff and customers in Ontario Province this fall before the
service goes national at the beginning of next year.
</P>
<P>
The system, developed by IBM Canada, will initially allow
balance checks, fund transfers and bill payment on the Internet.
Eventually, customers will be able to apply for loans, mortgages
and insurance, or buying mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
All customers need is a computer, a modem and access to an
Internet service provider. There is no special software required
to tap in, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The bank is billing its move as an industry first for Canada,
saying that no other financial institution currently offers as
wide a range of "fully transactional banking services on the
Internet."
</P>
<P>
Internet banking could be "the biggest milestone in banking
since the invention of the automatic banking machine," the bank
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Currently, most Canadian banks have been concentrating on
personal computer banking that connects with customers over secure
private telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
Security concerns over customers' funds and personal
information have been a roadblock to getting more banking services
on to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
But Nova Scotia Bank said its system, which masks customer
account numbers and doesn't identify customers by name, is
"entirely secure." It also promised to bear the cost if there
ever is a security breach.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Announces Troops Withdrawal From Lesser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Eritrean government has
announced its readiness to evacuate of its troops from Lesser Hanish,
a disputable island in the Red Sea for which both Eritrea and Yemen
have territorial claims, according to an Eritrean Foreign
Minsitry statement made available here today.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the Eritrean Foreign Ministry on
Sunday said, "as a gesture of goodwill and in the interests of
the smooth progress of the arbitration process and in order to
preserve and promote peace in the region, we shall evacuate from
Lesser Hanish."
</P>
<P>
Recently, Yemen accused Eritrea of having deployed its troops
in the disputable island, while the accusation was denied by
Eritrea in a communique on August 14.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued by the Eritrean government on the
second day of the arrival of a French delegation in Eritrea's
capital Asmara.
</P>
<P>
Through French mediation efforts, Eritrea and Yemen agreed in
May to solve their disputes on two islands Greater Hanish and
Lesser Hanish in the Red Sea in an ongoing international
arbitration process.
</P>
<P>
The statement said: "What concerns us most is the smooth
progress of the arbitration process. Moreover, since any present
or future dispute that may arise can only be resolved within the
framework of the arbitration process, we believe that other
peripheral issues cannot have precedence over it."
</P>
<P>
However, the statement added that "the Eritrean government has
not found disputable the fact of the presence of its units in the
island both before and after May 21, 1996 agreement."
</P>
<P>
The governments of Eritrea and Yemen signed an agreement on
May 21 on final solution to the dispute on Greater Hanish though
international arbitration.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Pakistan Rap India for Vetoing Nuclear Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Pakistan
criticized India's veto on the draft nuclear test ban treaty
accepted by the overwhelming majority of the negotiating states
here today.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Disarmament Ambassador Stephen Ledogar described India's
excuse for rejection as "nonsense," saying that India's true
intention was to keep its nuclear option open.
</P>
<P>
He also accused India of being insincere when it said in
February that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) talks
should also provide for nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
In her statement delivered at today's meeting, Indian
Disarmament Ambassador Arundhati Ghose said the draft treaty fell
far short of what it had been expected to achieve and the
entry-into-force (EIF) terms were "coercive."
</P>
<P>
She requested a reference to a timetable for nuclear
disarmament in the EIF clause, saying India wanted "a commitment
which could have acted as a catalyst for multilateral negotiations
on the elimination of nuclear weapons within a reasonable span of
time."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan sharply criticized India for blocking the project and
said that the India-proposed link of a nuclear disarmament
timetable to the EIF terms was "unrealistic and unreasonable."
</P>
<P>
The draft treaty needs the unanimous support of the negotiating
states before it goes forward to the U.N. General Assembly for
approval and signing.
</P>
<P>
However, Ledogar told reporters that some countries are now
considering circumventing the conference and directly putting the
draft treaty before world leaders when the 51st General Assembly
meets in September.
</P>
<P>
He said any attempt to re-open the current treaty text for
further changes in New York would not be acceptable.

<HEADLINE> Lebed Questions Yeltsin's Decree on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian Security Council
Secretary Alexander Lebed today raised doubts about President
Boris Yeltsin's latest decree on Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
A statement released by the information office of the Security
Council said the contents of the decree created doubt that Yeltsin
"took a direct part in finalizing the text of the order."
</P>
<P>
The presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said on Monday
that Yeltsin signed a decree on Sunday ordering Lebed to restore
order in the Chechen capital of Grozny, which was seized by
Chechen rebels on August 6.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council statement said the decree seemed to
suggest that the Russian forces would launch a massive military
operation in Chechnya to retake Grozny.
</P>
<P>
It warned that such an operation would cause heavy casualties
on both the Russian forces and citizens in Grozny, as well as
torpedo the peace talks between the government and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's spokesman said that the president had left Moscow for
a brief holiday, denying a news report that he was being treated
for a serious heart condition.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Experts Say Attacking U.N. Hurts U.S. Itself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 80 U.S. foreign
policy experts have warned that the U.S. hostility to the United
Nations is damaging not only the world body but also the national
interests of the United States itself.
</P>
<P>
The experts expressed their views in a report released on
Monday, less than a week after U.S. Republicans vowed in their
party platform not to let the U.N. override American interests.
</P>
<P>
The report, sponsored by the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations,
will be presented to the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress,
which has been calling for overhauling the world body.
</P>
<P>
The report concluded that politicians in the United States and
other countries have misrepresented the U.N. activities in
Somalia, Bosnia and elsewhere to cover up their own policy
failures.
</P>
<P>
"The failure in Bosnia was largely the failure of the major
powers to know what they wanted to do," said Morton Halperin, a
former official in the Johnson, Nixon and Clinton administrations
and now senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
"There was an attempt to give to the U.N. assignment that it
could not perform with the resource and authority it had been
given," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the United Nations has much stronger
support in the United States than almost any other institution.
</P>
<P>
The report called on the U.S. government and Congress to come
together with a realistic appraisal of the U.N.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe Teachers Union
National chairman Felix Mafa today urged the government to
seriously consider addressing civil servants' grievances to avoid
grave social and economic repercussions.
</P>
<P>
Mafa said the government should stop paying lip-service to
civil servant's plight, noting such attitude would lead to a
breakdown in the delivery of essential services.
</P>
<P>
''The government has for a long time misled people into
believing that it was working towards improving the conditions of
service of civil servants thereby raising the expectations of
everyone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on all striking civil servants to maintain a sense
of unity and purpose in order to have an effective voice with
which to confront the government.
</P>
<P>
The union leader warned that teachers will join the industrial
action if the government does not address the issue of civil
servants' salaries and conditions of service before the new
school term begins in September.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Zimbabwean civil servants Began strike yesterday
to press for higher salaries following the awarding of a three
percent salary increase backdated to July.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Equality of women depends on how

equality of women's rights.
</P>

<P>
BAGHDAD, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today denied a "false"
report by CNN that the Iraqi basketball team had disappeared from
the Olympic village in Atlanta where the team was supposed to take
part in the ongoing Paralympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Salman Tawfeeq, Secretary of the Iraqi Federation of
Handicapped Sports was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as saying
that the Iraqi team did not participated in the event because it
has never left Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on a CNN report that the Iraqi team of
wheelchair basketballers disappeared from the Olympic village in
Atlanta after registering as one of the teams taking part in the
games.
</P>
<P>
He said that six-year U.N. trade embargo imposed against Iraq
for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait was the direct cause behind the
absence of the Iraqi team from the games for the handicapped.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iraqi official, the Iraqi team was qualified
for the Paralympic Games in the Middle East region after winning
preliminaries in the Jordanian capital city of Amman last year.
</P>
<P>
Raed Ahmed, an Iraqi weightlifter and flag bearer for the
recently concluded 26th Olympic Games in Atlanta was reported to
have defected with the help of representatives of an overseas-based
Iraqi opposition group and the U.S. has granted him "political
asylum."

<HEADLINE> Picasso, Van Gogh, Monet Become Japanese Bankers' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Numerous French and European arts
masterpieces, purchased by Japanese speculators in Japan's
"financial bubble" era of the 1980s, are now hostages of Japanese
banks who seized the paintings after many speculators went
bankrupt, reported the French daily Le Monde today.
</P>
<P>
Le Monde quoted Japanese arts critic Shinichi Segi as saying in
Tokyo that the public no longer have access to many of the
paintings and don't know where and in what conditions they are.
</P>
<P>
Segi estimated that these paintings, which circulated in the
Japanese market from 1987 to 1990, are worth 3,000 billion yen (30
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Two thirds of the paintings obtained by Japanese are French,
mainly impressionist works signed by Pablo Picasso, Vincent Van
Gogh, Claude Monet, Pierre Renoir, Marc Chagall and some others.
</P>
<P>
Among the "hostages" is "The Wedding Party of Pierrette" by
Picasso. The painting was sold by Swedish speculator Frederik Roos
in November 1987 for 75 million U.S. dollars to Japanese
speculator Tomonori Tsurumaki, who went bankrupt two years later.
</P>
<P>
Some Japanese bankers themselves have become speculators of the
paintings. For instance, Yasumichi Morishita, president of the
Aichi Finance credit bank, has invested 1 billion U.S. dollars in
impressionist paintings.
</P>
<P>
Many speculators made colossal fortunes by trading Western
paintings in the "financial bubble" era with speculations in
"Japanese price," a term used by Westerners to mean unnaturally
high prices.
</P>
<P>
But the transaction volume in the Japanese arts market in 1995
was only 5 percent of that in 1990, the peak year of speculations,
which is about 24 billion yen (240 million dollars), while values
of the paintings dropped by 20-30 percent as compared with several
years ago, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"The Portrait of Doctor Gachet" of Van Gogh, sold for 12
billion yen (120 million dollars) in 1990, now is priced 8 billion
yen (80 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The report said that many Japanese bankers want to throw the
paintings back to the market, but are afraid of losing
considerably by doing so.

LUANDA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- 157 illegal foreign residents
were deported from Angola today, adding the number of the
expelled foreigners since August 8 to 1,017, an Angolan official
said today.
</P>
<P>
Director of National Immigration and Border Department Burity

</P>
<P>
The director noted that the absolute majority of the deportees
are Africans.
</P>
<P>
Miguel Neto, an official of the Foreign Ministry, told
reporters that the government has sent notes to the countries
whose citizens were expelled by Angola, including Senegal, Mali,
Guinea and Mauritania to explain to them the Angolan campaign.
</P>
<P>
He said that the campaign, aiming to create stability in
Angola, will not affect its relations with those African
countries which have expressed their understanding to it.

BAGHDAD, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraq' Health Minister Omed
Medhat Mubarak met here today with his Iranian counterpart Ali
Reza Marandi and the accompanying delegation.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the Iraqi health minister reviewed the
impact of the crippling U.N. trade embargo imposed on Iraq after
its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers discussed relations between their countries
which have not been back on the track of normalization due to the
unsettled issues including that of POWs since the end of the
1980-1988 Iraq-Iran war.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official's visit comes not long after the
U.S. enacted the law of D'amato which punishes non-American
companies making investment in Iran or Libya. The two countries
have been accused by the U.S. of "sponsoring international
terrorism."

American behavior conflicts with international law and norms.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Refutes U.S. Republican Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) today refuted charges from the Republican
Party of the United States that defined the DPRK as a "sponsor of
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The refutal came from an article in the Rodong Sinmun, the
organ of the Workers' Party of Korea.
</P>
<P>
The article pointed out that the U.S. Republican party, in its
"Policy Manifesto" published at its recent national congress,
criticized the DPRK-U.S. framework agreement on the nuclear issue
by defining the DPRK as a "sponsor of terrorism."
</P>
<P>
"This showed that the Republicans do not want peace in the
Korean peninsula by seriously harming the dignity and reputation
of the DPRK," the article said.
</P>
<P>
The framework agreement was not only beneficial to the two
countries but also in the interest of world peace and the
development of international relations, the article noted.
</P>
<P>
What they really want is to kill the agreement, stifle the DPRK
and dominate the whole of Korea, it added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Republican has endangered the outstanding bilateral
issues in a short-sighted manner in pursuing partisan interests,
the article warned.
</P>
<P>
In the hope of winning the forthcoming presidential election,
they has resorted to every conceivable means and even magnified
the DPRK issue and slandered it, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The article demanded the U.S. Republicans view the
DPRK-U.S. issue cool-headedly and act with discretion.
</P>
<P>
If the Republican party refused to discard the thinking pattern
of cold war and continued heaping pressure on the DPRK, it would
be unfavorable to the U.S. itself, the article concluded.

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches Successful Arrow Missile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The operational model of the
Arrow 2 missile has successfully destroyed another missile in a
test firing off the west coast of Israel this afternoon, Israel
Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The target of the ground-to-ground missile was first launched
from a ship in the Mediterranean, shortly after the Arrow was
sent up to intercept it, and within less than a minute, the Arrow
missile directly hit the target.
</P>
<P>
Senior Israeli defense officials and scientists of Israel
Aircraft Industry (IAI), the principal contractor in development
of the Arrow, were at the site as the missile went up.
</P>
<P>
Moshe Karet, director-general of the IAI, told Israel Radio
that today's test was great satisfaction, adding that the real
missile will be operational in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Today's launch was the first of four tests on the Arrow 2
missile's intercepting capability, and the missile is a smaller
weapon, compared with the prototype "Arrow 1", with two stages.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Arrow managers said the tests could be the most
important stage in a 322-million-U.S. dollar project, which is
being financed mainly by the United States, with Israel
contributing 28 percent of the cost.
</P>
<P>
They said the success of these tests will determine whether
an Arrow anti-missile defense system would be operational by
the end of this decade.
</P>
<P>
So far, both the U.S. and Israeli participants in the
eight-year-old project have expressed satisfaction with the
process of the "Arrow 2" and the level of their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media reported that the U.S. and Israeli defense
officials have agreed to give the Arrow 2 project high priority
following reports that the Middle East countries are developing
sophisticated ground-to-ground missile systems.

<HEADLINE> Central Mozambique Plagued by Locusts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Crops in northern and central
Mozambique, especially in Manica, Sofala and Tete provinces, were
seriously damaged by red locusts, the Mozambique Information
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Director of National Agriculture Sergio Gouveia as
saying that the plague of locusts started at the end of last
year.
</P>
<P>
The director said although the local governments had used
aircraft to spray insecticide in the plagued areas, the locusts
can still be seen everywhere.
</P>
<P>
The biggest challenge in eradicating the locusts in the
country is lack of insecticide and aircraft, he added.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the Food and Agriculture Organization of
the United Nations has promised to provide 200,000 US Dollars and
1,4000 liters of insecticide to Mozambique to control the
locusts.

<HEADLINE> Experts from Donor Countries to Gauge Funding to Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 20 (Xinhua)-- In a move to gauge funding to
Cambodia, a number of experts from some donor countries have
arrived here to examine the country's preparations for local and
general elections scheduled for 1997 and 1998 respectively, the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Michael Maley, a member of the Australian Electoral Commission,
and Ron Gould, an assistant to Canada's chief electoral officer
and a member of the Canadian Electoral Commission, have been in
Cambodia to assess preliminary work for the two elections.
</P>
<P>
U.S. embassy officials said the two men will be joined later
today by Theo Noel, a senior official from the U.S.-based
International Foundation for Electoral System.
</P>
<P>
International donors and lending agencies, including Australia
and Canada, pledged a total of 500 million U.S. dollars for
Cambodia's economic reconstruction in 1996 at a meeting held in
Tokyo last month.
</P>
<P>
The donors linked their financial aid to Phnom Penh's efforts
to work for a market economy and enact laws to ensure social
stability, including a law regulating next general elections.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said that the final reports by the three experts
would strongly influence the amount of aid foreign donors would
provide.
</P>
<P>
Cambodian Co-Interior Minister Sar Kheng said last week that
the government would need 40 million dollars to ensure that both
local and general elections, which still remain under preparation,
go smoothly as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources predicted that the three experts would slash
by "40 to 50 percent" the amount of aid demanded by the Cambodian
government.
</P>
<P>
Some donor countries have reportedly complained that the
Cambodian government, formed after U.N.-supervised general
elections in 1993, has not moved fast enough to adopt legislations
to facilitate the forthcoming elections.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Warns West Not to Interfere in Cambodian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen has warned the West not to interfere too much in
the country's election process, according to the Cambodia Daily
today.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen told Adelaide Advertiser, an Australian newspaper, that
he would cancel the elections if the West tried to run the poll or
decide a winner, the Cambodia Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen was quoted as saying that Western technical assistance
and foreign observers were welcome, but how to operate the polls
was a matter of "Cambodian sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a move to gauge funding to Cambodia, a number of
experts from some donor countries have arrived in Phnom Penh to
examine the country's preparations for local and general elections
scheduled for 1997 and 1998, respectively.
</P>
<P>
In another development, three election experts have come to
Cambodia at the invitation of the Ministry of Interior to provide
technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
But diplomats here were quoted by a local newspaper as saying
that vital funding may not arrive unless the government shows
determination to keep the polls free and fair.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Immigration Alarming in S.Africa: Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Illegal immigration into
South Africa is increasing at a very disturbing rate, Home
Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a parliamentary briefing of journalists and
diplomats in Cape Town, Buthelezi said the number of illegal
immigrants in South Africa has been estimated at between two and
five million, but some estimates put the figure as high as eight
million.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said although the South African Police Service
(SAPS) and national defence force are cooperating with his
department to curb the flood of illegals, the priority for the
SAPS now is to concentrate on fighting the high crime rate and
general criminality in the country.
</P>
<P>
Illegal immigration posed a serious threat to the country,
especially as far as the provision of services is concerned, said
the minster, adding that about 12 million Rand (about 2.67
million U.S.Dollars) were spent last year on combatting illegal
immigration.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Home Affairs Director General Piet Colyn said
150,000 illegal immigrants had been deported last year, among
them 70 percent to Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Colyn said illegals formed a high percentage of the
population, but a distinction had to be made between illegal
aliens and refugees, who had a right to be in the country.
</P>
<P>
While Buthelezi announced that his department had received
more than 10,000 applications from citizens of the southern
African Development Community countries who had lived illegally
in South Africa for five years or more, for exemption in terms of
a cabinet decision earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Talks End Without Consensus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Talks on the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty (CTBT) ended here today with a formal veto from India,
smashing the last hope for a consensus needed to forward the
treaty for signature in September.
</P>
<P>
To save the two-and-a-half-year nuclear test ban talks from
ending in vain, some countries were considering jointly submitting
the disputed draft to the United Nations General Assembly in
September for approval, diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
Thus there possibly will still be a CTBT, which is designed to
promote nuclear disarmament and prevent nuclear proliferation.
</P>
<P>
This approach, however, would defy the usual practice of the
Conference on Disarmament, which normally seeks consensus of its
61 members to recommend any treaty. Some countries fear that the
approach would set a dangerous precedent and undermine the
conference's credibility.
</P>
<P>
Should it get the approval of a majority vote at the General
Assembly, the treaty to ban all nuclear tests could be available
for signature, the diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, when the treaty could enter into force is still a
question. As India has made clear its refusal to sign the treaty,
it seems that it would take a long time for the treaty to take
effect.
</P>
<P>
The draft text stipulates that the ratification of 44
countries, including the five declared nuclear states -- Britain,
China, France, Russia and the United States, and the three
so-called "nuclear threshold" countries -- India, Pakistan and
Israel, is needed for the treaty to go into effect.
</P>
<P>
It also specifies that given failure to bring the treaty to
effect three years after its being open for signing, the then
ratifying countries would meet to decide by consensus what
measures in line with the international law should be taken to
promote the treaty ratification.
</P>
<P>
India called the entry-into-force terms "coercive" and claimed
that they would undermine its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Several other non-aligned countries also joined India in
complaining that the treaty did not include a nuclear disarmament
timetable.
</P>
<P>
Another long-debated key point in the treaty was the On-Site
Inspection (OSI) designed to detect potential treaty violations.
To prevent its abuse, it was finally agreed that the conduction of
OSI should be approved by at least 30 votes out of 51 members of
the treaty's executive council.
</P>
<P>
Western nations favored a simple majority, while some
developing countries, including China, wanted a two-thirds
majority, of votes to conduct an OSI.
</P>
<P>
According to the treaty, regular inspections will be carried
out by a global monitoring system, comprising seismological,
radionuclide, hydroacoustic and infrasonic monitoring facilities.
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming majority of the 61 participants of the CTBT
talks, with more or less reservation, have expressed their support
for the draft text.
</P>
<P>
The draft treaty was proposed by the disarmament conference's
Ad Hoc Committee Chairman Jaap Ramaker when the negotiation
entered its final stage in June.
</P>
<P>
The CTBT talks formally started in January 1994. To push it
forward, the U.N. General Assembly in 1995 passed a resolution
urging negotiators to complete the treaty text no later than 1996,
so as to make it ready for signature before its 51st session in
September.
</P>
<P>
All the five nuclear powers had declared a testing moratorium
to facilitate the process during the negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Premier Returns Home from Mideast Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Crown Prince and
Prime Minister Sheikh Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah returned home
today from a four-day official visit to Egypt, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
His tour is seen here as a further effort to cement Kuwait's
ties with its Arab allies and express its support to the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The tour came within delicate Arab circumstance, following the
latest developments including the hardline stance of the Israeli
government led by Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu on peace in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Before he left Lebanon, his last leg of the three-state tour,
the Kuwaiti prime minister said, "It is our duty to consult with
our Arab brethen because the peace process is facing obstacles in
the region and that's why the tour includes Egypt, Syria and
Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
According to official Kuwait News Agency reports, Sheikh Saad
said his meetings with the Egyptian, Syrian and Lebanese
presidents, Hosni Mubarak, Hafez Al-Assad and Elias Hrawi
respectively, and other senior officials "were constructive and
positive and aimed at reaching an agreement on a strategy to serve
the Arab world. We all felt the danger."
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the leaders agreed that the situation in the
region has become dangerous and requires solidarity among the
Arabs to face attempts by Israel to circumvent all the results of
the Madrid conference.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process was one of the main issues
discussed by Sheikh Saad and leaders of the three countries.
</P>
<P>
On challenges posed by the new stand of the right-wing Israeli
government on the Middle East peace process, Sheikh Saad stressed
during his tour that Kuwait supports the Arab endeavors against
Israel's refusal to implement the U.N. resolutions that stipulate
its withdrawal from the Arab territories it occupied in the past.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, Kuwait and Egypt agreed Saturday to
jointly form a ministerial committee to boost cooperation in the
media, economic, cultural, political and investment spheres and
agreed that the committee would meet for the first time early next
month on investment issues.
</P>
<P>
While in Syria, Sheikh Saad and Syrian officials reviewed the
strong relationship between the two countries in the political,
economic and other fields and expressed the hope to further
strengthen their friendly cooperation in various domains,
especially in the economic field.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait had set up a 200-million-dollar Damascus-based United
Kuwaiti Company for Investment whose objective is to invest in the
industrial, agricultural and tourism sectors in Syria. The Kuwait
Fund for Arab Economic Development has extended a total of 632
million U.S. dollars in loans to finance Syrian projects.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saad expressed Kuwait's strong support to the Lebanese
people in the struggle against Israeli attacks, saying "we as an
Arab nation should support Lebanon and to work on the fact that
its security should not be harmed."
</P>
<P>
He started his tour of the three countries last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Local media highlighted Sheikh Saad's tour during the last few
days when he was on the trip from Egypt to Lebanon, saying his
visit took place at a crucial period of time that necessitates
coordination and consultations among the Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
They said the Kuwaitis were very much aware of the value of
Arab unity as a result of their harsh experience in the past. The
three Arab countries stood firmly on the side of Kuwait during the
1991 Gulf war when the allied forces liberated the small emirate
from Iraq's seven-month occupation.

<HEADLINE> UK Takes Tough Line on Open Skies Deal with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The British government has said
that it is not prepared to sign an "open skies" agreement with the
United States similar to the U.S.-German aviation accord, the
Financial Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The British and U.S. government representatives are due to
resume their open skies talks on August 28-29 in Washington and
both sides are anxious to strike a deal before the U.S.
presidential elections in November.
</P>
<P>
However, the British government has made it clear that the
United States would have to make concrete concessions so that a
new aviation agreement can be reached, the report said.
</P>
<P>
One British government official is quoted as saying, "they are
as obdurate as ever. They want everything and they want to give
nothing. With the American elections coming up, the schedule is
rather tight."
</P>
<P>
Washington has demanded an open skies agreement with Britain
before it will give green light to the proposed alliance between
British Airways and the American Airline, which is expected to
create the world's most powerful aviation partnership.
</P>
<P>
Both sides mainly differ over the meaning of open skies: the
Americans view it as the right of any of its carriers to fly to
any point in Britain, including Heathrow airport and onwards to
third countries. The German-U.S. agreement, reached earlier this
year, embodied this principle.
</P>
<P>
But the British side rejected such a deal by saying "we do not
accept the American version of open skies is the only one or the
correct one."
</P>
<P>
British officials said that Britain would not grant "beyond
rights" for passenger flights, which allow U.S. carriers to fly
within the European Union aviation market, while foreign airlines
do not have the right to fly between two points in the U.S."
</P>
<P>
The talks to be held in Washington next week would be limited
to incidental matters on agreeing a disputes procedure and the
next round of talks on substantive issues such as access to
Heathrow airport and American demand for beyond rights are
expected to be held in London in September.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Shares prices in London and Paris
maintained their earlier gains and surged strongly today while
tradings in Frankfurt were cautious ahead of the two monetary
meetings in the U.S. and Germany.
</P>
<P>
London shares hit another new record trading level of 3,884.8
earlier today, boosted by evidence of rising consumer demand and
by reassuring money supply data from both Britain and Germany.
</P>
<P>
London's financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading
British shares finished only slightly below its high.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse carried on its earlier gains today and surged
strongly. The CAC-40 index gained more than 30 points, breaching
the 2,000 barrier for the first time since August 8. The market
ended at its highest level since August 2.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that share prices in Paris were spurred upwards by
a firmer dollar and hopes of a Bank of France interest rates cut.
</P>
<P>
But in Germany, the Frankfurt stock market was unmoved by
Germany's positive money supply data, which showed that growth in
M3 had slowed to an annualized 8.6 percent last month from 9.6
percent in June.
</P>
<P>
Investors were cautious ahead of today's U.S. Federal Reserve's
meeting and Thursday's gathering of Germany's Bundesbank Council.
</P>
<P>
Share prices were lower at the end of the session after a day
of lackluster trade and the market ended mixed.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index closed up 19.5 points at 3,883.2.
Paris's CAC-40 index finished up 33.05 at 2,019.347. Frankfurt's
DAX-30 shares ended floor trade down 2.5 at 2,563.20. The
computerized IBIS index was up 5.87 at 2,562.12.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Raises New Conditions On Hebron Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu today threatened that he will not carry out
redeployment from Hebron until the Palestinian Authority closes
its offices in east Jerusalem and corrects what he called
violations of the Oslo agreement, reported Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu issued the warning when he was speaking at the
Knesset (parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In a tone which appears to contradict his previous assessment,
the prime minister argued that the PLO had not abolished nor
replaced its National Charter, which represents a basic violation
of the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
In general, he said, there are many holes on the Palestinian
side of the reciprocity.
</P>
<P>
He said that he wanted to force Orient House, the PLO office in
east Jerusalem, to close. He also claimed that PA leader Yasser
Arafat himself promised to close two other offices in the Eastern
part of the city, but did not.
</P>
<P>
Until they are closed there will be no progress in
negotiations including on the subject of Hebron, he declared.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu denied charges that Hebron redeployment is being
delayed more by political problems, objections to the redeployment
by some cabinet ministers, than security elements cited by the
premier.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has a conceptual map, not a geographic one, in
his mind at this point for Hebron, indicating that he does not
want to hand over security control to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that he wants a civilian Palestinian entity
with other subjects remaining in Israeli hand.
</P>
<P>
Under Oslo 2 agreement, Israel was supposed to have withdrawn

suicide bombings in Israel and general elections, however,
redeployment was delayed again and again. Netanyahu said that he
considers security to be the most important thing concerning the
issue left over by former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The second batch of 111
Cuban doctors arrived in South Africa today to serve a three-year
contract at state hospitals and clinics throughout the country.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Buyoya Sacks Top Chiefs in Burundi's Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUJUMBURA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Burundi's new military leader
Pierre Buyoya today sacked three hardline top officers in a
shake-up to buttress his position in the ethnically-divided
country.
</P>
<P>
According to an official statement reaching here today,
Buyoya, who seized power in a bloodless coup on July 25,
dismissed Chief-of-Staff Colonel Jean Bikomagu, head of the
gendarmerie Colonel Pascal Simbanduko, and chief of the
presidential guards Colonel Gedeon Fyiroko.
</P>
<P>
They were replaced by Lieutenant-Colonel Vincent Niyungeko,
Lieutenant-Colonel Georges Muhorako and Lieutenant-Colonel Alfred
Ngurunziza, respectively. All of the three are the minority Tutsi
officers.
</P>
<P>
"With the new changes, the president has the right to choose
who he works with. It's not a question of competence or
incompetence. It's just to show that President Buyoya has a free
hand," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Observers say the dismissal of the hardline and powerful
officers was a move by Buyoya to placate regional anger over the
coup that ousted civilian Hutu President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya.
</P>
<P>
Since Buboya's July coup, some African countries, lined by the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), have imposed a military
embargo and economic sanctions on the central African country
torn by years of ethnic strife.
</P>
<P>
But Buyoya has been insisting that the recent coup was a
necessary step to save the country from being plunged into an
all-out civil war between the minority Tutsis and the majority
Hutus.
</P>
<P>
The former military leader, who ruled Burundi for seven years
before voluntarily handing over power to a first-ever civilian
government, said he has the ability and power to achieve national
and ethnic reconciliation in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A Saudi citizen was
beheaded today for stabbing and killing his fellow countryman over
a dispute, the Saudi Interior Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
A ministry statement carried by the Saudi Press Agency said
that the murderer identified as Hmoud Bin Ahmed al-Anbari was
beheaded in the southern province of Jizan, after the execution
had been delayed for a few years until his children reached the
age of consent.
</P>
<P>
The statement did not give more details on when the killing
occurred or the nature of the dispute between the murderer and
the victim, but identified the latter as Hassan bin Ali bin Maeed
Habaini.
</P>
<P>
In another case in Najran, south Saudi Arabia, a Saudi woman
was beheaded last Sunday for killing her husband while the man
was asleep.
</P>
<P>
In Saudi Arabia, crimes of murder and drug trafficking are
punished by beheading according to Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
Today's execution raised the number of people beheaded in the
kingdom this year to 29, which shows lower rate of executions
than in 1995, when a record 192 people were beheaded.

<HEADLINE> International Conference to Mobilize All Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The first International Conference
Against Sexual Exploitation of Children, due to be held on August
27-31 in Stockholm, will mobilize all forces in the world against
the evil of sexual exploitation of children, said the spokeswoman
of the conference June Kane today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French daily Le Monde, Kane said that
several million children -- all those under 18 -- around the world
are being abused as prostitutes, being sold for sexual abuses or
being abused by pornography industries today.
</P>
<P>
She said that each year, about one million children around the
world fall into the misery of prostitution, and this phenomenon
became "universal" in the past five or six years.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said that since the Vietnam War, sexual
exploitation of children has been worsening in Asia, which has
seen a massive influx of foreign tourists. She said that the
trade of child prostitution in Asia is now controlled by organized
criminal groups.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon of sexual exploitation of children is also
widespread in Africa, Europe, South America and the Middle East in
various forms, said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Kane pointed out that many Eastern European children have been
brought to Western Europe by criminal pedophile groups for sexual
abuse, while many children in Western European metropolis sell
themselves sexually on the street for easy money.
</P>
<P>
She said the reasons for the widespread of sexual exploitation
of children are misery, immense economic and social disparity,
massive urbanization, disintegration of family and traditional
community systems, discrimination against girls and women,
ignorance of many parents, and "the eternal human greediness".
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said that the best way to fight this evil is to
mobilize government and non-government forces against all crimes
of sexual exploitation of children by applying appropriate laws,
identifying criminals and making the maximum publicity in the
condemnation of such crimes.
</P>
<P>
She calls for the reinforcement of cooperation between police
forces of all countries, and said that the Interpol has done a lot
to promote multilateral legislations and extra-territorial
condemnation of criminals engaged in sexual exploitation of
children.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman suggested that the fight can begin by
infiltrating into the networks of pedophile groups, who like to
photograph and film their victims and then circulate the photos
around, while the organized criminal gangs are more vigilant and
the sex slaves controlled by them are afraid to talk about their
plight.
</P>
<P>
"We should inform the families about the risks, sensitize the
governments, and change little by little the image that some
societies have of their children. This is a long-term political,
educational and cultural work," she said.

<HEADLINE> Two US Freight Trains Collide in W. Virginia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Two people were killed and
another two were injured in a head-on collision between two
freight trains in West Virginia of the United States early today.
</P>
<P>
The collision between two trains of the CSX Transportation Inc.
occurred at 5 a.m. EDT (0900 GMT) near Smithfield about 150
kilometers southwest of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
Both trains were on a line between Grafton and New
Martinsville. One was en route from Cincinnati to Cumberland,
Maryland, and the other was making the opposite trip.
</P>
<P>
Both trains had three engines. One had 28 cars and the other
had 41. All three engines on the longer train and two empty hopper
cars and four cars of the second train were derailed.
</P>
<P>
One of the derailed cars spilled dust residue from polyvinyl
chloride pellets it had carried, CSX spokesman Marty Fiorentino
said.
</P>
<P>
The polyvinyl chloride, when in liquid form, is flammable and
releases hydrochloric acid when burned and, when in dry form, it
would be hazardous if mixed with diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
Officials said diesel oil spilled by the wreck had not come in
contact with the pellets. There were no plans for evacuation of
local community.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Exports Down Slightly in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Canada's exports slipped 1.8
percent to 16.0 billion U.S. dollars in June after a record high
in May, Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
Lower sales of cars, trucks and energy products had the
greatest impact, offsetting gains in machinery and industrial
goods.
</P>
<P>
Canada's exports were down to most of its major trading
partners, with the exception of Japan, the federal fact-gathering
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Imports climbed 2.3 percent in June to 13.8 billion U.S.
dollars. Machinery purchases accounted for the bulk of the
increase, up following a three month lull, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The decline in exports and rise in imports reduced Canada's
trade surplus to 2.2 billion U.S. dollars in June, down from a
record 2.8 billion in May.

<HEADLINE> Motion to Nationalize Land Passed in Swaziland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A motion to nationalize
all land in Swaziland was passed today by the Swazi senate,
reported the South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
The motion, proposed by former prime minister Prince Bhekimpi,
was aimed to repeal the concessions act of 1907, under which,
former Swazi Kings Mbandzeni and Mswati I gave vast concessions
of land to European settlers.
</P>
<P>
In an emotional speech delivered in Mbabane, Bhekimpi said
such land was loaned to them for free, but they had since claimed
ownership and used and sold it as they pleased.
</P>
<P>
This was essentially stealing land that had been lent to them
by the king, he said.
</P>
<P>
The passing of the motion has sent shock waves through private
and business sectors in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Natural Resources Rev Muntu Dlamini, who
unsuccessfully opposed the motion, warned senators it would have
serious political and economic implications and would shut the
door to investors.
</P>
<P>
A cross-section of Swazis, including land owners, subsistance
farmers, business leaders and cabinet ministers, was also
reported to condemn the move.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Registers Sharp Rise of Budget Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's consolidated budget
showed a deficit of 564 trillion Turkey Liras (TL) (6.558 billion
U.S. dollars) for the first seven months of this year, a sharp
rise from the 103.3 trillion TL (1.2 billion dollars) in the
corresponding period of last year, Finance Minister Abdullatif
Sener said here today.
</P>
<P>
Sener told reporters that the budget deficit was 475.4
trillion TL (5.53 billion dollars) at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
He said that foreign and domestic interest payments and the
transfers to social security institutions accounted for the
biggest totals in expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Interest payments of 844 trillion TL (9.81 billion dollars)
accounted for 44 percent of the total expenditures for the first
seven months while the total payments to the social security
agencies amounted to 170 trillion TL (1.97 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Sener said that tax revenues were the most important item in
the total budget revenues, reaching 1,103 trillion TL (12.83
billion dollars) while non-tax revenues amounted to 78 trillion TL
(907 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Turkish sources here said that the sharp rise of deficit in the
 first seven months of this year maintains pressure on the
coalition government led by pro-Islamic Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan to rein in spending and reduce its interest payment
burden.

<HEADLINE> Sexual Exploitation of Children in Full Expansion: UNICEF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. International Children's
Emergency Fund (UNICEF) today said that the evil of sexual
exploitation of children is in full expansion around the world
with one million children becoming sex slaves each year.
</P>
<P>
A UNICEF report received here said that each day millions of
children are being abused, trapped and sold as commodities in a
worldwide market with estimated billions of U.S. dollars of deals.
</P>
<P>
The first International Conference Against Sexual Exploitation
of Children, to be held in Stockholm on August 27-31, will gather
doctors, social workers, legal experts, and representatives from
various institutions around the world to "give an answer of the
international community to this inhuman industry," said UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
The conference is sponsored by the non-governmental
organization of End Children Prostitution in Asian Tourism, the
Swedish government, UNICEF and the non-governmental organization
of Convention for the Rights of Children.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said that while more than one million children are
sold to illegal sex markets each year, the "larva characteristic"
of the brutal but flourishing business makes it difficult to
obtain reliable statistics on the width and fullness of the
plague.
</P>
<P>
But the latest discovery of a case of monstrous kidnapping and
killing of young girls in Belgium shows that the scarcity of
statistics should not conceal the evidence, said UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
A Belgian man, Marc Doutroux, was found last week to have
kidnapped six young girls for sexual abuse and starved at least
two of them to death. The case could lead to the discovery of a
criminal pedophile network preying on children in Europe,
according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
Local media quoted organizers of the conference as saying that
sexual exploitation of children exists in all parts of the world,
and is "tacitly accepted, if not protected in different degrees of
complicity" in some countries.
</P>
<P>
In a report entitled "From the Bars of Patpong (Thailand) to
the Ghettos of America, Several Million Children Prostitute," the
French daily Le Monde rapped some tourists of America, Europe and
Japan for buying and thus supporting this slave industry.
</P>
<P>
"Far from their homes, the good daddies from Europe, America
and Japan sleep with foreign children. In Thailand, they are
called `crocodiles'," said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said that while Europe has banned children
pornography, the curse is having a full boom in Asia with Japan
becoming its principal market.
</P>
<P>
It said that the fight against sexual exploitation of children
is a tough and long task which will include provision of training,
information, education, aid for economic progress and a fight
against poverty, ignorance, and prejudices.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Accepts Proposal for Joint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash accepted today a proposal to meet with Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides and issue a joint statement aimed at restoring
calm on the divided island.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was put forward by the United Nations special
representative to Cyprus Gustav Feissel.
</P>
<P>
Feissel's initiative came after tension escalated in Cyprus
after two Greek Cypriot demonstrators were killed in clashes with
Turkish troops last Sunday and Wednesday in a buffer zone
separating the island.
</P>
<P>
The violence was the worst of its kind in 22 years on the
island.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's semi-official Anatolia News Agency today quoted
Denktash as saying that he considered the proposed joint
statement "as useful and necessary as it gives the public a
positive message."
</P>
<P>
"The point is not to sit at the table separately. The point is
to come together and to give the tangible message proposed to
us. We accepted this," Denktash said.
</P>
<P>
"I asked him (Feissel) whether Clerides was going to accept
this proposal or not. He said that he thought he would, but that
he had not received an answer yet," Denktash said.
</P>
<P>
Feissel said he expects a response to his initiative from the
Cyprus president within a day or two.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops to
took control of one third of the island' territory following an
abortive coup by the Greek Cypriots supporting union with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared their independence in the
northern part of Cyprus in 1983. Their self-declared republic is
only recognized by Turkey.

SARAJEVO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Flavio Cotti, chairman of the
Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), said on
Tuesday that success of upcoming Bosnian elections depend on the
freedom of movement.
</P>
<P>
Cotti told reporters after his meeting here with Bosnian
(Muslim-Croat) Federation president Kresimir Zubak that the
freedom of movement is the "most important condition" for the
elections to be successful.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that if this free movement of citizens could be
guaranteed, the main condition for minimum correct elections could
be given," Cotti said, adding that there are still "many problems"
concerning free movement in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting Zubak gave the assurance for the free
movement in the federation half of Bosnia and Cotti appealed
Repblika Srpska, which is the other entity of Bosnia, to do the
same.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia's former warring sides, especially the Serbs, have
obstructed the visits by refugees in the past, raising concerns
that bloody incidents would occur on the election day when
hundreds of thousands of refugees are expected to cross
inter-entity boundary line (IEBL) to vote.
</P>
<P>
As a precautionary measure, OSCE will have to set up special
polling stations along the IEBL for refugees whose crossing into
the entity might be blocked.

<HEADLINE> Susan McDougal Gets Two Years in Whitewater Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Susan McDougal, former wife
of one-time Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan President James
McDougal, was sentenced today to two years in prison in the
Whitewater case.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. in Little Rock, Arkansas,
also ordered her to serve three years probation after her prison
time, pay 300,000 dollars plus interest to the Small Business
Administration and a 5,000 dollar fine, according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
Howard denied a request by Mrs. McDougal's attorney that she be
allowed to remain free pending the outcome of her appeal. She was
ordered to report to prison on September 30. She faced up to 17
years in prison and 1 million dollars in fines.
</P>
<P>
Howard handed down the sentence after hearing about an hour of
testimony about Mrs. McDougal's job history, which prosecutors
argued showed "a pattern of defeat" and repeated misleading
statements.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. McDougal, 41, was convicted of obtaining a 300,000-dollar
loan from Capital Management Service, the small business lending
company operated by key government witness David Hale. She signed
the loan application.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. McDougal said she was never aware of the basis for the
loan application, which the government contended was false.
Prosecutors say the funds were used to pay McDougal bills instead
of financing a new business for her.
</P>
<P>
McDougal, her former husband, and former Arkansas Governor Jim
Guy Tucker were convicted on May 28 on fraud and conspiracy charges
in the first Whitewater case to come to trial.
</P>
<P>
Tucker was sentenced Monday to four years probation as the
former Arkansas governor is awaiting a liver transplant.
</P>
<P>
Tucker also was ordered to repay a 1986 Small Business
Administration loan and interest amounting to nearly 300,000
dollars. He also was fined 25,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
James McDougal's sentencing was postponed until November 18,
appearing to confirm published reports that he is cooperating with
Whitewater investigators. The judge has ordered McDougal and
attorneys not to discuss the delay.
</P>
<P>
He could face up to 84 years in prison and 4.5 million dollars
in fines.

<P>
However, the report did not give details.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian prime minister, who was on his first visit to Tehran
in the past six years, was quoted by IRIB as saying that Iran and
Syria can "cooperate in many fields."
</P>
<P>
"Syria believes in great industries established in Iran and
its stand of self-reliance and perseverance," he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the current level of development, Iranian First
Vice-President Hassan Habibi said that the Islamic countries
should carry out massive cooperation in the political, cultural
and economic areas.
</P>
<P>
During his four-day visit to Tehran, Syrian Prime Minister
Zouebi voiced his opposition to the latest U.S. sanction against
Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We declare our opposition to the irrational and
aggressive policies of Washington. We will prove this by signing
major agreements for cooperation and joint investment."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian report said that Zouebi condemned the D'Amato bill
and supported Iran's principled stand "in spite of the desire of
the United States and the Zionist regime."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the D'Amato bill in early
August to impose sanctions against oil companies to invest 40
million U.S. dollars or more a year in Iran or Libya.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the two sides reviewed various
aspects of Tehran-Damascus relations as well as the latest
regional and international developments.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian prime minister left here this evening for home
after winding up his official visit. He was accompanied by a
high-level delegation, including six ministers.

<HEADLINE> Congress Reports 1995 Arms Sales Statistics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Congressional report,
to be released this week, says Russia exceeded the United States
in arms sales last year to the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The Congressional Research Service report, however, admits
that the United States was still far ahead in actual deliveries
of arms last year.
</P>
<P>
Russia agreed to sell about 6 billion U.S. dollars worth of
weapons in 1995, compared to 3.7 billion dollars in the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. arms transfers last year dropped to 3.789 billion
dollars from the 6.218 dollars of 1994, excluding commercial
sales, i.e. not in the official U.S. government program.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. actual deliveries of arms in 1995 were worth 9.537
billion dollars while Russia was far behind with only 2.4 billion
dollars in the same year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there were 1.2 billion dollars worth of U.S.
commercial deliveries in the year that ended in October 1995.
</P>
<P>
France experienced a drastic slip from 8.3 billion dollars in
1994 to 2.4 billion dollars in 1995. Britain came the fourth with
500 million dollars worth of new contracts of arms sales.
</P>
<P>
New agreements for transfers to developing countries last year
totaled 15.4 billion dollars, down from 60 billion dollars in
1988.
</P>
<P>
The report says, "In the most recent period, the United States
has dominated the arms market in the developing world. From
1992 to 1995, the United States made 40.6 billion dollars in arms
transfer agreements with developing nations, 45.3 percent of all
such agreements."

<HEADLINE> 10 Billion Dollars Needed to Boost Iran's Steel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISFAHAN (Iran), August 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran today unveiled an
ambitious plan to boost annual steel production from the current 6
million tons to 10 million tons by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Mines and Metals Mohammad Hussein Mahlouji said at
a press conference here that Iran needs an investment of 10
billion U.S. dollars to complete the massive projects.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country would not have problems about the
financial sources despite the latest economic sanctions imposed by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Citing two examples to support his statement, the Iranian
minister indicated that foreign investment will be absorbed to
develop its industry.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has pledged to invest 400 million dollars in
the copper sector in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
An Australian company is also making feasibility study in the
gold sector in Iran.
</P>
<P>
While answering a question raised by Xinhua, he said, Iran at
present turns out 1,000 kilograms of gold annually.
</P>
<P>
"That is far from enough. Iran has to import gold 30 times as
much as the domestic production," Mahlouji added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran will also export steel products and use
export earnings to boost steel production. He was specially
referring to the Mubarakeh Steel Complex which has a production
capacity of 2.3 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Mahlouji said that Iran will resume export of steel in six
months.
</P>
<P>
Iran has exported 1.8 billion dollars worth of steel to Japan,
Australia, China, South Korea, India, Thailand and some other
Middle East countries in the past five years, he added.
</P>
<P>
There are three main steel complexes -- the Khuzestan Steel
Mill with an annual production capacity of 3 million tons, the
Isfahan Steel Plant with a yearly production of 2.45 million
tons, and the Mubarakeh Steel Complex.
</P>
<P>
Iran, the largest steel producer in the Middle East, plans to
increase steel production output by expanding existing
facilities.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani
today urged the steel industry to raise the steel output of the
Mubarakeh Steel Complex from the present 2.3 million tons to 3.3
million tons and the Isfahan Steel Plant from 2.45 million to 4.5
million tons.
</P>
<P>
President Rafsanjani today inaugurated a production line of
sponge iron at Isfahan's Steel Plant.
</P>
<P>
The new production line designed by Iranian engineers will
produce 600,000 tons of sponge iron a year.
</P>
<P>
Some 26 million dollars have been spent on promoting the new
method of producing sponge iron through reducing scrap-iron to
the material.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Ministry of Mines and Metals claimed that the
Isfahan's Steel Plant has registered this method of sponge iron
production for the first time in the world's steel industry.
</P>
<P>
Over 15,000 tons of equipment were used to assemble the
production line, known as the Qa'em 2 project.

<HEADLINE> US President Signs Bill to Raise Minimum Wage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
signed today a bill which increases the U.S. federal minimum wage
by 90 cents from 4.25 dollars per-hour to 5.15 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bill, passed by the U.S. Congress on August 2, raises the
federal minimum wage from 4.25 dollars an hour to 4.75 effective
on October 1 this year and to 5.15 dollars an hour on September 1,
1997.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first increase in five years in the minimum
wage, which is near an inflation-adjusted 40-year low.
</P>
<P>
"This bill says to the working people of America that if you're
willing to take responsibility and go to work, your work will be
honored," Clinton said at the signing ceremony on the South Lawn
of the White House.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 10 million Americans will see wage increases in
their paychecks just before voters choose between Clinton and
Republican Bob Dole in the November presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to raise the minimum wage was put forward by the
government in March. But U.S. Republican leaders, particularly in
the House, adamantly opposed increasing the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
Accusing Democrats of playing politics in the election year,
they argued that the increase would destroy entry-level jobs
needed by millions graduating from high school or leaving welfare.
</P>
<P>
In the end, it was moderate Republicans, many from Northeastern
states with large working-class populations, who forced Republican
leaders to make a concession and bring the measure to a vote.
</P>
<P>
The measures which Republicans added to the wage-increase bill
include, among others, 21 billion dollars in tax breaks over 10
years for small business owners and partly excluding workers who
receive tips from the increase.
</P>
<P>
The wage-increase bill is considered by many people as a
victory for U.S. Democrats in the election year.

<P>
ANKARA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Acting Prime Minister
Tansu Ciller said here this evening that Turkey would participate
in different fairs to be held in Iraq between August and November
in a bid to export more to the country.
</P>
<P>
Ciller, who also serves as Foreign Minister, said Turkey would
try to export the necessities worth of 1.3 billion U.S. dollars
to Iraq in line with a U.N. decision to allow Baghdad to sell 2
billion dollars worth of oil every six months to buy food and
medicine for the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
She added that Turkish businessmen will make contributions to
the development of the volume of trade between Turkey and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Mehmet Yildirim, chairman of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce,
has said after a trip to Baghdad that the volume of trade between
the two countries was set to reach over 1 billion dollars by the
end of 1996 and hopefully will achieve the pre-1990 levels of over
2.5 billion dollars next year.
</P>
<P>
Yildirim said that the Iraqi authorities viewed Turkey and
Turkish businessmen as the best possible trade partners.
</P>
<P>
He also listed a number of proposals for government and
private sector firms to help them reach the one-billion-dollar
trade volume by the end of this year, but he did not
elaborate.

<HEADLINE> IFOR Suspends Destroying Munitions From Serb Army Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Spokesman for the NATO-led
peace Implementation Force (IFOR) Sector Southwest Paul Brook said
today that the destruction of Serb ammunition scheduled for today
was suspended for investigation purposes.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of planned 90 tons of ammunition found by the
IFOR from a Serb army dump in the village of Margetici was
destroyed Monday and explosions were heard five kilometers away,
the Tanjug news agency quoted Brook as telling a press conference
in Banja Luka, the largest Serb city in northwestern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR found 300 tons of arms and ammunition in Margetici
last week in eastern Bosnia which the IFOR regarded as
unauthorized and must be destroyed. The IFOR estimated that the
destruction of all these munitions could last a week.
</P>
<P>
The general staff of the Serb army sent letters Monday to the
NATO and IFOR commands, calling for a suspension of destroying
these weapons, and warning this operation represented a dangerous
provocation and could cause an environmental disaster.
</P>
<P>
Brook denied a Serb TV broadcast Monday evening that the IFOR
intended to hide toxic materials in craters which will remain
after the explosions.

BELGRADE, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A Yugoslav military court today
sentenced four Yugoslavs from one to five years' imprisonment for
espionage and revealing military secrets to a foreign power.
</P>
<P>
The military court in Nis, a city in southern Serbia, sentenced

then passed the information to a foreign country. Blasko is still
at large and wanted by the police, Tanjug added.

<HEADLINE> Chrysler Will Build New Plant in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Chrysler Corp., one of the
three major automakers in the U.S., will invest 315 million U.S.
dollars in a new Brazilian assembly plant.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers here describe the investment as a critical
step in its effort to carve out a share of the emerging world's
fastest-growing auto-motive market.
</P>
<P>
The automaker also announced plans to invest an additional 65
million U.S. dollars in a plant in Argentina still under
construction.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Robert J. Eaton of Chrysler said that the company had
set a short-term goal of selling 100,000 vehicles a year in South
America.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian market is a hotbed of automotive growth,
reflecting the country's revitalized economy and the virtual
elimination of inflation, which had run as high as 10 percent a
day in the early 1990s. In 1992, Brazilian motorists bought just
772,000 cars and trucks. Last year, volume climbed to 1.7 million.
The sales will jump to 2.5 million by the end of the decade,
according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
Other auto companies lost no time in entering the market. Ford
Motor Co., Fiat SPA, Mercedes-Benz AG and Honda Motor Co., all
have set up plants in the country. Industry sources estimate auto
manufacturers from around the world will spend at least 11 billion
U.S. dollars in Brazil by the end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler will focus on light trucks, which are now dubbed
"Popular Cars" on the market, the company said.

<HEADLINE> Time Mature for Political Talks With Taiwan, Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior official said here
today that it is time for political talks between the two sides of
the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Tang Shubei, executive vice chairman of Association for
Relations across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) said he hoped that
Taiwan authorities should take concrete and practical actions for
political negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Tang made the remarks during a meeting with a visiting group
from Taiwan on the exchange of affairs between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Tang told the visitors that it has been a persistent stance of
the mainland that to realize the reunification of China, the two
sides should settle political disputes through political
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, Taiwan authorities have in the past refused
to hold political talks and have tried to reach its political goal
of "split the country and rule under separate regimes" during
unofficial talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's attitude on the issue has been the fundamental cause
of various failures related to talks between the ARATS and the
Straits Exchange Foundation of Taiwan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that the two organizations have made some progress in
tackling problems regarding the legal rights of people from the
two sides of the straights. But the key point between the two
sides lies in the political issue, as has been proved by the
situation across the straits since last year.
</P>
<P>
The mainland holds that the two sides should, under the
principle of one China, hold political talks on issues including
the way to end the hostility between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
To this end, consultations should be held, on an equal footing,
to set the mutually acceptable pattern, time and method for
holding the talks, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
A sound atmosphere is necessary for resuming the consultations
between the two organizations, Tang stressed. He asked Taiwan
authorities to stop their "two Chinas" and "one China, one Taiwan"
activities in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
"We have noticed that the Taiwan side has come to realize the
necessity to hold political talks between the two sides of the
straights," he said, expressing the hope that Taiwan authorities
would come up with concrete, practical actions.

efforts by central and local governments, Pudong New Area in
Shanghai, China's largest city, has been built into one of
the most attractive foreign investment zones in the country.
</P>
<P>
Over 4,000 overseas-funded enterprises have been set up in
Pudong, with a total direct foreign investment of 10.8 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
In April 1990, the Chinese government made Pudong a special
economic development zone, and since then an increasing number of
overseas investors have poured their money into the area, with the
improvement in the investment environment.
</P>
<P>
In the earlier stages most of the foreign-invested firms were
engaged in secondary, labor-intensive industries. But since 1993,
more and more overseas-funded tertiary industries, including real
estate, banking and trade businesses, have developed in the zone.
</P>
<P>
Sixty world-famous transnational companies, from the United
States, Japan, Hong Kong, Switzerland, Germany, France, the United
Kingdom and other countries and regions, have invested a total of
4.42 billion US dollars in 100 projects in Pudong.
</P>
<P>
Some of the transnationals have moved their headquarters or
regional headquarters to Pudong in a bid to expand their
businesses in China.
</P>
<P>
Most of the foreign-funded projects are large in terms of their
investment volume, and 379 such projects have an investment of 10
million US dollars each. They have been playing a remarkable role
in the development of Pudong.

<HEADLINE> Iran Plans to Launch Satellite to Counter Cultural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran has announced that it plans
to launch its own satellite to counter the Western cultural
invasion.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Mustafa Mirsalim
disclosed in today's Persian evening paper Kayhan that Iran is
planning to place an exclusive satellite into the orbit to
confront the Western cultural invasion.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for a high-ranking government official
to talk about the specific program to launch the satellite.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government is making preparation and the
project is underway.
</P>
<P>
The government has also taken measures in the cultural, social
and economic fields in a bid to counter the cultural invasion, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He did not give details about the satellite project.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Iran insists on banning satellite dishes in
the Iranian society as part of its efforts to fight against Western
cultural invasion despite widespread opposition.
</P>
<P>
According to a local monthly magazine, Iran is ready to launch
a satellite called Zohreh (Venus) for telecommunication purposes.
</P>
<P>
"The satellite is ready. We are waiting for the permission to
launch it by the authorities," an official of Telecommunication
Corporation of Iran (TCI) said.
</P>
<P>
The launching of the satellite was on the new year agenda of
the Iranian authorities since President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani
announced it in the new fiscal budget starting from March 20 this
year.
</P>
<P>
The Persian magazine Payam-e Emrouz did not reveal whether the
satellite was imported or made inside the country.
</P>
<P>
The report did not mention which foreign company would help
Iran launch the satellite because Iran has no capability of
satellite launching.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the magazine reported that the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU) had given a deadline to Iran for
launching its satellite otherwise it would lose the right to use
the orbits.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Post, Telecommunication and Telephone Minister Mohammad
Gharazi told the press last summer that financial problem was the
main obstacle for launching of the satellite.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Surplus May Reverse in 25 Years: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's current state of
high savings and external surpluses could reverse to a deficit
situation in 25 years because of the country's aging population,
the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said in a report
published today.
</P>
<P>
While Singapore's gross domestic savings rate is projected to
decline only slightly before 2005, the drop should accelerate from
2010 onwards, the report said.
</P>
<P>
MAS added that the country's present and projected external
surpluses should be viewed in the context of its earlier history
of chronic deficits. In the 1970s and 1980s, Singapore ran
persistent current account deficits.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's current and future surpluses are a reflection of
its more mature stage of economic development, MAS explained.
</P>
<P>
In the light of the eventual reversal to deficit, the current
high savings and strong pace of reserve accumulation are desirable
when most of Singaporeans are still in their working years and
incomes are still growing rapidly, it said.
</P>
<P>
Only under such circumstances will Singapore be able to sustain
its necessary investment in education, health care and other
social services, said the report.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Princess Maha Chakri
Sirindhorn of Thailand toured Beijing Language and Culture
University today.
</P>
<P>
The princess exchanged books with president of the University
and toured some of the computerized facilities on the campus. She
also found a book she wrote on her previous China trip in the
University library.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Language and Culture University focuses on teaching
and researching Chinese language.
</P>
<P>
Princess Sirindhorn, who speaks good Chinese, has an interest
in Chinese culture and history. Whenever she visits China she
tours culture institutions and writes her own travel notes.
</P>
<P>
Though this is her 7th visit to China, the country - in her
own words the "hometown of the dragon" - attracts her just as
much as it did on her first visit.
</P>
<P>
An official at the Thai embassy in Beijing said the princess
"enjoys everything here" -- China's culture, landscapes, even
Maotai, the well-known alcoholic beverage.
</P>
<P>
Before arriving in Beijing earlier today, the princess
visited Sichuan and Hubei provinces, and studied the preservation
of cultural relics near the Three Gorges area.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Concerned About Growing Household Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government is
concerned about the high growth rate of household debts, the
Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said in its annual report
released today.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the rising level of household debts
mainly to more spending by Singaporeans on assets such as
property.
</P>
<P>
It said the government acted timely in its anti-speculation
curbs on property. As for the current slowdown in the electronics
sector, MAS said it did not see the economy heading for a
recession like the one in 1985.
</P>
<P>
MAS recalled that the 1985 recession was brought about by a
confluence of several factors, including a collapse of the
construction sector.
</P>
<P>
The report said MAS expects a modest recovery in the
electronics sector next year as new orders for electronic products
in the United States have picked up recently.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that Singapore has already diversified its
electronic markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
As for the economic growth this year, MAS' forecast is seven to
eight percent, similar to that of the Ministry of Trade and
Industry.

JERUSALEM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli border guards and

Izarieh and Abu Deis villages in the West bank, said a report of
JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Israeli sources as saying that the raids

telephone.

He condemned the raid as a violation of the peace agreements
signed between Israel and the PLO. He added that the PA will file
a complaint to the Israeli government against the practice, which
he described as an aggressive act against the PA.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Minister for Foreign
Affairs and International Co-operation Kalonzo Musyoka said today
Kenya will insist on its "one China" position.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan foreign minister made the remarks while meeting the
visiting Chinese Vice- Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei in his
office this morning.
</P>
<P>
Musyoka said: "On bilateral relations, Kenya will insist the
'one China' principle, and we will further promote this
principle."
</P>
<P>
Tian Zengpei appreciated for Kenya's stand, saying that this
stand amounts to Kenya's support for China's sovereignty,
territorial integrity and unity of the country.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders expressed satisfaction over their identity of
views on many international issues. They criticized the west
countreis' human rights view and the double standards in this
aspect the western countries have adopted to different countries.
</P>
<P>
Tian said some western countries has politicized the human

different countries for their political purpose.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM: Lawsuit against US Gets No Response </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The International Tribunal of
Justice at the Hague has not yet made response to Iran's lawsuit
against the United States, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister said at a press conference that
"it is too early to get any response from the International
Tribunal of Justice because it is time-consuming."
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "we will follow the issue very carefully."
</P>
<P>
Iran lodged a lawsuit against the United States in the
International Court of Justice at the Hague on August 12.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said the U.S. allocation of 20 million U.S. dollars to
be spent on subversion against the Iranian government is in
contradiction with the international conventions recognizing the
independence of states and prohibiting interference in the
internal affairs of other nations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. covert program was passed by the House of
Representatives in December and approved by the White House this
year.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said the U.S. legislation against Iran is
also in violation of the Algeria accord stipulating that the two
countries would not interfere in each other's internal affairs,
which was signed by Iran and the U.S. in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Iran's complaint also included the U.S. legislation on
intensifying embargo on Iran.
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the D'Amato
bill into law to punish non-American companies which make new
investments of more than 40 million dollars annually in the oil
and gas sectors in Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
The move, which sparked international criticism, came after
Washington failed to convince other Western countries to join its
unilateral economic embargo imposed on Iran in June 1995.

<HEADLINE> Regulations on Managing Cargo Transport Agents Across Taiwan Straits issued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) has issued a series of
regulations for managing cargo transport agents across the Taiwan
Straits. The new procedures become effective today.
</P>
<P>
The document, comprising 14 articles, is aimed at promoting the
development of trade, economy and shipping industries across the
Taiwan Straits and keeping normal order of cargo transport agents,
in accordance with the principles of one-China, two-way direct
shipping service and mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
It stipulates that direct cargo transport on the sea between
harbors on the Chinese mainland and Taiwan is deemed to be
domestic transportation with special management.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC is an institution in charge of the business and
management according to the country's relevant laws and the
situation of supply and demand of the cargo transport market
across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The document says that those who are engaged as cargo transport
agents should be approved by MOFTEC.
</P>
<P>
Those who want to apply to be cargo transport agents should
accord with two conditions.
</P>
<P>
-- The enterprises should be international cargo transport
agents established with the ratification of the Ministry, with
their capital totally coming from enterprises on the Chinese
mainland.
</P>
<P>
-- Ratified by the ministry, they should be joint ventures and
cooperative enterprises invested by both Chinese mainland and
Taiwan investors and engaged as agents in international cargo
transport.
</P>
<P>
It also says that the ministry will regularly announce lists of
names of enterprises handling such business. Those who want to be
involved in the business of direct cargo transport on the sea
should choose their agents from among enterprises affirmed by the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
Those who violate the relevant laws and decrees, as well as the
newly issued regulations, will be punished by the ministry, the
document says.
</P>
<P>
The regulations on the management of direct passenger and cargo
shipping business across the Taiwan Straits, made known to the
public by the Ministry of Communications yesterday, and the
regulations on managing cargo transport agents are described as a
major event in economic exchanges and trade between the two sides
of the Taiwan Straits. They are also seen as an important measure
for promoting direct exchange of mail services, trade, air and
shipping services.

HARARE, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's civil servants today
defied a government order to end a nationwide strike as more
joined the industrial action, further crippling the provision of
essential services in the country.
</P>
<P>
Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare Minister Florence
Chitauro last night ordered the workers to return to work or face
dismissal.
</P>
<P>
Unions leaders today continued to mobilize workers to take the
strike action to press the government to review upwards a nine
percent salary increment.
</P>
<P>
Health workers including doctors, nurses and other support
staff entered third day of the work boycott, demanding a 60
percent raise to salaries and wages.
</P>
<P>
Medical officers from the police, army, airforce and some
volunteers from the Red Cross have stepped in to assist at
government hospitals, but they are failing to cope.
</P>
<P>
The critical situation at the hospitals in Harare further
deteriorated as the skeleton staff, overwhelmed by the increased
workload, started to show signs of strain.
</P>
<P>
More government departments joined the industrial action
compared to Tuesday when only health workers and a few from some
ministries took part in.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Says It Does Not Fear Any U.S. Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has no reason to
fear any U.S. sanctions following its investment in Iran's oil and
gas industry because it is meant to help the people in that
country, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said today.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. did not try to dissuade Malaysia from making
the deal with Iranian authorities, under which Malaysia's national
petroleum company will take up a 30-percent stake in Iran's Sirri
A and E fields.
</P>
<P>
"We feel we have the right to make our own assessment,"
Mahathir told reporters after attending the second Asia-Pacific
Conference on Plant Physiology, which opened Tuesday in Shah Alam,
25 kilometers southwest of Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
He said the Malaysian investment was not meant to support the
Iranian government or assist it in any way, and but to try to help
the people of Iran.
</P>
<P>
"We don't believe that we should punish the people who are
innocent. You can't starve a whole nation," he was quoted as
saying by the Malaysian news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
"We know the general feelings of the U.S. ... We are for
working with the U.S. in certain matters, and where we disagree,
we will not work with them," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton earlier signed a bill aimed at
punishing foreign firms that invest 40 million U.S. dollars or
more annually in Iran's or Libya's energy sector.

The number of joint projects involving Arab countries stands at
408, with an investment of 4.6 billion Riyals (1.23 billion
dollars), according to the study.
</P>
<P>
The improvement in the quality of locally made products by the
joint ventures and their ability to compete with commodities from
other parts of the world have boosted the demand for them, the
study said.
</P>
<P>
The study noted the joint ventures are expected to boost Saudi
Arabia's exports in the coming years, adding that the total
exports of the kingdom may reach around 95 billion Riyals, or
25.33 billion dollars, in the next three years.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities Urged to Take Steps to Improve Cross-Straits Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official today urged
the Taiwan Authorities to remove obstacles as early as possible
and take substantial steps under the one-China principle to start
a direct mail service, trade, air and shipping services across the
Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Liu Xiangdong, assistant minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, made the remarks when a regulation on managing cargo
transport agents was issued in Beijing by the ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said the promulgation of the document, and another
regulation on the management of direct passenger and cargo
shipping business, was of an important significance to the
development of closer economic relationship and trade between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that the Chinese government has made
unremitting efforts for developing economic relations and trade
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
As early as January 1, 1979, the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress called for the direct exchange of mail
services, trade, air and shipping services.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 17 years, the ministry has worked hard in this
regard and adopted a series of policies and measures with a view
to pushing forward economic relations and trade between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
In trade, Liu said that the mainland first unilaterally opened
its market, and adopted preferential taxation rates in importing
commodities from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1995, the mainland's unfavorable balance of trade
with Taiwan amounted to 53.6 billion U.S. Dollars. This fully
shows the mainland's determination and sincerity to promote the
exchange of trade across the straits.
</P>
<P>
In investment, Liu said that the ministry also enacted a series
of preferential policies to encourage Taiwan compatriots to invest
in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The law on the protection of investment from the Taiwan
compatriots, promulgated by the ministry in 1994, has provided
Taiwan investors with the full protection by law, he said, adding
that relevant departments will formulate regulations on the
full implementation of the law in a shortest possible time.
</P>
<P>
But Liu noted that the Taiwan Authorities have stuck to the
policy of no contact, no negotiations and no compromise, and have
refused to realize the direct exchange of mail service, trade, air
and shipping services.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Taiwan authorities's attempt to create
"two Chinas" has resulted in a tense relationship across the
Taiwan Straits, which also affected the Taiwan economy.
</P>
<P>
Under those circumstances, industrialists on the Taiwan Island
urgently asked for practical measures to be taken to improve
relations across the straits, he said.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, leaders of the Taiwan Authorities recently
declined to talk about the exchange of mail services, trade, air
and shipping services. This shows that they have no sincerity at
all to improve relations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the Taiwan Authorities will put the
whole interest of the Chinese nation above everything else to
realize the exchange of the three services at an early
date.

<HEADLINE> US Survey Reports More Drug Use by Teen-Agers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Marijuana smoking among
American teen-agers had jumped 141 percent from 1992 to 1995 and
that overall teen-age drug use more than doubled, according to a
drug survey released on Tuesday by Federal Administration.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that though overall drug use nationwide
remained flat from 1994 to 1995 and was far below the peak levels
of the late 1979's, it jumped among teen-agers. Among youths ages
12 to 17, 10.9 percent had used illegal drugs in the months before
they were surveyed, up 33 percent from 1994 and up 105 percent
from the 10-year low in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Another study released on Tuesday by the Drug Abuse Warning
Network showed that from 1992 to 1995, emergency room cases
connected to marijuana rose by 96 percent, while those connected
to heroin rose 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since the rise in teen drug use is generational,federal
government officials and experts stressed that a new push on
antidrug propaganda in American schools and homes is needed.

<HEADLINE> "Collected Works of Research Theses on Deng Xiaoping's Diplomatic Thoughts" published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The "Collected Works of Research
Theses on Deng Xiaoping's Diplomatic Thoughts" was published today
by the World Knowledge Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
Important speeches, by President Jiang Zemin, Vice Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, and heads of relevant departments,
and more than thirty theses are collected in the new book.
</P>
<P>
The theses and speeches were delivered at a symposium on Deng
Xiaoping's diplomatic thoughts, which was held by the Chinese
Foreign Ministry at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
All the theses and speeches expounded the rich intension of
Deng's diplomatic thoughts from different angles, and China's
diplomatic practice in following it.
</P>
<P>
By exchanging their intimate knowledge, all of the authors
considered Deng Xiaoping an outstanding international strategist
and world diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Deng inherited and developed Mao Zedong's diplomatic
thoughts. His diplomatic thoughts are an important component of
his theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
According to the change in the international situation, Deng
made a major strategic adjustment to China's diplomatic policy,
and determined China's international strategy and diplomatic line
in the new period.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that Deng's extensive and profound diplomatic
thoughts, which greatly enriched and perfected China's independent
foreign policy of peace, has led China to achieve one success
after another in its diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
The practice has proved that, in the new period, Deng's
diplomatic thoughts were the guiding thinking of China's
diplomacy, and to uphold the thoughts will be a guarantee in
smoothly carrying out the country's diplomatic work.
</P>
<P>
The authors are experts, who have studied Deng's diplomatic
thoughts for many years, and heads of some departments of the
Chinese Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The new work is seen, therefore, as an important reference book
on studying Deng's diplomatic thoughts and on better understanding
China's diplomatic policy and line.

<HEADLINE> IFOR Destroys Almost Half of Serbs' Illegal Ammunition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The NATO-led Implementation
Force (IFOR) in Bosnia has destroyed almost half of the 300-ton
ammunition seized at a Bosnian Serb munition dump, an IFOR
spokesman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
IFOR spokesman Brett Boudreau said that the IFOR has destroyed
about 130 tons of ammunition by this morning at the Sokolac town
in eastern Bosnia, where the weapons were discovered on August 5
by an IFOR patrol.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 IFOR soldiers started to destroy the ammunition
last weekend in a so-called "Operation Volcano."
</P>
<P>
The Serbs were accused of violating the Dayton peace accord for
not reporting the ammunition to the IFOR.
</P>
<P>
Boudreau said that the IFOR also found 11 depots which held
3,000 tons of ammunition and six training and radar relaying sites
within the self-proclaimed Republic Srpska.
</P>
<P>
He said that both the ammunition and military facilities would
be destroyed or moved to other sites regonized by the IFOR in 14
days.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with IFOR ground troops commander Michael
Walker today, the Serb representatives from Sokolac said that
blow-up of the ammunition would pollute the town's water supply.
</P>
<P>
However, the IFOR believed that there was little evidence of
pollution, Boudreau said.

<HEADLINE> First Poem On Deng Xiaoping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A 3,000-line poem, the "Ode to
Deng Xiaoping", the first lyric poem to honor the general
architect of China's reform and opening-up drive, was recently
published in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The poem, in the style of the Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky,
is divided into six parts: "Prelude", "Ode to the General
Architect", "Way of Exploration", "Economic Reform", "Great
Changes in China", and "Hong Kong, Oh Hong Kong".
</P>
<P>
The politically-inspired lyric poem illustrates the course that
Deng has pursued for more than 90 years, and opportunities,
prosperity, and glory his thought has brought about in China.
</P>
<P>
The author of the work, Gui Xinghua, 49, was an intellectual in
Shanghai who, as a young person, worked on a farm in a poor county
in each China's Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
"Without Deng, my generation and I would not have what we have
today. And modern-day China would not be as prosperous and
glorious as it is," Gui, who has published over 500 poems and
3,000 pieces of lyric prose, commented.
</P>
<P>
To write the poem, Gui went through a lot of material on Deng
and Deng's works, and visited many places, including Beijing,
Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Xiamen and Deng's birthplace in Sichuan, in an
effort to experience the great changes that Deng's theory has
brought about in China.
</P>
<P>
The poem has been carried by the local monthly magazine
"Opening" and will be scripted for a TV series by a local TV
station, to be read aloud by some well-known artists.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The National People's Congress
(NPC), China's parliament, will send three groups to oversee the
law enforcement in three provinces in the coming month.
</P>
<P>
The groups will inspect how well public security has been
maintained over the past five years by local law enforcement
bodies in Liaoning, Shandong and Shaanxi provinces, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee has also asked the governments of
five other provinces and municipalities, including Sichuan,
Shanghai, Zhejiang, Guangdong and Hainan, to make a similar check
of their respective law enforcement agencies on an individual
basis, and report the results to the Standing Committee, the NPC
officials said.
</P>
<P>
China's public security has improved since the "strike hard"
crackdown on crime three months ago, said Li Ximin, the NPC
Standing Committee vice-chairman, after hearing reports on the
country's comprehensive plan to tackle problems in public security.
</P>
<P>
However, Li said, some local leading officials did not do their
job well and the grassroots organizations are not strong enough.
</P>
<P>
The situation of public security in some areas is serious, and
the quality of the law enforcement officials should be improved,
Li said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the NPC inspection will focus on the
responsibility of the leading officials and building of the
grassroots units, he said.
</P>
<P>
The inspection groups will also oversee the local agencies'
efforts to fight crime, and work to improve the quality of law
enforcement officials.

<HEADLINE> Housing Construction Will be Made New Economic Growth Pole (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- House construction is a new
growth pole of economy, said China's Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji in
a recent talk.
</P>
<P>
He explained that as one of China's biggest needs now, house
construction will help such key industries as steel and
building materials to develop faster.
</P>
<P>
According to related authorities, at present housing is
becoming a new consumer focus, and one of the main motives to push
economic growth in China.
</P>
<P>
A series of plans and countermeasures made by both the central
and local governments have been carried out in the recent months.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference recently held in Beijing, Chen Jinhua,
minister of the State Planning Commission, said that in the first
half of this year, investment coming to the real estate sector
witnessed the fastest growth after infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Chen said: "In the next half of this year China will hasten its
step in carrying out housing projects nationwide, and the
investment going to this sector will continue to be enlarged".
</P>
<P>
"This will help to form a new consumer focus and a new market,
which will benefit the readjustment of the whole economic
structure", he said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor of Beijing Zhang Baifa said recently at the
opening ceremony of a real estate trade fair that in the coming
several years the real estate sector will still have bright
prospects in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
But the deputy mayor stressed that in Beijing the really
urgent need is for standard apartments for ordinary residents,
not luxury or expensive villas.
</P>
<P>
"Better not to invest in villa construction in the next
several years," the deputy mayor told developers.
</P>
<P>
According to him, only 20 percent of approved villa projects in
Beijing are underway in Beijing, and the rest have had to be
postponed or even scrapped due to financial or market reasons.
</P>
<P>
"To those which don't have the ability to continue the project
the municipal government will withdraw the right to use the
land," Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> China Remains Largest Re-export Partner of HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- China remained the largest
partner for Hong Kong's re-export trade. Of the total 550.8
billion HK dollars (70.61 billion US dollars) of re-exports going
through Hong Kong in the first half of 1996, 89 percent involved
China in either direction, according to official statistics
released today.
</P>
<P>
The statistics show that re-exports accounted for 85 percent of
the value of total exports in the first half of this year, while
in the same period of 1995, the corresponding share was 83
percent.
</P>
<P>
As a source, re-exports originating in China accounted for 56
percent of Hong Kong's re-export value in the first six months,
while as a destination, China's share was 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is noted that much of the re-export trade involving China is
related to outward processing, as raw materials and
semi-manufactured goods are exported to China for processing, with
the final products subsequently returned to Hong Kong and
re-exported to overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
Other main origins of Hong Kong's re-exports in the first half
of 1996 included Japan, Taiwan, the United States and South Korea.

Shandong province, the provincial government claimed that by the
year 2010, the province will basically settle the housing
problem: a comfortable house for each family.
</P>
<P>
According to the ambitious plan of Shandong province, a total
new area of 120 million square meters will be built by the end of
this century, and, by 2010 the figure will be 370 million square
meters.
</P>
<P>
It is also reported that in the Shangrao prefecture of east
China's Jiangxi province, the total cost of house building in the
past five years has reached 470 million Yuan (58 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
"80 percent of the funds were collected by the residents
themselves", said an official from the local government.
</P>
<P>
"The large amount of housing not only makes the housing area
per capita exceed eight square meters, which is the line for
comfort, but has also become a great dynamic force in the overall
economic growth", he added.
</P>
<P>
The Shangrao prefecture of Jiangxi province is one of the first
pilot areas for housing reform in China.

<HEADLINE> Licenses for Non-Official Job Agencies Restricted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Labor and the
State Administration of Industry and Commerce have issued
regulations that govern the management of job agencies, with an
emphasis on tightening the control over those that are not
official.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by 1995, China had more than 29,000 such
agencies. Over the past few years, more than 10 million people
found jobs through these businesses.
</P>
<P>
A Labor Ministry official warned that some of the non-official
agencies provided false information and cheated their clients, and
some were even involved in criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
He said these illegal practices not only disturb the normal
order of the labor market and infringe on the legal rights and
interests of both employers and employees, but also endanger
public security.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, all of the job agencies must be
licensed by the local labor departments. Agencies for business
purposes must first be approved by the labor departments, and
apply for a license from the institutions of the State
Administration of Industry and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The official also called on departments involved to check into
the current situation, and to crack down on illegal agencies and
activities.
</P>
<P>
China's labor departments at all levels have opened job
agencies for public interests to promote the steady flow of the
labor force, and the appropriate placement of labor
resources.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Capital City Paralyzed by General Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A general strike called by a
leftist party virtually paralyzed this capital city of Nepal today
with almost all the shops and businesses remaining closed
throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
The close-down program in the Kathmandu valley has been
launched by the United People's Front (UPF) in protest at the
alleged border encroachment by India in Nepal's eastern border
area.
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere in the city was generally quiet with tight
security in downtown areas for the whole day, as riot police were
deployed at main street corners.
</P>
<P>
No clashes between protesters and police were reported by the
evening.
</P>
<P>
The ultra-leftist UPF party has launched a nation-wide protest
program on Saturday against the alledged territorial encroachment
by India, the local press said.
</P>
<P>
Suspicions of Indian encroachment were raised last month in
Nepal's eastern border area where local people claimed that a new
border pillar between the two countries was erected inside the
Nepali territory.
</P>
<P>
However, the Nepali government had already clarified that the
new border pillar was erected in accordance with an 1816
Nepal-India border treaty and under an agreement on demarcation
between the two countries in 1988.

<HEADLINE> Australian Opposition Criticizes New Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Australian opposition said
today they have already uncovered 25 broken promises in the
1996-97 budget document just released by the Howard government,
including the increased Medicare levy and reduced funding for
labor market programs.
</P>
<P>
The opposition expects to uncover many more broken promises as
it sifts through the budget papers in the next few days, Labor's
treasury spokesman Gareth Evens told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
"A promise is a promise, and Mr. Howard has been breaking them
on a massive scale. We have identified a couple of dozen
absolutely major ones. There are many other lesser ones lurking
away in those budget papers, and we'll be turning them up over the
days ahead," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opposition leader Kim Beazley, while talking to the
ABC-TV program, said he believed that there was a substantial
amount in the budget that could be changed in the Senate. "I
don't believe the budget would get through the Senate unscathed,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Areas that the opposition would be closely examining include
higher education charges, cuts in aged care and areas associated
with health.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Australian Greens Senator Bob Brown warned the
government "not to celebrate too soon," saying that the federal
budget faces an uneasy passage through the Senate. "I think they
are going to find a lot of trouble over this budget," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The ambitious program to
resettle more than 31,000 people from the Three Gorges area is
nearing its end with the approaching of the damming deadline.
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 people have moved into new homes to date, and
the remaining 10,000 are scheduled to be relocated by early next
year, according to a resettlement official with the Three Gorges
Project Construction Committee under the State Council.
</P>
<P>
So far, 1.2 billion yuan has been injected into the program's
infrastructure construction, making use of uncultivated farmland,
building roads and houses in rural areas, and investing in
communications, transportation, water and electricity supplies in
urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The resettlement endeavor is of critical importance to the
world's largest water-control project, which will affect nearly
one million people by 2009, the expected completion time for the
work, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The official added the resettlement program should be carried
out in a continuous and coordinated manner to ensure the smooth
construction of the project.
</P>
<P>
The state plans to set aside 40 billion yuan for the
resettlement program, with more than three billion yuan already
earmarked.
</P>
<P>
The state also granted a yearly credit of 500 million yuan to
relocated enterprises for technical renovations.
</P>
<P>
The resettlement program received wide support from coastal
provinces, which have agreed to participate in 1,800 direct aid
projects involving a contractual capital of 3.6 billion yuan. Of
the total, 620 projects have been implemented with invested funds
exceeding 800 million yuan.

HONG KONG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government will
continue to offer meaningful support services which are
particularly beneficial to small and medium enterprises (SMEs),
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said here today.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said that SMEs accounted for 98 percent of all businesses
in Hong Kong and they were the major beneficiaries of the
government support program.
</P>
<P>
SMEs are defined in Hong Kong as manufacturing enterprises
employing less than 100 people or service enterprises employing
less than 50 people. In 1995 some 300,000 establishments in Hong
Kong were categorized as SMEs.
</P>
<P>
"This shows quite clearly that the dynamism and agility of SMEs
has been the foundation of Hong Kong's economic success," Tsang
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that last month the Hong Kong government set up a Small
and Medium Enterprises Committee to help identify the issues that
affect the development of SMEs.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong has become a "commercial nerve center"
in the Asia Pacific Region and excelled as an active package and
integrator of commerce for the local, regional and global economy.
</P>
<P>
"With appropriate support, SMEs can ride the wave of
globalization trend and prosper," he said.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Offshore Oil Production Reaches 462,000 BPD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced here today its
offshore oil production has reached 462,000 barrels per day (bpd)
by drilling 21 new wells and repairing 190 wells.
</P>
<P>
Esmail Jalilian, offshore production manager of the National
Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), said Iran has spent about 810 million
U.S. dollars on reconstruction of wells and projects to increase
the production in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The offshore oil installations were seriously damaged during
the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq and its offshore oil
production dropped to 245,000 bpd.
</P>
<P>
The manager stated that 183 wells are currently pumping out
oil and gas in the Gulf offshore fields.
</P>
<P>
The oil production had been planned to amount to 500,000 bpd,
and the production is likely to exceed the target, Jalilian
added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that in the light of the increased
activities, the offshore oil production is to reach 1 million bpd
by the end of the Second Five-Year Development Plan in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The number of drilling rigs of the company will increase from
two to nine by 1999, he said, adding that last year, for the first
time in the country, two horizontal wells, instead of vertical
ones, were drilled in the Abouzar oil field.
</P>
<P>
Iran, the fourth largest oil producer in the world, pumps out
a total of 3.6 million barrels of crude oil a day and exports 2.5
million bpd.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Oil Ministry claims a sustainable oil output
capacity of 4.3 million bpd as of June 1996, nearly 200,000 bpd
more than claimed in the previous year and due mostly to
restoration of the offshore capacity.
</P>
<P>
Specialists noted that the United States will face serious
problems in enforcing its latest sanctions on Iran, and they
pointed out that even 100 percent effective sanctions would not
affect Iran's ability to produce at its existing OPEC quota of 3.6
million bpd for another decade.
</P>
<P>
A more immediate concern for Iran is its ability to keep
domestic consumption from rising too fast beyond its present 1.1
million bpd by continuing to reduce price subsidies and
substituting gas for crude.

"The success of the development of the atomic and hydrogen
bombs proved the key role played by theoretical physics in the
nation's defence sector. The development of the semi-conductor,
digital control and superconductor technologies will continue to
prove our role in economic development fields".
</P>
<P>
According to He, the prospect is bright for theoretical
physicists to play a role in such fields as the peaceful use of
nuclear technology and optic communications.
</P>
<P>
Su Zhaobing, director of the Theoretical Physics Research
Institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that
researchers in his institute will lay more stress on the research
of important technologies faced by the the nation's development of
agriculture, communications, transportation and energy.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 200 experts from more than 50 institutes and
universities are attending the five day seminar organized jointly
by the State Fund For Natural Sciences and the Theoretical Physics
Research Institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"The seminar was planned more than a year ago, long before the
central government's announcement of the suspension of nuclear
testing at the end of this July", an official from the State Fund
For Natural Sciences said.
</P>
<P>
Starting from 1993, the fund has allocated a certain amount of
money specially for the research of theoretical physics. According
to the official, the fund will continue to give financial
preference to theoretical physics in the future.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Defend Itself from US Adventurism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran today said it will defend
itself with all available possibilities against U.S. adventurism.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati made the remarks at
a press conference. "We are determined to defend ourselves" in
response to potential military attack by American forces stationed
in the Gulf, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are a strong country and we have shown our determination
during the eight-year war with Iraq. We are determined to defend
ourselves," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that no one would rule out the
possibility of potential military attack by the United States or
Israel against Iran.
</P>
<P>
The situation remains delicate and tense in the Gulf region
since U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry threatened to launch
military attack on Iran on grounds that the Iranian got involved
in the June 25 bombing of a U.S. military housing complex in Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
U.S. forces and Iranian troops are on a red alert against each
other for a possible military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister today once again denied any
Iranian involvement in terrorist bombings in any countries.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We condemn any kind of terrorism and believe that the
international community should act without discrimination in this
respect."
</P>
<P>
"We are victim of terrorism and we lost a president, many
ministers and deputies in this way. We categorically deny all
terrorism accusations by the United States," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iran's permanent representative to the United
Nations Kamal Kharrazi stressed that the Islamic Republic does not
seek tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
"But if the Americans were after adventurism, we would defend
(ourselves) considering all available possibilities," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He told local daily Iran that Iran-U.S. relations were
undergoing a challenging period.
</P>
<P>
He added that as long as the Americans did not accept the
reality of Islamic Iran, the struggle would continue.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility of easing the tension in Tehran-Washington
relations, he said this could only be realized when the Americans
accepted the Islamic Republic of Iran as a reality.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, the Americans, in considering the
interests of others as well as their own economic objectives in
the region, is hinting that Iran is a threat that has taken the
place of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official also expressed this view on American
public opinion towards the D'Amato law that stipulates penalties
against foreign companies investing in the Iranian oil and gas
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said Americans were normally non-political people,
adding that majority of entities and organizations that would be
adversely affected opposed the legislation.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that these groups believed that the political
motives that stemmed from U.S. support for Israel were behind the
sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The French ruling right-wing parties are on the verge of a
nerve breakdown over the crisis of 300 illegal immigrants who have
been occupying the Saint-Bernard Church in Paris for 52 days.
</P>
<P>
Gilles de Robien, president of right-wing Union Pour la
Democratie de France in the National Assembly, has agreed to
mediate between the government and immigrants. Meanwhile, the
French left-wing parties again urged President Jacques Chirac to
intervene to find a solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
-- One week before the holding of an international conference
against sexual exploitation of children in Sweden, the discovery
of a case of serial kidnapping of little girls in Charleroi,
Belgium, has increased the worry about the emergence of a
clandestine child sex market in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Thompson, author of an inquiry report entitled "Kids
for Hire" published by the Save the Children organization in
London, said that the fall of the Berlin Wall has resulted in the
development of a child sex market in former Eastern European
countries, Russia and the Baltic states.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Ten French left-wing parties sent an open letter to
President Jacques Chirac asking him to intervene between the
government and illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The letter, signed by Socialist Party first secretary Lionel
Jospin and Communist Party national secretary Robert Hue, said
that the 10 African immigrants who have been on hunger strike for
47 days are in a very grave situation. They called on Chirac to
"intervene with the government so that the latter resume
immediately the negotiations."
</P>
<P>
-- The inquiry into a kidnapping of two Belgian little girls by
Marc Doutroux could lead to the exposure of a criminal network of
child abuse in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Interpol in Prague confirmed that they
received a letter in January 1996, asking them to help find An
Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks, two little girls kidnapped by
Doutroux and his accomplice. But the Interpol chief in Prague
said that there is no evidence to prove that there exists a "Czech
connection."

the limit stipulated by the election law.
</P>
<P>
In the 15th South Korean National Assembly elections on April
11 this year, the ruling New Korea Party (NKP) headed by President
Kim Young-sam won 139 seats, 11 short of a simple majority in the

<HEADLINE> Israel's Blitz Affects Lebanon's Economy: Lebanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's economic activities
have suffered a stagnation as a result of an Israeli large-scale
blitz against Lebanon in April, which cost 300 million
U.S. dollars in losses, a major Lebanese bank said today.
</P>
<P>
"Due to these unprepossessing economic circumstances, some
foreign and local experts estimate that the growth rate of this
year will reach from three to four percent, or only half of that
in last year," said Fransabank, one of the five biggest banks in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It said in a report on Lebanon's economic situations in the
second quarter of 1996 that the retardation of the economic growth
also derived from the "poor performance of some affected sectors
and a slow influx of capitals accompanied by an increase of the
general debt."
</P>
<P>
This has restricted the private sector's capacity to obtain
investments, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military strikes from April 11 to 27 caused up to
300 million dollars of damages to the infrastructures, especially
to the sector of electricity, road networks, communications,
water, agriculture, industry, in addition to the damages of houses
and trade companies, the report stressed.
</P>
<P>
Bank Audeh, another major bank in Lebanon, has estimated the
damages at between 400 to 500 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state launched the air strikes and bombardments in
a bid to stop the Katyusha rocket attacks by Lebanese Hezbollah
guerrillas on northern Israel. More than 200 people, mostly
civilians, were killed in the 17-day clashes.
</P>
<P>
Fransabank noted that the Israeli aggressions came at a time
when Lebanon was managing to return its markets to the regional
competition center by attracting international banks and
financial institutions, and entering the world markets through
issuing treasure bonds all over the world.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to the impact on the Middle East peace
negotiations, the aggressions also greatly affected the
substantial investments which the tourist sector had expected to
gain in these days and which would have amounted to some 500
million dollars," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the general debt increased by 8.3 percent in the
second quarter of this year to reach 8.4 billion dollars,
including seven billion dollars of domestic debt and 1.4 billion
dollars of foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
Despite the negative effects of the aggressions, the Lebanese
pound remained stable thanks to the dual policy followed by the
authorities to stabilize the prices of currencies and to pursue a
relatively rigorous monetary policy.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Seeks Mubarak's Interference to End Israel's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
has asked Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to interfere to end
Israel's settlement policy, Egypt's leading newspaper Al-Ahram
reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a message sent to Mubarak earlier this week, Arafat warned
that there would be confrontation between the owners of the
Palestinian lands and the Jewish settlers if Israel carries out
its plan to expand the settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Arafat expressed confidence in the message that Mubarak would
spare no efforts in trying to put the Middle East peace process
back on the right track, the Arabic-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has recently lifted restrictions on
settlement building, a move which has triggered strong criticism
from the Arabs, especially the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Israeli government announced that it would allocate
five million U.S. dollars in new aid to settlers and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he planned to build more roads in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians regard the expansion of settlements as a
violation of the Palestinian-Israeli agreements.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country ever to make peace with Israel, has
acted as a mediator between the Arabs and the Jewish state in
peace negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Warlords of Liberia Pledge to Back New Abuja </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Two faction leaders in Liberia,
Charles Taylor and Alhaji Kromah, pledged Tuesday to abide by the
revised Abuja Peace Accord released last weekend by leaders of
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
At separate news conferences in Abuja, capital of Nigeria,
Taylor, leader of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL),
one of the factions that started the conflict in December 1989,
and Kromah, leader of the United Liberian Movement of Liberia
(ULIMO-K), expressed their support for the new peace agreement,
according to press reports today.
</P>
<P>
However, Kromah picked holes in the transition time, noting
that the January 31, 1997 date set for the disarmament of armed
fighters was too far as faction leaders who wish to breach the
accord could do so within the five months period.
</P>
<P>
Kromah also frowned on the January 31, 1997 date set for the
dissolution of the warring factions, saying that the date should
have been close to presidential elections scheduled for may 30
next year.
</P>
<P>
Saying he did not read the revised accord before signing it,
the ULIMO-K leader told reporters that the right sequence should
be from a ceasefire through disarmament, demobilisation,
dissolution of warring factions to elections.

<P>
TEHRAN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Union is going
to discuss with the United States about the D'Amato bill at
the U.N. General Assembly to be held late September, Greek Foreign
Minister Theodoros Pangalos said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here, the Greek minister said that the EU
tries to find a solution with the United States to the Iranian
issue.
</P>
<P>
On August 5, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the D'Amato
bill into a law to punish foreign companies investing more
than 40 million dollars in Iranian and Libyan oil and gas
sectors.
</P>
<P>
"It is a major issue. We will discuss it in the Dublin

Pangalos said EU and the United States will discuss the
issue in the sideline of the UN General Assembly in New York
on September 25.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the U.S. sanction, he said: "It does not
concern us. We don't think any country should try to decide
unilaterally the nature of trade in the world by imposing
its will on others."
</P>
<P>
"We have good trade and economic ties with both Iran and
the United States. We respect and use international trade rules
and regulations," he added.

improve them in new fields," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran is supplying half billion dollars worth

from Iran. Iran is actually a major supplier of oil to
Greece."
</P>
<P>
He assured his Iranian counterpart that the Greek government
supports the integration of Iran in the international community.

levels that were occurring, and that included foreign investment.

JOHANNESBURG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) today criticised international
investors for withholding investment in the region despite
democratisation in its member countries and liberalisation of
their economies.
</P>
<P>
SADC Deputy Finance and Investment Director Phakamani Hadebe
said in the Lesotho capital Maseru that international investors
continued to hold negative views of the political and economic
situation in southern Africa, reported the South African Press
Association.
</P>
<P>
Hadebe said foreign direct investment in the region remained
low despite measures taken by individual countries to democratise
their political systems and liberalise their economies.
</P>
<P>
He also said there was a need to improve the prevailing
economic situation by co-ordinating the different economic
policies of the 12 member countries.
</P>
<P>
Hadebe pointed out that many countries like Zambia and
Zimbabwe were strongly adjusting their economies through
structural adjustment programs.
</P>
<P>
This situation encouraged unfair trade as countries like
zambia and zimbabwe could not easily sell their products in South
Africa, he added.
</P>
<P>
South Africa was under strong criticism for imbalance trade
with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
A trade protocol, which formed the basic framework of a free

</P>
<P>

assist Dhaka in its exchanges with countries in the region.
</P>

<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Phnom Phen municipal
anti-drug police have arrested a Danish business man involved in
drug trafficking, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Peter Hensen, manager of the Danish MCCT transportation
company's Phnom Phen office, was arrested and brought to court
August 19 after the International Police Organization (INTERPOL)
seized 6.75 tons of heroin from MCCT freighter Maersk Douala on
August 11 at port Nouakchott, Mauritania, Heng Bou, Head of the
Municipal Anti-Drug Bureau, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Maersk Douala, loaded with green beans, set sail from the port
of Sihanoukville, Cambodia, on June 29, to Nouakchott.
</P>
<P>
The seizure of the heroin, with a street value of 500 million
U.S. dollars, was one of the world's biggest hauls in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
INTERPOL officials believed that the heroin came from "Golden
Triangle," the area where Myanmar, Thailand and Lao meet, and
where about 60 percent of the heroin sold on the American streets
originates.
</P>
<P>
They speculated that the heroin was wrapped in rubber bags and
mixed with the green beans before loading for shipment, the report
added.

GUANGZHOU, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province in south
China has decided to do something about its annoying acid rain
problem, which has caused more than two billion yuan in economic
losses to the agriculture, forestry, and materials sectors in the
last several years.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the discharge of waste gas increased
12.5 percent and that of industrial particles 9 percent in the
booming province, and acid rain frequency was between 50 and 80
percent in some cities.
</P>
<P>
In a new provincial government plan, the province will
formulate new local air pollution regulations, increase the use of
gas, renovate boilers, and get rid of high-consumption,
low-efficiency, polluting boilers, and promote the use of unleaded
gasoline.
</P>
<P>
Factory layouts will be rearranged, and thermal power plants
dispersed, with no power plants being built in the Pearl River
Delta.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, new thermal power plants with a capacity of
more than 200,000 kw each must have desulphurizing apparatus, and
emphasis will be placed on developing nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
Acid rain control areas will be built in the Pearl River Delta
for Guangzhou, Foshan, Dongguan, and Shenzhen.

LUSAKA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's cotton production this
year is expected to be double that of last year, reaching about
16,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The newly privatized Clark Cotton of Zambia in Eastern
Province alone has set aside eight billion Kwacha (about 6.5
million US Dollars) for the purchase of cotton.
</P>
<P>
Cotton farmers in the province have been assured that they
will get their money in time, unlike in the past when payments
were long delayed.
</P>
<P>
The good cotton harvest this year is attributed to sufficient
rains and the government incentive policy on cotton production.
</P>
<P>
The promised payments in time and this year's harvest will
encourage more farmers, most of them small-scale farmers, to grow
cotton in the next planting season. enditem

<HEADLINE> Physical Basis Found for Mental Retardation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The mechanism that causes the
most common form of inherited mental retardation, Fragile X
Syndrome, has been discovered by a team from Israel's Haifa
Technion's Rappaport Faculty of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
Today's Jerusalem Post quoted Michael Fry, professor of the
medical faculty's biochemistry, as saying that "we have identified
the probable physical basis to the clinical defect."
</P>
<P>
Fragile X Syndrome affects one in 1,500 males and one in 2,500
females, which marks it one of the most prevalent human genetic
diseases in the world.
</P>
<P>
Its symptoms include mental impairment, such as learning
disabilities, mental retardation, attention-deficit disorder and
hyperactivity. People suffering from the syndrome also experience
anxiety, unstable mood and autistic-like behavior.
</P>
<P>
Among the physical characteristics that go with the syndrome
are a long face, large ears, flat feet, hyperextensible joints
(especially fingers) and larger-than-normal testicles.
</P>
<P>
"We have always had a special interest in unusual conformations
of DNA, and while investigating this field, we came across
abnormal DNA structures forming within the gene that becomes
defective in patients afflicted with Fragile X Syndrome," said
Fry.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, researchers first identified the mutation that
"turns off" the FMR1 gene in people suffering from the syndrome,
preventing it from producing a vital protein.
</P>
<P>
While the location of the defect and its effects were known,
why it turned off the FMR1 gene remained a mystery.
</P>
<P>
The Technion team found that when a piece of DNA situated
within the gene mutates to become longer, it can take the shape
of an unusual four-stranded DNA instead of the normal two strands
or it may fold back into a hairpin structure instead of
remaining straight.
</P>
<P>
Fry said that when the piece of DNA expands, specific DNA
binding proteins are no longer able to stabilize its excessive
length and it thus folds back, thereby explaining the name
"fragile."

<HEADLINE> Beijing, Tianjin Seek Economic Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The future development of
Beijing and Tianjin, two heavily-populated cities in north China,
has become a popular topic for Chinese economists.
</P>
<P>
At present, the rapid economic growth in east and south China
is outshining that of the two leading cities. Economists and
government officials are worried about the relatively slow
economic growth of Beijing and Tianjin, and the growing gap in the
development between north and south China.
</P>
<P>
The economic status of Beijing and Tianjin is declining,
compared with development in Shanghai, China's largest industrial
center, and Guangdong Province, the showcase of China's economic
reforms, said Wang Zhangnong, an economist involved in regional
economic research.
</P>
<P>
The growth rates of the two cities were even slower than those
of Shandong and Liaodong peninsulas, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the State Planning Commission,
the two Cities' combined original value of fixed assets in 1985
accounted for 71.47 percent of that in Shanghai. The funds used by
Beijing and Tianjin were 1.39 times those of Shanghai. However,
the profits and taxes generated by the two cities were only 67.54
percent of Shanghai's.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the aggregate industrial output value of Beijing and
Tianjin was still less than that of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Peng Tianyu, an economist who studies coastal development,
described their growth as the "Beijing-Tianjin Phenomenon," saying
that the sluggish progress of the two cities has had a negative
impact on the overall economic development of north China.
</P>
<P>
Many economists and government leaders attributed the problems
produced by the "Beijing-Tianjin Phenomenon" to the similar
industrial structures of the two cities.
</P>
<P>
Identical industrial structures cause Beijing and Tianjin to
compete for energy and raw materials and scramble for a place in
the market, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
A US research fellow said that such unhealthy rivalry would
make both sides suffer, and proposed that Beijing and Tianjin set
up a new-type partnership.
</P>
<P>
To date, the two cities have reached an understanding about the
importance of cooperation, and have pledged to push ahead with
economic integration.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan said his city will readjust existing
industrial structures to coordinate its industrial development
with Tianjin's.
</P>
<P>
Gao Dezhan, municipal party secretary of Tianjin, said
establishing a unified social and economic plan has been included
in the Ninth Five-Year Plans of both Beijing and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also unify their operations in investment,
finance, technology, information and technical personnel markets.
</P>
<P>
Beijing and Tianjin are seeking favorable central government
policies that are conducive to bilateral economic integration.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Tightens Anti-Flood Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is tightening anti-flood
measures to deal with the rising river waters,
</P>
<P>
The water level of the Red River, which flows through Vietnam's
capital city, reached 12.3 m this morning, or 0 .8m above the
flood red alert grade 3, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
Water levels of other major northern rivers continue to swell,
threatening to flood the low-lying areas in the Red river delta.
</P>
<P>
The central government has asked local authorities to brace for
floods and take more measures to prevent Hanoi and other
localities from being flooded as another tropical storm is
developing off shore from northern and central Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Floods spawned by torrential rains have swept parts of the
northwestern border provinces of Lai Chau and Son La and the
northern province of Tuyen Quang. Initial reports show that some
1,060 houses were swept away or submerged and storehouses holding
403 tons of foodgrains flooded in Lai Chau.
</P>
<P>
Helicopters have been mobilized to conduct relief work,
distributing food to flood victims, while thousands of soldiers in
military zones 2, 3 and 4 have been called out to help people in
flood-stricken provinces to strengthen sea and river dykes, and to
conduct rescue work.
</P>
<P>
Evacuations of people from flooding areas are underway in most
of the low-lying areas in northern and central region.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Defuse Tension with Turkey: Greek FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos said here today that his country will defuse tension with
Turkey in favor of peace and tranquility.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos, who arrived here Tuesday night for an official visit,
told a press conference here that "we are willing to defuse
tension with Turkey in favor of peace and tranquility."
</P>
<P>
The relations between Turkey and Greece remain tense after
Turkish-Cypriot forces shot dead a Greek Cypriot in the recent
latest outbreak of violence along the U.N.-patrolled buffer zone
dividing Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos noted that Greece wants to settle the dispute with
Turkey in a peaceful way in accordance with international laws.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey is the only country, which intends to
violate the international laws and invade another country and keep
its troop there.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the only way for Turkey to get out of the
situation and to remain a great country is to think about its own
population and solve the problem with Greece and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos attacked Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan for
increasing military expenditure.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, Greece is the target of Turkish military
expenditure," the visiting Greek foreign minister said. "I have
read Mr. Erbakan's plan to eradicate poverty and economic hardship
from the Turkish society. How could that be achieved with the
increased armed expenditure?"
</P>
<P>
"With the military expenditure," he said, "there is also the
execution of orders that go with it."
</P>
<P>
The issue of tension between Greece and Turkey was brought up
at the table between the Greek foreign minister and his
Iranian counterpart Ali Akbar Velayati.
</P>
<P>
Velayati announced at the press conference that Iran is ready
to do some kind of mediation efforts between Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned about the tension between the two countries
and the tension is against stability and tranquility in the
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are very interested to do some kind of mediation between
the two countries in a bid to reduce the tension," he said.
</P>
<P>
As to the Iranian efforts to mediate between Greece and
Turkey, Pangalos said that his country welcome Iran's efforts to
reduce the tension between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos arrived here Tuesday night and was greeted at
Tehran's Mehrabad International Airport by Velayati. The two
foreign ministers held the first round of talks this
morning.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Footwear Exports Increase Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel's footwear production
has grown by 73 percent to 268 million U.S. dollars since 1990 and
exports have expanded by 143 percent to 27.3 million dollars,
according to figures provided by the Israel Export Institute.
</P>
<P>
Israel's footwear industry is small by world standard, but in
today's huge world markets increasingly dominated by Far East
producers, Israel has tried hard to win a share with unique
qualities.
</P>
<P>
People in more than 43 countries around the world relax
and play in Israeli footwear. The largest market is the United
States, to which Israel exported more than 12 million dollars of
footwear in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In the same period, about 38 percent of Israel's footwear
exports went to the European Union, principally Germany and
Denmark. Italy, Portugal and Spain, which are major shoe
producers, also imported considerable quantities of footwear from
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Non-traditional export destinations included China, Korea,
Singapore, Kazakhstan, New Zealand, Columbia, Congo and Kenya as
well as Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
About 4,000 workers in 40 Israeli factories produced some
10 million pairs of shoes and other footwear in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Two Flood Peaks Pass Xiaolangdi Without Causing Damages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, August 21 (Xinhua)-- China's largest water
conservation project on the Yellow River, and the second largest
water-control project after the Three Gorges, survived two major
flood peaks on the Yellow River recently.
</P>
<P>
The Xiaolangdi project, which is located 40 kilometers north of
Luoyang, a major city in central China's Henan province, is a
crucial one for China.
</P>
<P>
This year is critical for the project which is under
construction, and preventive measures were taken to protect
against floods, with the construction management bureau of
Xiaolangdi project forming emergency groups for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains hit the Xiaolangdi project area twice in July and
flood waters hit the highest water levels and volume of flow in
the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the protection of a cofferdam with a perimeter of
several kilometers, major structures withstood the onslaught of
the floods.
</P>
<P>
The project is now going smoothly, and 49 million cubic meters
of earth and stone have been moved, with 410,000 cubic meters of
concrete poured.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Trade with Iraq Will Not Suffer: Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has rejected arguments
that its trade and other relations with Iraq would suffer as a
result of the involvement by pro-Iraqi Baathist elements in
instigating the recent riots in the south.
</P>
<P>
Two cabinet ministers said here Sunday the arguments are untrue
that efforts to boost trade with Iraq following the adoption of
the U.N.-sponsored oil-for-food deal will be undermined,
English-language newspaper Jordan Times said today.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Trade and Industry Ali Abul Ragheb said he
believe that trade links with Iraq should not be affected
"seriously" as the accusations of the pro-Iraq Baathist involvement
in the riots were not directly leveled at the Iraqi regime.
</P>
<P>
"We have not accused the Iraqi government of fomenting the
riots," Ragheb said.
</P>
<P>
"It is true that we did accuse leftist parties with
pro-Iraqi ideological affiliations of instigating the unrest. But
that should not have a negative impact on trade links between
our two countries," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Transport Nasser Lawzi shared the view with Ragheb,
saying that Jordan separates the two issues are "separate and
should not be linked."
</P>
<P>
Local press reported that Iraq Monday denied charges of
involvement in the riots, saying the Jordanian government should
be held solely responsible for the unrest.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Revive Thai-Myanmar Railroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has made it a policy to
revive the 415 kilometer-long Thai-Myanmar railroad, known as "the
death railway," according to Smaur Shavavai, governor of the State
Railway of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok-Yangon railroad got the notorious nickname because
when it was being built during World War II, tens of thousands of
allied prisoners of war (POWs) and forced Asian laborers died from
Japanese troops' brutal torture, starvation, lack of medical care
and poor weather conditions, particularly in western Thailand's
mountainous region.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese troops never used the railroad to transport their
war materials to Myanmar (then Burma) as they had wished because
of repeated heavy bombings by allied aircraft. A few months after
the completion of the railroad, the Japanese surrendered.
</P>
<P>
Now only a 120-km strech of the railroad exists in western
Thailand, mostly used by foreign tourists who come to see the
"death railway" and visit cemeteries of western POWs.
</P>
<P>
Other sections of the rail link are unusable because of the
destruction made during the war, with one stretch submerged by a
reservoir built after the war.
</P>
<P>
The revival of the rail link was first proposed by Myanmar in
1992, and Thailand has agreed to the idea. But there have never
been any serious talks about a coordinated work plan.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Banks Continue to Cut Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Banks in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh
city have cut interest rates by 0.1 to 0.2 percent per month for
deposits over six months.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time of cutting interest rates since the
beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates for demand deposits were fixed at 0.4 percent a
month on August 17 at the Vietnam Industrial and Commercial Bank
and 0.45 per cent at the Vietnam Bank for foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
All banks have refused to accept one year deposits while the
four state-owned banks are still accepting nine month deposits.
</P>
<P>
According to official reports here, after recent cuts in
lending rates, banks have been unable to halt capital inflows.
</P>
<P>
Banks say they cannot lend to businesses because most firms
fail to meet lending criteria. They now grant only short-term
loans to business.
</P>
<P>
Despite the decrease in interest rates on Vietnamese dong,
interest rates for U.S. dollar deposits have been set at between 5
to 6 percent a year.

<HEADLINE> China, US to Sink Five Oil Wells in Bohai Bay in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The American Kerr-McGee
Petroleum Company has announced in Tianjin that it will sink five
oil wells in Bohai Bay in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Kerr-McGee signed contracts with China National Offshore Oil
Corporation (CNOOC) to exploit the 04/36, 05/36 blocks in the
Bohai Sea in 1994 and 1996, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Block 04/36 is in the west region of the Bohai Sea, covering
2,280 square kilometers. The seven-year project here includes
exploration, exploitation and production, and seismic surveying of
a 950-kilometer area.
</P>
<P>
Adjacent to 04/36 is block 05/36, in the middle of the Bohai,
which occupies a 1,680-square-kilometer area, with seismic
surveying to be done on an 850-kilometer portion.
</P>
<P>
Since work began on the 04/36 block, 410.57 kilometers of
seismic surveying have been completed, and two drilling wells have
been sunk.
</P>
<P>
Caofeidian well 2-1-1 obtained 96 cubic meters of oil and 7,700
cubic meters of gas from its first oil layer daily, and 900 and
50,000 cubic meters, respectively, from its second oil layer.
</P>
<P>
The exploitation of the Caofeidian high-yield oil well
attracted an additional six foreign oil companies to the Bohai,
and indicates a bright future for Sino-US joint efforts to exploit
oil resources.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia's Tourism Affected by Cholera Epidemic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A cholera epidemic in
northern Mongolia has affected the country's tourism with fewer
tourists coming lately, a local daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Government News quoted Delger Suren, manager of the Tourism
Limited Company, as saying that the U.S. State Department has
banned U.S. citizens from traveling in Mongolia until September 15
while some 100 Japanese have cancelled their trip altogether.
</P>
<P>
The Tourism Limited Company, one of the major traveling
agencies in Mongolia, has only 3,000 customers for months, and
finds it difficult to meet the 6,000 target for 1996 despite the
government's new policy adopted last September to boost tourism
during the 1995-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports said the cholera outbreak has not yet been
brought under control and, with increasing number of cases, is
feared to spread to other areas.
</P>
<P>
Since the first cholera patient was found on August 7 in the
remote Khoetol county in northern Selenge province bordering
Russia, the epidemic has advanced to the capital of Ulan Bator and
the neighboring areas.
</P>
<P>
By Monday, the cholera outbreak has killed eight people and
infected 106, with 2,967 being quarantined across the nation.
</P>
<P>
Cholera, an infectious disease caused by bacteria through
contaminated foods, attacks especially the sufferer's stomach and
bowels with severe diarrhea. It often leads to death if
untreated.

<HEADLINE> Economic Crimes Increase in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The rate of economic crimes in
Zimbabwe has increased almost two-fold in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
The officer commanding fraud squad, Assistant Commissioner
Osborne Mawere said on Tuesday that economic crimes, particularly
fraud, had risen from below 3,000 cases in 1993 to over 5,300
last year.
</P>
<P>
''The increase has been due to the fact that detection of such
crimes has improved and also that there is a lot of free movement
by companies in and out of the country,'' said Mawere.
</P>
<P>
Of last year's cases, 530 involved 45 million US dollars while
600 investigated in 1993 involved 8.4 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Both private and public sector companies as well as
individuals were involved in the crimes, Mawere said.
</P>
<P>
He said there was need to harmonise legislation to enable
police officers to speed up investigations. enditem

<HEADLINE> Most Students in Japan Favor 5-Day School Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 21 (Xinhua) --A recent nationwide survey shows
that most schoolchildren in Japan favor a five-day school week,
Kyodo News Service reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80 percent of elementary and junior high school students
responding to the survey said they approve of the five-day school
week which the Education Ministry plans to bring in by 2001.
</P>
<P>
However, among parents and guardians of the students, 33
percent of the respondents opposed the plan. Many said the
five-day school week would disrupt the rhythm of students' lives
and hamper their ability to enter society.
</P>
<P>
But most students say the shorter school week would give them
more rest time.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted in June by the National Congress of
Parents and Teachers Associations of Japan and covered students at
elementary and junior high schools and their parents and
guardians. About 7,000 people responded to the poll, the group
said.
</P>
<P>
At present, schools have a partial five-day week, closing on
the second and fourth Saturdays of every month, in addition to
Sundays.

<HEADLINE> More Railway Funds For East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- This economically-more-advantaged
part of China is turning to local government, enterprises, and
overseas investors to build its railways.
</P>
<P>
A total of 11 joint-funded railway lines, with a combined
length of 2,175 km, have been or are being built, or have been
approved, accounting for about 40 percent of the railways in east
China.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the costs of railway construction were always
covered by the government's railway departments.
</P>
<P>
In east China, however, transport could not meet the needs of
rapid economic growth, so local authorities took a different tack
in raising funds for railway building.
</P>
<P>
One example was Anhui Province's soliciting 2.7 billion yuan to
build a railway from Hefei, its capital city to Jiujiang, in
Jiangxi Province, in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Now the province plans to build a bridge over the Yangtze River
in Wuhu City. The project will take about five years to be
completed.

PARIS -- The U.N. International Children's Emergency Fund
(UNICEF) Tuesday said that the evil of sexual exploitation of
children is in full expansion around the world with one million
children becoming sex slaves each year.
</P>
<P>
A UNICEF report received here said that each day millions of
children are being abused, trapped and sold as commodities in a
worldwide market with estimated billions of U.S. dollars of deals.
</P>
<P>
The first International Conference Against Sexual Exploitation
of Children, to be held in Stockholm on August 27-31, will gather
doctors, social workers, legal experts, and representatives from
various institutions around the world to "give an answer of the
international community to this inhuman industry," said UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
BELGRADE -- Spokesman for the NATO-led peace Implementation
Force (IFOR) Sector Southwest Paul Brook said Tuesday that the
destruction of Serb ammunition scheduled for the day was suspended
for investigation purposes.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of planned 90 tons of ammunition found by the
IFOR from a Serb army dump in the village of Margetici was
destroyed Monday and explosions were heard five kilometers away,
the Tanjug news agency quoted Brook as telling a press conference
in Banja Luka, the largest Serb city in northwestern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR found 300 tons of arms and ammunition in Margetici
last week in eastern Bosnia which the IFOR regarded as
unauthorized and must be destroyed. The IFOR estimated that the
destruction of all these munitions could last a week.
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON -- The United States is still holding the pilot of a
Cuban hijacked plane for further investigations despite Havana's
strong demand for his immediate return, the U.S. State Department
confirmed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Department spokesman Glyn Davies told a press briefing here
that the pilot of the Cuban plane, which was hijacked and ditched
into the sea off Florida by three hijackers on August 16, was
being kept in the United States "to help in the investigation."
</P>
<P>
Davies disclosed that the Cuban pilot had asked to be sent back
to Cuba, while one of the three hijackers had been transferred to
U.S. territory for medical treatment and the other two were being
held aboard a U.S. Coast Guard vessel.

<P>
Moscow -- Russian military commander in Chechnya, General
Konstantin Pulikovsky, has ordered the civilians to leave Grozny
within 48 hours and vowed to sweep the Chechen rebels from the
war-torn city.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued monday night, Pulikovsky accused the
Chechen rebels in Grozny of making use of the peace negotiation to
consolidate their positions and launch sporadic attacks on Russian
troops, Russia's official news agency Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
Puliskovsky urged all civilians to leave Grozny through a
corridor opened by Russian soldiers ahead of the offensive.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he threatened that after the withdrawal of the
civilians, he will have the right to use all forces, including air
force and artillery, to strike.
</P>
<P>
On August 6, thousands of Chechen rebels, who have been seeking
independence from the Russian Federation, launched a surprise
attack on Grozny controlled by Russian troops, capturing most part
of the city and trapping russian soldiers in their checkpoints and
in the central government complex. Russia's federal troops
suffered heavy losses in the several days of fierce fighting.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Government Orders Civil Servants to End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government has
ordered its striking workers to return to work by Wednesday
morning or face dismissal.
</P>
<P>
Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister Florence
Chitauro said on Tuesday evening that the strike action was
illegal and those workers who defied the order would be
disciplined.
</P>
<P>
The country's civil service was on Tuesday plunged into a
crisis as health workers and the rest of the public servants
boycotted their duties to press the government to review salary
increments announced last month.
</P>
<P>
The civil servants are demanding a rise of at least 30
percent, but the state had already imposed an average increase of
six percent for each worker and 10 percent and 15 percent
increases in transport and housing allowances respectively.
</P>
<P>
''If they do not take heed to this call (to return to work),
the heads of ministries are required to take the necessary
disciplinary action according to the public service
regulations,'' said Chitauro.
</P>
<P>
She said workers who had noted errors on their pay slips
should either report to the ministry or approach the Public
Service Commission (PSC).
</P>
<P>
PSC Chairman Mariyawanda Nzuwah said the strike was
irresponsible. enditem

<HEADLINE> Fuji Heavy Industries to Boost Vehicle Marketing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., maker
of Subaru cars, will step up marketing operations and boost annual
sales to 360,000 units, Kyodo News Service quoted the company's
new president Takeshi Tanaka as saying.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Kyodo News, Tanaka said that the
company will emphasize marketing subcompact vehicles while
developing mini vehicles to satisfy the needs of consumers.
</P>
<P>
Tanaka, formerly an executive director of Nissan Motor, said a
new recreational vehicle model will be marketed next year as one
of mainstay subcompact cars along with the recently restyled
Legacy and Impressa, which will soon be remodeled.
</P>
<P>
Legacy produced in the United States is selling well there at a
monthly rate of about 8,000 -- well above the target -- but
exports to Europe were poor last year because of the strong yen,
with shipments totaling 50,000, or half the targeted volume of
100,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
The company plans to sell 75,000 vehicles in Europe this year,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine MNLF Chief: Not to Insist on Council Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- MORO National Liberation Front
(MNLF) Chief Nur Misuari indicated he will not insist that he be
appointed head of the Southern Philippines Council for Peace and
Development (SPCPD) if he is elected governor of the Autonomous
Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Executive Secretary Ruben Torres as saying
that Misuari, once elected governor of the ARMM, was prepared for
the possibility that he may not be named chairman of the SPCPD
should there be a legal impediment to it.
</P>
<P>
Torres, the president's emissary to the MNLF, said Misuari had
made it clear he will not insist on holding the dual positions if
it was illegal.
</P>
<P>
The executive secretary said there was nothing in the draft
peace agreement that states the MNLF chairman should head the
SPCPD.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement only says it is the MNLF (that would nominate
the SPCPD chairman). And if Misuari wants the position, he can get
it and that was given to him. If there is any legal impediment,
then he will not insist on it," Torres said.
</P>
<P>
The SPCPD is a consultative body to be established under the
final peace agreement to supervise peace and development in 14
provinces and nine cities in Mindanao and nearby areas. It is
explained as an extension of the presidential office and has no
ruling and police power over the local government.
</P>
<P>
The proposal that Misuari will take two positions, both chair
of the SPCPD and governor of the ARMM, raised opposition from the
Supreme Court and the Senate which claimed it is against the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
The senate met behind closed doors on Tuesday to define its
stand on the agreement, but deferred any final decision once again
on whether to support the SPCPD after the majority and the
minority disagreed on the revisions they wanted to be included in
the final draft agreement.

<HEADLINE> Mexico's Exports to Canada Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Mexican exports to Canada
grew 8.4 percent during the first half of this year compared with
the same period in 1995, totalling 2.19 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to "Statistics Canada", a government department,
motor vehicles occupy the biggest share of 55 percent followed by
machinery and equipment, 24 percent, farm and fishery products, 7
percent, and other industrial products, 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The increase, which makes Mexico the fourth biggest exporter to
Canada after the United States, Japan and Britain, resulted from
the implementation since January 1, 1994 of the North American
Free Trade Agreement, made up of Mexico, the United States and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
During the same period of time, Mexican imports from Canada
also increased 7.7 percent, but the trade still yielded a 1.72
billion dollars of surplus for Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Senator Denounces Helms-Burton Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. decision to revoke
under the Helms-Burton Law visas from Mexican businessmen who
invest in Cuba is "arbitrary and arrogant", a Mexican senator said
today.
</P>
<P>
Senator Maria de los Angeles Moreno, who is also vice-chairman
of the Senate High Commission, stressed that the U.S. Helms-Burton
Law violated all legal principles and international diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the Helms-Burton bill into
law to tighten economic and trade sanctions against Cuba after it
shot down two U.S. private planes allegedly flying over Cuban air
space.
</P>
<P>
The law allows Cuban exiles in the U.S. to sue foreign
companies that buy or sell their confiscated property in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Glyn Davis, spokesperson for the U.S. State Department, said on
Monday that the Domos Group was the first Mexican company to be
sanctioned under the Helms-Burton Law.
</P>
<P>
Davis said the company's executives and their spouses as well
as children will not be able to travel to the United States if
they do not halt their business dealings in that country within 45
days.
</P>
<P>
Maria de los Angeles Moreno called for a fight to prevent the
Helms-Burton Law from sanctioning countries that do trade with
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The senator said that the Mexican congress is working to
introduce an "antidote" bill at the next ordinary session to
counter the Helms-Burton Law.
</P>
<P>
She added that the antidote bill could be ready by the end of
this year.

<HEADLINE> Bank Loans 3.6 Billion US Dollars to State Commercial Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- China's large and medium state
commercial firms were 30-billion-yuan beneficiaries of the
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) in the first half
of this year, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
ICBC, a leading state-owned commercial bank, injected 30
billion yuan (3.6 billion US dollars) in loans to finance 1,519
key state commercial enterprises in 24 major cities in China
between January and June, a bank official said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The 24 cities include provincial capitals, the three
municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin, and economically
developed cities such as Dalian and Qingdao.
</P>
<P>
The ICBC loans accounted for 43 percent of all commercial loans
extended in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The official said these loans play an important role in
supporting the development of state firms, boosting commodity
market supply and curbing inflation.
</P>
<P>
Bankable commercial firms with sales exceeding 100 million yuan
(12 million US dollars) got loan priority.
</P>
<P>
A further 20.3 billion yuan (2.4 US dollars) went to 569 large,
profitable wholesale and retail enterprises in the 24 cities,
which accounted for 68 percent of total loans to the commercial
sector.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, the combined sales value of the 569 firms
hit 91 billion yuan (10.9 billion US dollars), up 8.3 percent from
the same period last year and higher than the average growth rate
of the country.
</P>
<P>
To ensure sufficient market supply and lower the inflation
rate, ICBC prioritized lending support to commercial firms engaged
in purchasing necessities such as grain, edible oil and food, and
commodities which have a well-developed market, sell well and
enable enterprises to recoup money quickly, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics indicate the bank granted 2.5 billion
yuan (301 million US dollars) to help enterprises in 11 cities
purchase 127,000 tons of grain, 8,161 tons of edible oil, 4,000
tons of eggs and other vegetables and fruit by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
The bank also extended 4.2 billion yuan (506 million US
dollars) to help commercial firms in 15 cities purchase household
appliances such as color TV sets and air conditioners, bicycles
and various garments, textbooks and medicines.
</P>
<P>
The official also said ICBC extended loans for commercial firms
to expand operations and upgrade services to increase market
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, commercial enterprises in the
24 cities received 750 million yuan (90.3 million US dollars) from
ICBC to use for outlets or chain stores.
</P>
<P>
ICBC also took measures to strengthen financial services to
promote the economic growth and reforms of the state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The bank offered various services to enterprises, such as
helping firms improve their accounting systems, adopting various
credits to relieve the capital shortage of enterprises and
supporting the transformation of poorly operated commercial
firms.

<HEADLINE> Polish Economy Expected to Grow at 6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth in Poland is
expected to reach 6 percent this year, with the inflation rate at
around 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
Previous budget forecasts put the figures at 5 percent in Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) growth and 17 percent in inflation,
Miroslaw Pietrewicz, Polish deputy prime minister and chief of the
Central Planning Office, pointed out in an economic communique.
</P>
<P>
Pietrewicz said that industrial production increased by 8.5
percent in the first half of this year. The inflation rate was
11.3 percent during the first seven months.
</P>
<P>
The unemployed were 2.466 million last July, or 14.1 percent of
the active population, which was the lowest since August, 1992, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister attributed the optimistic economic
situation to a 24 percent increase in investment in the country's
enterprises and consumption growth.
</P>
<P>
People's purchasing power went up by 4.9 percent with pay
rising by 26 percent, Pietrewicz said.
</P>
<P>
However, the trade deficit reached 3.1 billion U.S. dollars, as
the imports growth rate was much higher than the exports growth of
6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Portugal to Help Jobless College Graduates Find Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Portuguese government has
decided to allocate more than seven million U.S. dollars to help
some unemployed college graduates find jobs, Prime Minister
Antonio Guterres said here today.
</P>
<P>
About 1,240 college graduates who have been out of work for
more than one year will benefit from the program which is aimed at
encouraging the young people to contribute to the country's
economic development, said Guterres.
</P>
<P>
The program will take effect as from November 1.
</P>
<P>
Guterres admitted that unemployment is still a serious problem
for Portugal, as the unemployment rate of the second quarter of
this year fell only 0.2 percent over that of the first quarter --
7.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
It has been very hard for college graduates to find jobs in
recent years due to a consistently sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
Portugual has about 3,400 college graduates every year.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Asks U.S. to Hand Over Cuban Hijackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban government today
demanded the United States immediately hand over all the Cubans
who hijacked airplanes to the U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban official "Granma" newspaper quoted the Cuban Foreign
Ministry as saying today that those Cubans who were involved in
recent hijackings of two Cuban planes are "air pirates" and
"terrorists".
</P>
<P>
The hijackers include the three who hijacked a small plane
owned by Cuba's National Air Services Company on August 16 and
forced the pilot with knives and a revolver to fly to Florida,
said the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Cuba also requested that another hijacker, who hijacked a Cuban
airplane flying the Santiago-Guantanamo route at gunpoint on July
7, be repatriated.
</P>
<P>
So far, Cuba has not received any satisfactory reply from the
U.S. authorities about these cases.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban ministry said that the U.S. government is responsible
for any incidents that may arise for the air and sea traffic in
the region and for a weak and unconsistent attitude.
</P>
<P>
"Should its passive attitude and zero volition to return these
wrong-doers persist, the U.S. government will be encouraging
criminal acts and putting into doubt, once again, its willingness
to comply seriously with the migratory accords signed by both
countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
In September 1994 and May 1995, the United States and Cuba
signed migratory agreements that called for the repatriation of
Cubans who attempt to cross illegally to the United States, and
prohibited the use of force to commandeer aircraft or seagoing
vessels with the aim of emigrating.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban ministry pointed out that the U.S. noncompliance of
the accords encourages air piracy.
</P>
<P>
Cuba demanded once again that the United States comply with its
international obligations and the provisions of the migratory
accords and that it adopt the steps necessary to put an end to the
hijacking of airplanes and turn over those responsible for the
acts so that they can be tried in Cuban courts.

<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Filipino Secretary of Foreign
Affairs Domingo Siazon has proposed fundamental and structural
reform of the United Nations, in an interview with the Austrian
newspaper, Die Presse.
</P>
<P>
Siazon, former Director-General of the United Nations
Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), stressed that the UN
Secretary-General should exercise more leadership in reform. It
must be sped up: "We have talked about it for years," he said.
</P>
<P>
He made three proposals for reform plan.--
</P>
<P>
-- The permanent members of the UN Security Council could enjoy
the right of veto on political and security issues, but not on
development and economic problems of the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
-- The position of the UN Assembly must be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
-- The double-track system of the UN must be cancelled and its
organizations merged or made more centralised.
</P>
<P>
When these reforms were done, members must pay membership dues
punctually on January 1, Saizon said.
</P>
<P>
The main problem facing the Organization was that some members
of it did not pay their dues, or did not pay them on time.

<P>
BANGKOK, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Faced with an occupancy slump
that has endured for three years, rock-bottom room rates are
becoming the rule for Bangkok hotels.

First-class hotels in the central business district are

rates of 1,500 to 2,000 baht (60 to 80 US dollars)--about half
what they would charge in better times.

<HEADLINE> Big Natural Gas Field Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The largest natural gas field in
the Junggar Basin has been found in the past few days, the
Petroleum Administration in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region announced.
</P>
<P>
The field, located in Shanqian'aoxian (hollow area in front of
mountain) in Hutubi county, was found on August 6. The controlled
gas-containing acreage of the field is 23 square kilometers, with
a deposit of natural gas of 20 billion tons.
</P>
<P>
Prospecting of the natural gas field was launched in August,
1994, according to an expert. The natural gas airflow gushed from
the test well, numbered "HU-2", during drilling. The logging shows
that the well can produce 800,000 cubic meters of natural gas and
7.4 cubic meters of condensate per day.
</P>
<P>
According to the expert, the area is likely to become a
large-scale natural gas field, as the effective prospecting
acreage of the HU-2 area covers 250 square meters.
</P>
<P>
The regional petroleum administration is now organizing more
exploration work to build on the current achievements.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Sign Anti-drug Pact with S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will soon sign a treaty
with South Africa to allow the exchange of information related to
narcotics trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, when signed, will be an effective measure for
Thailand to curb drug smuggling by Nigerians, who have topped the
list of international smugglers caught over the past few years in
Thailand, according to secretary-general of the Office of the
Narcotics Control Board of Thailand Preecha Jamparat.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is a popular source of narcotics for Nigerian drug
operators, as they can easily smuggle heroin to South Africa and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
There are several Bangkok-Johannesburg flights every week
operated by nine airlines.
</P>
<P>
A South African drug control agency source said Nigerians
control more than 50 percent of the drug business in South Africa
and that Johannesburg and Cape Town have become centers of
narcotics trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The treaty on information exchange would help Thai police keep
track of Nigerians who have been blacklisted by Thai police for
drug trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Ruling Party for Ratifying Treaty with India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's main ruling party has
decided its stance over a border river development treaty between
Nepal and India by ordering its lawmakers to ratify the treaty in
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of the ruling Nepali Congress (NC) party
Tuesday directed MPs from the party to vote for the ratification
of the Mahakali treaty during the ongoing parliament session.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, signed earlier this year on the prime minister
level in New Delhi, provides principles for cost and benefit
sharing between the two countries on future hydro projects on the
Mahakali river, which lies on Nepal's western border with India.
</P>
<P>
However, voices against the treaty have been heard recently
from various social groups in Nepal while the main opposition
parties are busy studying documents about the treaty before taking
a final decision over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, leaders of the opposition had vowed not to let the
treaty be ratified in the current parliament session.
</P>
<P>
Although the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN-UML) so far has not
finalize its position over the treaty, sources from the main
opposition party said it would not opt to ratify it.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party has accused the opposition of withdrawing its
support to the treaty, which was initialed in Kathmandu last
January after a national consensus was reached among major
political parties in the country.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML's support would be crucial for the ratification of
the Mahakali treaty as the party holds 88 seats in the 205-seat
lower house.
</P>
<P>
The country' three ruling parties control a total of 105 seats
which are not sufficient to ratify the treaty since it needs at
least a two-thirds majority in the parliament to ratify a treaty.
</P>
<P>
The Mahakali treaty is considered a brainchild of Foreign
Minister Prakash Lohani and Water Resources Minister Pashupati
Rana, both are from the second ruling National Democratic Party
(RPP).
</P>
<P>
Political observers here speculate that the coalition
government led by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba of the NC
party might have to resign on moral grounds if the Mahakali treaty
is not ratified.

ISLAMABAD, August (Xinhua) -- The Salang Highway, the artery
connecting Kabul and Afghan northern areas, will be reopened next
Tuesday after three years' closure, said a report reaching here

<P>
The report quoted Afghan Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar as

</P>
<P>
The agreement said that the Salang Highway will be "completely
opened" to all public traffic from August 27, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar said that the agreement was reached at talks between
the two sides in Mazar-i-Sharif, Dostum's headquarters in the

At that time, the Afghan government also announced that Dostum
had pledged to reopen the Salang Highway, but no date for this was
given.

<P>
Analysts said that the reopening of the Salang Highway was a
major triumph by Hekmatyar and would greatly improve the

<HEADLINE> Singapore Non-Oil Domestic Exports Rise in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's non-oil domestic
exports rebounded by an unexpected high 6.4 percent year-on-year
in July, after a 6.1 percent decline in June, the latest Trade
Development Board (TDB) figures showed.
</P>
<P>
According to the TDB figures, Singapore's total trade rose by
4.3 percent on a monthly basis, while non-oil domestic exports
rose by 6.4 percent and re-exports increased by six percent.
</P>
<P>
On a three-month moving average basis, total trade in July at
current prices increased by 3.1 percent. The moderation of total
trade growth resulted mainly from slower growth in both domestic
exports and re-exports, the TDB said.
</P>
<P>
The Straits Times reported today that Minister for Trade and
Industry Yeo Cheow Tong, who is now in Malaysia on a three-day
official visit, said that these figures should be interpreted with
caution, like the June trade figures.
</P>
<P>
Economists here remained cautious and maintained that non-oil
domestic export growth, a key indicator of the health of the
manufacturing industry, would continue to be slow in the second
half of the year and would be in the single-digit range at best.
</P>
<P>
Minister Yeo recently warned that the current economic slowdown
caused by a sluggish electronics industry could last up to nine
months. The second quarter's economic growth slowed to seven
percent, down from a strong 11 percent expansion in the first
quarter.

<HEADLINE> Collection of Modern Chinese Literature Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A 30-volume collection of
modern Chinese literary works has just been published here.
</P>
<P>
Featuring fiction, drama, opera, poetry, works of translation,
literary theory, and folk and popular literature, the book covers
an 80-year period, from 1840 to 1919.
</P>
<P>
The works feature an anti-imperialistic, anti-feudalistic
spirit during a period of transition from classical Chinese
literature to the new literature movement of the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
Such a collection was a difficult job in the past because
Chinese publishing houses and academic institutions seldom were
able to publish literary works produced after 1840 or before 1919.
</P>
<P>
To provide readers with a true history of the time, a group of
scholars and writers has made a great effort at compiling the 20
million-character collection.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Improve Products Quality for Export Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam should improve the quality
of products to expand exports and avoid a growing trade imbalance,
the latest issue of the weekly "Vietnam Economic Times" magazine
quoted a senior official from the Ministry of Trade as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official also stressed that the emphasis of exports should
be shifted away from half-processed goods or raw materials, and
more investment be attracted to upgrade the technology and
equipment of processing lines.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts have predicted that Vietnam's trade deficit is
likely to reach at least 3 billion U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months of this year, the country's export
turnover was 3.5 billion dollars, but its imports cost 5 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The deficit climbed to 2.3 billion dollars in 1995 from 113
million in 1991 and 1.7 billion in 1994, the weekly said.
</P>
<P>
The trade official said that Vietnam had to expand imports for
the development of its economy.
</P>
<P>
But the country will be able to reverse the trade imbalance in
10 or 20 years by properly exploiting its rich resources under
land and sea.

<HEADLINE> China's Main Tropical Forest Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The world's tropical forests are
decreasing at the rate of 15 million hectares annually, but a
survey conducted by the International Agricultural Research and
Consulting Institute, China's main tropical forest areas have
increased by 30 percent compared with 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The study showed that nearly half of the world's tropical
forests are threatened by population increases, poor management
and bad policies.
</P>
<P>
Hainan has more than 600,000 hectares of tropical forests,
accounting for half of the nation's total. The figure is 200,000
hectares more than 10 years ago. In 1991 a state forest park was
established, and in 1994, a code was issued by the provincial
government to completely prohibit the cutting of tropical forests.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that the tropical forests in Hainan have many
rare plant and animal species, many of which are on the brink of
extinction.
</P>
<P>
Tropical forests are important for maintaining regional and
global ecology.
</P>
<P>
Protection of tropical forests in China began in 1970, when the
Ministry of Forestry established a topical primitive forest
preserve and set up a tropical ecological research center.
</P>
<P>
According to an official from the ministry, in recent years
China has invested more than 130 million yuan in the protection of
the tropical forests in Hainan. The local protection work also has
won some financial support from a number of countries and
organizations.

<HEADLINE> Protecting Women's Rights in Tianjin Court of Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A special court in Hebei
District, Tianjin City, was established in May 1995 by the Hebei
District Court and the Hebei District Women's Federation to handle
infringement of women's rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
A total of 100 cases have been adjudicated by the collegiate
court that was founded in response to the increase in family
violence as shown by a survey conducted by the federation recently.
</P>
<P>
In some families, women have become the victim of violence
because their husbands get angry easily or are especially
chauvinistic.
</P>
<P>
Some husbands who fall in love with another woman attempt to
use violence to get their wives to divorce, while others turn to
violence because their wives have lost their jobs or been laid off.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that the rights and interests of the victims
are not adequately protected even when the court grants a divorce
decree. So, the court and the District Women's Federation decided
to set up this "collegiate bench" to protect women's rights and
interests more effectively.
</P>
<P>
A member of the Women's Federation who is director of a
neighbourhood committee serves as a member of the jury in cases of
infringement of women's rights and interests to make sure that a
fair decision is reached.
</P>
<P>
One woman, Yu Yuanyuan, who could no longer bear the beating
that her husband, a heavy drinker, gave her, filed for
divorce. Subsequently, her husband threatened to kill her and even
disrupted the court proceedings. The collegiate bench found for
the woman, however, and granted divorce, to Yu's satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
Another woman who suffered from nephritis asked the court for a
divorce because her husband refused to give her money for medical
treatments.
</P>
<P>
When the local court could not reach a decision, the bench
heard the case and reached a decision that the woman owned the
house and that the husband had to pay her one hundred yuan a month
for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
After the divorce, the woman came into the Women's Federation
office in a wheelchair, and with tears in her eyes said, "It is
the Federation and the collegiate bench that have given me the
hope I need to live."

<HEADLINE> Contestants Ready for Indonesia's Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's three political
groupings contesting next year's general election vowed to make
the event a success, and promised not to launch maneuvers which
may harm each other, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the United Development Party (PPP) Ismail Hasan
Metareum, Chief of the Ruling Golkar Harmoko and Soerjadi, the
government-recognized chief of the Indonesian Democratic Party
(PDI) signed here Tuesday a five-page statement attesting to the
purpose, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The groupings agreed to "maintain the national leadership in
the hands of the new order administration," the statement said.
The Indonesian government called the current period under the
leadership of President Soeharto as the new order period.
</P>
<P>
Golkar, who has won landslide victories in the past six
elections, vowed to retain its "single majority" status in the
forthcoming election scheduled for June 1997. The PPP and PDI said
they also wanted to win.
</P>
<P>
The three parties will contest 425 of the 500 seats in the
House of Representatives and the remaining 75 seats will be
allocated to non-voting representatives of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The 500 representatives will also constitute half of the 1,000
strong people's consultative assembly. This will convene in 1998
to elect a president and draw up the broad guidelines of state
policies. The other 500 assembly members are representatives from
the regions and other social groups.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Golkar won 282 seats, PPP 62 and PDI 56.
</P>
<P>
The General Elections Institution, which organizes the
election, has scheduled the event into several stages. The first
stage, the registration of all voters, was conducted last May.
</P>
<P>
The second step is the drawing up of lists of candidates for
the People's Consultative Assembly, the House of Representatives,
Legislative Councils in the provinces and regencies from July 1996
to March 1997.
</P>
<P>
The third is a month of election campaigning for the three
contestants, from April 29 until May 23, 1997. The fourth stage is
the voting, and counting of ballots.
</P>
<P>
Harmoko, who is also information minister, denied the
suggestion that the statement was prepared because the contestants
feared that the conflicts embroiling the PDI might render the
election legally defective, the Jakarta Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The PDI has two leaders, one is Soerjadi, the other is Megawati
Soekarnoputri, who was ousted in a dissenters' congress in Madan,
north Sumatra, in June. The government has recognized Soerjadi but
Megawati still has strong support from some branches.
</P>
<P>
In their statement, the three groupings said the 1997 general
election should be conducted in accordance with the laws in order
to elect independent people's representatives from across
Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Indian Court Adjourns Hearing on Rao's Plea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- India's Supreme Court Tuesday
adjourned till Wednesday further arguments on former prime
minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's plea against his summoning by a
Delhi local court in a cheating case, the statesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Rao was charged of helping a controversial godman in cheating a
non-resident Indian businessman of 100,000 U.S. dollars in 1983 by
falsely promising the businessman, Lakhubhai Pathak, newsprint and
paper pulp contracts.
</P>
<P>
During the arguments on Tuesday, Rao's counsel K. Parasaran
said the proceedings initiated against the former prime minister
were unjust, unfair and unreasonable as he did not have the
benefit of any safeguard like an investigation or a pre-trial
opportunity of cross-examining the witness.
</P>
<P>
He said "no one should be put to the harassment of a criminal
trial unless there were good and substantial reasons."
</P>
<P>
A magistrate of the Delhi local court had on July 9, 1996,
issued summons to Rao as a co-accused in the Lakhubhai Pathak
cheating case and he was directed to appear on July 24 before the
magistrate. Later the Delhi High Court upheld the issuance of
summons to Rao and he was directed to appear on August 2.
</P>
<P>
On appeal before the Supreme Court, the former prime minister
was exempted from personal appearance before the magistrate till
the disposal of his petition against the order of the Delhi High
Court.
</P>
<P>
The apex court, by an order of August 12, also stayed
proceedings against Rao before the magistrate.
</P>
<P>
The court is expected to make a final decision today on whether
the former prime minister should face the cheating charge or not.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Expand Petrochemical Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran has announced a major
policy shift in its oil industry, which is trying to expand
the export of petrochemical products rather than just crude oil,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh said in a report,
carried in today's Persian daily Iran, that the shift would be one
of the three major measures to further promote the oil industry in
Iran, the second largest oil exporter and the fourth largest oil
producer in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said the measures are the development of petrochemical
industry, export of natural gas, and transfer of technical
know-how and catering of oil services.
</P>
<P>
Aqazadeh said that Iran was pursuing a policy that
petrochemical products would fetch the country added value in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
"One of the most significant measure to promote the oil
industry is the strategic long term planning for the
petrochemical industry," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that with the export of petrochemical products,
Iran will have a foreign currency revenue of at least six billion
U.S. dollars annually during a 10-year period.
</P>
<P>
Aqazadeh said that the production capacity of petrochemical
products, which used to be 11 million tons per annum, would be
boosted up to the level of 35 million tons in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Oil industry development, the second measure, would be based on
the export of gas which would fetch the country between two and
three billion dollars in hard currency annually, said the oil
minister.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the export of gas will be initiated at the
turn of 21 century.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Iran and Turkey signed a 20 billion dollars
gas deal. Under the 22-year accord, Iran will sell 4-10 billion
cubic meters of gas to Turkey beginning from 1999.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the transfer of know-how technology and
catering of special oil services was another important measure.
</P>
<P>
He added that top Iranian oil experts are well-versed in their
field and their specialty extends to the repair of oil wells,
construction of oil refinery and oil exploration.
</P>
<P>
The oil minister said that Iranian oil experts are currently
in Senegal providing services of oil exploration, and in Libya,
they are repairing oil wells. Aqazadeh said that negotiations are
underway for the construction of oil refineries and exploration of
oil in Bangladesh, the Philippines and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
He expected an accord on the construction of an oil refinery in
Pakistan to be finalized soon. He added that the capacity of the
oil refinery would be 120,000 barrels per day, worth more than one
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The oil minister said that Iran is studying the proposal of 11
tenders received from various oil cartels, which was gazetted
in October, 1995, on major oil and gas projects.
</P>
<P>
Aqazadeh said that Iran, which was once a major importer
of oil by-products, will be transformed into one of the major
exporters, once the Bandar Abbas refinery starts operating next
year. He added that the export revenue from this source will exceed
1.5 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Gansu Using Foreign Technology for Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu
Province, which suffers from adverse geographical conditions, has
developed its agricultural sector by using advanced imported
technology.
</P>
<P>
It has brought in 200 types of technology from Japan, the
United States, Canada, Germany, and France to give a boost to its
farming, and forestry, livestock and fishery sectors.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Gansu invited 25 foreign experts and sent 149 local
agronomists abroad.
</P>
<P>
Sixty percent of the imported technology has been applied in
the province, leading to an increase in per-unit yields of grain
and other crops.
</P>
<P>
Dry-land paddy technology from Japan has helped increase
per-unit yields by 30 to 50 percent. A Sino-Canadian joint
experimental program for high-yield wheat production has been a
success and has been made use of in the province.

NEW DELHI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of India's
employees will observe a countrywide strike on September 9 to
press home their demands, mainly for recruitment and expansion of
the bank's activities, a trade union leader said today.
</P>
<P>
Announcing this in Calcutta Tuesday, Samir Ghosh, the general
secretary of the All India Reserve Bank Employees Association,
said the bank's management has decided on "shrinkage and
decimation of this premier institution."
</P>
<P>
The management, he said, has virtually ceased recruitment in
base cadres for the last six or seven years which has resulted in
the accumulated vacancy of nearly 2,000 in clerical cadres alone,
in 20 offices of the bank.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of staff members has resulted in piling up of
arrears, the leader said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Export-Import Bank of China
(Eximbank) will provide the Industrial Development Bank Ltd. of
Kenya with an export buyer's credit of 10 million US dollars,
according to an agreement signed by the two banks on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The credit will be used to support Kenyan imports of China-made
capital goods, including machinery, electronic products and
complete sets of equipment, according to the deal, which was the
second the Chinese bank arranged with a foreign bank in the past
five months.
</P>
<P>
In late March, Eximbank closed a similar-style deal with a
Peruvian bank, providing 70 million US dollars in export buyer's
credit.
</P>
<P>
An Eximbank official said that the new agreement marks further
economic and financial cooperation between China and African
countries.
</P>
<P>
Eximbank was established in 1994 to finance China's exports of
machinery, electronic products, complete sets of equipment and
other capital goods.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Bomb Suspect Passes a Lie Detector Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Atlanta Olympic bomb suspect
Richard Jewell passed a lie detector test in which he denied any
involvement in the July 27 explosion, a former Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) polygraph expert said today.
</P>
<P>
Dick Rackleff, who served as FBI's Polygrapher in Atlanta from
1979 to 1990, told reporters in Atlanta that 15 hours of polygraph
tests with Jewell on August 4 and 15 were "unquestionable and
conclusive from the standpoint that he was not involved in any way
with the explosive device."
</P>
<P>
Jewell's attorneys paid for the test in an effort to show
security guard Jewell was innocent in the pipe bombing that left
two people dead and more than 100 injured at downtown Atlanta's
Centennial Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
Although Jewell offered to undergo FBI testing shortly after
the bombing, his lawers refused to let him be tested by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
Jewell was one of the first to have found the bomb in a
knapsack. He was hailed as a hero for spotting the knapsack and
trying to get people out of the area before it exploded. But soon
he became one of the suspects who were under the FBI's
investigation.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's inflation rate decreased
from 22.5 percent in June to 22 percent last month, according to
figures from the Central Statistical Office.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the down surge momentum in inflation was likely
to continue in August given that the inflationary pressures
inherent in the economy were very minimal during this time of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce Economist Edmore Tobaiwa
said the all items index which measures the price changes in a
basket of essential consumer goods, had declined during the
period under reviews.
</P>
<P>
''This indicates the downward spiral in the annualised
inflation rate will continue, although at a marginal rate, before
sizzling out by the end of the third quarter,'' he said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Residents Purchasing Publicly-Owned Houses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 21 (Xinhua)-- In Shanghai, 609,000 families
have purchased a total of 32 million square meters of
government-owned apartments, or half of the city's total.
</P>
<P>
Over 13 million residents live in Shanghai, where for a long
time, housing was built by the government and rented at low prices.
</P>
<P>
The city began to sell housing to its residents in 1994 when
they could purchase housing with depreciation and discounts in
according to the amount of time they have worked.
</P>
<P>
This has been going on for two years now, and has helped solve
some of the difficulties of limited living space in Shanghai. June
statistics showed that conditions had improved for 20,000 most
difficult families with per capita living space under four square
meters. By now 670,000 families have moved into new housing.
</P>
<P>
Average per capita living space was eight square meters in 1995,
as compared with 6.6 square meters in 1990. The proportion of
income spent on housing in 1995 was twice the 3.3 percent of five
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
According to local banks, nearly 40,000 Shanghai residents have
applied for mortgage loans for the purpose of purchasing houses.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Municipal Housing Committee said that some
residents are still reluctant to buy such houses because of the
high interest rates of mortgage loans and poor services of housing
projects.

<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Honduras, Guatemala and El
Salvador are to renew their preparatory meetings aimed at joining
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) via Mexico.
</P>
<P>
A tripartite negotiating committee agreed to hold its first
meeting on September 25 to 26 in order to lay the judicial
foundation for the CA-3 Group Agreement signed by the three
Central American countries, according to Julio Gonzalez, a
Honduran undersecretary of internal trade.
</P>
<P>
But Gonzalez admitted that his country will enter the free
trade agreement on an unequal footing in that Honduras can only be
a buyer and not an exporter due to its low productivity.
</P>
<P>
The Central American trade balance is at a disadvantage as
against Mexico right now.
</P>
<P>
Mexico, the United States and Canada signed the NAFTA agreement
on January 1, 1994 and the accord covers a market of 370 million
consumers in North America.

<HEADLINE> Hainan's Tourism Market Reorganized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Forty-seven travel agencies and
six guides had their licenses or working certificates revoked for
going against professional ethics during a recent market shake-up
in Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
The drive last March shows the provincial government's
determination to make the south China island province a more
attractive and pleasant destination for tourists.
</P>
<P>
The number of travelers coming to Hainan has grown at an annual
rate of 6.8 percent in the past five years, and some 2.06 million
tourists visited the island in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
With the increasing travel industry, problems of poor service
and market irregularities have occurred, prompting the provincial
government to reorganize the business for healthier development in
future.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-six other agencies and more than 100 guides and drivers
were fined or had their business rating lowered for failing to
provide standard services or for going against regulations.
</P>
<P>
Shops selling tourist souvenirs and tourist sites were also
among those being examined, and seven shops were closed or fined
for demanding high prices for shoddy products and paying guides
high sales commissions.
</P>
<P>
Hotels and restaurants with insufficient facilities or which
were polluting were also closed down.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, a complaint hot-line operated by the tourism
authorities handled nearly 100 complaints, with 96 percent of them
settled and tourists who lodged the complaints being paid a total
of 33,000 yuan in compensation.
</P>
<P>
To better administer the industry, the provincial tourism
authorities published the Hainan Tourism Administration
Regulations last August, and later issued detailed rules and
regulations on travel services and tourist buses.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have also sponsored training courses for
tourist guides in an effort to improve their professional
qualities, and 80 percent of the travel services on the island
have paid service quality guarantee fees to the authorities.

The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- The federal government has halved the underlying deficit to

election pledges.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Road conditions have improved a
great deal in Fuzhou, capital of east China's Fujian Province,
since the city began a road construction project three years ago.
</P>
<P>
The project focuses on increasing funds for road construction,
from government investment solely to a number of other sources,
including bank loans, the public, and overseas.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the amount of funds for road construction over the
past three years was 2.4 times that of the total figure before the
project was initiated.
</P>
<P>
By the first half of this year, Fuzhou had invested some 1.89
billion yuan in road construction, according to Tang Senjin,
director of the city's transportation department.
</P>
<P>
Fuzhou plans to invest 550 million yuan in road construction
this year to complete 72.3 km of roadbed and 148.5 km of roads.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the year, renovation of the three national
highways crossing the city will have been completed, and the city
will have more than 2,000 km of highways.
</P>
<P>
Fuzhou is set to focus on the Fuzhou-Quanzhou expressway and
roads connecting villages in the next road construction move.

Jiangsu is an economic giant in east China, but suffers from
serious pollution problems. It has 10 percent of the country's
major pollutants, with only one percent of the country's total
area.
</P>
<P>
To improve environmental quality, the province has launched a
campaign to clean up its polluted rivers and lakes.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that during the 1996-2000 period, the province will
allocate 20 million yuan each year for an anti-pollution fund for
major environmental protection projects.
</P>
<P>
Cities and counties across the province have also been asked to
set up special funds to fight pollution.

MANILA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
-- The Philippine Senate met behind doors on Tuesday to define

<HEADLINE> Cosco Agrees Cargo Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The China Ocean Shipping Group
(Cosco) yesterday signed an exchange agreement with Japan's
Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha (K Line), in a bid to improve the efficiency
of its service, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Yangming Marine Transport Corporation of Taiwan will also
participate in the three-way cooperation and has signed a similar
agreement with K Line.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements, Cosco will get cargo space on K Line and
Yangming vessels, helping to extend its service to Kaohsiung and
Keelung ports in Taiwan plus ports in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, K Line and Yangming will be given space on Cosco
vessels and extend their services to Shanghai, Xingang port in
Tianjin and Qingdao.
</P>
<P>
All these places are important trading ports connecting Asian
countries, expecially China and Japan with northwest Europe.
</P>
<P>
As the global shipping capacity is larger than the available
shipping volume, ocean carriers worldwide are facing up to fierce
competition.
</P>
<P>
The co-operation arrangement, the first of its kind between
China's shipping flag-bearer and overseas counterparts, will
shorten the shipping time of participating carriers and reduce
their costs.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the agreement will involve 25 vessels owned by the
three shipping firms, and the slot-exchange arrangements will
start from September 20, according to Cosco sources.

<HEADLINE> US Takes Risk While Sanctioning Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The unilateral sanctions by the
United States against Cuba, Iran and Libya recently would also
pose risks for U.S. foreign policy, according to an article
carried in The Journal of Commerce today.
</P>
<P>
The United States adopted the Helms-Burton Act targeted at Cuba
and the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act which would impose sanctions
on foreign firms that invest in these countries.
</P>
<P>
Under Helms-Burton, foreign firms using Cuban properties
confiscated from Americans could be sued in U.S. courts, and their
corporate officers barred from entering the United States.
</P>
<P>
Under the Iran-Libya measure, foreign firms that make
significant investments in either country's energy industry would
be hit with at least two of six possible sanctions, including bans
on exporting to the United States, receiving loans from U.S.
financial institutions or contracting with the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
But the article said that rather than follow the U.S. lead,
Iran and Libya's large European trading partners have maintained
near-normal commercial relations with both countries.
</P>
<P>
Other countries claim that the U.S. is trying to impose its
policies on them, threatening their sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Next month, the European Union is likely to authorize
countersuits by European firms sued under Helms-Burton. Canada is
expected to adopt a similar measure later this year, according to
the paper.
</P>
<P>
The EU may also impose new visa restriction on U.S. executives.
Canada and Mexico plan to initiate North American Free Trade
Agreement dispute-settlement proceedings on Helms-Burton, and the
EU may seek rulings from the World Trade Organization on both
laws. The EU is also reviewing other measures to counter the
Iran-Libya sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the article said, the U.S. acts would pose several
risks for U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
It said other governments are likely to conclude that cutting
economic ties with Iran and Libya would mean capitulation to U.S.
pressure, which they will not want to set.
</P>
<P>
Retaliation could also hurt U.S. workers and firms, it said.
U.S. investments worldwide could be in jeopardy if other countries
take up similar measures.
</P>
<P>
The article also pointed out that imposing sanctions could
undermine longstanding U.S. leadership on international trade
issues. That would harm U.S. economic interest, too.
</P>
<P>
The way to prevent harm to U.S. foreign policy interests
could be in the hands of the president who has the authority to
waive sanctions under certain circumstances, according to the
paper. More talks with other governments would make it easier
for the president to avoid trade conflict, it said.

<HEADLINE> US Refuses to Return Cuban Pilot of Hijacked Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States is still
holding the pilot of a Cuban hijacked plane for further
investigations despite Havana's strong demand for his immediate
return, the U.S. State Department confirmed today.
</P>
<P>
Department spokesman Glyn Davies told a press briefing here
that the pilot of the Cuban plane, which was hijacked and ditched
into the sea off Florida by three hijackers on August 16, was
being kept in the United States "to help in the investigation."
</P>
<P>
Davies disclosed that the Cuban pilot had asked to be sent back
to Cuba, while one of the three hijackers had been transferred to
U.S. territory for medical treatment and the other two were being
held aboard a U.S. Coast Guard vessel.
</P>
<P>
"The pilot was brought to the United States to help in the
investigation of the case," the spokesman said. "He is in the
custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service."
</P>
<P>
However, the Cuban Foreign Ministry has reportedly issued a
statement, denouncing the United States for "its traditional
cover-up and weak attitude in the face of hijackings of this
kind."
</P>
<P>
Cuban officials said that they were demanding "the immediate
return of all the air pirates involved in recent hijackings of two
Cuban planes."
</P>
<P>
On July 7, a Cubana de Aviacion plane flying a domestic route
in eastern Cuba was diverted to the U.S. naval base at
Guantanamo by an armed passenger.
</P>
<P>
The hijacker, a Cuban military officer who fired a weapon
aboard the plane during the incident, was still being detained and
interrogated by the U.S. authorities at Guantanamo base, Davies
disclosed.

NEW YORK, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street were
mixed but changed little today after the Federal Reserve left the
interest rate unchanged, in line with the broad expectations of
the market.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average added 21.82 to 5,721.26.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly a 7-to-6
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with its volume increasing
to 334.95 million shares, up from 293.95 million in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index slipped 0.03 to 356.61, and the

<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 6.24 to 1,124.67, and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 1.69 to 559.29.
</P>
<P>
Most broader measures were nearly unchanged after the central
bank left its key short-term interest rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Since the decision was widely anticipated, there was no
significant market reaction immediately afterwards. The Nasdaq
market was again the weak sector, weighed down by technology
shares.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Suggests New Political Mechanism for Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- UN. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali said today that in order to solve the
conflict in Burundi for good, the world community should help find
a new power-sharing political mechanism for the country.
</P>
<P>
"Political mechanism have to to be found to share power between
the majority and the minority in a way that will allay the fears
of both sides and gradually build up the confidence that will
enable them to live in harmony," said the secretary-general in a
report to the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
He noted in the report that the 1994 Convention on Governance
was such a mechanism but unfortunately it did not work and that in
the present circumstances the two sides would not be able to
identify and establish an effective political mechanism by
themselves.
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately outsiders are ready to help," he said. "In recent
months they have united in support of the noble and tireless work
of President Nyerere and they look to him now to redouble his
efforts to get all the Burundian political parties and factions to
enter into a dialogue which will permit the negotiations of a new
political mechanism to succeed the Convention on Governance."
</P>
<P>
He suggested that given the acuteness of the current crisis,
it is desirable that all tendencies should be represented in
such talks, "difficult though some will find it to sit down with
others after the horrors which have afflicted Burundi during the
last few years."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the coup d'etat of 25 July, the secretary-general
reiterated that the forceful overthrow of the legal government
will not solve the problems of Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"It will increase violence and add to the suffering of the
Burundian people," he said. "It thus makes a political dialogue
all the more imperative."

Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
Assistance Group in Grozny to negotiate a permanent and peaceful
end to the fighting.

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Demands Preemptive Strikes on Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- House of Representatives
speaker Newt Gingrich today delivered a threatening speech, saying
the United States would take preemptive strikes on terrorists and
so-called terrorist-sponsored nations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a business leaders' meeting, Gingrich said the
United States should go ahead and say it has a "reason to believe"
that some suspected nations "are not behaving correctly" and they
should convince the United States in the next 24 hours that "we're
wrong or we will take you out."
</P>
<P>
"If we would be very aggressive in saying to Libya, Syria, Iran
and Sudan that we will not tolerate your supporting terrorists, we
could have a big effect on the resources available to terrorists
around the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said attacks on terrorist cells could be carried out
covertly by the Central Intelligence Agency or overtly by
military means in the way Israel took in 1981 when it bombed a
French-built nuclear plant in Iraq with American jets, killing a
French technician.
</P>
<P>
He also demanded that the U.S. government apply "whatever
levels of pressure we have" to prevent funds from flowing into
terrorist hands.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton on August 5 signed into law a bill to
penalize companies that invest 40 million U.S. dollars or more in
energy sectors in Iran or Libya, which immediately provoked
protests from U.S. allies, especially European nations.
</P>
<P>
A Republican-drafted anti-terrorism bill was approved this
month in the House of Representatives, but stalled in the
Senate. It was said that the bill lacked most of the provisions
sought by Clinton following the crash of TWA Flight 800 off New
York last month and the explosion at the Centennial Olympic Park
in Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> US to Begin Destroy Chemical Weapons </HEADLINE>

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military will begin
destroy some of its chemical weapons at the Tooele disposal plant
in the Utah desert Thursday despite strong protests by local
environmentalists, the Pentagon announced today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. stockpile of chemical weapons consists of some 30,000
tons of weapons agent, including about 3.3 million individual
items. They are located at eight sites in the United States and
on Johnston Atoll in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>

The Tooele plant, located about 50 miles southwest of Salt lake
City, has the largest of the eight stockpiles and is the first
incinerator in the United States to begin the destroying process.
Chemical experts said that the burning chemical weapons in Utah
would take seven years.
</P>
<P>
The cost of destroying the chemical weapons has been put at
12.4 billion U.S. dollars, Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement to destroy the U.S. stockpile of nerve and
blister agents came just a week after U.S. District Judge Tena
Campbell in Salt Lake City refused a bid by local
environmentalists to stop the incinerator.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials insisted that they would eliminate the
chemical weapons "in a very safe and secure way."

<HEADLINE> US Fed Leaves Short-term Interest Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
(Fed) left short-term interest rates unchanged today, apparently
satisfied that the economy is slowing down on its own and
inflation is not a threat.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Fed spokesman Joseph R. Coyne announced that the Federal
Open Market Committee (FOMC), Fed's policy-maker, had adjourned
its meeting and said there would be no further announcement. It
meant that U.S. Fed policy-makers had decided to keep the
short-term rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts had expected recently that the FOMC would hold
rates steady to wait further data before making any moves,
although they had believed sometimes ago that the Fed would raise
the rates.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.2 percent in
the second quarter of this year following a rate of 2 percent
during January to March.
</P>
<P>
But a Fed survey of regional business conditions prepared in
late July found indications that the economy was moderating with
little sign of inflation, leading analysts to believe that the Fed
would not raise the rate this month.
</P>
<P>
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan also told Congress last month that
he and his colleagues expected the economy to moderate during the
second half of the year from its sizzling pace last spring.
</P>
<P>
But in his congressional testimony, Greenspan warned that
"recent favorable inflation developments... may be drawing to a
close," causing the Fed to become "especially vigilant."
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. analysts believe price pressures will force the U.S.
Fed to raise interest rates later this year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed last raised the federal funds rate, the rate banks
charge each other for overnight loans, to 6 percent from 5.5
percent in February 1995. Then it pushed the rate down to 5.25
percent in three moves between July 1995 and January 1996 as the
U.S. economy showed signs of stalling. The rate has been kept
unchanged in the past seven months.
