<HEADLINE> Judge orders religious community to comply in custody case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KINGSTON, N.Y. (AP) - Court proceedings Friday revealed that
members of the Bruderhof religious community sought in a custody
battle by three former members may be in England and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Bruderhofs focus on Christ's spirit and teachings in the Sermon
on the Mount. They believe in community living, don't own private
property and share everything. Money is held commonly, decisions
are made jointly and individual members work in the community's
shops, making playthings and equipment for handicapped children.
</P>
<P>
   The women and children are believed to be part of the Bruderhof
community in Ulster County.
</P>
<P>
   The fathers - Joseph Idiong, Ebong Ebong and Basil Ebong -
charge that they have been prevented from seeing their children
since being evicted from the religious group three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Ebong returned to the Bruderhof community in
Farmington, Pa., where he was living, following a trip to Nigeria,
only to find that he could not get back into the community because
he had questioned the Bruderhof leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Ebong said he saw his children once after that.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is frightening,'' said Mike Mauceri, a lawyer representing
Ebong. ''They (Bruderhof) have created a totalitarian community
with consenting adults and children.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Bruderhof Community in Woodcrest said that
in view of the ''concern and safety of the children involved, we
don't believe it is appropriate to comment at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   During a rigorous two-hour testimony, Joe Keiderling, vice
president of the Bruderhof Communities in New York Inc., said two
of the women were believed to be in Bruderhof communities in
Robertsbridge and Dover counties, England. The third one is said to
be in a Bruderhof community in Farmington, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Mary Work, who is hearing the petitions, ordered a report
of the current case to be sent by overnight mail to the two women
in England. She did not order an appearance for the Pennsylvania
woman.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are making it simply impossible to find the children,''
said Steve Franzman, a court-appointed legal guardian. The lawyers
for the three men charged that the women and children had been
whisked away to multiple locations right after members of the
Bruderhof got wind of the case.
</P>
<P>
   There are Bruderhof communities in Catskill in Greene County,
Walden in Orange County, Rifton and Ulster Park in Ulster County,
Farmington, Pa., England and Australia.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Go to Martha's Vineyard  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- Now that the Republican convention is
over, ''it's our turn,'' President Clinton said Friday, as he
tossed a few scraps of red political meat to a hungry crowd of
partisan Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton kept the tone light and the humor dry in his first
political remarks since George W. Bush was formally nominated as
the GOP presidential standard-bearer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just finished the Republican convention and now it's our
turn,'' Clinton remarked to eager applause at a posh fund-raising
party to benefit his wife's campaign for Senate in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats gather next weekend in Los Angeles for their
convention, which will nominate Vice President Al Gore. Clinton
addresses the convention on Aug. 14, along with his wife, Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Clinton and his family have returned to
Martha's Vineyard, their regular summer haunt, for a vacation that
is as much about fund raising as fun.
</P>
<P>
   The president helped bring in an estimated $172,000 for Mrs.
Clinton's campaign Friday, at the nearby Nantucket home of
perennial Democratic hosts Smith and Elizabeth Bagley.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's one thing that we apparently agree on -- that the
country is in good shape,'' Clinton said of the rival political
parties. ''And I appreciate that act of uncommon generosity on
their part,'' Clinton added. ''We disagree on how it happened and
what to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd laughed, egging him on, but Clinton declined to
reprise the sarcastic put-downs of Bush that were a sidelight to
the convention this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have to say anything bad about our opponents as
people, and if I have anything to say about it, the Democrats won't
do that,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president expects to raise about $1.3 million at four
fund-raising speeches between Friday and Sunday. All but one of the
events benefit his wife's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very hard for me to say anything that is not ...
sappy,'' Clinton said before delivering a testimonial to Mrs.
Clinton's record of public service. ''I'm always afraid I'll be
over the top or ineffective.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, it's off to Hyannis Port and the Kennedy
family compound. Clinton expects to help Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen
Kennedy Townsend raise $800,000 for her expected gubernatorial
race.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Clinton headlines two events on Martha's Vineyard
that benefit his wife's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In between, he will probably play a few rounds of golf. Good
weather was predicted for the weekend, after two weeks of
intermittent rain.
</P>
<P>
   The first family has visited this quaint island off the coast of
Massachusetts each summer of Clinton's presidency except 1996, when
they vacationed in Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   This year is the family's shortest stay yet -- just a long
weekend. Clinton, his wife and daughter Chelsea, accompanied by dog
Buddy, lost about two hours of even that brief vacation when they
left the White House later than expected on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton brought his briefcase, and an aide was seen stuffing a
paper bag marked ''beach towels'' into the presidential helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people were lined up at the sand-strewn airport at
Martha's Vineyard to greet the Clintons, including regular
presidential golfing buddy Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the family stayed on the island about a week before
decamping for fund raising and another short vacation in upstate
New York. While there, they bought a $1.7 million house in
Chappaqua, north of New York City.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Make Day Trip To Colombia  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is drawing the wrath of
Colombia's largest guerrilla movement by planning a visit to that
country Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will meet with President Andres Pastrana in the port
city of Cartagena to discuss ways of curbing U.S.-bound drug flows.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Congress approved $1.3 billion in assistance to
Colombia, mostly in training and equipment for military units
assigned to counter-narcotics activities.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia is the world's largest coca producer. The government
also must contend with two determined guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Antonio Lozada, a spokesman for the FARC guerrilla
movement, said Friday that Clinton's stopover was ''clear
evidence'' that the United States was using the guise of the war on
drugs to violate Colombia's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't believe this is a visit by a president who is a
friend of the Colombian public, but exactly the opposite,'' said
Lozada, whose rebel army is believed to be about 20,000 strong.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a visit by a head of state that ... comes ready to
grossly intervene in the internal affairs of our country.'' He
spoke in a telephone interview from southern Colombia's
guerrilla-controlled demilitarized zone.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in a statement that it is ''profoundly in the
interest of the United States'' for Colombia to succeed in its
efforts to seek peace, fight illicit drugs, build its economy and
protect democracy.
</P>
<P>
   He will be joined on the trip by House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., and Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del. Undersecretary of State
Thomas Pickering will travel to Colombia next week to help lay the
groundwork for the trip and also to speak to a conference of
business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   It will be Clinton's first trip to Colombia, and he will go down
and back on the same day. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said an overnight stay was ruled out for security
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The visit mirrors a visit former President Bush made in February
1990 when, highlighting his administration's anti-drug campaign,
took a day trip to Cartagena. Bush was joined there by Colombia's
president and leaders from other Andean countries.

<HEADLINE> Noted Caltech math professor killed in car crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASADENA (AP) - Thomas Wolff, a pioneering mathematics professor
at the California Institute of Technology whose work aided
explanation of the physical world, was killed in a car crash,
Caltech officials announced Friday. He was 46.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff died July 31 in Kern County, according to a news release
issued by the university.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff made many contributions to a number of mathematical
fields, including number theory. He also worked on several problems
involving quantum mechanics, a field that explains the function of
matter at the subatomic level.
</P>
<P>
   The New York native earned his bachelor's degree from Harvard in
1975 where he often played poker with fellow student Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   He received his doctorate in mathematics from the University of
California, Berkeley. Afterward he worked as an acting assistant
professor at the University of Washington and a postdoctoral fellow
at the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   He joined Caltech as an assistant professor in 1982 and was
named a full professor in 1986. He left soon after, however, to
work at New York University and then Berkeley before returning to
Caltech in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He received a number of awards from the mathematics community
over the years and was a member of the editorial boards of three
publications.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Helen Hunt and Hank Azaria have split.
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar- and Emmy-winning actress separated from her husband
several months ago, said publicist Steven Huvane.
</P>
<P>
   The two married on July 17, 1999. They had been together since
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt won 1998's best actress Oscar for ''As Good As It Gets''
and multiple Emmys for her comedic lead character in ''Mad About
You.'' Azaria's movie credits include ''Godzilla'' and ''The
Birdcage.''
</P>
<P>
   A message left for Huvane after business hours Friday was not
returned. He told ''Entertainment Tonight'' the separation was
mutual.
</P>
<P>
   ''They remain good friends,'' Azaria's publicist, Stan
Rosenfield, told the syndicated television show.
</P>
<P>
   Azaria also had a recurring role on ''Mad About You'' as Nate
the dog walker and is well known to fans of the animated TV series
''The Simpsons'' as the voice of a number of characters.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt is slated to star opposite Tom Hanks in the upcoming movie
''Castaway'' and opposite Mel Gibson in ''What Women Want.''

<HEADLINE> Alaska Airlines Testing Jets  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. MARTINEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- One day after announcing that a tool used to
measure stresses on the tail sections of some of its jets may have
given erroneous readings, Alaska Airlines said no problems were
found in the 17 MD-80s it grounded for inspection.
</P>
<P>
   The tool in question, made by the airline itself, measures
stresses on jackscrews in the jets' horizontal stabilizers. The
same part has been implicated in the Jan. 31 crash of Alaska Flight
261 off the California coast that killed all 88 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines officials said that stress measurements on the
17 aircraft inspected Friday were correct and did not show any
additional wear and tear. The planes were being returned to
service, the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating
that accident, confirmed Friday that it will look into Alaska's use
of its measurement tool as an alternative to one made by the
MD-80's manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas, now part of The Boeing Co.
The jackscrew on Flight 261 was found to have been stripped.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the company said 18 jets would be grounded for the
inspections, but airline spokesman Jack Evans said one of those was
found to have been tested with the McDonnell Douglas tool and not
in need of an additional check.
</P>
<P>
   Airline officials told the Federal Aviation Administration on
Thursday that its tool used to check jackscrews may have produced
incorrect readings. The jackscrew assembly consists of a nut that
rides up and down a screw as it turns to raise and lower the
stabilizer, a wing-like part of the tail used to tilt the nose of
the plane in flight.
</P>
<P>
   There were no indications of problems, but other airlines also
have been told to check MD-80 and DC-9 planes, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   The scramble resulted in cancellation of 18 Alaska Airlines
flights late Thursday. An additional 29 flights were canceled
Friday, Evans said, far below the 72 flights the company had
estimated.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're having a better day than we thought we would,'' Evans
said. ''Even for a Friday before a busy summer weekend, this is
pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines, the dominant carrier on north-south routes
along the West Coast, normally operates about 500 flights a day
with a fleet of 90 planes, including 34 MD-80s.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing took over production of the MD-80, which is based on the
DC-9 airframe, after absorbing McDonnell Douglas in a $16.3 billion
merger in 1997. Out of about 2,000 MD-80-series and DC-9 jetliners
worldwide, more than 1,100 are flown by U.S. carriers.
</P>
<P>
   After the Alaska Flight 261 crash, the FAA inspected the
airline's maintenance facilities and found more than 150 instances
of improper or missing paperwork. The probe found that maintenance
had been done correctly, however.
</P>
<P>
   A criminal investigation into the crash has focused on a
mechanic's decision not to replace a jackscrew assembly. The
jackscrew had been tested repeatedly and found to be nearly worn
out but was returned to service after a second crew retested it a
few days later. Two Alaska Airlines mechanics from that second crew
insisted in an interview with The Seattle Times that they were not
at fault.

<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Police detained Saturday 25 people for
holding a protest denouncing Turkey's new prison system, which
critics believe will leave hundreds of inmates isolated and
vulnerable to abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new system, thousands of inmates will be moved away
from large wards that house up to 100 people and put in small cells
housing one or three prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The government says the new cell system will put an end to
riots, hostage-takings and hunger strikes which frequently plague
Turkish prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cells are death -- we will not enter them,'' the protesters
shouted on Istanbul's fashionable Istiklal Street, the Anatolia
news agency reported. Police detained the 25 after they ignored
calls to disperse.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners belonging to Kurdish and Islamic groups often run
their own wards like indoctrination centers.
</P>

   Human rights groups say torture is common in Turkish prisons.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Veto Marriage Tax Cut  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton announced his veto
plans Saturday for the Republican-sponsored tax cut for married
couples, including those now penalized by higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address, Clinton ticked off economic
successes of his seven-year administration and said the course he
charted ''is the right path for America.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't retreat from this opportunity of a lifetime to keep
our economy strong and move our country forward,'' Clinton said.
''That's why I'm vetoing legislation that represents the first
installment of a fiscally reckless tax strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's veto of the $292 billion, 10-year tax cut is no
surprise, since he promised to kill the measure even before the
Senate gave final congressional approval to the legislation on July
21.
</P>
<P>
   ''On Capitol Hill, the Republican majority has passed a series
of expensive tax breaks to drain nearly a trillion dollars from the
projected surplus,'' in federal budget coffers, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The veto, which comes between the two political parties'
national nominating conventions, is tricky for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans believe Clinton's veto gives them a winning
political issue by demonstrating that with a GOP-controlled
Congress, a Democratic president is the only obstacle to sweeping
tax reductions.
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign rally Friday in Akron, Ohio, GOP presidential
nominee George W. Bush ridiculed Clinton's decision to veto the
bill. ''What kind of a tax code is it that discourages marriage?''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton kept his own tone light at a fund-raising dinner Friday
night on the Massachusetts resort island of Nantucket. As he has
done frequently of late, he got a laugh when he compared GOP tax
cuts to a sweepstakes letter that says ''you may have won $10
million.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone who went out the next day and spent the $10 million
ought to vote for them,'' Clinton said. ''If you didn't, you better
stick with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Gore call the GOP tax cut plan irresponsible
because, they claim, it would spend all the projected budget
surplus over the coming decade. Some of that money may not turn up,
Clinton says.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans got some help from Democrats in passing the marriage
tax cut package. The marriage penalty is the popular name for the
extra taxes 25 million couples must pay because of a structural
quirk in the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill would also cut taxes for about as many additional
couples who now enjoy a marriage ''bonus,'' paying less than they
would if they were single. This largely affects families in which
one spouse earns most of the family income.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the bill's tax reductions come from enlarging the bottom
15 percent tax bracket and increasing the standard tax deduction
for couples filing jointly.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argued that the measure would benefit millions of
middle-class Americans while using just a small portion of the
projected $2.2 trillion, 10-year federal surplus. The figure
excludes even larger projected Social Security surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed both the Senate and House last month by less
than the two-thirds majorities needed to override a presidential
veto.

<HEADLINE> Soldiers Sentenced in Ivory Coast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- A military tribunal has sentenced
seven soldiers to 10-year prison terms for participating in a July
mutiny in this West African country, newspapers reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The accused are among 45 soldiers charged with disobeying
orders, revolt and looting during the mutiny in the central town of
Bouake.
</P>
<P>
   One soldier was acquitted at the hearing Friday in the
commercial capital, Abidjan, newspapers reported. The rest are
scheduled to appear before the tribunal at the Gallieni military
base over the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Charges of threatening state security are being investigated
against six other soldiers, all colonels.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a police commissioner was sentenced Friday to six
months in prison for disobeying orders during the mutiny, news
reports said.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers in Bouake and other towns rebelled July 4-5 over perks
and bonuses they said were promised for supporting the Christmas
Eve coup that brought junta leader Gen. Robert Guei to power in
Ivory Coast, a nation that had previously been considered a bastion
of stability in volatile West Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In a compromise settlement, the junta promised to pay the
soldiers $1,600 each to help them buy houses. The protesters had
demanded six times that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Although the December coup was initially popular among many
Ivorians, who had grown tired of corruption and ethnic favoritism
under ousted President Henri Konan Bedie, many have since become
disillusioned with the new regime.
</P>
<P>
   Guei has promised elections to restore civilian rule for Sept.
17. He has not said, however, whether he will run for president.

   But Sean Kelly, who helped plant a bomb in a fish shop in the
mostly Protestant Shankill Road in October 1993, told the weekly
North Belfast News that he, too, was a victim of Northern Ireland's
''troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly told the newspaper that he had intended to kill leaders of
the Protestant paramilitary group the Ulster Defense Association,
whom he believed were meeting above the shop.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that innocent people died is something I will have to
live with for the rest of my life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to accept the families of those people who were killed
in the explosion will never forgive me. But it honestly was an
accident and if I could do anything to change what happened,
believe me, I would.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's accomplice, Thomas Begley, was killed when the bomb they
were planting exploded prematurely. Kelly lost the sight in one eye
and the power in his left arm.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know there are those who will say I have no right to talk
about victims, but everyone has suffered, including those of us who
have been to jail,'' he told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ''I lost my close friend Thomas Begley that day. Like the other
people who died in the bomb, he was a mother's son too.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are all victims, we have all suffered, but I just hope and
pray that it is now at an end.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, who says he now supports Northern Ireland's peace
process, was freed from the Maze prison last month as part of an
early-release program linked to the province's 1998 peace
agreement.

<HEADLINE> Burgeoning flock: At the shore, churches overrun with summer visitors </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILDWOOD, N.J. (AP) - Bless them, Father, for they are hot. And
sunburned. And dripping with perspiration, standing four deep in
the corners and elbow to elbow up in the bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   The air conditioner in the gymnasium of Wildwood Catholic High
School is cranking noisily, but it is no match for the humidity or
the body heat. More than 1,000 people - in sandals, tank tops,
cutoff jeans - have crammed themselves in here for the 11 a.m.
Sunday Mass.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Rev. Jaromir Michalak performs the sign of the
cross to start the service, people are still filing in. Some stay
squished into the corners, some climb past the basketball hoops and
into the bleachers by the championship banners that hang from the
walls.
</P>
<P>
   The late arrivals know better than to go looking for a vacancy
in the rows of wooden folding chairs that cover the hardwood floor
court.
</P>
<P>
   ''People in the summer, they're just trying to find a church on
the island,'' Michalak says later in an interview. ''They're happy
to find us here.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to summer church, seashore style.
</P>
<P>
   As surely as the beaches, boardwalks and amusement parks of the
Jersey shore fill up when the weather warms, so do the pews,
confessionals and bleachers of churches and other houses of
worship.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nine months of worry, three months of scurry,'' said
Rabbi Aaron Krauss, of Temple Beth El Synagogue in Margate, echoing
a saying used by clergymen of all faiths from Point Pleasant Beach
to Cape May.
</P>
<P>
   The change from winter to summer is dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   On Long Beach Island, there is only one place to attend Roman
Catholic services in the off-season. It is St. Francis of Assisi in
Brant Beach, which celebrates five Masses every Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In summer, St. Francis opens mission churches in Loveladies,
Beach Haven and Surf City to accommodate the bigger congregations.
Among the four locations, the parish offers 20 Sunday Masses, each
attended by 800 to 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a big, big operation,'' said the Rev. Andrew Reitz,
its pastor.
</P>
<P>
   Priests are imported - from Franciscan institutions like Siena
College in Albany, N.Y., St. Bonaventure University in Olean, N.Y.,
and Washington Theological Union in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the communion hosts, the tiny wafers signifying
the body of Christ, which are served at all Masses. ''When we
order, we order 200,000 of them. And that doesn't even carry us
through the summer. We always have to order more,'' Reitz said.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Ann's Roman Catholic Church in Wildwood, one of only two
parishes serving Wildwood, North Wildwood, Wildwood Crest and West
Wildwood, the summer-to-winter dichotomy is equally dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   The 71-year-old baroque cathedral, one of the state's biggest
churches, holds 2,800 people. In winter, it has more than enough
space and there are empty seats in all six of the Sunday Masses.
</P>
<P>
   Not so in summer, when the population of the Wildwoods goes from
15,147 to an estimated 250,000. The parish adds eight Masses - five
of them held at Wildwood Catholic High School, about a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   Between 75 and 90 percent of those attending are out-of-towners,
according to the Rev. Michael P. Orsi, pastor.
</P>
<P>
   At the high school, church workers drape a blue cloth with a
white cross on it over one of the basketball backboards at one end
and erect a makeshift altar beneath it.
</P>
<P>
   It's not St. Patrick's Cathedral, but it serves the purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's part of our faith to attend Mass every Sunday, and they
make it easy for you here,'' said Fran Boyer, 50, of Oaklyn, a
regular summer visitor who attends Mass at the high school. ''My
sons always like this better (than St. Ann's). It's less formal.
They feel more comfortable, with the basketball hoops and
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy to see a packed house, pastors sometimes struggle to
accommodate all the extra people. On a recent Sunday, a first-time
visitor sitting in the back of St. Ann's during a 9:30 a.m. Sunday
Mass was tapped to serve as an usher, collecting money.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter that the man was a newcomer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a pleasure,'' Orsi says of his swollen summer flock. ''I
can't tell you what a pleasure it is. It's wonderful to have a full
church. You hear so many people complain about people not going to
church anymore. Well, you tell them: They're all coming to
Wildwood,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bagpipers Play Into Record Books  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) -- It was music to the ears -- well, some
ears -- as 10,000 bagpipers and drummers set a record Saturday for
the largest-ever pipe band.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the pipe-a-thon, a fund-raiser for the Marie Curie
Cancer Care charity, said more than 8,600 pipers set out on a
procession from Edinburgh Castle along Princes Street in the heart
of the Scottish capital.
</P>
<P>
   The skirl of the pipes could be heard for miles. At one point, a
ring of bagpipers in kilts encircled the medieval castle that looms
over Edinburgh as pipers from Spain, Alaska, Guam, Canada, the
United States, Australia and Hong Kong joined their Scottish
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Among the visitors were the Texas Firefighters Band and the pipe
band of the New York City Department of Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Charles was to meet participants Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   A similar event in 1994 attracted 5,000 pipers. Researchers from
the Guinness Book of Records were on hand to verify Saturday's
feat, organizers said.

<HEADLINE> Kashmir Rebels Kill 6 Indian Soldiers  </HEADLINE>
By QAISER MIRZA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- A Pakistan-based rebel group claimed that
two of its fighters stormed an Indian army camp in Kashmir early
Saturday and killed six soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The shootout continued for several hours in the Sarankot camp,
300 miles southwest of Srinagar, said Abu Dalaha, a spokesman for
the Lashkar-e-Tayabba, who called The Associated Press in Srinagar.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment by the Indian army headquarters
in Srinagar.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, suspected militants lobbed two hand grenades in
downtown Srinagar, police said. The first attack wounded a security
guard and two civilians near Gandhi College. In the second, outside
a mosque, suspected guerrillas threw a hand grenade at a police
jeep, seriously wounding six, including four civilians. There was
no claim of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks came as Indian government officials and the
commanders of the Hezb-ul Mujahedeen, the main rebel group,
scheduled a second meeting to discuss steps to strengthen a
cease-fire agreement in the valley.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir, a former princely state, is divided between Pakistan
and India and has been the cause of two wars between them since the
British rule ended in the subcontinent in 1947. Both the countries
lay claim to a united Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Hezb-ul Mujahedeen declared the three-month
cease-fire on July 24, more than a dozen other militant groups have
vowed to continue fighting the Indian forces. The groups want
Kashmir either to merge with Pakistan or gain independence from
India.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan, meanwhile, urged India on Saturday to hold three-way
talks involving New Delhi, Islamabad and Kashmiri leaders.
According to the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan, the
foreign minister said the militants' demands for talks with India
is ''logical,'' and in line with U.N. resolutions recognizing
Pakistan and India as the two major parties to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   India accuses Pakistan of training and arming the militants -- a
charge Islamabad denies -- and has not wanted to include Pakistan in
any talks on the future of Kashmir, where more than 25,000 people
have been killed in fighting since 1989.

<HEADLINE> Congo Rebels: 45 Solidiers Killed  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Rebels in the northern Congo said Saturday
they repulsed attacks by government forces backed by combat jets
and heavy weapons, killing 45 government troops.
</P>
<P>
   The Congolese Liberation Movement, one of three rebel groups
which have waged a two-year civil war against the government of
President Laurent Kabila, said its losses were light, with just two
killed since Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Olivier Kamitatu said in a satellite telephone call
that rebel lines about 560 miles northeast of the capital,
Kinshasa, had held off attacks by government troops, which
bombarded them with heavy weapons loaded on gunboats on the Oubangi
River. He said the government also received support from Zimbabwean
troops, which struck rebel positions with Russian-made Sukhoi-25
and Antonov aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   There was no independent confirmation of the rebel claims, and
the Congolese government blamed the rebels for provoking the
clashes.
</P>
<P>
   The rebellion against Kabila broke out in this central African
country, formerly called Zaire, in August 1998. The rebels accuse
the Congolese president of corruption and of harboring Hutu
militias that fled Rwanda after committing genocide there in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   A cease-fire was signed in July 1999 by Kabila and his allies --
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia -- and by Rwanda and Uganda, which are
backing the rebels. The rebels signed a month later.
</P>
<P>
   But fighting continues, with Kabila blocking the deployment of
unarmed U.N. military observers and troops to protect them, and all
sides accusing each other of violations. Weeks of clashes in the
northern Congo have forced tens of thousands of refugees into
neighboring Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic,
according to the U.N. refugee agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Congolese government said earlier this week it considered
the 1999 agreement dead so long as Rwandan and Ugandan troops
continue to occupy the eastern half of Congo. Both countries said
they would withdraw only after U.N. troops deploy and the Rwandan
Hutu militia is disarmed.

<HEADLINE> Turkey: Persevere, Palestinians  </HEADLINE>
By SUZAN FRASER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer urged
visiting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Saturday to press
ahead with peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Since the breakdown of two weeks of talks at Camp David on July
25, Arafat has renewed his pledge to declare an independent
Palestinian state on Sept. 13 even if a final peace accord is not
reached.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey already recognizes Palestinian independence and allows
the Palestinians to maintain an embassy. But its leaders are
concerned a unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood could
spark renewed conflict in the Middle East. Turkey is also a strong
ally of the United States and has close economic and military ties
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of an agreement at Camp David, ''it is a fact
that several steps that cannot be neglected were taken toward
peace,'' Sezer said after a meeting with Arafat in Ankara, Turkey's
capital. ''It is important that the sides do not disregard them and
continue with the negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat asked Turkey to ''carry on with all Turkish efforts to
protect and push forward the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has also visited France, several Arab nations and South
Africa to seek support after the breakdown of talks because of
disagreement over the status of Jerusalem. The Palestinians demand
sovereignty over traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, while Israel
insists that the entire city remain united under Israeli
sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> GOP, Dems Agree: Farms Need Help  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats and Republicans agree it's time to
fix federal agricultural policy. But the parties, in their
platforms, are not saying how -- and that's the tricky part because
even farmers themselves don't agree on what's best.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican platform states that the GOP-authored farm law of
1996, known as Freedom to Farm, ''has been limited by events at
home and abroad.'' The party calls for ''immediate action on a
safety net'' for federal farm supports
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, in the platform they are set to approve at their
convention next week in Los Angeles, say the law is ''misguided and
must change.'' They promise to ''strengthen, not shred, the safety
net.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There is going to be a very serious look at farm policy next
year and it appears there may be more impetus to push something
instead of waiting for the (1996 law) to expire in 2002,'' said
Mary Kay Thatcher, a lobbyist for the American Farm Bureau
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   The law, which had broad support from farmers when it was
passed, ended a Depression-era system of production controls and
allowed growers to plant anything they wanted without fear of
losing government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans designed it, the law was supposed to wean farmers
from government assistance.
</P>
<P>
   But four years later, the country is awash in grain, commodity
prices are at historic lows, and Congress has had to pass three
multibillion-dollar bailouts in as many years to keep the
agricultural economy afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Government farm payments are expected to total nearly $23
billion this year -- about half of the current total net farm income
and three times the payouts in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   With bumper crops in the fields this summer and grain stocks
swelling worldwide, economists do not foresee a turnaround in
commodity prices soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''The course the Republicans are on is heading for a train
wreck,'' said John Schnittker Sr., a private consultant and former
USDA economist. ''Freedom to Farm is programmed to add large
commodity stocks to our surplus year after year after year until we
get a drought or until the world gets a big crop failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Schnittker says Congress needs to reinstate production controls
to shrink the surpluses and drive up commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Democratic or the GOP platform suggests anything
like that. The idea of limiting production has been strongly
opposed by both major farm groups as well as grain buyers that
would pay the higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties, echoing farm groups and agribusiness, see
increased trade as the solution to higher farm prices.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, in their platform, pledge to ''open markets abroad.''
The GOP says ''prosperity depends in large measure on expansion of
global markets,'' the GOP platform says.
</P>
<P>
   Despite President Clinton's successes in securing better access
for farm products in China and Mexico, Republicans accuse his
administration of ''ineptitude'' in trade policy.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Veneman, considered a leading candidate to be agriculture
secretary if Republican George W. Bush wins the presidency, is an
expert on farm trade who served in the Agriculture Department
during his father's administration and later was California's
agriculture commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   By emphasizing trade, the parties are reflecting the priorities
of farm groups and agribusiness.
</P>
<P>
   A letter sent July 31 letter Bush and Vice President Al Gore,
the presumptive Democratic nominee, from 95 farm organizations and
business groups urged the candidates to make expansion of
agricultural trade a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even the best farm policy cannot undo bad trade policy,'' the
letter said.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no such consensus in or outside Congress on what
do about government income support for farmers, according to Rep.
Larry Combest, chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. A
supplemental income program proposed by the Clinton administration
earlier this year went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''Finding a solution to these challenges won't be a simple
task,'' the Texas Republican said.
</P>
<P>
   A delegate to the Republican convention, Nebraska businessman
David Hergert, said both parties deserve blame for problems in farm
policy and should work together to solve them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Neither party can go in there and try to ram something
through,'' he said. ''It's going to have to be nonpartisan.''

<HEADLINE> Colombian Cops Fear Rebel Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW SELSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASCA, Colombia (AP) -- Standing behind a wall of sandbags amid
the rubble of a blown-up police station, officer Jose Borney
Trujillo nervously surveys the forested mountains where leftist
rebels roam virtually unimpeded.
</P>
<P>
   Word has come to this tiny police outpost that Colombia's
biggest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or
FARC, now executes policemen captured after attacks.
</P>
<P>
   During the first half of this year alone, rebels killed 120
police, many of them in overwhelming attacks on remote outposts
manned by only a few officers.
</P>
<P>
   The dozen police in Pasca, located a two-hour drive southwest of
the capital Bogota, fear they will be next. They say that without
reinforcements, they'd be overrun and likely killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are aware that if the guerrillas come in here, they will
kill us all. We won't be able to surrender and ask for mercy,''
Borney said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Whether reinforcements save them could depend on the
interpretation of an agreement that sent powerful U.S.-made combat
helicopters to Colombia. Washington donated the helicopters to
fight rebels and others who protect drug crops. But they are not
supposed to be used in normal combat in Colombia's 36-year
guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have overrun Pasca three times -- most recently in
July 1994, when they killed a police sergeant and wounded a
patrolman, then dynamited the police station and jail.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very dangerous here,'' said Borney, 25, as he unslung a
Galil assault rifle from his shoulder and peered into the
mist-shrouded mountains. ''We've been hearing more gunfire coming
from over there in the last few weeks. The rebels are letting us
know they're around.''
</P>
<P>
   A trench has been dug in the rubble. A new police station now
stands next door. From there, the green-uniformed national police
investigate robberies, assaults and other common crimes. But they
are crippled by the hostile environment surrounding them.
</P>
<P>
   ''This affects our work 100 percent,'' admitted patrolman
Anderson Smith Certuche.
</P>
<P>
   The policemen never go on patrol or to crime scenes with less
than five officers. Their area of responsibility extends several
miles outside town, but they don't dare venture out more than a few
hundred yards.
</P>
<P>
   Doing otherwise would make them an easy target for ambush, or
for a hidden lone gunman.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is good to have the police here, but someone really should
send more of them,'' said Meri de Morales, who runs a small general
store down the narrow, pitted street from the police station.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights monitors critical of the rebels' attacks on police
point out that many officers, like those in Pasca, are not involved
in anti-guerrilla operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Pasca police spend much of the day hunkered down in their
brick building, which is laced with chicken wire to repel hand
grenades. A cartoon bird with the message ''Say NO to drugs,'' is
painted on the wall outside.
</P>
<P>
   The officers say they could fend off a large assault for several
hours, but that reinforcements would have to arrive quickly.
</P>
<P>
   It would take hours for additional government forces to reach
Pasca on foot. By truck would be faster, but rebels often mine
roads leading to besieged towns or set up ambushes.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue from the air is the best hope. Tolemaida military base,
where U.S. special forces have been training army counternarcotics
troops, is only about a five-minute flight away.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-made Huey and Black Hawk helicopters are often there, but
whether they would come is uncertain. Last month, U.S.-supplied
helicopters were not used to rescue 13 besieged cops northwest of
Bogota, who eventually surrendered and were allegedly executed by
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   In a subsequent rebel assault, the helicopters were used to
ferry in reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
   After the killings, U.S. Ambassador Curtis W. Kamman said the
helicopters could be used ''to defend the police and military
forces if they are under attack in a zone where there are
anti-narcotics activities.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a definition some fear would mean deeper U.S.
involvement in Colombia's intractable war, which has claimed tens
of thousands of lives since it began in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., said recently that the problem is
likely to persist.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very unclear what's counternarcotics and what's
counterinsurgency. We're going to have, over and over and over
again, many examples like this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the donated aircraft aren't used, the police in Pasca
hope firepower will arrive -- Colombia has more than a dozen
U.S.-made combat helicopters, including Black Hawks, that it
purchased outright and which were not donated. There are no strings
attached to the use of these helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   They are frequently at Tolemaida, and the military says it would
not hesitate to send them into combat to rescue police.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without a doubt, we'll use our helicopters to support them if
they ask for help,'' said Army Col. Paulino Coronado.
</P>
<P>
   Still, foul weather, missions elsewhere, or any number of
problems could delay or paralyze their deployment. Borney and his
mates fret about the consequences if reinforcements are slow in
coming.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to be prepared mentally to fight for five or six
hours,'' Borney murmured as he ejected the magazine from his rifle
and slapped it back in. ''We have to be mentally prepared for what
lies ahead.''

<HEADLINE> Contest for governor center stage at New Jersey's GOP convention  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHERRY HILL, N.J. (AP) - The New Jersey delegates to the
Republican National Convention last week worked and were worked on
as the party sorted out the process of selecting a new governor.
</P>
<P>
   Governor, not president.
</P>
<P>
   The televised version of the Philadelphia convention adulated a
nominee for president despite the fact George W. Bush ended the
real suspense five months ago.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey delegates at the Cherry Hill Hilton had some
suspense: Who can win what is for the moment a three-way race to
replace Gov. Christie Whitman after next year?
</P>
<P>
   First comes the June 5 primary. Positioning is underway, as
Democrats have demonstrated in the last several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican lineup:
</P>
<P>
   - Senate President Donald DiFrancesco was credited by delegates
with being the most diligent during the convention with endless
small meetings and restaurant outings to cajole GOP officials.
</P>
<P>
   - Assembly Speaker Jack Collins was seen at the major functions,
but worked his charms at less visible receptions in his hotel suite
throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
   - Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler, viewing himself as outside
the GOP mainstream, acted outside the hotel itself. He staged a
shadow convention for three nights at a downtown Philadelphia
auditorium, a costly affair with buses bringing in supporters from
virtually every county over three nights, but few convention
delegates. Jack Kemp, Newt Gingrich and Steve Forbes gave speeches.
</P>
<P>
   - Former Gov. Thomas Kean was as busy denying he intended to run
as others were busy circulating rumors that he might do so.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco said, ''Yeah, sure I was lobbying, meeting people.''
But he downplayed it. ''You don't want to do too much to draw away
from Bob Franks,'' the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''And don't forget, this was supposed to be about George Bush,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Hunterdon County chairman Henry Kuhl said DiFrancesco ''had a
very good week. He has such a nice, laid-back style but he doesn't
seem to run out of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuhl, whose county could be decisive, said he was not committed.
</P>
<P>
   John Bennett, who hopes to replace DiFrancesco as Senate
president, was working overtime last week to build up funding
commitments for the Senate GOP's fund-raising account.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1993 law, the legislative leaders control these
accounts, doling out cash to Senate Republicans in contested races.
Political analyst Jim McQueeny said such control gives Senate
presidents enormous influence, making it unlikely DiFrancesco or
Bennett - his second-in-command - will face much internal
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyist Tom Wilson, who has volunteered to help DiFrancesco,
said, ''Collins? Where was he? I don't think he was doing much at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Schundler said his shadow convention accomplished what he had
hoped. ''I am doing well as an outsider. People know who I am, and
those who attended this convention know I am in this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco gave Schundler his due for his effort but added, ''I
don't know, was it good? I didn't get over there.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We will be positive about it. Bret Schundler will be Bret
Schundler. He will try to attack us in a different way,'' he said.
''I don't think that he will be a threat in any way to where I want
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Delegate Jack Rafferty was worried about a divisive primary
hurting the party in 2001 for the nomination for governor. He
thinks Republicans should consolidate their strength against
Democrats, who are sure to launch a major effort to win the post.
</P>
<P>
   One sure candidate, Woodbridge Mayor Jim McGreevey, ran a close
race against Whitman in 1997. He demonstrated his organizational
skills last week by outfoxing U.S. Sen. Robert Torricelli in the
contest for county endorsements, causing Torricelli to drop out two
weeks after he dropped in.
</P>
<P>
   Rafferty would be pleased to see DiFrancesco consolidate support
like McGreevey has done. ''Anyone who tells you a primary doesn't
cause problems, they're wrong. There are rifts that will never be
healed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Allies of the winners get a chance at government appointments,
while allies of the losers are passed over and don't soon forget
it. ''The first ones on board, they get the good jobs. The people
who came later, they get good government,'' Rafferty quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Delegate William Gormley disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The party will be fine. We come from a very strong base of
accomplishment,'' said the Atlantic County state senator who was
himself seen as flirting with a run for governor. Gormley had a
strong second-place finish to Franks in the Republican primary for
U.S. Senate two months ago.

<HEADLINE> Daughter of Peru Leader Makes Appeal  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- The oldest daughter of President Alberto
Fujimori long avoided Peru's often vicious political scene,
devoting herself to children's causes and ceremonial occasions.
</P>
<P>
   But Keiko Sofia Fujimori, who became the unofficial ''primera
dama'' during her parents' messy divorce, is emerging as a soothing
voice for tolerance and negotiation amid the social turmoil
accompanying the start of her authoritarian father's third term.
</P>
<P>
   It's a contrast to the president, who has lashed out at the
opposition, contending it is only ''capable of guaranteeing
chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, a 25-year-old graduate of Boston University, has
gotten a close-up taste of the contentiousness.
</P>
<P>
   She had to wipe tear gas from her eyes while walking beside her
father in a downtown procession before his July 28 inauguration as
riot police clashed a few blocks away with demonstrators irate over
his victory in an election marred by irregularities and allegations
of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Later, she watched opposition lawmakers march out of Congress in
protest during the president's swearing-in. Among them was her
mother, Congresswoman Susana Higuchi, whom Fujimori publicly
stripped of her ''first lady'' title six years ago during their
divorce fight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was thinking how wonderful if instead of confrontation there
could have been dialogue,'' Keiko Sofia said of the inauguration
day violence, which left six people dead, more than 100 injured and
a nation dangerously divided.
</P>
<P>
   She has been spreading that message in a series of interviews
with radio, television, newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ''We Peruvians are tired of so much violence, and I think the
time has come to debate and discuss the construction of a nation
with democracy,'' she said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
   But she doesn't stray too far from the official government line
that blames the opposition for the inauguration day riots.
Opposition leaders contend their protest rally was infiltrated by
National Intelligence Service agents who provoked the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Keiko Sofia rejects the ''dictator'' label pinned on her father
by probably half of Peru's people.
</P>
<P>
   ''My father always taught us to listen to constructive
criticism, and when foolish words are used it is preferable not to
take them into account,'' she told The Associated Press in an
interview at the Government Palace.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a very tolerant man, very funny,'' she added. ''He likes
to tell jokes, especially about himself. He's loving, very strict,
hardworking, stubborn, and he is an excellent father.''
</P>
<P>
   She also expressed her belief that Fujimori's feared national
security adviser, Vladimiro Montesinos, should end his 10-year
reign as Peru's de facto head of the government intelligence
network.
</P>
<P>
   ''My father made an announcement that (Montesinos) could
probably occupy a public post, which seems an excellent idea to
me,'' she said. ''That would mean he could be investigated to
dispel many of the things that are said about him, many things
which aren't true.''
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos has been accused by Fujimori's foes of leading death
squads and using dirty tricks, bribery and threats to maintain the
president's control over all branches of government.
</P>
<P>
   ''He isn't as powerful as one would imagine. The opposition has
set out to demonize him,'' Keiko Sofia said. ''One would think he
is a monster, when he is a normal person, even charismatic.''
</P>
<P>
   As the eldest of four children, Keiko Sofia took on the role of
first lady in 1994 after her mother, already separated from
Fujimori, accused him of tolerating widespread corruption and
ignoring the needs of Peru's poor.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori ''fired'' his wife of 22 years, saying in a televised
address that Higuchi was ''disloyal'' as well as ''unstable and
easily influenced'' by his political rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ''A divorce is very painful for any family, especially if it's
played out publicly, the whole world knowing, journalists
commenting,'' Keiko Sofia said.
</P>
<P>
   The breakup climaxed in a full-scale political fight when
Fujimori thwarted Higuchi's bid to run against him in the 1995
presidential election, pushing a law through Congress that barred
his immediate relatives from seeking higher office. Their divorce
became final in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Keiko Sofia said she remains close to her mother, who was
elected to Congress last April 9 representing the opposition
Independent Moralizing Front. She said they talk on the phone
daily.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very proud that she was elected to Congress. The
political party is of no importance,'' the daughter said.
</P>
<P>
   All the Fujimori children have ''learned to be tolerant and
stand by both'' parents, ''even though they have different
political ideas,'' she added.

<HEADLINE> Retired cop drowns when boat flips on Lake Ontario  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A retired police officer drowned when his
boat flipped over on Lake Ontario as he attempted to escape
3-foot-high waves, but his former partner was rescued after hanging
on for an hour to the overturned craft.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Murray, 60, a 20-year Rochester police veteran who
retired in 1985, and Kenneth Roblee, 52, whose police career ended
in 1969, were dragging an anchor to slow the boat from drifting as
they fished off Fair Haven beach Friday.
</P>
<P>
   When high waves started to fill the bottom of the boat with
water, they started the engine to head back to shore. Once they
started moving, water rushed to the rear of the boat, causing the
stern to sink and the boat to flip over.
</P>
<P>
   Murray was thrown about 15 feet into the water and drowned,
authorities said. Roblee, who was rescued by a boater, was treated
for hypothermia at a hospital in Newark, east of Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   In their retirement years, the men sometimes operated a sandwich
stand - most recently at the Park Avenue festival in Rochester last
weekend.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Writer Detained  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- A liberal Iranian writer and cleric was
detained Saturday for attending a controversial Berlin conference
on Iran, his son said.
</P>
<P>
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency confirmed the arrest
of Hassan Yousefi Eshkevari, saying he was taken to Tehran's Evin
prison for investigation on security charges.
</P>
<P>
   Eshkevari's son, Ruhollah, 22, said his father was detained at
his home hours after returning to Iran for the first time since he
attended the conference in Berlin in April.
</P>
<P>
   ''Security forces in plain clothes searched our home for two
hours. They confiscated some books and papers, and even my personal
computer,'' Ruhollah said.
</P>
<P>
   The conference received wide publicity in Iran and was condemned
by conservatives as television footage showed women dancing and
Iranian exiles making speeches against the government. Iran's
Islamic laws do not permit women to dance in public.
</P>
<P>
   Several other delegates to the conference were detained on their
return to Iran. Some, including two women, have been released.
However, Akbar Ganji, a leading journalist opposed to Iran's
hard-liners, remains in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Eshkevari is charged with acting against national security and
publishing articles that defamed Iranian officials and criticized
the government, the official news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   As Eshkevari is a cleric, he will be tried by a Special Clergy
Court once the investigation is completed, the agency added.
</P>
<P>
   His arrest is seen as part of the ongoing power struggle between
reformist supporters of President Mohammad Khatami and hard-liners
who use their control of the judiciary to impede the liberal
movement.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the authorities closed a weekly satirical magazine,
Tavana, accusing it of publishing ''defamatory articles against
officials,'' the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   It is the 22nd publication to be closed since the hard-liners
began a sweeping crackdown on the press in April.
</P>
<P>
   Eshkevari had remained in Europe after the conference to do
research and give lectures on Iran, his son said.

<HEADLINE> Man sentenced to 95 years for killing senior citizen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FREEHOLD, N.J. (AP) - A 33-year-old Long Branch man was
sentenced to 95 years in prison for murdering his 72-year-old
friend by beating him to death with a hammer after the older man
refused to give him money to buy crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   At Friday's sentencing, Donyelle Locust insisted on his
innocence and claimed that detectives lied on the witness stand and
had coerced him into a detailed confession.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Amison, a retired Marine sergeant and union official, was
found bludgeoned to death at his Asbury Park home after he refused
to give Locust some cash on Feb. 11, 1999, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Locust had borrowed about $100 from Amison
earlier in the day, but apparently wanted more. When Amison refused
the second request, Locust waited until the older man had gone to
sleep and used a hammer from the house to strike him repeatedly in
the head. Locust then stole several items of jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Locust was friends with the man and did odd jobs for
him.
</P>
<P>
   A jury convicted Locust in June of murder, robbery, theft and
possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at Friday's hearing, Amison's nephew, James Emery, read
a letter to the courtroom that directly addressed the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Locust, you and you alone know that you killed Joe Amison,
and you knew exactly what you were doing,'' Emery said.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Patricia Del Bueno Cleary sentenced Locust
to 75 years for the murder and 20 years for the robbery. He must
serve at least 80 percent of that - or about 80 years - before he
is eligible for parole.

<HEADLINE> Free Trade Pact Concluded in Africa  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) -- After years of wrangling, 11 southern
African nations have approved a free trade agreement aimed at
eliminating all tariffs in the region within 12 years, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of South Africa, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho,
Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, Mozambique, Mauritius and
Malawi are to sign the accord Monday at a Southern African
Development Community summit in the Namibian capital, Windhoek. The
accord will take effect Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Final details of the deal were hammered out Friday at a SADC
council of ministers meeting, said South Africa's Foreign Affairs
Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very important protocol in terms of integration of the
region and also for the trade of all our countries,'' the South
African Press Association quoted her as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The accord aims to simplify investment and trade among SADC
countries, which have a combined population of some 199 million
people and a gross domestic product of $176 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Differences over a timetable for the reduction of tariffs and
so-called rules of origin, which establish the source of products
qualifying for tariff reduction, have delayed its adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the grouping's 14 member states -- the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Angola and the Seychelles -- are not party to the
agreement, but may join later.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and
Swaziland, which make up the Southern African Customs Union, must
liberalize faster than less-developed SADC members.
</P>
<P>
   Signatories are expected to phase out a minimum of 85 percent of
tariffs within eight years, and all tariffs by the end of 2012.

<HEADLINE> Activists: End Iraq Sanctions  </HEADLINE>
By CHERYL WITTENAUER
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. G. Simon Harak was a professor of ethics until a 1997
trip to Iraq convinced him that a greater moral urgency demanded
his attention.
</P>
<P>
   He quit the faculty of Fairfield University in Connecticut and
now works full time in a growing ''people's movement'' to end
economic sanctions that the United Nations imposed on Iraq on Aug.
6, 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the movement comprises dozens of groups, assembling this
weekend in Washington for a National Mobilization to End the
Sanctions Against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors range from three of the nation's oldest peace groups --
Fellowship of Reconciliation, Pax Christi USA and the American
Friends Service Committee -- to the American Muslim Council.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-sanctions movement includes Gulf War veterans and spans
most faiths and ages, college students and 20-somethings to
gray-haired veterans of the 1960s anti-war movement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Teaching ethics was great, but I made the choice,'' said
Harak, a 52-year-old Jesuit priest. ''It was a step in faith. Jesus
himself would find the sanctions intolerable.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years earlier in Chicago, a handful of peace
activists who had worked together for years to protest nuclear
arms, U.S. military involvement in Central America and the Persian
Gulf War had reached the same conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1995, a call came from Chuck Quilty, a 58-year-old
former chemical engineer from Rock Island, Ill., who quit his job
at a weapons plant 30 years earlier as an act of conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Quilty was gathering his friends to find a way to end the
sanctions, which the United Nations imposed four days after
President Saddam Hussein sent Iraqi troops into neighboring Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq lost a quick war to a U.S.-led coalition in early 1991, but
sanctions were continued to force Saddam to comply with terms of
the truce demanding destruction of his weapons of mass destruction.
Many hoped the sanctions also would lead the Iraqis to oust Saddam,
but activists contend they have managed only to strangle Iraq's
economy and kill an untold number of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Quilty's meeting in peace activist Kathy Kelly's Chicago
apartment was the catalyst for an anti-sanctions group, Voices in
the Wilderness -- ''voices for children in a wilderness of
compassion'' -- and the spur for a movement to end the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, Voices has led more than 30 delegations of U.S.
citizens to Iraq to witness effects of the sanctions. Their tours
include visits to pediatric wards of dying children and inoperative
water treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF says the number of infant and child deaths in Iraq has
doubled in the decade since the sanctions began.
</P>
<P>
   Strict trade sanctions are being kept in place, primarily by the
United States and Britain, until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq
is free of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is allowed to sell oil under a U.N.-approved program. To
prevent diversion of proceeds to Saddam's military or other
unintended recipients, they go to a U.N. fund for food, medicine
and other essential goods and modernize Iraq's oil facilities.
Critics, including some humanitarian workers in Iraq, say it falls
far short of Iraq's needs, and some critical supplies are forbidden
by the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials at the United Nations ''don't foresee changing
the sanctions regime at any point in the near future,'' said Mary
Ellen Glynn, spokeswoman for U. N. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke.
''It's within (Saddam) Hussein's capacity to feed his people
through the oil-for-food program.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even the anti-sanctions movement's most optimistic adherents
believe they will end soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are moral citizens first. To those who blame Saddam, I say
we're not responsible for the things Saddam does. We are
responsible if the actions of our government keep Iraqi children
from food and clean water,'' said Doug Hostetter, international
secretary of the Fellowship of Reconciliation, which plans soon to
deliver water chlorinators to Iraq.

<HEADLINE> BIA head says he will step down before Eastern Pequot ruling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORTH STONINGTON, Conn. (AP) - The head of the federal Bureau of
Indian Affairs plans to leave that job before there is a final
decision on federal recognition for the Eastern Pequot and
Paucatuck Eastern Pequot tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Gover has come under fire from state Attorney General
Richard Blumenthal and the leaders of the towns surrounding the
tribes' joint reservation. They claim the BIA's preliminary
decision to grant one or both tribes recognition was tainted by a
conflict of interest on the part of Gover, who once served as an
attorney for the Golden Hill Paugusetts, another Connecticut tribe
that is seeking recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Gover told the Norwich Bulletin that the final ruling on the
Eastern Pequot and Paucatuck's bids is likely more than a year away
and he intends to step down when the Clinton administration ends in
January.
</P>
<P>
   He said town officials in Ledyard, North Stonington and Preston
need to stop criticizing him and become more involved in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't know if the tribes are even going to be recognized
at the end of the day,'' Gover said. ''It seems to me their money
would be spent better addressing the merits of the petitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Gover also said he believes it would be a ''waste'' of money for
the towns to file a lawsuit against the BIA and the Department of
the Interior over the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''The process has been challenged many times and the authority
of the Bureau has been upheld many times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   North Stonington First Selectman Nicholas Mullane said Friday
while legal action would be unfortunate, town leaders believe
they've exhausted every other available avenue. Guy Martin, one of
the towns' Washington attorneys, said Friday the lawsuit would ask
that the tribes' proposed positive findings be withdrawn because
the BIA process is fundamentally flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Gover suggested the towns apply to extend the 180-day comment
period to have more time to offer feedback on the tribes'
applications. If they don't, their options are limited, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The comment period closes Sept. 27. Then the tribes have at
least 60 days to respond before the BIA sets the final
determination date.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Skakel buys home in New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - Michael Skakel, the Kennedy cousin
accused of the 1975 murder of Greenwich teen-ager Martha Moxley,
recently bought a home in New York state, The Hartford Courant
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel's new property, in Windham, N.Y., is less than 100 miles
from Stamford Superior Court, where a judge is deciding whether he
will face trial in the slaying of his former 15-year-old neighbor.
Skakel has been commuting to court appearances from his home in
Hobe Sound, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel purchased the three-bedroom home on May 19 for $290,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Skakel name is well known in Windham, a ski resort community
where both Michael Skakel and his father, Rushton W. Skakel Sr.,
met their current wives.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean Skakel has been welcomed there with open
arms.
</P>
<P>
   ''The general consensus is that he got away with murder for many
years,'' said Bobbie Jacobs, a restaurant bartender who used to
serve members of the large Skakel family on their regular visits to
Windham to ski.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel was arrested for drunken driving in the town in 1978.
That arrest led to his enrollment in the Elan School, a treatment
center in Maine, where prosecutors claim he admitted killing
Moxley.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Superior Court Judge Maureen Dennis has not
indicated when she will issue a ruling based on legal arguments and
three days of testimony she heard in June in Stamford.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis must decide whether there is probable cause to try Skakel
for murder. If so, she must further decide whether to try him as an
adult or under 1975 statutes pertaining to juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   A conviction as an adult could carry a maximum sentence of 60
years in prison; it is unclear what punishment, if any, Skakel
would face if tried and convicted as a juvenile under 1975 laws.

<HEADLINE> State, local police team up to fight Internet crime against kids  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH FORMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a ninth-floor room of a Dallas hotel, Katie Tarbox first came
face-to-face with her online predator.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1995. The then-13-year-old New Canaan, Conn., resident
had arranged to meet ''Mark'' - a 41-year-old California man -
after months of Internet chat, e-mail exchanges and phone
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   She thought the Texas encounter, planned around an eighth-grade
swim meet, would be an innocent get-together between two friends.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mark'' had other plans. He had kissed and touched Tarbox
before her mother and swim coaches, warned by Tarbox's teammate,
came knocking on the door.
</P>
<P>
   As Tarbox recounts in her recently released book, ''Katie.com,''
the man was really Francis John Kufrovich. Federal investigations
later revealed that Kufrovich had pursued and had sex with other
girls and boys, and had downloaded child pornography onto his home
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Tarbox, now 18, said no one ever warned her about online child
exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never thought I would ever be at risk for something like
this,'' she said in a telephone interview. ''That was the mindset I
had.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, law enforcement officials in Connecticut and
across the country are stepping in to change that.
</P>
<P>
   State and local law enforcement agencies are working on programs
to educate children, parents and teachers about who is lurking in
cyberspace. They fear not only those who lure children into
meetings, but those who download and send child pornography.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a big problem,'' said Monique Mattei, an attorney and
planning specialist with the state police Computer Crimes Unit.
''The online stuff is particularly fertile ground for attempting to
engage minors in sexual activities and pedophiles in general,
because it's where kids like to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The state last year used a $300,000 federal grant to create an
Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force. Its purposes: to
investigate online activity, develop training programs for local
and state police and promote online safety education programs.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in September, Mattei said, the task force will
introduce Internet-based lessons to fourth- through sixth-graders
at five schools in Connecticut. The pilot program will include an
interactive demonstration. Mattei said the two, 40-minute lessons
should be in place statewide by the following year.
</P>
<P>
   The task force also is working on an educational Web site where
parents and children can get information on avoiding online
predators.
</P>
<P>
   And the unit recruits local police officers for a minimum of a
years' worth of ''top notch'' computer crime training, Mattei said.
Officers from Hamden and Central Connecticut State University are
already working with the state police; officers from South Windsor
and Milford were slated to start this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Online anonymity gives criminals a sense of security, said David
Finkelhor, director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center
at the University of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ''It creates an environment where people feel at liberty to do
illegal things. We need to have law enforcement there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In its first year of operation - August 1998-99 - Connecticut's
Computer Crimes Unit handled 103 cases. Of those, 25 percent dealt
with child pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Between August 1999 and February 2000, Mattei said, the agency
took on 270 new cases, three quarters if them involving child
pornography or exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia-based National Center for Missing &AMP; Exploited
Children estimates there were 785 ''traveler'' cases nationwide in
1999 - incidents where a child or adult traveled to meet physically
with someone first encountered on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the FBI has dedicated several hundred agents to
Internet crimes cases against children since 1994, said Peter
Gulotta Jr., a special agent in the Baltimore office. Fifteen of
the FBI's 58 field offices have task forces that specialize in that
kind of crime, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several related bills are before Congress, ranging from stiffer
penalties for ''travelers'' to a national training facility for
policing Internet crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Some Connecticut police departments have their own Internet
crime initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Derby Detective Sgt. Gerald Narowski gives presentations at area
high schools to educate parents and teachers about the dangers of
cyberspace. Narowski said he shows adults how easy it is to pop
into a chat room and strike up a conversation. Within 10 minutes,
he said, the talk usually becomes sexually explicit.
</P>
<P>
   ''The majority of the parents were oblivious to the threats out
there,'' he said. ''They had no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Narowski said he teaches people to work with the Internet, not
fear it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not that scary a place if you know what's out there,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   In Milford, police Chief Thomas Flaherty said he plans to create
a new Internet crime unit as part of his detectives' bureau, to be
staffed with several officers from his 109-member department.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a priority,'' he said. ''It's the future of crime. The
volume of these kinds of cases exceeds the ability of a local
department to investigate them.''
</P>
<P>
   New Britain Detective James Wardwell - who works in the unit
that fights other crimes against children - is involved in a case
that started with his own online investigation. Wardwell wound up
in contact with a predator who thought the officer was underage.
</P>
<P>
   The case, he said, is now in court.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every single police agency, sooner or later, is going to have
to deal with computer-related crime,'' Wardwell said.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not easy. Mattei said the state's investigations are
labor-intensive and the jurisdiction issues in cyberspace are often
confusing. Of the cases the state's taken on, she said, many remain
open.
</P>
<P>
   ''It drags out,'' Mattei said. ''It seems like forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarbox agreed that the court process can be frustrating, often
because there are no precedents. More than two years after the
encounter, Kufrovich was sentenced to 18 months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eighteen months is not going to cut it for Frank when they
knew about a serious history,'' Tarbox said.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, her focus is on preparing for her freshman year at
the University of Pennsylvania. She's also working on another
personal memoir about what it's like to be 18.
</P>
<P>
   And Tarbox is still online, although she avoids chat rooms and
instant messages from strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great tool to aid in everyday life,'' she said, of the
Internet. ''But when I signed on at 13, I thought it was a meeting
place.''

<HEADLINE> Judge dismisses last count of Williams lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A state Superior Court judge has dismissed
what little remained of a $21.8 million discrimination lawsuit by
the ousted head of the New Jersey State Police.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Judith Yaskin on Friday dismissed a count in Carl
Williams' lawsuit that alleged that Gov. Christie Whitman conspired
with former Attorney General Peter Verniero and her director of
communications to ''libel and defame'' Williams by implying he was
a racist.
</P>
<P>
   Yaskin also dismissed a claim by Williams that he had been
defamed by state Assemblyman LeRoy Jones Jr. Earlier, she had
dismissed a similar claim against The Star-Ledger of Newark.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Williams' lawsuit was dismissed in July.
</P>
<P>
   In it, Williams claimed that the governor wanted him to resign
in retaliation for published remarks he made linking minorities
with drug trafficking and discriminated against him because she
wanted to appoint a younger, black man.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman pressed for Williams to resign in February 1999 after
The Star-Ledger published an interview in which he made comments
about police practicing racial profiling, or stopping motorists
based on their race.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Opposition Claims Advances  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Afghan opposition fighters claimed
Saturday to have seized territory from forces of the ruling Taliban
in clashes that killed 70 Taliban soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition soldiers broke through Taliban defense lines and
advanced toward the strategic Salang Pass, 60 miles north of the
capital, Kabul, Mohammed Abil, an opposition spokesman, told The
Associated Press by telephone from northern Takhar province.
</P>
<P>
   He said at least 30 Taliban soldiers were also taken prisoner,
but he gave no details of the opposition losses. ''Intense fighting
is still raging in the area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban denied suffering heavy casualties, saying that they
repulsed the opposition attack and the front line remained
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, comprising ethnic and religious minorities,
controls barely 10 percent of Afghanistan and is battling the
ruling Taliban militia on several fronts in an attempt to stop them
from capturing the entire country.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, which espouse a strongly conservative version of
Sunni Islam and captured the Salang Pass two months ago, have held
their positions on mountain heights, a Taliban official in Kabul
said on the condition of anonymity. The pass is one of the main
routes connecting the capital to the country's north.
</P>
<P>
   No independent confirmation of the casualties was possible
because of the remoteness of the area.
</P>
<P>
   Fierce fighting also broke out overnight in Takhar province, 120
miles north of Kabul, where the Taliban are trying to overrun
opposition positions, Abil said.
</P>
<P>
   At least seven Taliban soldiers were killed in that fighting,
Abil said, adding that there were no casualties in the opposition
ranks.

<HEADLINE> Researchers seeking hints of past under New York's concrete  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Those who love New York know it as an
ever-changing city, where a neighborhood can take on a new
character in a matter of weeks and the sight of digging workers
usually signals the coming of a new apartment building or office
tower.
</P>
<P>
   But from the far reaches of Brooklyn and the Bronx to Central
Park, the city's green heart, a few persistent researchers are
poking under soil and concrete not to build the skyscrapers of the
future but to strengthen the city's connection with its past.
</P>
<P>
   These urban archaeologists are hunting for centuries-old
dishware, toys, garbage dumps and chamber pots - any bits of
history that will add color and detail to New Yorkers'
understanding of the lives of those who came before.
</P>
<P>
   ''New York is a city that's always concerned with the present
and looking to the future,'' said Diana Wall, a City College
anthropologist who has participated in excavations all over the
city. Archaeology ''provides an historical depth to this place in a
very immediate sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Sifting through the soil of a big, crowded city in a relatively
young country poses challenges far different from those faced in
the far-flung locales more commonly associated with archaeology -
Egypt, Greece, Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Many New York sites have been destroyed by construction, and
researchers must often probe through the complicated underground
infrastructure of water pipes, sewers, and power lines that keeps
the city running. Sometimes work schedules even have to be planned
around traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to deal with the concrete, the pipes, all the
modern intrusions that can really mess up a site,'' said
Christopher Ricciardi, a Syracuse University graduate student
working on a dig in the Marine Park-Flatlands section of Brooklyn.
''Every now and then you've got to rent a jackhammer.''
</P>
<P>
   But the rewards can be great - a clearer view of 18th and 19th
century lives in a city where history is often drowned out by
bustle and business. Archaeologists say their work can provide
valuable details about the everyday existence of those who didn't
make it into the history books, especially minorities, women,
workers and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the biggest New York finds, an 18th century cemetery
now called the African Burial Ground was discovered in 1991 during
the construction of a federal office building in lower Manhattan.
Some 10,000 to 20,000 people are believed to have been buried
there, far more than historians previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   And in the financial district, the remains of a scuttled ship
from the mid-1700s were unearthed when workers began building an
office tower in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, nine interns supervised by researchers from City
College, Barnard College and the New-York Historical Society
searched Central Park for clues about Seneca Village, a settlement
of free blacks and Irish immigrants who were forced out in 1857 to
make way for the park.
</P>
<P>
   Working in a sliver of the park's west side, the students marked
off plots of grass with white tape and peeked under the soil with
ground-penetrating radar and instruments that use electrical
conductivity and resistivity to find objects in the earth.
</P>
<P>
   The interns, whose findings are being loaded into computers for
analysis by project leaders, did not break any ground in the park.
Their aim was simply to locate areas that might be worth digging.
</P>
<P>
   Nan Rothschild, a Barnard anthropology professor who is one of
several researchers involved in the study, said it's not yet clear
what the team has found. She and her colleagues hope to make
excavation plans once they examine the survey's results and obtain
permits from the city. If all goes well, she said, limited digging
could start in fall 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The team hopes buried artifacts will fill in gaps in historians'
knowledge about Seneca Village, which was viewed by some in the
past as a settlement for vagabonds and squatters.
</P>
<P>
   But Rothschild said tax, church and census records have since
shown the area between 82nd and 89th streets on the park's west
side was a stable community of several hundred people, families who
owned land and held jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''African-Americans did own property,'' said Ericka Haskins, 27,
a junior at the Borough of Manhattan Community College who worked
on the project. ''They weren't just vagrants.''
</P>
<P>
   Seneca Village boasted several churches and a school, as well as
small shops like a grocery and a barrel-maker, Rothschild said. The
researchers hope to find the remains of basements, wells, garbage
dumps and household items like dishes and bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Digging can also provide details about families like the wealthy
Lotts of Brooklyn, whose land the Syracuse researcher Ricciardi is
helping to excavate.
</P>
<P>
   The Lott project is sponsored by Brooklyn College and led by
Arthur Bankoff, chairman of the school's archaeology and
anthropology department. It's aim is to learn more about the rural
history of this most urban city.
</P>
<P>
   The digging is painstaking. Peeling back layers of soil with
small trowels and brushes, the researchers hunt for shards of glass
or clay that are usually less than two inches wide. For every three
weeks of fieldwork, they can spend as long as nine months on
laboratory analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like doing the ultimate jigsaw puzzle,'' Ricciardi said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lotts, who came from Holland when New York was still New
Amsterdam, bought their 250 acres in southeast Brooklyn in 1719,
for 2,100 British pounds. The family sold their land piece by piece
over the years, but kept the farm operating until about 1925. A
relative occupied the main house until 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The surrounding Flatlands were largely rural until the late
1920s, when the city sewer and water systems arrived, making dense
residential development possible.
</P>
<P>
   Bankoff says that once artifacts from the Lott land are
analyzed, they could provide insights into New York's evolution
from farmland to city. One of his team's early findings - a glass
egg used to stimulate unproductive hens - gave members a vivid
reminder of the area's earthy past.
</P>
<P>
   For Ricciardi, it demonstrated archaeology's ability to bring
history home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody thinks we know everything (about New York's past)
because the documents tell us,'' he said. ''Documents, in a sense,
are like reading a table of contents. ... Archaeology is in a
perfect position to piece together all the background and the guts
of a story.''

<HEADLINE> Fake lawyer sentenced to one year in jail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A man who admitted practicing as an
immigration lawyer for more than a decade without a license was
sentenced to a year in jail and must pay $50,000 in restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Callan, 61, said Friday he never meant to hurt anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ''The majority of people that came into the office were
helped,'' said the Trenton resident, who ran The Immigration Law
Center in Ewing for more than 10 years. ''These people need help,
and there was little help available.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercer County Assistant Prosecutor Lawrence McGivney said Callan
preyed on people who dreamed of coming to America. He said many
were deported because Callan didn't handle their cases properly.
</P>
<P>
   McGivney called Callan ''a con man of the highest order.''
</P>
<P>
   McGivney said the scheme was discovered when one victim, a
Russian businessman, called the Bar Association to check Callan's
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Callan pleaded guilty to practicing law without a
license, theft by deception and attempted theft by deception.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Paul Innes on Friday said Callan ''preyed
on these people who were extremely vulnerable. Mr. Callan's actions
resulted in the forfeiture of their dreams.''

<HEADLINE> Serbia's Opposition Divided  </HEADLINE>
By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The leader of Serbia's largest
opposition party said Saturday his group may reverse its decision
to boycott presidential elections but run its own candidate rather
than back one expected to be nominated by the rest of the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The entry of a second opposition candidate in the race could
hand President Slobodan Milosevic victory in the Sept. 24 polls.
</P>
<P>
   Vuk Draskovic, leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement, said his
party would meet Sunday to make the final decision on challenging
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic said he expected the party to nominate the opposition
mayor of Belgrade, Vojislav Mihailovic, as its presidential
candidate. He said Mihailovic, a senior figure in the Serbian
Renewal Movement, should be the only opposition candidate to face
Milosevic, who so far is the only declared candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the fractured Serbian opposition movement is
expected to support Vojislav Kostunica, leader of the small,
center-right Democratic Party of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, however, said Kostunica ''is someone who is so
secluded, who never travels abroad and who would basically continue
Milosevic's policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Other opposition parties had been urging the Serbian Renewal
Movement to abandon its threatened boycott, saying the election
offered the best chance to rid the country of Milosevic after years
of ethnic wars, economic devastation and international isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic's party had said any election supervised by the
Milosevic government would be neither free nor fair. However, other
opposition leaders are reluctant to rally around a candidate allied
with the mercurial Draskovic, who served as a Yugoslav deputy prime
minister until he was fired during the 1999 NATO bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Another opposition leader, Zoran Djindjic, told B2-92 Radio that
Draskovic was trying to promote his own party's candidate and to
take away votes from a united opposition. ''Thus, he helps
Milosevic,'' Djindjic said.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic denied he was collaborating with Milosevic ''while I
am still recovering from my injuries inflicted by Milosevic's
killers. May God give them such collaboration with Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic was slightly wounded in an assassination attempt in
his summer home in Montenegrin coastal town of Budva on June 15. He
accused Milosevic of the attack, although the government has denied
any role.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Western administration in Montenegro, which along with
Serbia forms the Yugoslav federation, has also refused to take part
in the presidential election, despite an appeal from U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic denied any
pressure on him to take part in the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one is pressuring Montenegro,'' Djukanovic said. ''The
views of Montenegro are relevant for the international community in
creating policies concerning southeastern Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that Montenegrins should not worry about
''provocations launched by the Yugoslav army.'' The army, which is
loyal to Milosevic, maintains nearly 20.000 well-armed and trained
troops in Montenegro. Djukanovic can rely on a 15.000-member
paramilitary police force.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything that the Belgrade authorities and their puppets in
Montenegro are launching regarding the republic's role at the
forthcoming balloting is a mere lie, an expression of allegiance
psychology and anti-Montenegrin hysteria,'' Djukanovic told the
newspaper Vijesti.
</P>
<P>
   He said Montenegro ''has the power and motive and the citizens
to protect its freedom and dignity if necessary.''

<HEADLINE> Austria Seeks EU Ties  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Despite differences within the government
over European Union expansion, Austria's foreign minister is
calling for a ''strategic partnership'' between Austria and Eastern
European countries seeking to join the EU to promote the interests
of smaller states.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should promote a strategic partnership with the states of
central and eastern Europe because we have common interests,''
Foreign Minister Benita Ferrero-Waldner said in an interview
published Saturday by the Salzburger Nachrichten newspaper. ''I
have made this alliance my foreign policy priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrero-Waldner's comments contrast sharply with statements made
during last year's election campaign by the far-right Freedom Party
of Joerg Haider. The Freedom Party is now part of the governing
coalition along with the foreign minister's conservative Austrian
Peoples' Party.
</P>
<P>
   Haider's party finished second among the five parties in the
October election after warning Austrians that EU expansion would
threaten jobs because industry would relocate to the low-cost
countries of the former Soviet bloc.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ferrero-Waldner underscored the historical and cultural
ties between Austria and Eastern European countries, many of which
were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. She said Austria had a
stake in the economic and political success of countries such as
Poland, Bulgaria and Romania.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one can take away this historical and also cultural
tradition,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrero-Waldner said such a partnership was necessary to promote
the interests of small European states and serve as a counterweight
to the major powers such as Germany and France within the EU.
</P>
<P>
   Five countries -- Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Spain --
account for more than half the population in the 15-member EU.
</P>
<P>
   ''There must be equality with all other partner states,''
Ferrero-Waldner said. ''At the same time, one must ask how a small
state in this large (European) Union can lobby the best for itself.
I believe it is through the building of this alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Her comments reflect a growing debate within Europe over the
future of the EU after a speech in May by German Foreign Minister
Joschka Fischer, who said the vision of a united Europe from 50
years ago should be carried to its logical end with a European
Federation led by an executive branch and two houses of legislature
codified in a European constitution.
</P>
<P>
   If everyone isn't ready to go that far right now, a ''core
group'' of countries should make the first move and the rest can
join later, he said. That triggered a backlash among smaller EU
countries which fear such a union would be dominated by Germany and
France.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrero-Waldner said she could foresee the European Union
developing into a ''United States of Europe,'' underpinned by a
European constitution. However, she called this a ''utopian idea''
and said such a move would require a continent-wide political
debate about what ''would be decided on a regional, a national and
at a European level.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Alters West's Landscape  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID FOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Skimming over the waves in his jet boat,
Rich Steele gazed upon his beloved Columbia River and flashed a
smile that threatened to stretch from shore to shore.
</P>
<P>
   For 35 years, Steele had fought to protect this free-flowing
stretch of the Columbia from development. Now, by presidential
decree, it had become the Hanford Reach National Monument, and
Steele could barely contain himself.
</P>
<P>
   With the wind combing back his silvery hair, he scanned the
river, finding delights at every bend: a deer bounding along the
shore, a heron launching itself with a squawk from a cottonwood
tree, swallows darting from chalky white bluffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ta-DAAH!'' Steele sang, throwing his arms out wide. ''I've got
myself a monument. Pretty spectacular, don't you think?''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Across the West, environmental activists like Steele have
something to celebrate these days. President Clinton, trying to
carve out an environmental legacy, has created or added to 10
national monuments covering nearly 4 million acres in the West --
and administration officials have signaled more may be on the way.
</P>
<P>
   The monuments protect an unprecedentd array of natural wonders,
from giant sequoias in California to archeological sites in
Colorado to ancient ironwood trees in Arizona. The Hanford
monument, one of four created June 9, protects 51 river miles of
critical spawning grounds for salmon and 195,000 acres of
surrounding grass and brush land.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is relying on the Antiquities Act of 1906, which gives a
president unilateral authority to create national monuments on
federal land to protect ''objects of historic and scientific
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The monument designation, first used by President Theodore
Roosevelt to protect the Grand Canyon, can remove land from mining,
logging, grazing and other extractive uses that are allowed on much
of the nation's 630 million acres of federal land.
</P>
<P>
   Today, more than 100 monuments in 24 states and the Virgin
Islands cover about 70 million acres. Even more areas began as
monuments but were converted later to national parks by Congress,
including Grand Canyon, Death Valley, Glacier Bay, Olympic and
Grand Teton national parks.
</P>
<P>
   President Jimmy Carter holds the record for the most land set
aside in monuments, having protected 56 million acres in Alaska --
much of which went on to become parks and preserves by order of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In the lower 48 states, however, Clinton has put more land into
national monuments than any other president, even Teddy Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Holding press conferences in scenic spots has given Clinton a
chance to trumpet positive accomplishments in a presidency soiled
by scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe maybe if there's one thing that unites our
fractious, argumentative country across generations and parties and
across time, it is the love we have for our land,'' Clinton said in
January as he created a national monument nearly doubling the
protected zone around the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   But the monument designations have raised controversy of their
own. Critics complain that the designations bypass the normal
give-and-take of the political process because they require no
congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   ''This process has no integrity,'' said Sen. Larry Craig,
R-Idaho, who has filed a bill in Congress that would prevent a
president from creating monuments without congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a matter of 'If you don't legislate it, I'm going to
decree it.' I don't think that's the way a representative republic
does it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even environmentalists, as pleased as they are, have expressed
surprise at some of the new monuments, since they have been shut
out of the decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
   ''There certainly is some logic to them once they get
announced,'' said Charles Clusen, a public-lands specialist with
the Natural Resources Defense Council, ''but we don't really know a
lot about what they're doing and when they do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Department of Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt
consider many factors, officials say: Does the land have a
diversity of wildlife? Is it important historically? Is it
threatened by development? How strong is opposition to protecting
the area? And perhaps most important, is there at least some local
support for creating a monument?
</P>
<P>
   Finding grassroots allies has become an important part of the
Clinton administration's approach -- nowhere more so than along
Hanford Reach, the subject of intense debate for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Rich Steele, retired at age 67 from a career making plutonium at
the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, never guessed he'd be so important
to national policy. He just wanted a place to fish.
</P>
<P>
   Steele fell in love with the river at age 9, fishing for bass
from its banks. As he grew older, he realized how rare the wild
stretch of water in his backyard was.
</P>
<P>
   Hydroelectric dams had turned most of the Columbia into a chain
of long reservoirs. But here in eastern Washington, in the 51 miles
between Richland and the Priest Rapids Dam upstream, the river
flowed freely -- the only undammed, non-tidal stretch of the
Columbia in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The river and surrounding uplands had been preserved as a
security buffer around the Hanford reservation, established in 1943
to make plutonium for America's nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Here, salmon and steelhead trout spawned on gravel bars washed
clean by the current. Here, a few fishermen and boaters ignored
Hanford's nuclear reactors on the shore and focused instead on a
riverscape of pure water, sandstone bluffs and a seamless desert
sky.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the best of all worlds,'' Steele recalled. ''No one had
heard about this place, and no one was doing anything to it. I
would have been happy if everybody had just left it alone. But it
just wasn't going to work out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, the Army Corps of Engineers announced it wanted to
build a dam on the reach. Steele and others formed a group to
defeat the proposal. Later, the same group fought government plans
to dredge the river for a barge channel.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Steele started campaigning to get Hanford Reach
protected under the Wild and Scenic River Act, a federal
classification that limits commercial development.
</P>
<P>
   Steele gave boat rides to politicians, congressional staffers,
journalists -- ''just about anyone I thought could help the cause.''
</P>
<P>
   He practiced politics jet-boat style: Lobby guests in the
morning while heading upstream in his 21-foot boat, the Can Do II.
Then, in the heart of the reach, kill the engine, open the beer
cooler and let the river sell itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always had an unfair advantage,'' Steele said. ''How can you
not want to protect this?''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., fell in love with the place and
became one of its biggest champions in Congress. Steele named a
beach after her.
</P>
<P>
   As national environmental groups took note of Hanford Reach,
momentum built during the 1980s for protecting it.
</P>
<P>
   But local farmers opposed the idea, wanting to preserve options
for opening up nearby federal land for irrigated farmland. County
officials objected to the prospect of more federal regulations. And
Department of Energy officials at Hanford worried that it might
affect their operations.
</P>
<P>
   Congress called for a study. Completed in 1994 after six years,
it recommended that the reach become a wild and scenic river, with
a wildlife refuge along its northern shore.
</P>
<P>
   After five more years of discussion, it appeared that an ad hoc
committee representing environmentalists, Indian tribes, farmers
and local, state and federal governments was inching toward
agreement. Then, in January of this year, the talks fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary Babbitt, shopping for federal real estate in need of
protecting, visited the reach in May. Two weeks later, he
recommended to Clinton that the area be made a national monument. A
week after that, on June 9, Clinton made the formal designation.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than environmentalists had hoped for -- and worse
than any compromise plan opponents had seen. A wild and scenic
river designation would have protected the river and a quarter-mile
strip of shore on each side. The new monument did that and more,
adding 97,000 acres to the north of the river and 75,000 acres
already in an ecological reserve on the nuclear reservation.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of a sudden, one individual in the United States makes the
determination of how that land is going to be protected,'' said Max
Benitz, a Benton County commissioner. ''Why do we even have local
governments?''
</P>
<P>
   A similar refrain can be heard throughout the West in places
where Clinton has designated monuments.
</P>
<P>
   In Utah, county governments are suing the Clinton administration
over the 1.7 million-acre Grand Staircase-Escalante National
Monument, created in 1996. Benitz said county commissioners around
Hanford Reach are researching their own legal options. So are
county officials in southern Oregon, unhappy with the new
Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Craig knocks Babbitt's efforts to solicit public input as a
pale imitation of the public comment collected before Congress
makes land-use decisions. Three public meetings that Babbitt held
in Idaho to gather opinions about expanding Craters of the Moon
National Monument were the equivalent of ''a drive-by shooting,''
Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt remains undeterred in his search for potential new
monuments, said Interior spokesman John Wright. Administration
officials aren't saying how many more monuments are possible, but
Babbitt continues to travel the West, poring over maps and meeting
with local residents.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Steele cut the engine, and sounds of the river emerged from the
quiet. Whirlpools sloshed and swirled. Two ducks flapped overhead,
and Steele started telling about his most celebrated river trip of
all.
</P>
<P>
   On June 9, as Clinton signed Hanford Reach National Monument
into creation back in the other Washington, Vice President Al Gore
toured the reach aboard Steele's Can Do II with Sen. Murray and
Washington Gov. Gary Locke.
</P>
<P>
   Gore saluted local activists. ''This is a good day,'' he
pronounced. Murray was beaming. A few guys from Gore's staff stayed
late to party with Steele. He said they hugged him, shook his hand
and kept thanking him for what he'd done.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just beautiful,'' Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   Steele recognizes the frustration of his neighbors who think it
unfair to trump a local compromise with a presidential
proclamation. Then again, ''if I said it isn't nice to win, I'd be
lying to you,'' he said. ''I've wanted to beat those folks for a
long time. We've been lucky. But I think it's because we just
happen to be on the right side.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Steele reached into his cooler and cracked open a
beer, letting his boat drift with the river.

<HEADLINE> Helen Quinn, Met's Queen of Standees, dies  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - The singing has stopped for the Queen of Standees.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Quinn, so dubbed as the infamous, self-appointed manager
of the Metropolitan Opera's standing-room tickets line for 32
years, has died. She was 76.
</P>
<P>
   It's ''the only system of its kind in the world,'' the retired
keypunch operator once said with pride.
</P>
<P>
   Each Saturday morning, rain or shine, hot or cold, she arrived
at the opera house at about 6 a.m. Equipped with a bullhorn and a
clipboard, Quinn took charge of the willing crowd of opera buffs
who came to buy that week's allotment of standing-room tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at the head of the line, she scribbled down each
person's name on a list. And if they got out of line, or failed to
respond, she would turn on her gruff schoolmarm manner - with a
wink - and get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   ''Quiet, back there!'' Quinn warned when the buzz of
conversation interrupted her task.
</P>
<P>
   Then the fans were free to trickle off to breakfast, to get some
more sleep - to do anything, in short, but wait in line.
</P>
<P>
   They had to be back by about 9 a.m. - the box office opens at 10
a.m. - to pay attention while she barked out their names and handed
out numbered slips of paper. And if someone cut into the line, ''I
pounce.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal was to get a $12 spot upstairs in the house or a $16
space behind the velvet orchestra seats - one of the 175
standing-room tickets available for each performance.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, who grew up in Port Chester, N.Y., had been doing this
without pay every Saturday since 1968 - since she decided to stop
the bickering one day while she herself was standing in line at the
Met.
</P>
<P>
   She saw her first opera, Mozart's ''The Magic Flute,'' while
still in high school in 1943, and became such a fan that she
eventually moved to an apartment on West 57th Street near the Met.
</P>
<P>
   She had three hobbies: opera, horse racing and the Yankees. In
that order.
</P>
<P>
   But she never worked for the Met, which nevertheless appreciated
her service and wrote her a letter to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn died Wednesday at her Manhattan apartment, of food
poisoning, said Josephine Rowe, a friend who promises to continue
running the standing-room line.

<HEADLINE> Chavez Pushes for OPEC Unity  </HEADLINE>
By FRED PALS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Making a controversial push for unity
among OPEC members, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez departs Sunday
on a 10-day trip to meet with leaders of the petroleum-exporting
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The self-styled revolutionary wants to invite every head of
state to a Sept. 27 summit in Caracas. His goal to promote deeper
ties with OPEC Arab, African and Asian countries and increase the
grouping's global importance.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez will visit Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, United Arab
Emirates, Iran, Iraq, Indonesia, Libya, Nigeria and Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela was once the group's most notorious quota buster and
most apathetic member. But breaking with the past is Chavez's war
cry as leader of South America's only OPEC country.
</P>
<P>
   The Venezuelan president may need more than a whirlwind trip to
turn the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries into a happy
family again.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Ali Rodriguez recently
admitted he was concerned about reports that the organization is
leaking an extra 700,000 barrels a day into the market. OPEC
heavyweight Saudi Arabia undermined the group's credibility last
month by threatening to boost output unilaterally to bring down
sizzling prices. And OPEC countries have been lukewarm about
sticking to a self-imposed price band system that Rodriguez
masterminded to keep oil prices stable.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like a class of children where not everybody is behaving
well,'' said Mazhar Al-Shereidah, professor in hydrocarbons at the
Caracas University. ''We know current discipline is imperfect, and
seeking unity is a difficult task.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that OPEC hasn't shown the world its ability to pull
together. When oil prices hit record lows in 1998 and 1999, the
group agreed to a series of output cuts that lifted prices to
9-year highs. Chavez gained credibility among OPEC countries by
helping engineer those cuts and ordering Venezuela to comply with
its production quota.
</P>
<P>
   But with oil prices soaring now, some of OPEC's biggest
producers are eager to reap the benefits and are reluctant to keep
output down. On the other hand, heavy social spending and declining
production capacity have forced Venezuela into the role of price
hawk.
</P>
<P>
   ''These prices aren't high,'' Chavez recently said. ''They're
just and fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, fresh from a resounding re-election victory, has more
than higher prices on his mind. The Venezuelan president sees OPEC
as a tool to alter the world order. He frequently preaches about
the need for the poor countries to band together to stand up to
industrialized world powers.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Chavez doesn't mind stepping on the toes of
giants by championing engagement with internationally isolated
nations such as Iraq, Iran and Libya. Few leaders of the world's
democracies are ready to call Iraqi President Saddam Hussein ''a
brother'' or praise Libya as a model of ''participatory
democracy.'' Chavez does, and next week he will become the first
democratically elected leader to pay an official state visit to
Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some say Saddam Hussein is the devil, but the devil is in
hell,'' Chavez said. ''We're all sons of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Such statements, which seem to scoff at U.S.-led efforts to
isolate Iraq, have raised more than a few eyebrows. Venezuela is
the number-four supplier of crude oil and refined products to the
United States, and Chavez has drawn criticism for antagonizing the
country's most important client.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shake hands with Saddam Hussein, saying that $30 a barrel is
fair and get away with it, that would be truly amazing,'' said one
official at the embassy of a European country, who asked not to be
named.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, both Chavez and Rodriguez, who is also OPEC's
president, continue to envision the birth of a new and united OPEC
at the Caracas summit.
</P>
<P>
   ''The summit will underline OPEC's strength, and OPEC will gain
strength every day,'' Rodriguez said in a televised interview
Friday morning.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Drug Adviser Goes South  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's chief adviser on drug
policy leaves Monday for Mexico and Colombia to discuss
anti-narcotics operations.
</P>
<P>
   Announcement of the trip comes one day after the White House
said Clinton will go to Colombia on Aug. 30 for a one-day visit.
</P>
<P>
   Barry McCaffrey, director of the White House Office of National
Drug Control Policy, will head an American delegation in Mexico
City during two days of meetings about cooperation between the two
governments, McCaffrey's office said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican side will include President Ernesto Zedillo and
other top Mexican officials as well as representatives of
President-elect Vicente Fox, according to the statement from
McCaffrey's office.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey also will travel to the port city of Cartagena,
Colombia, for a review Wednesday and Thursday of implementation of
the $1.3 billion U.S. aid project Plan Colombia, which Congress
passed last month at Clinton's behest.
</P>
<P>
   Subjects McCaffrey will discuss with President Andres Pastrana
and others include legal, economic and social development,
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
   During Clinton's one-day visit to Cartagena, the president will
discuss with Pastrana the aid program and efforts to end the
country's 36-year civil war. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.,
and Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., will accompany the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in a statement Friday that it is ''profoundly in
the interest of the United States'' for Colombia to succeed in its
efforts to seek peace, fight illicit drugs, build its economy and
protect democracy.

<HEADLINE> Lazio attacks Clintons over marriage penalty veto  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - ''Flabbergasted'' by the president's
long-distance veto of the Republican-sponsored tax cut for married
couples Saturday, U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio accused the president and
Hillary Rodham Clinton of being out of touch with New York
families, the average American, and reality.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, who is running for U.S. Senate against the first lady,
criticized her for not being an advocate for the tax cut, which
President Clinton vetoed before a morning round of golf on the
Massachusetts resort island of Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   ''She certainly has had an opportunity over these last eight
years to be an advocate for it, to support, to speak out for it,''
Lazio said in Buffalo after addressing the Vietnam Veterans of
America's biennial National Leadership Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's remarkable about today is it just shows you how out of
touch both of the Clintons are with the average New Yorker, with
the average American, that you can be in the middle of a golf game
at some fancy golf club on Martha's Vineyard, be in the process of
raising a half million dollars in soft, unregulated money to pour
into a campaign in a state that you have very little attachment to,
and then at the same time veto a bill that helps provide some basic
tax relief, some tax fairness, for America's working families,''
the Republican congressman said. ''I just think it shows an
incredible lack of attachment with reality.''
</P>
<P>
   An aide for the first lady's campaign said Lazio's support of
the marriage penalty measure illustrated an important difference
between the Senate candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact is that Congressman Lazio supports a risky tax scheme
that would squander our surplus,'' campaign spokesman Howard
Wolfson said. ''Hillary Clinton believes we need to use the surplus
to pay down the debt and preserve Medicare and Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, the candidates' volley over soft money continued
with a letter from Lazio campaign manager Bil Dal Col to his
counterpart in the Clinton camp, Bill de Blasio.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Lazio, claiming millions of unregulated dollars have
been poured into Clinton's Senate race to produce negative ads,
said he wouldn't use soft money in his campaign if Clinton didn't.
The Clinton campaign responded by pointing out that advisers to the
first lady had said in May that she would consider renouncing soft
money if her opponent did the same.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's letter, Dal Col again urged Clinton to stop
soliciting soft money contributions, and also to return existing
money and to call on outside groups to stop running attack ads.
</P>
<P>
   ''Upon receipt of your letter,'' Dal Col said, ''our campaign
will send you a similar letter of intent, call on all outside
groups to refrain from interfering in the campaign, and will agree
not to open any soft money accounts of our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Buffalo, Lazio received a warm reception from
members of the Vietnam Veterans of America in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have to tell all of you I'm in the toughest fight of
my political life right now and I could use your support,'' he
said, ''and because nobody knows more about a tough fight than
Vietnam vets I'm proud to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization does not endorse candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio used a 15-minute address to criticize the Clinton
administration for military cuts, which he said have put the lives
of military personnel at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have my unwavering commitment that I will fight to restore
the strength to our armed forces and respect to our veterans,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Several New York veterans indicated their support for Lazio was
as much about being anti-Clinton as pro-Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sad that a person like Bill Clinton, a draft dodger, will
get better medical care than any veteran,'' said Dick Chipchak, a
Republican who served in the Navy from 1964-68.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming week, Lazio will embark on an out-of-state
fund-raising campaign.

<HEADLINE> Man convicted of conspiring to fix races won't go to jail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FREEHOLD, N.J. (AP) - A harness driver convicted of conspiring
to fix races won't serve any jail time.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Patricia Del Bueno Cleary sentenced Richard
Wojcio to five years probation on Friday and imposed a $7,500 fine.
Wojcio also was ordered to perform 500 hours of community service,
which he has already completed.
</P>
<P>
   The sentencing comes after a state appellate court ordered a new
hearing for Wojcio, who originally received a sentence of 180 days
in Monmouth County Jail, 500 hours of community service and five
years probation.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court in July upheld Wojcio's conviction, but
struck down two aggravating factors Cleary used when sentencing the
once-prominent harness racer in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Wojcio apologized in court before he was sentenced a second
time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sorry to the betting public. I'm sorry to the harness
racing industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His attorney described the hardships the driver - who won 405
races and more than $2.4 million in purse money in 1995 - has faced
since his arrest in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Plaza said Wojcio's problems after the arrest should
deter others from conspiring to fix races. Wojcio was banished from
the raceway, sold his house and now lives in a one-bedroom
apartment. Employers have turned Wojcio down for several jobs,
including one as a delivery truck driver. He now paints houses.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General William Gicking argued that Wojcio
betrayed honest harness drivers who struggle to make a living.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to make those who resort to this type of conduct know
that the price is far too high,'' Gicking said.
</P>
<P>
   Cleary agreed that Wojcio's life ''has been virtually
destroyed'' by the conviction.

<HEADLINE> Mexico's Fox To Go to S. America  </HEADLINE>
By TRACI CARL
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Throughout his campaign and since his
election as Mexico's next president, Vicente Fox has pushed for
more free trade.
</P>
<P>
   His first diplomatic trip as president-elect will be no
different, with Fox traveling to Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay to
discuss an agreement with the Mercosur trading bloc. He will also
visit Chile, meeting with leaders and opposition groups in all four
countries.
</P>
<P>
   On July 2, Fox became the first opposition presidential
candidate to defeat a member of Mexico's ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, which has been in power since its creation in
1929.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his support for free trade follows the lead of his
predecessor, President Ernesto Zedillo, who negotiated many trade
deals, including agreements with Israel, the European Union and
several countries in Central America. Zedillo also talked of an
agreement with Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea is that Mexico has to sign free trade agreements with
everybody in sight,'' said Sidney Weintraub, of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico fears it is too highly dependent on the U.S. economy,
Weintraub said. It has looked to expand into other markets to
protect itself from an economic downturn by its neighbor to the
north.
</P>
<P>
   Trade pacts have fueled exports, helping Mexico rally from its
1995 economic crisis. Yet critics have accused the government of
helping only those prepared for the global economy, leaving behind
people who weren't ready to compete and exacerbating income
disparities.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, however, has fully embraced free trade.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after his election, he began lobbying for the
eventual expansion of the North American Free Trade Agreement into
a common market similar to that of the European Union -- including
the free movement of workers between Mexico, the United States and
Canada. The idea is likely to face opposition in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive, has also promoted the idea of
expanding the four-nation trading bloc known as Mercosur, which
includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
   After meetings Monday in Chile, Fox will discuss a possible
Mercosur agreement with leaders in Argentina on Tuesday, followed
by trips to Brazil and Uruguay later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   However, the president-elect won't be able to sign any
agreements until he takes over the presidency Dec. 1, leading
Weintraub to believe the trip is more about appearances than trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''My instinct is that Fox is trying to establish himself as a
big player in the hemispheric and even world scene, and these
visits have as much that in mind as they do signing agreements,''
he said. ''I assume that's the purpose: to build up his own
stature.''
</P>
<P>
   After his trip to South America, Fox will travel to Canada and
the United States, meeting Aug. 22 with Canadian Prime Minister
Jean Chretien in Ottawa and Aug. 24 with President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He also plans to travel to Dallas to Aug. 25 to talk with Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, Gore's opponent in the presidential election.

<HEADLINE> Longtime Radio Host Halts Career  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Charles Laquidara signed off the air Friday,
ending an era on Boston radio that helped revolutionize FM
listening.
</P>
<P>
   Laquidara, who was the host of the hugely popular ''The Big
Mattress'' on WBCN-FM for the better part of 25 years, devoted his
farewell program on WZLX-FM to reminiscences and a sampling of his
favorite music -- an eclectic mix ranging from Grateful Dead to the
heavy metal band Metallica to Tony Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   His final song was Bennett's ''The Best is Yet To Come.'' He
plans to move to Maui and may explore Internet opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Laquidara was a struggling young actor in Hollywood in the 1960s
when he took his first job in radio, as an announcer for classical
music station KPPC-FM in Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   When the station changed its format to what was then referred to
as ''underground rock,'' Laquidara began to develop a reputation as
a pioneer in a radio movement that was closely linked to the
protest culture of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, he was hired at WBCN to replace disc jockey Peter Wolf,
who would go on to become the lead singer of the J. Geils Band. In
1972, he was named host of the station's morning-drive show.
</P>
<P>
   On his Web site, www.bigmattress.com, Laquidara explains how he
came up with the unusual name for the show:
</P>
<P>
   ''It seemed to conjure up images of thousands of listeners, from
hundreds of different towns in New England, all on this huge,
imaginary mattress -- all waking up to the sounds of rock and roll
from their radios before they went off to school or work.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, WBCN replaced Laquidara in the morning with Howard
Stern. Laquidara moved to sister station WZLX, and that station's
''classic rock'' format featured many of the same songs he played
when the music was new and considered ''underground rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Laquidara's final week was marked with a series of events around
the city, including the presentation by Boston Mayor Thomas M.
Menino of a walk-of-fame star outside the city's Tower Records.

<HEADLINE> Indian Bandit Wants $12M for Star  </HEADLINE>
By RAMESH THIMAIYA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGALORE, India (AP) -- A bandit who has eluded pursuit for
almost two decades and is wanted for killing more than 130 police
officers offered to release an abducted movie star in exchange for
$12 million -- and the right to rejoin society, officials said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Veerappan, who kidnapped well-known Indian actor Rajkumar on
Sunday, made the demands in an audio cassette he sent through an
emissary to governments of the southern states of Tamil Nadu and
Karnataka, where police have tried in vain to arrest him for 18
years.
</P>
<P>
   A senior official of Karnataka state told The Associated Press
on condition of anonymity that Veerappan made a list of six
demands, including the ransom, amnesty from both governments and a
safe house in Tamil Nadu.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants financial compensation for Tamil people affected
in ethnic riots in 1991, official recognition for the Tamil
language in Karnataka state and resolution of a water dispute on
behalf of Tamil Nadu.
</P>
<P>
   Krishna said Veerappan gave no deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Veerappan, who like many in southern India goes by only one
name, enjoys a reputation as a Robin Hood-like figure, striking
from his hide-out in the dense Andhiyur-Satyamangalam forest and
championing the cause of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Governments call him a ruthless criminal who has killed at least
130 policemen and profited from slaughtering elephants for ivory,
smuggling fragrant sandalwood trees and kidnapping for ransom.
</P>
<P>
   But at age 56, he now reportedly suffers from asthma and has
repeatedly offered to surrender in exchange for amnesty. The
government of Karnataka, where most of his crimes were committed,
wants him tried.
</P>
<P>
   Rajkumar, 72, who has appeared in more than 200 Kannada-language
films in a five-decade career, was seized Sunday along with three
others from his vacation home.

<HEADLINE> Mother wants state to pay for wrongly imprisoning mentally ill son  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STORMVILLE, N.Y. (AP) - The mother of a mentally ill man is
suing New York state for imprisoning her son after he was mistaken
for another man.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Los Angeles, where Kerry Sanders was picked up on
a park bench and soon after extradited to New York on a warrant for
prison escapee Robert Sanders, settled a suit with Mary Sanders Lee
for $290,000 for their role in the mistake. But Lee's battle to get
compensation from New York to help her ensure proper care for her
son continues five years after Kerry Sanders was released.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' two years in prison and his exoneration were reported
for the first time in today's New York Times Sunday magazine
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal began when a Los Angeles police officer found Kerry
Sanders sleeping on a park bench on Oct. 5, 1993. Sanders had been
on and off medication for paranoid schizophrenia for a few years,
and was staying alternately with family, in hospitals, and on the
street at the time.
</P>
<P>
   When the officer asked a dispatcher if there were any warrants
out for Sanders, two came back. One was for Kerry Sanders, accused
of jaywalking. The other was for Robert Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   The two men shared a birth date, June 25, 1966. Both were black,
a couple inches apart in height and about 20 pounds different in
weight.
</P>
<P>
   Prison records showed that Robert Sanders was a repeat criminal
from New York who tried to kill a man over a cocaine deal in 1990
and escaped three years later while on work release at a
minimum-security prison in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Richard Bentley, said in a recent interview that
when he asked Sanders if he used any other names, he responded,
''Yes - Terry and Robert.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I asked him whether he was the Robert Sanders they were
looking for in New York,'' Bentley said, ''and he looked me
straight in the eye and said, 'Yes, I am.'''
</P>
<P>
   In his police report, Bentley listed only ''Terry'' under
nicknames and made no mention of the questions about New York.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the case, Kerry Sanders made alternately true and
occasionally delusional claims about his identity. Adding to the
confusion, his fingerprints were never checked. And although his
jaywalking arrest took place while Robert Sanders was in prison,
that and several other discrepancies were not pursued.
</P>
<P>
   During the two years he was in the Green Haven prison in
Dutchess County, Kerry Sanders continually told psychologists and
others that he did not know why he was there.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, his mother pestered police and searched skid row,
questioning homeless people and gang members trying to find her
son.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't have it in my heart that my son was dead,'' Lee said.
''If he's dead, I'm dead.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 7, 1995, federal agents arrested a man waiting in a
Cleveland bus station. He was accused of dealing cocaine. Unsure of
the man's identity, the agents took fingerprints and sent them to
the F.B.I. Within hours, the Drug Enforcement Agency learned that
the prints matched those of Robert Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until authorities discovered Sanders was supposedly
sitting in a prison in New York that Kerry Sanders' fingerprints
were taken. He was quietly sent back to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   New York's attorney general's office is fighting Lee's lawsuit
in Federal District Court in Manhattan. The state did not dispute
that Sanders was wrongly imprisoned, but claimed it was not liable.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne L. Strack, then-deputy commissioner for corrections, said
he was ''flabbergasted'' when he learned about the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all the checks and balances that we've got, I can't
understand how it happened,'' Strack said in a deposition. ''I
mean, it's drilled in you from Day One of the job: You take an
inmate, you're responsible, you identify him. I mean - my mind goes
boggled.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said the blame for the mistake was broad because
''too many things happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Sanders, now 34, has been living since March at a
supervised board-and-care residence in Los Angeles, where he has
his own room and a structured schedule, as well as psychiatric and
health care. A van takes him to counseling and classes.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Sanders remains in federal prison in the Cleveland drug
case, serving a 15-year sentence, the Times reported. New York
still has a warrant out for his arrest.

<HEADLINE> Chechens Warn of Upcoming Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Rebel commanders urged Chechen civilians
Saturday to flee before they launch a major offensive on
Russian-held towns, while the military stepped up security at
checkpoints and administrative buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels in breakaway Chechnya have been spreading leaflets that
warn civilians to leave their homes from Saturday to Monday ''when
armed actions will be carried out'' against Russian installations
and soldiers, the military command's press center said.
</P>
<P>
   The leaflets have appeared in the Nozhai-Yurt region in eastern
Chechnya, which borders on the Russian republic of Dagestan. It was
unclear when the threatened attacks could begin or where civilians
were supposed to go.
</P>
<P>
   Russian commanders have said there could be a wave of attacks on
Sunday, which Chechen separatists regard as their independence day
because it marks the fourth anniversary of their retaking of the
capital Grozny from Russian forces in the 1994-96 war. That war
ended with Russian troops withdrawing in humiliation a few months
later.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops re-entered Chechnya last September, and rebels
fled Grozny en masse in early February. But rebel hit-and-run
attacks and bombings continue in the city and elsewhere in the
republic.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, several Russian servicemen were injured when a
checkpoint in Grozny was attacked by rifle and mortar fire, and an
armored personnel carrier was hit by a grenade launcher, said an
official at the Russian headquarters for Chechnya, in the city of
Gudermes.
</P>
<P>
   Girding for possible attacks on Sunday, the military has
increased security at checkpoints and administrative buildings and
tightened travel restrictions on Chechnya's roads.
</P>
<P>
   Grozny's shattered streets were unusually quiet Saturday, and
there was almost none of the informal street trade that has been
the city's main commerce for months.
</P>
<P>
   Some said fears of a rebel offensive were overblown.
</P>
<P>
   An official from Grozny's civilian administration said the
militants were too fractured and diminished in number to launch a
coordinated offensive, the Interfax news agency reported. The
official, who was not named, said authorities are urging Grozny's
civilians to stay home and ignore the rebels' call to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a spokesman for the rebel command who identified
himself as Alikhan told The Associated Press from central Chechnya
that the militants had no plans to try to seize Grozny on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will do it some other time, when no one expects it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russian forces on Saturday carried out attacks of
their own, sending warplanes and helicopter gunships to bombard
suspected rebel targets in the Nozhai-Yurt, Vedeno and Argun
regions. Russian artillery pounded the Kurchaloi district, where a
Chechen leader, President Aslan Maskhadov, is believed to be based,
the official in Gudermes said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Russia sent troops back into Chechnya after rebels there twice
raided Dagestan a year ago and after apartment bombings in Russia
that killed 300 people. Moscow blames Chechens for the bombings, a
charge the rebels deny.

<HEADLINE> Red Cross Workers Missing in Georgia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) -- Police searching for three missing Red
Cross aid workers found their abandoned car Saturday near the
border with the breakaway republic of Chechnya, but not its
passengers, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   The three have been missing since Thursday, when they set off in
a Toyota sedan from Georgia's capital, Tbilisi, to Pankisi gorge to
visit several thousand refugees who fled fighting in Chechnya
between separatist rebels and Russian troops, said Pauline Ceinaix,
a Red Cross representative in Tbilisi.
</P>
<P>
   The search began after the group failed to respond to radio
transmission for more than 24 hours, Ceinaix said. The three had
not arrived at the refugee camp by Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Police found the car ''on the territory of the Pankisi gorge''
on Saturday but no sign of the passengers, ITAR-Tass cited unnamed
officials as saying. No other details were immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Police had used helicopters and ground vehicles to search the
rugged terrain along Georgia's northern border with Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Red Cross Tbilisi office, the missing workers
were Sophie Prokopieff of France, Natasha Zullino of Italy and
their Georgian driver, Yuri Darchiyev, who regularly visited the
Chechen settlement in Pankisi.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are contacting other organizations working in the area, and
we are trying to find out what happened to our colleagues,''
Ceinaix told Associated Press Television News.
</P>
<P>
   According to Russian television, police said the car could have
crashed on the rough mountain route, but they also suggested the
workers could have been kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   International aid groups pulled out of Chechnya and surrounding
regions after a wave of kidnappings and killings that followed the
1994-96 Chechnya war.
</P>
<P>
   Six Red Cross workers were shot to death in 1996 as they slept
in Chechnya's capital Grozny, and at least three foreign aid
workers were kidnapped. Kidnapping for ransom became a growth
industry in Chechnya after Russian troops pulled out at the end of
the last war.
</P>
<P>
   Aid groups began returning cautiously to the area after Russian
forces entered Chechnya again last September, but only a few aid
workers are inside the republic itself, largely because of security
concerns.

Communications and the potential impact of a strike:
Issues:
<TEXT>
<P>
   -The Communications Workers of America (72,500 Verizon workers)
and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (14,700
workers) want higher pay, improved benefits, greater job security
and better working conditions. The unions also want more access to
nonunion jobs and workers in Verizon's growing wireless division,
the nation's largest. Of Verizon's 32,000 wireless workers, fewer
than 50 are unionized.
</P>
<P>
   -The unions represent operators, customer service workers and
repair workers in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania,
Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia, and the District of Columbia.
Potential Impact:
</P>
<P>
   -No interruption in regular telephone service or 911 emergency
service, according to Verizon.
</P>
<P>
   -No effect on wireless operations, according to Verizon.
</P>
<P>
   -Delays in repairs of local telephone service for residential
and business customers, installation, and resolving billing
questions. ''If there is an outage ... it will be a lengthy phone
outage, if there's a strike going on,'' CWA spokesman Jeff Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   -Repairs and service on long-distance would affect only Verizon
customers in New York.

<HEADLINE> Democracy Forum Held in Singapore  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE (AP) -- Democracy advocates from Asian countries
meeting in Singapore on Saturday scoffed at the claims of some
regional leaders that political freedoms were culturally unsuited
for Asian peoples.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians -- many from opposition parties -- who gathered
for a forum on political openness in Asia rejected the so-called
''Asian values'' argument, which says Asians favor social stability
and order over individual rights like freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's this nonsense about different Asian values when it
comes to basic human rights? It is but the convenient excuse of
some Asian leaders to deny very basic human rights,'' said Martin
Lee, a member of Hong Kong's Legislative Council and chairman of
the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians also criticized the argument by some Asian
leaders that political openness is a luxury, which can only be
granted after countries gain economic wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ''Openness creates wealth and prosperity,'' said Lim Guan Eng,
vice chairman of Malaysia's opposition Democratic Action Party.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians from Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan
gathered for the forum, which was organized by the Open Singapore
Center, a private group that promotes political openness in this
tightly controlled city-state. About 50 spectators turned up.

<HEADLINE> At FDR's home, Social Security celebrates anniversary  </HEADLINE>
By REAGAN HAYNES
<TEXT>
<P>
   HYDE PARK, N.Y. (AP) - Social Security's 65th birthday was
celebrated Saturday at the home of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the
president who brought it to life.
</P>
<P>
   Young and old gathered on a sunny stretch of lawn outside the
tan stucco and stone home to watch a re-enactment of the speech
that preceded the Aug. 14, 1935 ''fireside chat'' and bill-signing.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging 11 percent of American senior citizens live
in poverty today despite the law, the agency said that without its
benefits, the figure would be half.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's as Roosevelt said in his speech earlier, this is a
foundation for people, and it grows and changes with the times,''
Social Security Commissioner Kenneth Apfel said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said Roosevelt considered Social Security a
cornerstone of his administration.
</P>
<P>
   But when he signed that first bill to financially assist
retirees, he was viewed as a communist. On Saturday, retirees
considered his memory only with gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel very fortunate to be with Social Security,'' said
Harold Goodwill, 81, who performed at the event with the Golden Age
Singers. ''With the program benefits I can really enjoy things.''
</P>
<P>
   James Roosevelt spoke about his grandfather and the program that
was part of the ''New Deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Apfel said that although the number of seniors will double over
the next 20 years as people live longer, Social Security will be
there for them.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an intergenerational system. I'm paying for my dad's
retirement and you're paying for your grandparents,'' he said.
''It's changed with the times to last 65 years, and it will be
there 65 years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Maurice Hinchey praised the program that has expanded
to cover about 44 million people, paying tribute to Eleanor
Roosevelt's ''coaxing'' her husband for reform.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her role as my grandfather's eyes and ears, her reports to him
of ... poverty and older America, inspired him to fight the good
fight,'' James Roosevelt said.

<HEADLINE> Peacekeepers on Israeli Border  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH PANOSSIAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) -- U.N. peacekeepers fanned out Saturday
along the Lebanese-Israeli border, completing their deployment for
a mission to bring stability to a zone occupied by Israel until May
and controlled since by guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   White armored vehicles flying the blue U.N. flag cruised without
incident along the border fence that has been the most violent
front of the Arab-Israeli conflict for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment clears the way for Lebanon to station its own
troops in the former Israeli-occupied zone, where anti-Israeli
guerrillas have been the de facto authority since the Israelis left
on May 24.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese Interior Minister Michel Murr said Saturday that a
force of 1,000 soldiers and police officers were poised to enter
the zone early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Murr said the force would maintain law and order in the former
occupied zone, but not security along the border. That, he said,
was the duty of the U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon has repeatedly refused to send troops to its southern
border, saying it does not want to serve as guards for Israel.
However, Murr said, the Lebanese force would not tolerate armed
guerrillas in the former occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak welcomed the
U.N. deployment, issuing a statement that he hoped it would ''bring
stability and security to the area'' and allow Israelis living near
the border to lead normal lives.
</P>
<P>
   The operation, which began at 6 a.m. and lasted most of the day,
went smoothly. Some 370 U.N. troops took up positions along border,
sometimes taking over posts vacated by Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking Indian officer at the U.N. headquarters in the
south Lebanon town of Naqoura said ''all necessary measures were
taken with Lebanese officials, who coordinated with all parties on
the ground, including Hezbollah.'' He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, Hezbollah's backer, welcomed the U.N. deployment. Iranian
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said he hoped it would prevent any
further Israeli incursions into Lebanon, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Finnish soldiers of the 5,000-member U.N. force set up a
position on the Lebanese side of the border across from the Israeli
town of Metulla.
</P>
<P>
   Platoons of peacekeepers from Fiji, Ghana, India, Ireland and
Nepal deployed in and around the border villages of Taibeh, Rmeish,
Alma Shaab, Aitaroun, Meiss el-Jabal, Addaisseh, Meri and at Sheik
Abbad hill, according to witnesses and U.N. officers who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In a reassuring move for residents at former strongholds of the
Israeli-backed militia, Indian soldiers set up a station between
the Christian towns of Marjayoun and Qlaiaa. Capt. Kumara Dhas said
his men were readying another position in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is good. Now, we can move freely,'' said Munif Lahham, a
Marjayoun resident in his early 60s who lives on main street.
</P>
<P>
   Marjayoun served as headquarters of the South Lebanon Army, a
2,500-member militia that helped Israeli troops patrol their
occupied zone until it collapsed with the Israeli withdrawal. Most
militiamen surrendered to Lebanese authorities and are being tried
in military court for collaboration. Other officers were among the
7,000 Lebanese, many of them Christian residents of Qlaiaa and
Marjayoun, who fled to Israel for fear of retribution by Muslim
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the deployment Friday, the United Nations said the
main aim would be to ''instill confidence among the local
inhabitants.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the guerrillas have acted with restraint since Israel's
withdrawal, and there have been very few incidents of revenge. But
there have been cases of intimidation of Lebanese accused of
collaboration. There also have been tensions at the border fence,
with Israel warning Lebanon it must stop civilians from throwing
stones at Israeli soldiers posted on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. troops had taken up position at six points along the border
in the past two weeks, but Lebanon had refused to allow them to
deploy fully until its cartographers were satisfied that Israel was
no longer violating the international border.
</P>
<P>
   Around 550 U.N. troops total are now in the zone. The remainder
of the force is stationed to the north and is due to send in more
troops to reinforce the new positions.
</P>
<P>
   While the presence of the U.N. peacekeepers is welcome, some
southern Lebanese say they do look forward to the deployment of the
Lebanese security forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want the Lebanese army. We are suffocating. We need the
army to lift our spirits,'' said Mohammed Meri, a 35-year-old
Marjayoun resident.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's deployment fulfills the mandate of UNIFIL for the
first time since it was created by the U.N. Security Council after
a 1978 Israeli invasion. Israel invaded again in 1982 and set up
the occupied zone in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment also brings a strong international presence to a
border that has seen fighting since the late 1960s when Palestinian
guerrillas made south Lebanon into a base for attacks on Israel.

<HEADLINE> Evangelicals Conclude Conference  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD N. OSTLING
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- A conference of world's
evangelical Protestants, organized by the Rev. Billy Graham, is
concluding with an uncompromising platform statement that insists
''Christ is the one and only Savior of the world'' and rejects
liberal trends in Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   The paper, called ''The Amsterdam Declaration: A Charter for
Evangelism in the 21st Century,'' was developed from special
discussions this week among 1,000 of the 10,300 participants from
209 countries and territories. It will be distributed to the
meeting during its closing hours Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Conference leaders said it is a statement of the 1,000 who
prepared it, not the conference as a whole. But it will be
considered an important definition of the growing evangelical
movement against more liberal versions of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   A second document, a 14-point ''Covenant for Evangelists,'' will
also be given to all those in attendance Sunday. They are being
asked to sign it as a personal pledge before God to spread the
Gospel with zeal and integrity. No names or total of signers will
be tabulated.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who is absent from the meeting recovering from surgery
in Rochester, Minn., is the first signer of the covenant.
</P>
<P>
   The other document, the declaration, states that ''there may
well be traces of truth, beauty and goodness in many non-Christian
belief systems. But we have no warrant for regarding any of these
as ... separate roads to salvation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The only way to know God in peace, love and joy is through the
reconciling death of Jesus Christ the risen Lord,'' it says,
although that message must be shared ''with love and humility,
shunning all arrogance, hostility and disrespect.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the declaration takes a strong conservative stance
against all modern trends toward religious relativity and
pluralism, in Christian churches as well as ''post-modern''
society.
</P>
<P>
   It says the ''western intellectual establishment'' largely
denies there is any absolute truth and this is ''influencing
popular culture throughout the world.'' But it insists that the
Christian Gospel is authoritative truth ''to everyone everywhere in
all times.''
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting liberal theology, the declaration says the 66 books of
the Protestant Bible ''constitute the written Word of God. As the
inspired revelation of God in writing, the Scriptures are totally
true and trustworthy, and the only infallible rule of faith and
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement affirms such classical -- but often debated --
Christian teachings as the Trinity, the virgin birth of Jesus, his
bodily resurrection from the dead, and his personal future return
as judge and renewer of all things.
</P>
<P>
   It also insists that apart from faith in Christ, all people face
''eternal destruction, separated from the presence of the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   The document also urges an action plan in which an indigenous
church will be established for every group on earth so that
everyone has the chance to hear the Christian message ''in a
language they understand, near where they live.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar statements of conservative evangelical principle and
practice were issued by previous Graham-sponsored world meetings in
1966, 1974 and 1983.

<HEADLINE> German Police Detain Neo-Nazis  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL GEITNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Police detained dozens of neo-Nazi supporters
trying to hold a rally Saturday, while hundreds of Germans took the
streets in an anti-Nazi protest decrying the rise in racist
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests came after courts banned the extreme-right National
Democratic Party (NPD) from holding a rally in Bad Berka, a resort
near Weimar in eastern Germany, calling it a danger to public
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Around 100 skinheads were taken into custody by police as they
tried to attend anyway.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,200 people turned out for the anti-Nazi demonstration in
Duesseldorf, where an explosion July 27 at a rail station injured
10 recent immigrants from the former Soviet Union, six of them
Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Although police have yet to determine a motive, the possibility
that the grenade was set off by right-wing extremists has triggered
a wave of national soul-searching and demands for action to stop
the daily occurrences of neo-Nazi offenses, ranging from
spray-painting swastikas to three fatal attacks so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's true that Hitler and his followers were beaten military
55 years ago, but in the year 2000 they're still not politically
defeated,'' author Ralph Giordano told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks were echoed by onlookers, some of whom noted sadly
that a rally demanding tougher leash laws for attack dogs two weeks
ago attracted nearly 10 times as many people.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes I'm afraid it's already much too late,'' said
Elisabeth Debener, an 81-year-old retiree who lived through the
Nazi era. More than 50 years later, one of her acquaintances is
harassed on the street because of his dark skin when they walk
together to the train, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in a situation in which one has to be afraid,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the eastern city of Eisenach, more than 300 people gathered
Friday night to show support for two African men who were kicked
and spit at and chased through the town by a gang a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nine young neo-Nazis were jailed overnight for threatening to
disrupt that demonstration. Police said their leader, an NPD
member, had a banner with an anti-foreigner slogan hidden under his
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Some 250 NPD attended a rally Saturday that the party was
allowed to hold in Tostedt, east of Bremen.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's government is considering having
the fringe NPD declared unconstitutional for agitating against
foreigners, leftists and other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   But Interior Minister Otto Schily expressed serious
reservations. Banning the party runs the risk of sending its
members underground and making them even more militant, he said in
Der Spiegel magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Schily also told the magazine he was considering deploying
border patrol officers in areas known to be potentially dangerous
''to provide people with visible state protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials also planned to expand video surveillance at
railway stations under the jurisdiction of the border patrol, Der
Spiegel reported. Train conductors will also be able to alert
border patrol officers by code word when skinheads are on board.
</P>
<P>
   A poll published in Saturday's Bild newspaper found 89 percent
of Germans say the government and justice system don't treat
right-wing extremists hard enough. The poll of 1,100 people
provided no margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Economics Minister Werner Mueller joined some of
Germany's top corporate chieftains in warning that the recent rise
in anti-foreigner and anti-Semitic attacks threatened to scare off
foreign investors and harm the German economy.
</P>
<P>
   The depressed, former communist eastern states, where much of
the violence has been concentrated, risk falling further behind
''if xenophobia becomes a terrible distinguishing characteristic
there,'' Mueller told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Bosses of several German companies warned that racist or
neo-Nazi remarks could be grounds for termination.

<HEADLINE> Professor's new test format gives instant feedback  </HEADLINE>
By J.J. THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCEVILLE, N.J. (AP) - Students in Mike Epstein's psychology
classes don't wonder long if they've picked the right answer on a
multiple choice test.
</P>
<P>
   With Epstein's special answer sheet, they know as soon as they
make their choice - and leave the classroom with their exam grade.
</P>
<P>
   The Rider University psychology professor claims his form is a
vast improvement over the fill-in-the-circle computer sheets that
have become common in classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are lousy devices,'' he said. ''They don't really get at
what a person knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Epstein's patented answer sheet features scratch-off boxes
similar to those on instant lottery tickets. Test-takers pick their
answer and scratch off the corresponding box.
</P>
<P>
   If their choice is correct, they'll see a star underneath the
gray box. If they're wrong, they keep guessing until they find it.
</P>
<P>
   Students get partial credit if they know enough about the topic
to guess correctly on the second or third try. And he said his
method ensures they know the correct answer immediately, instead of
waiting several days for the test to be graded.
</P>
<P>
   ''Psychologists know learning requires feedback and the speed in
which you get it matters. What do we do with standardized tests? If
you're lucky you get the test back within 48 hours and very often
the instructor doesn't give back the tests - just the answers,''
Epstein said. ''It's really ridiculous, you're not learning from
your exam.''
</P>
<P>
   Epstein, who has taught at Rider since 1971, began using his
form, called ''Immediate Feedback Assessment Technique,'' or
''IF-AT,'' about three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At first it was a big adjustment for students used to filling in
circles with a No. 2 pencil. Epstein said they were reluctant to
scratch off their first answer. And they quickly learned they
couldn't change an answer if they made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ''I often heard groans in the classroom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But most students have told him they prefer his answer form to
the computer sheets, and have even asked other instructors to use
them.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein, meanwhile, has revised the test to include an
anti-cheating mechanism that prevents students from making hairline
scratches to find the star. He's also done some research that
indicates the form helps people learn.
</P>
<P>
   If a student makes a mistake on a test using a computer answer
sheet, Epstein said there's a 75 to 85 percent chance they will
provide a wrong answer on a follow-up exam. On tests where students
use the his form, they have a 60 percent chance of being correct on
the second try.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein has already sold forms to more than 20 schools
nationwide and in Canada. The Trenton school district also plans to
begin using the form this fall to help students prepare for the
state's standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   He charges about 10 cents a sheet and is trying to market the
form for licensing tests and study guides.
</P>
<P>
   David DiBattista, a psychology professor at Brock University in
Ontario, Canada, said he used the form in some courses this year.
</P>
<P>
   He likes that the test tells students the correct answer
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your evaluation form also becomes a learning opportunity for
the student,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most students he surveyed also liked the immediacy and
appreciated the partial credit.
</P>
<P>
   Their only complaint is they can't change their selection.
</P>
<P>
   ''What they did say is using the IF-AT does require a little
more thought because once you scratch you can't go back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a drawback for teachers: The test must be graded by
hand. But DiBattista claims the exams don't take long to get
through if students do the initial grading.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Connor from Binghamton University in New York also uses the
answer form in her classes.
</P>
<P>
   The form is motivational, she said, because students respond to
it like they're playing a game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he has a real winner there,'' said the psychology
professor.

<HEADLINE> Tribunal May Be Needed for E. Timor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor (AP) -- The United Nations may need to set up a
war crimes tribunal to prosecute those responsible for the death
and destruction that wracked East Timor last year, the top U.N.
human rights official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Robinson, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, said
that if Indonesia fails to punish the people behind the violence
that followed Timor's vote for independence in August 1999, the
United Nations may have to.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important thing is to bring perpetrators to
justice,'' she said after arriving in East Timor's capital Dili.
''That can either be done by courts in Indonesia or in East Timor.
Or if it is necessary it can be done by an international
tribunal.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is important ... that the message goes out that there is no
impunity,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-independence militia, backed by elements in the Indonesian
military, went on a rampage after the U.N.-sponsored vote for
independence ended 24 years of Indonesian rule, killing dozens,
destroying hundreds of buildings and leaving thousands displaced.
</P>
<P>
   Order was restored only after an Australian-led peacekeeping
force arrived and Indonesian troops withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said a future tribunal should be limited to addressing
crimes committed leading up to, and immediately after, the election
in August, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Western governments have said they would back the creation of an
international war crimes tribunal -- akin to those for the former
Yugoslavia and Rwanda -- if Indonesia's government fails to act
against military commanders responsible for the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson is scheduled to spend three days in East Timor before
traveling on to Jakarta.

<HEADLINE> Russian Vodka Distillery Disputed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Two rival directors backed by armed guards
occupied different wings of the company that makes Stolichnaya
vodka Saturday, in a dispute for control over one of Russia's most
renowned distilleries.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Romanov, ousted as general director of the Kristall
distillery by a July court ruling, moved into the factory in
eastern Moscow with armed men in camouflage Friday afternoon while
acting director Vladimir Svirskiy was out.
</P>
<P>
   When Svirskiy returned, he was not allowed in the building. But
on Saturday, he returned with his own guards and took over the
company's accounting offices, Russian television channels reported.
</P>
<P>
   Romanov threatened to have the company's bank accounts blocked
in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Svirskiy said on NTV television Saturday that he sent appeals to
the prosecutor general's office, the Moscow prosecutor's office and
the Interior Ministry to have Romanov removed.
</P>
<P>
   Kristall, which is 51-percent owned by the government, makes
several of Russia's leading vodkas. The management dispute comes as
the government is attempting to consolidate state-owned alcohol
enterprises into a single holding company, according to industry
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict began in May, when Kristall's board of directors
elected Romanov as general director. Some board members objected,
and the Moscow Arbitration Court in July ruled that appointment
invalid and Svirskiy was made acting director.
</P>
<P>
   The board was to hold a meeting to discuss the management
question Friday, but Svirskiy decided not to attend. Then about 15
armed guards and Romanov showed up and entered the plant. Romanov
said the move was aimed at ''re-establishing the state's
ownership.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the tension, tax police raided the company Friday and
seized documents in an ongoing investigation. Russian news reports
said the documents were linked to an audit conducted earlier this
year that uncovered financial wrongdoing under Romanov's
predecessor.

<HEADLINE> Hackensack cops bag 3 in fake luggage operation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) - Police have bagged three men who they
say cranked out $750,000 worth of bogus Louis Vuitton purses.
</P>
<P>
   Officers raided the warehouse of the TK Trading Company Thursday
night, arresting Kwon Kim, 46, of New City, N.Y.; No Chong, 31, of
Queens, N.Y.; and Thomas Rojas, 25, also of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Each was charged with criminal simulation.
</P>
<P>
   Police say they believe Kim and Chong operated the warehouse,
which was formerly called 222 Trading, and that Rojas was an
employee.
</P>
<P>
   The raid was carried out after an 18-month investigation. Inside
the warehouse, investigators found purses, and stacks of designer
labels not attached to any merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   U.S Customs officials said the purses were imported from Korea.
To fool Customs agents inspecting the shipment, the fake Louis
Vuitton labels on the purses were covered by a sewn-on layer of
brown plastic.
</P>
<P>
   Once the bags were inside the warehouse, workers would peel off
the plastic covering, said Hackensack police Capt. Michael Morgada.
</P>
<P>
   The bogus handbags sold for $40 to $50 each, authorities said.
Real Louis Vuitton purses sell for $350 to $3,000.

<HEADLINE> Putin Signs Last Bill in Plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin on Saturday signed the
last of three bills in his plan to tighten Moscow's control over
Russia's far-flung provinces, capping his victory over
independent-minded regional bosses.
</P>
<P>
   The new law allows provincial governors to fire mayors and local
officials who are found to have violated the law, Russia's
state-controlled RTR and ORT television reported.
</P>
<P>
   That bill had caused the least debate. The other two were more
contentious but were eventually approved by both houses of
Parliament last month in what was seen as a key domestic policy
victory for the new president.
</P>
<P>
   The first law will oust the regional governors and regional
legislative speakers from their seats in the upper house of
Parliament, replacing them with appointed legislators by 2002. The
regional leaders will also lose their immunity from criminal
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The second law allows Putin to fire governors who are found to
violate the law.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has already signed the first two bills, ORT said. In an
apparent effort to appease angry regional leaders, Putin also
proposed Saturday that both houses of Parliament create a committee
on how to implement the new laws.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential press service could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Putin says reining in the regions is necessary to fix Russia's
economic problems. Many of the regional governors are highly
authoritarian and have pushed for greater autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents say Putin, who won election in March on a platform
of strengthening the state and Russia's global clout, is
consolidating too many powers.

<HEADLINE> Witness in murder case is killed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - He was expected to testify in an East Orange
murder case. Now Daniel Meronvil has himself become a murder
victim.
</P>
<P>
   He was shot to death last Sunday after leaving his job at Newark
Airport. His family members told The Star-Ledger of Newark for
Saturday's editions that he had testified before a grand jury that
indicted Damian Nelson, who is charged with the East Orange
slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson is accused of shooting a close friend of Meronvil, Shily
Charles, 24, on Main Street Feb. 14. Meronvil's sister, Damaqu,
said her family feels her brother's killing was related to the
Charles slaying.
</P>
<P>
   ''He saw his friend shot in front of him and he testified about
what he saw,'' she said. ''We kind of feel this had something to do
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meronvil, 21, was one of two witnesses to the Charles killing
listed in a police report on the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, 19, was arrested at his East Orange home on Feb. 25 and
charged with murder and weapons offenses. He has been in jail since
then.
</P>
<P>
   A relative of Nelson said he doubted Nelson had anything to do
with Meronvil's death.
</P>
<P>
   ''Damian's locked up,'' said a man who answered the door at
Nelson's home and identified himself as a brother-in-law of the
suspect. He would not give his name. ''He does call home sometimes,
but all calls are monitored, so as for him having any connection,
that sounds far-fetched to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Meronvil was found in an empty lot near South 12th Street,
bleeding from a gunshot wound Sunday night after he left his job as
a janitor at Newark International Airport. He died several hours
later at University Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Smith, a spokeswoman for the Essex County Prosecutor's
Office, would only confirm that Meronvil was shot to death. She
would not discuss details of the shooting, or whether Meronvil was
expected to testify against Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper cited unidentified law enforcement officials who
said he was, in fact, scheduled to testify for the prosecution. It
was not clear when Nelson is due to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   The officials would not say whether they have information
linking Meronvil's killing to Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Family members told the newspaper that Meronvil died from
shotgun blasts to the leg and chest. They said they did not know if
he was on foot or driving when he was shot.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Rights Group Sues for Permit  </HEADLINE>
By SALAH NASRAWI
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Egypt's most prominent human rights group
decided Saturday to sue the government for the right to function,
its secretary-general, Hafez Abu Saada, said.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights will appeal to the
courts against a Ministry of Social Affairs decision to postpone
indefinitely a permit for the group, Abu Saada said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ministry's delay is unconstitutional and we are going to
court to challenge it,'' Abu Saada said after a meeting of the
EOHR's board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the ministry said it was delaying a permit at the
request of state security officials.
</P>
<P>
   The EOHR's difficulties are seen as part of a series of moves
against government critics in recent months, including the
detention of the academic and rights activist Saad Eddin Ibrahim
and the suspension of the Islamic-oriented Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Saada said the ministry had violated the law on
associations, which says that organizations can start functioning
60 days after applying for a license if the government does not
reject their applications.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-day period for the EOHR ended on July 30, Abu Saada said.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the licensing department at the Social Affairs
Ministry, Mohammed Abdel Moneim Tawfic, said Saturday that the
EOHR's application had not been turned down and the group still has
a chance to be licensed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The security (agency) wanted some clarifications and
documents,'' Tawfic said.
</P>
<P>
   He denied the government was trying to restrict the EOHR's
activities, saying ''we are only trying to protect them against
malpractice.'' He refused to say when the license was expected to
be issued.
</P>
<P>
   EOHR's requests for government permission to receive foreign and
local funds have been rejected, Abu Saada said. The group was
hampered from fundraising in Egypt because of its lack of legal
status.
</P>
<P>
   At Saturday night's meeting, the trustees decided to contribute
funds from their own pockets in order to keep the organization
alive, Abu Saada said.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1985, the EOHR is Egypt's first independent rights
group and remains among its most respected. It functioned without a
permit until last year when a change of legislation forced it to
apply for a license.

<HEADLINE> Malcolm X Plaza in Harlem opens as an Islamic tribute  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - In tribute to the slain black leader, the new $1
million Malcolm X Plaza in Harlem opened Saturday as an
Islamic-style garden that replaces a crumbling sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   The plaza on 110th Street, at the junction of Malcolm X
Boulevard and St. Nicholas Avenue, was officially unveiled at a
morning ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by members of his family,
community leaders and city officials.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was City Council member Bill Perkins, who was
instrumental in obtaining the funding for the project from city
coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Representing Malcolm X's Muslim faith, the plaza is landscaped
as a replica of an Islamic garden, with benches, chairs and tables
amid trees, shrubs and white roses.
</P>
<P>
   It was jointly designed by the city's Department of Design and
Construction and Cityscape Institute, a not-for-profit urban design
group.
</P>
<P>
   A statue of the civil rights leader gunned down in the Audubon
Ballroom in Harlem in 1965 will eventually be added to the site.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm X was at the forefront of the 1960s civil rights
struggle that accompanied the rise of the Muslim faith in America,
with competing branches of the movement active in Harlem. Three men
with ties to the Nation of Islam were convicted in the slaying and
served prison terms.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia Bank Owner Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- A former interior minister
and part-owner of a bank in which the U.S. government lost $900,000
was arrested at the offices of his import-export company, police
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Alija Delimustafic, 46, was arrested Friday, but Sarajevo police
refused to specify the charges. The spokesman for the U.N. police
in Bosnia, Douglas Coffman, quoted Bosnian authorities as saying
the charges ''are related to organized crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarajevo police refused to specify the charges against
Delimustafic. The spokesman for the U.N. police in Bosnia, Douglas
Coffman, quoted Bosnian authorities as saying the charges ''are
related to organized crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Coffman gave no further details.
</P>
<P>
   Delimustafic, a former policeman, was appointed interior
minister in 1990 and later served as foreign trade minister during
the 1992-1995 Bosnian war. After the war, he became a principal
owner of the BH Banka, one of the country's largest banks, which
went bankrupt in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released last month, the U.S. General Accounting
Office said the U.S. government had not recovered $900,000 in U.S.
embassy operating funds and loan payments which were deposited in
the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the bank had been involved in corruption.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Western European officials have long complained that
widespread corruption has impeded the economic development of this
country since the 1995 Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the top international official in Bosnia,
Wolfgang Petritsch, welcomed the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are glad to see that the judiciary and police are doing
their job and fighting fraud and corruption in Bosnia,'' said the
spokeswoman, Alexandra Stiglmayer. She added that Bosnia ''must
have a reliable banking system to recover economically.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, dozens of U.N. police and NATO-led peacekeepers
raided a police station, seizing prohibited materials, including
weapons, equipment and documents in a move to control activities of
local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The raid took place in Vares, 25 miles north of Sarajevo, in the
part of the country controlled by the Muslim-Croat Federation, the
U.N. statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the seized material ''wouldn't have been used for normal
police activities,'' said U.N. police spokesman Douglas Coffman,
without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
   During similar raids such as one in Mostar last December, troops
and U.N. police found evidence that the police were spying on
international and Bosnian officials.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20,000 NATO-led peacekeepers, accompanied by 1,700
international policemen, are serving as a part of an international
effort to enforce the peace agreement which ended the 3&AMP;frac12;-year
ethnic war in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Actor Mustafa Mitwali Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Mustafa Mitwali, a popular Egyptian film and
stage actor, died Saturday of a heart attack. He was 51.
</P>
<P>
   Mitwali died at home shortly after returning from Cairo's
Pyramids Theater, where he was playing in ''Bodyguard,'' a long-
running stage comedy, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Family members said he had complained of chest pains on the way
home. He was buried later Saturday in Cairo after a funeral
attended by actors and fans.
</P>
<P>
   Mitwali starred in several plays alongside Egypt's most popular
current comedian, Adel Imam.
</P>
<P>
   Mitwali studied at Cairo's Higher Institute for Dramatic Arts.
After graduating in 1970, he started his career in television soap
operas and went on to act in historical dramas for many years. His
first film was ''Bab Zuweila,'' directed by Nour el-Damerdash.
</P>
<P>
   Later he acted in theater and took lead roles alongside Imam in
his four successful plays: ''A Witness Who Saw Nothing,'' ''Seyed,
the Servant,'' ''The Leader,'' and ''Bodyguard.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitwali is survived by a wife and three sons.

<HEADLINE> France To Destroy Soybean Fields  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- The French government has decided to destroy 115
acres of soybeans in southern France containing genetically
modified seeds, officials announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some other crops, genetically modified soybean is not
authorized in France.
</P>
<P>
   The seven owners of the fields, located in the Bouches-du-Rhone
region around Marseille and the nearby Herault region, are to be
compensated, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   France is opposed to most genetically modified, or GM, products.
However, authorities recently decided against uprooting 11,100
acres of cornfields in southwest France scattered with genetically
modified corn.
</P>
<P>
   Certain types of GM tobacco and corn are authorized for planting
in France.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian prime minister, meanwhile, decided to suspend the
sale of four types of genetically modified corn as a
''precautionary measure,'' although his health minister had
approved the products, the Milan daily Il Giornale reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Giuliano Amato's Cabinet approved the suspension
at a meeting Friday that was not attended by Health Minister
Umberto Veronesi.

<HEADLINE> Miami Storm Becomes First Hurricane  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL LA CORTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The first named tropical storm of the 2000
hurricane season intensified to hurricane strength Saturday but was
not expected to threaten land anytime soon, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   The storm, centered about 515 miles west of the Cape Verde
Islands, had top sustained winds of 75 mph, passing the 74 mph
threshold to become Hurricane Alberto, said Miles Lawrence, a
hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's no threat to land for several days,'' Lawrence said. ''At
some point it might be, but not any time soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Alberto was located about 3,315 miles southeast of Florida with
hurricane force winds extending 25 miles from its center.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters said it was still too early to predict if Alberto
might ever threaten the United States or the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just one of many (storm) systems of a similar kind that
come across the Atlantic, and whether or not they actually make it
all the way across and threaten land, we'll just have to wait and
see,'' Lawrence said.

<HEADLINE> Ford Recovers From Stroke  </HEADLINE>
By HOPE YEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Doctors on Saturday said former President
Gerald Ford had probably completely recovered from the small stroke
he had suffered, and they performed surgery to correct an abscess
in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's tongue had been painfully swollen for several days, but
it quickly returned to normal size after Saturday's operation, said
Dr. Richard Hayden, chief of the ear, nose and throat department at
Hahnemann University Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''His comfort level is markedly improved and his speech has come
back,'' Hayden said at an afternoon news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The 87-year-old former president also was likely recovered from
the small stroke he suffered during the Republican National
Convention, said Dr. Robert Schwartzman, chief of neurology at the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Ford had complained of a swollen tongue since before his trip to
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said the swelling was the result of an exceedingly rare
bacterial infection known as actinomycosis.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's so rare, we're calling it the president's syndrome,''
joked Calvin McDowell, a spokesman for the former president.
</P>
<P>
   Ford will remain on antibiotics for at least six weeks, Hayden
said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said Ford was strong, and although the one-hour
operation required general anesthesia, he was able to walk around
later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden said Ford should be released later this week, but he
didn't want to set a specific date.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have said Ford wouldn't need rehabilitation therapy. He
had regained the use of his left hand and was sleeping well, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   The former president has been eager to leave the hospital and
get on the campaign trail on behalf of GOP presidential nominee
George W. Bush and vice presidential nominee Dick Cheney, who was
Ford's White House chief of staff in 1975-76, McDowell said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's wife, Betty, and three of his four children visited with
him Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's in great spirits,'' McDowell said. ''Everyone is very
excited. Mrs. Ford is calling it a 'beautiful day and beautiful
news.'''

<HEADLINE> Media Magnate Kidnapped in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
By OLIVIER ACUNA
<TEXT>
<P>
   CULIACAN, Mexico (AP) -- A powerful media magnate was kidnapped
in Mexico's drug-plagued Sinaloa state, prompting police to lay low
and his family and newspapers to keep silent in a bid to protect
his life.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Saturday that police checkpoints have been closed
down in the newspaper owner's hometown of Los Mochis out of fear
for the safety of Ildefonso Salido, 62.
</P>
<P>
   Salido, one of the richest men in the northern Mexican state,
was abducted Wednesday from a sports complex in the Pacific coast
city, about 130 miles north of the state capital of Culiacan.
Kidnappers are asking for $10 million for his release, government
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The region's main newspaper, El Debate, owned by Salido, has not
covered the kidnapping at the request of his family, a columnist
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The family said in no way should authorities or the media
intervene,'' said Martin Mendoza, columnist for El Debate.
</P>
<P>
   Director Jose Ramos Santos, director of El Debate, said the
paper also had not filed a criminal complaint or asked police to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have not identified the four men who, posing as
federal police officers, abducted Salido as he exercised at a track
in Los Mochis.
</P>
<P>
   Police searched local hotels, but did not find the victim or the
suspects. Kidnappings and drug-related executions have been
frequent in the state in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Salido also owns two sister papers and has holdings in several
farming and farm-supply companies in Sinaloa.

Bush Attacks Gore on Tax Policy
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SCHOOLCRAFT, Mich. (AP) -- George W. Bush, campaigning by train across an
important midwestern battleground state, today sought to portray rival Al Gore
as both anti-family and timid. The GOP nominee seized on President Clinton's
announcement earlier in the day that he would veto legislation to repeal the
so-called marriage penalty in the tax code. ''Al Gore had a chance to stand up
to President Clinton and say don't veto that bill. But he was silent. He had
nothing to say,'' Bush told a railside rally in East Lansing. Gore, speaking in
Westhampton, N.Y., dismissed Bush's accusations, saying the congressional
proposal would only have benefitted the wealthy.

on the environment, welfare reform, tax relief, health care and other issues,
his campaign said today. The vice president and former senator of Tennessee will
travel from his hometown of Carthage through southern and Midwest states, with a
''handing of the baton'' to Gore from President Clinton in Michigan on Aug. 15,
spokesman Chris Lehane said. He then heads to the convention, Aug. 14 through
Aug. 17 in Los Angeles, to accept the presidential nomination.

   MESA VERDE NATIONAL PARK, Colo. (AP) -- A wildfire at the nation's largest

near several ancient cliff dwellings. Because of the cliff dwellings' locations
and lack of vegetation around them, they aren't in danger from the flames, said
Rob Morrison of the Durango interagency dispatch center. Just 12 hours after
Mesa Verde National Park reopened to tourists Friday after being closed for two
weeks because of another wildfire, it was closed again indefinitely.

<HEADLINE> $11.1M Stolen in Paraguay Air Heist  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- Gunmen in military-style uniforms
stole $11.1 million as guards were about to load the money onto a
plane headed for New York in the South American country's biggest
robbery ever, authorities said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they had no immediate clues who was behind the
robbery, which went off Friday evening without a shot being fired
when heavily armed men overpowered security guards at Asuncion's
international airport.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Stark Coscia, an executive with the security service
Prosegur that employed the guards, said the heist occurred on the
tarmac as the money was being moved from one of its trucks to the
cargo hold of the plane operated by Sao Paulo-based carrier Tam, or
Transporte Aereo del Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the money had been collected from several
private banks. The flight was scheduled to stop first in Buenos
Aires, Argentina, then continue on to New York with the money
destined for a bank in that city.
</P>
<P>
   Local newspaper Ultima Hora said eight gunmen, their faces
daubed in camouflage, pulled up to the plane in a pickup truck
equipped with flashing lights like a security vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper added that the gunmen then overpowered the armored
car's four guards, took the money in a matter of minutes and fled
in the pickup truck down the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not confirm this account.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vetoes GOP Marriage Tax Cut  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton vetoed a
Republican-sponsored tax cut for married couples Saturday,
describing it as ''the first installment of a fiscally reckless tax
strategy'' that would erase projected budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   He said the tax break package amounted to little more than a
gift to the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation passed both the House and the Senate by less
than the two-thirds majorities needed to override Clinton's veto,
but a House leader said an override attempt will be a top priority
after Congress' current summer recess.
</P>
<P>
   GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush, on a campaign train
tour through the Midwest with running mate Dick Cheney, criticized
the veto. The legislation, Bush said at a rally in Pontiac, Mich.,
''was the right thing to do. What kind of tax code is it that
penalize marriage. It's a bad tax code.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential
nominee, said he agreed with the veto but would sign a different
tax cut for married couples.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm for repealing the marriage tax, but not going beyond
working families and not giving tax relief to people who are in the
upper brackets and people who are not even married who are
benefited by the version that was passed,'' said Gore, speaking
from Westhampton, N.Y. ''So I do support the veto. I also support
the right kind of repeal of the marriage tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vetoed the $292 billion, 10-year tax cut before his
morning round of golf on the Massachusetts resort island of
Martha's Vineyard, where the first family is vacationing this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   He returned the legislation to Congress with a letter in which
he said the tax plan was regressive.
</P>
<P>
   ''It provides little relief to families that need it most, while
devoting a large fraction of its benefits to families with higher
incomes,'' Clinton's letter said.
</P>
<P>
   The veto, which Clinton announced on his weekly radio address,
is the opening salvo of a complicated political skirmish as the
November presidential election looms. Clinton and the Democrats are
trying to offer their own tax cut package while arguing that
Republicans are giving away the store.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans believe Clinton's veto gives them a winning
political issue by demonstrating that with a GOP-controlled
Congress, a Democratic president is the only obstacle to sweeping
tax reductions.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's Senate author, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas,
gave an indication of what is to come with a statement that said
Clinton chose a quiet Saturday morning for the veto because he
thought American's wouldn't notice.
</P>
<P>
   ''But working families are paying attention, and they know the
president has run out of excuses,'' Hutchison said. ''The
Republicans have just nominated a presidential candidate who will
give marriage penalty relief to working families.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay, also of Texas, the third-ranking Republican in
the House, has said that upon its return from recess next month,
the House will make trying to override the veto its ''first order
of business.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House claims that tax cuts supported by GOP leaders in
Congress, when combined with the tax cut package proposed by Bush,
would cost more than $2 trillion over 10 years. Bush said Saturday
he would have signed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the non-Social Security budget surplus range from
$1.5 trillion to $2.2 trillion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton accuses Republicans of using his success to justify
election-year tax break gimmicks they know he will veto.
</P>
<P>
   ''I support tax cuts, but tax cuts we can afford. We can't
afford a $2 trillion U-turn on the path of fiscal discipline and
economic progress,'' Clinton said in the radio address.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage penalty legislation and other tax cuts approved by
the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee this year ''provide
about as much benefit to the top 1 percent of Americans as to the
bottom 80 percent combined,'' Clinton's letter to Congress said.
</P>
<P>
   The wealthiest 1 percent of families get an average tax break of
more than $16,000, while a middle-class family gets an average
break of $220, Clinton claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Ways and Means Chairman Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, turned tables
on Clinton and accused him of playing election-year politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''Married couples are the latest victims of vetoes, and it's
becoming sadly clear that President Clinton cares more about the
fortune of political pals on election day than working families on
tax day,'' Archer said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage penalty is the popular name for extra taxes 25
million two-wage-earner couples must pay because of a structural
quirk in the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   The bill Clinton vetoed also would have cut taxes for about as
many additional couples who now enjoy a marriage ''bonus'' by
paying less than they would if they were single. This largely
affects families in which one spouse earns most of the family
income.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the bill's tax reductions would have come from enlarging
the bottom 15 percent tax bracket and increasing the standard tax
deduction for couples filing jointly.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's veto, his 32nd, is no surprise. He promised to kill
the measure even before it passed last month.

<HEADLINE> Gore Tour To Lead to Convention  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTHAMPTON, N.Y. (AP) -- Al Gore will sweep into the Democratic
National Convention fresh from a tour designed to demonstrate he
will ''go the distance'' on the environment, welfare reform, tax
relief, health care and other issues, his campaign said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president and former senator of Tennessee will travel
from his hometown of Carthage through southern and Midwest states,
with a ''handing of the baton'' to Gore from President Clinton in
Michigan on Aug 15, spokesman Chris Lehane said. He then heads to
the convention, Aug. 14 through Aug. 17 in Los Angeles, to accept
the presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he'll announce his running mate on Tuesday, hoping to
create some drama and deflate the double-digit bounce in the polls
rival George W. Bush gained from his just-finished Republican
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said his list of contenders is ''six, plus an
out-of-the-box possibility.'' He had yet to make a decision
Saturday night, advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   Of those six, a knowledgeable Democrat said the leading
prospects are Sens. Evan Bayh of Indiana, John Edwards of North
Carolina, John Kerry of Massachusetts and Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats inside and outside the Gore campaign, none of whom
know for certain what Gore will do, are increasingly touting
Kerry's prospects. A decorated Vietnam War veteran, Kerry would
help Gore underscore his military service and cast the ticket as a
new-new generation alternative to Bush and Dick Cheney -- the son of
former President Bush and the elder Bush's defense secretary.
Neither GOP candidate served in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a charismatic, solid guy with national stature,'' said
David Axelrod, a Chicago Democrat with ties to the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One official close to Gore, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said a number to Gore advisers favor Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   Republican consultant Scott Reed, who ran Bob Dole's 1996
presidential campaign, said Kerry would help Gore energize
Democrats but also would help Republicans cast the ticket as
liberal. ''He'd be a good pick, but in the end Republicans know the
race is about Al Gore,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with ABC News, Gore was asked if Lieberman, an
Orthodox Jew, would face prejudice from some voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think those old distinctions and categories matter
these days, the way they did in the past,'' Gore replied.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party Chairman Ed Rendell suggested religion could be
an issue. ''I don't think anyone can calculate the effect of having
a Jew on the ticket. If Joe Lieberman were Episcopalian it would be
a slam dunk,'' he told reporters outside a Long Island fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell said he was happy with Gore's short list, but still
looking for a name that ''excites the heck out of people'' such as
Bill Bradley, Gore's vanquished primary opponent. ''He'd bring
intelligence, integrity, stature, not to mention Pennsylvania, New
Jersey and Delaware,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Edwards, who was first elected two years ago, Gore told
ABC, ''I don't think Washington experience is the only experience
that's relevant to leadership and to this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has often said his No. 1 requirement of a running mate is
that he or she be ready ''to become president at a moment's
notice.''
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt and New Hampshire Gov.
Jeanne Shaheen are also on Gore's short list.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his running mate will open the ''Going the Distance
Tour,'' on Wednesday with a sort of ''This is your life'' town hall
forum in Carthage that will feature members of Gore's family,
former neighbors and constituents he represented during his 16
years in the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane said the seven-day tour ''will give people the
opportunity to discover the real Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has already begun to emphasize his enlistment in the Army
and service in Vietnam as a military journalist.
</P>
<P>
   --Thursday in Atlanta, Gore will rally with southern governors
and address welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   --Friday in Philadelphia, he'll talk about tax relief, health
care and retirement security.
</P>
<P>
   -Saturday in Springdale, Pa., he will discuss the environment.
</P>
<P>
   --Sunday in Cleveland, Ohio, he visits with child patients and
their parents at University Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   -Aug. 14 in Independence, Mo., Gore talks about ''real
independence for seniors,'' on the 65th anniversary of Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   --Aug. 15 in Michigan, Gore and Clinton focus on the robust
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning Saturday, Gore addressed the National Association of
Police Organizations in Washington, praising the country's law
enforcement officers and crediting them for helping to produce what
he described as the longest sustained decline in crime ever
recorded in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some say the age of heroes has passed. I say look around this
room. Heroism is a part of your job description,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The police organization, which endorsed the Clinton-Gore ticked
in 1996, may issue its 2000 endorsement later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supports a victims' rights amendment and certain gun
controls, including child safety locks. Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett
said Gore and Clinton ''let police officers down by not enforcing
the current laws.''

<HEADLINE> Suspect in hit-and-run death waives extradition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK MILLS, N.Y. (AP) - The main suspect in a fatal
hit-and-run accident pleaded innocent in village court Friday night
to charges of leaving the scene of a fatal accident.
</P>
<P>
   Police this week transported 35-year-old Scott S. Zimmers from
his mother's home in Coweta County, Ga., about 40 miles south of
Atlanta. Investigators allege Zimmers fled there after the pickup
truck he was driving struck and killed 57-year-old Joan E. Foley as
she walked along a rural road south of Utica on July 30.
</P>
<P>
   Foley was walking home from the Oneida County Fire Convention.
Her body was found in a ditch Sunday morning by her husband.
Investigators believe Zimmers also attended the firemen's
convention and was on his way to a tavern in Waterville, 14 miles
south of Utica, when he struck the woman.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmers drove south alone and apparently did not tell anyone
what police said was the true nature of his urgent trip. He
deceived family members as he tried to cover up his alleged
involvement, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmers explained the damage to his truck by saying he struck a
deer in Pennsylvania while driving to Georgia, deputies said.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmers is currently being held without bail at Oneida County
Correctional Facility.

Brazilian Academy of Letters and a tireless promoter of Brazilian
literature overseas, died Saturday. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Coutinho died of cardiac arrest at a hospital in Rio, the
academy said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Coutinho was named to the prestigious Brazilian Academy of
Letters in 1962 after teaching the country's literature to
generations of students here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   His 1955 landmark study, ''Literature in Brazil,'' has been
translated into various languages, the academy said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Coutinho was a visiting professor of Brazilian
Literature at Columbia University in New York, where he also
studied in the 1940s during a five-year stint working as an editor
for Reader's Digest Selections magazine, the academy said.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, he amassed a personal library that served as the
foundation for the Afranio Coutinho Literary Office in Rio, a
research center and library for international and Brazilian
scholars.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he was responsible for showing the literary face of
Brazil to the world,'' said his son-in-law, Frederico de Goes, a
professor of literature at the Federal University of Rio de
Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his son Eduardo de Faria Coutinho, and his
daughter, Maria da Graca Coutinho de Goes. He will be buried Sunday
in Rio, the academy said.

<HEADLINE> Dougherty Leads Burnet Classic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COON RAPIDS, Minn. (AP) -- Ed Dougherty shot a 6-under-par 66 to
take a one-stroke lead after the second round in the Coldwell
Banker Burnet Classic on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty, a four-time runnerup last year, has put himself in
position for his first Senior victory. He has had 14 birdies and
just one bogey in shooting a two-round total of 131 en route to a
36-hole tournament record of 13-under.
</P>
<P>
   Among the prime obstacles for Dougherty in Sunday's final round
will be Hale Irwin, the 1997 and '99 Burnet champion. Irwin, Allen
Doyle and Senior rookie Chuck Moran are one stroke back at 12-under
in the hunt for the $240,000 first-place prize.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hale is licking his chops right now,'' Doyle said, referring
to Irwin's experience and 28 Senior victories. ''He isn't worried
about me, Ed or Chuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin said he likes his spot, but predicted that a score of 17
under or better will likely be needed to win the final round. Irwin
set the 54-hole tourney record in 1997 with a 17-under-par 199.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to just look at what I need to do,'' Irwin said.
''Sundays present a sense of urgency, and I love that. It tends to
energize me. My game hasn't been quite as efficient or crisp as I'd
like it to be, but if my best game can surface Sunday, I'll be
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty started the day in a three-way share of the lead after
an opening-round 65. He played a bogey-free round and birdied Nos.
15 and 16 to regain the lead from Moran.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty, who won just once in 23 years on the PGA tour, led
for three rounds at the 72-hole 1999 Senior Open before taking
second. A back injury has slowed him in 2000, however. He's ranked
No. 33 on the Senior money list.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll see what happens Sunday. I know if I shoot the low
round, I'll win the tournament,'' Dougherty said.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty downplayed the pressure of leading the tournament on
the final day.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sure, it's a thrill to be in the lead, it's what we all play
for,'' he said. ''But I'm 52 years old and on the back nine of my
life, so I don't worry about too many things.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin's 5-under 67 was highlighted by a 50-foot birdie putt on
No. 14. Irwin has played 10 consecutive subpar Burnet rounds at the
Bunker Hills layout with a combined score of 51-under.
</P>
<P>
   Moran, a virtual unknown in PGA and Senior tour circles, tied
the tournament single-round record with a 64, including a 30 on the
front nine.
</P>
<P>
   He surged with an eagle on the par-4 No. 7 and had six birdies.
He was on pace to become the first Burnet tourney player to shoot
63, but parred the last four holes.
</P>
<P>
   Moran played in just one PGA major, the 1980 U.S. Open, where he
missed the cut. He has just one top-24 finish in 13 career Senior
events -- a 17th-place tie in June at the Cadillac NFL tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of golf to be played, so I'm not getting too
excited,'' Moran said. ''For me it will be a good experience
playing under pressure. That's always good for a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle, the runnerup last week at the Long Island Classic, had
six birdies and a bogey in his 5-under 67.
</P>
<P>
   Tom McGinnis was alone in fifth place at 11 under. McGinnis,
whose lone Senior win came in a 1999 playoff over Irwin at the
BankBoston, birdied his final three holes to post a 65.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Morgan shot a 68 and was in sixth place at 10 under.

<HEADLINE> Indians 6, Angels 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Kenny Lofton singled over a drawn-in infield to
drive in the go-ahead run in the seventh inning, and the Cleveland
Indians beat the Anaheim Angels 6-3 Saturday for their fourth
straight win.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton's broken-bat blooper off Scott Schoeneweis (5-6) fell
behind shortstop Kevin Stocker and scored Sandy Alomar from third
base for a 3-2 lead. Lofton had three of Cleveland's 16 hits as the
Indians sent Anaheim to its fourth straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Speier (2-1) pitched 1 1-3 scoreless innings, and Paul
Shuey struck out both batters he faced to close the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thome, Omar Vizquel and Jolbert Cabrera added RBI singles in
the eighth off Mark Petkovsek for a 6-2 lead. Matt Walbeck hit a
run-scoring grounder in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Finley allowed only two singles in the first five innings
against his former team. The left-hander, who had not made it out
of the sixth inning in three previous starts, faltered again in the
sixth and wasted a 2-0 lead on Tim Salmon's 24th homer, an
opposite-field drive to right, and Garret Anderson's RBI single,
which followed an error by Lofton in center.
</P>
<P>
   Finley allowed two runs, five hits and four walks in six
innings. He struck out six.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton singled in the first, stole second, took third on Travis
Fryman's bunt single and scored as Roberto Alomar hit into a double
play. Thome hit a broken-bat, RBI single in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Ramirez ran through a stop sign by third-base coach Jim
Riggleman and was an easy out as he crashed into Walbeck attempting
to score on Thome's hit.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Chan Perry followed with his first major league hit and
Sandy Alomar also singled, but Cabrera hit into a inning-ending
force play.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ramirez left in the eighth inning because of a sore left
hamstring. He was on the disabled list May 30 to July 12 with a
strained left hamstring. ... Perry, called up from the minors
Friday, made his major-league debut in right field. He is the
brother of White Sox third baseman Herb Perry, a former Indian. ...
Ron Gant's second-inning single was his first in nine at-bats in
the AL since Anaheim acquired him July 30 from Philadelphia. ...
Indians catcher Sandy Alomar threw out both runners attempting to
steal on him. He is 17-for-73 on steal attempts this season.

<HEADLINE> Moni Maker Wins Nat Ray Trot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Moni Maker became the first horse
in harness racing to surpass $5 million in career earnings, winning
the $500,000 Nat Ray trot Saturday in her final Meadowlands
Racetrack appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Moni Maker broke her own trotting record for mares, winning in
1:52.1, two fifths of a second better than her old mark.
</P>
<P>
   The win atoned for her loss in last week's Breeders Crown trot
in which the 7-year-old mare finished second to Magician.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's the greatest trotter that ever raced,'' said trainer
Jimmy Takter, who also said the mare will move to Canada for a few
races before retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime driver Wally Hennessey said nothing Moni Maker does
surprises him.
</P>
<P>
   Magician was parked through the first three quarters of the Nat
Ray and was never a factor, finishing sixth. Nikki Cole Cole was
second and Raffaello Ambrosio third.
</P>
<P>
   Moni Maker took command at the top of the stretch and was never
seriously challenged. She paid $3.30 to win and increased her
career earnings to $5,168,631 -- more than any other harness horse.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARMA, N.Y. (AP) - Authorities say an elderly woman whose body
was found by firefighters Friday was the victim of a homicide and
that the perpetrator tried to set the house on fire to cover the
death.
</P>
<P>
   North Greece Fire Chief Mark Stolte said a relative came to the
house just before 10 a.m. to take the apparent victim on a weekly
shopping trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''She opened the front door, saw the inside of the home was
burned and smoky, and ran to a neighbor's house for help,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire apparently had burned itself out by the time police and
firefighters arrived at the house in Parma, a town west of
Rochester, said Monroe County sheriff's spokesman Jim Pringle.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear when the killing happened and when the fire was
set.
</P>
<P>
   The victim's identity was not disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Alberto becomes first hurricane of the Atlantic season  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL LA CORTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) - The first named tropical storm of the 2000
hurricane season intensified to hurricane strength Saturday but was
not expected to threaten land anytime soon, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   The storm, centered about 515 miles west of the Cape Verde
Islands, had top sustained winds of 75 mph, passing the 74 mph
threshold to become Hurricane Alberto, said Miles Lawrence, a
hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's no threat to land for several days,'' Lawrence said. ''At
some point it might be, but not any time soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Alberto was located about 3,315 miles southeast of Florida with
hurricane force winds extending 25 miles from its center.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters said it was still too early to predict if Alberto
may ever threaten the United States or the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just one of many (storm) systems of a similar kind that
come across the Atlantic, and whether or not they actually make it
all the way across and threaten land, we'll just have to wait and
see,'' Lawrence said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Visit Western Fires Area  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton will visit military
troops fighting forest fires in the West next week, the White House
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans a trip Tuesday to Boise, Idaho, where he will get
a briefing on the status of firefighting efforts, White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said. Clinton also is slated to make a
second stop closer to the front lines of a fire in Idaho, where he
will meet some of the troops sent in to relieve exhausted civilian
firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president wanted to just let the firefighters know how
much the country appreciates what they are doing,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the West on Saturday, about 70 large fires were burning
on more than 747,100 acres, according to the National Fire
Information Center. The biggest, in Idaho, had charred at least
102,000 acres near the Montana border.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart did not say whether Clinton plans to announce any new
grants or other assistance from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a short trip. Clinton is due back on the East Coast
for a Democratic fund-raiser Tuesday night at the home of
Charlottesville, Va., political patron Patricia Kluge. The event is
expected to bring in $500,000, much of which is intended to help
the presidential campaign of Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, more than 62,000 wildfires, mostly in the
West, have burned 3.8 million acres. Assistant Interior Secretary
Sylvia Baca has called it the worst fire season in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Army soldiers and Marines have been sent to help
weary civilian fire crews, and Forest Service chief Mike Dombeck
announced Friday that 200 Canadian firefighters were coming to
Montana to help.

<HEADLINE> Els Still Leads International Golf  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASTLE ROCK, Colo. (AP) -- Despite faltering down the stretch,
Ernie Els rode the strength of four early birdies on Saturday to
establish another tournament record and lengthen his lead in The
International.
</P>
<P>
   Els, who began the third round with a 6-point lead over Stuart
Appleby, had 6 points Saturday for a total of 40, eclipsing the
previous 54-hole record of 39 shared by Phil Mickelson and David
Toms.
</P>
<P>
   Els forged an 8-point lead over Mickelson and Greg Norman under
the modified Stableford scoring system used in this event.
</P>
<P>
   The scoring system awards a player with 5 points for an eagle, 2
points for a birdie, zero for a par, minus-1 for a bogey and
minus-3 for a double bogey or worse.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in three days, weather did not intervene.
Lightning caused suspensions of play on Thursday and Friday,
forcing 72 players to conclude their first rounds Friday morning
and 51 to finish their second rounds Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Norman had a 6-point round to get to 32, and Mickelson rallied
into contention with seven birdies worth 14 points to match
Norman's total.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's Stuart Appleby and Spain's Sergio Garcia were at 30,
and Edward Fryatt had 28.
</P>
<P>
   Els, whose 34 points after two rounds also set a tournament
mark, gave his closest pursuers little cause for optimism,
birdieing Nos. 2, 3, 8 and 10 to raise his total to 42 points for a
10-point advantage over Norman.
</P>
<P>
   His birdie on the difficult 10th hole came despite a drive into
the rough. He hit a prudent iron to the left edge of the green to
avoid the pond which fronts the putting surface, then drained a
25-foot putt.
</P>
<P>
   Els, five times a runnerup this season, suffered his first bogey
since Thursday on the par-5 14th hole when he drove into the rough,
pitched out and flew the green with a short iron, failing to get up
and down.
</P>
<P>
   Els saved par after missing the green at No. 16. He drove into
the gallery off the 18th fairway, reached the green with his iron
shot but lipped out his second putt for another bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Norman, playing in his first tournament since having hip surgery
five weeks ago, had three birdies on the front side but also came
undone at the 14th with a bogey following an errant drive.
</P>
<P>
   He birdied the par-5 17th, leaving a 12-foot downhill putt for
eagle just short that would have given him 5 points. Norman then
bogeyed No. 18 after missing the green.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, citing the need to rest before the PGA
championship, skipped this event. David Duval, the world's
third-ranked player, withdrew Thursday because of a lingering back
injury. Tom Lehman, tied for fourth after the second round,
withdrew on Saturday because of an injury to his right leg.
</P>
<P>
   The field, cut to the low 72 players and ties after the second
round, was cut again to the low 36 players and ties for Sunday's
final round. Unlike the formative years of this tournament, all
scores are cumulative for the four rounds.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Miguel Cairo walked with the bases
loaded in the bottom of the 10th inning as the Tampa Bay Devil Rays
beat the Baltimore Orioles 5-4 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second straight game the teams needed extra innings.
The Orioles beat the Devil Rays 10-9 in 15 innings, a game that
ended at 12:33 Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Vaughn started the 10th inning with a single off Mike
Trombley (4-3). Vaughn stole second base and went to third on Fred
McGriff's grounder. The Orioles opted to walk Jose Canseco and Jose
Guillen to load the bases with one out. Cairo then walked to force
in Vaughn with the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Creek and Roberto Hernandez threw five hitless innings out
of the bullpen. Creek walked one in three innings, while Hernandez
(3-3) worked two perfect innings.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore starter Sidney Ponson went nine innings, striking out
a career-high 10. He gave up four runs on eight hits.
</P>
<P>
   Brady Anderson gave the Orioles a 4-3 lead with a fifth-inning
two-run homer. His 14th homer came on the 14th pitch of the at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn tied it in the bottom of the fifth with his 19th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Tanyon Sturtze, making his first start for the Devil Rays, gave
up four runs and six hits over five innings. The right-hander,
acquired from the Chicago White Sox on May 31, had been working out
of the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles scored single runs in the first two innings to take
a 2-0 lead. Delino Deshields scored when third baseman Aubrey Huff
dropped Alert Belle's first-inning pop fly. Brook Fordyce had an
RBI double in the second.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays drew even on Guillen's run-scoring grounder in
the second and McGriff's third-inning sacrifice fly. The RBI was
McGriff's first since July 28.
</P>
<P>
   Huff's run-scoring double put the Devil Rays up 3-2 in the
fourth. Tampa Bay had the lead despite going 0-for-8 with runners
in scoring position in the first four innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Neither team took batting practice before Saturday's 4:15
p.m. start. ... Tampa Bay wasted little time extending its club
record for grounding into double plays to 12 straight games when
Russ Johnson -- who was batting second -- hit into a 6-4-3 DP in the
first. ... McGriff, who needs one homer to record his 13th season
of 20 or more, has gone 63 at-bats without hitting one. ... Hall of
Fame pitcher Robin Roberts threw out the ceremonial first pitch.
... Sturtze threw 44 of his 114 pitches in the fifth inning.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Billy McMillon homered twice in his Detroit debut
and Javier Cardona hit his first major league home run as the
Tigers beat the Minnesota Twins 4-3 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Encarnacion hit a tiebreaking single for the Tigers in the
sixth that chased Joe Mays (6-13) after Bobby Higginson singled and
Hal Morris drew a two-out walk.
</P>
<P>
   Knuckleballer Steve Sparks (1-2) gave up three runs and seven
hits in six innings. Todd Jones pitched the ninth for his
AL-leading 32nd save in 34 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Hocking homered and had two RBIs for the Twins, who lost
for just the sixth time in 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   McMillon, whose contract was purchased Monday from Triple-A
Toledo, hit a solo homer in the third and followed Cardona for
back-to-back homers in the fifth for a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   McMillon, signed in the offseason as a minor league free agent,
doubled his career home-run total. He played 65 games with Florida
and Philadelphia in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Mays, who pitched a five-hit shutout May 7 against Detroit,
allowed four runs and six hits -- including three homers -- in 5 2-3
innings. All of the runs scored with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks put Minnesota ahead in the second with a bases-loaded
walk to Hocking, but got a break when third baseman Dean Palmer
made a nice stop of Cristian Guzman's liner and stepped on the bag
for a force.
</P>
<P>
   McMillon's first homer tied it in the third, but Hocking's homer
gave the Twins a 2-1 lead in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The consecutive homers put Detroit ahead in the bottom half.
Cardona's was a drive down the left-field line that was just fair.
</P>
<P>
   Jacque Jones' RBI triple gave Minnesota a 4-3 lead in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Palmer, nursing a sore right shoulder, played third base
for the first time since July 23. ... McMillon joined the Tigers in
the move that also led to the release of OF Luis Polonia, who
signed with the New York Yankees. McMillon led the International
League in batting (.350), hits (131) and on-base percentage (.446).
... Jones' 121st save for the Tigers moved him ahead of Guillermo
Hernandez for third place on the club's career list. Mike Henneman
leads with 154. John Hiller had 125.

<HEADLINE> Northeast lawmakers explore ways to lower prescription drug prices  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL MELLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - Northeast states can band together to
force lower prescription drug prices without hurting manufacturers'
long-term profits, a Boston University professor said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But the solution, legislation requiring drug makers to slash
prices to increase purchases by consumers, could take years to
implement, health services professor Alan Sager said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may take a few years but if we don't start now we won't get
there. There is no alternative,'' Sager said.
</P>
<P>
   Sager's report, ''Cutting Prescription Drug Spending By Paying
Federal Supply Schedule Prices,'' was the centerpiece of Saturday's
meeting of Northeast lawmakers seeking ways to curb prescription
drug prices.
</P>
<P>
   Drug manufacturers this year will be paid $18 billion by private
insurers, government programs and residents of the eight states for
brand name prescription drugs, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Sager said the states can save a combined $6.5 billion in the
first year by forcing drug makers to offer them prescription drugs
at the same lower prices paid by the federal government, under the
Federal Supply Schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from New England, New York and Pennsylvania have been
meeting on an ad hoc basis for months. The group is organized as a
nonprofit corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ''All this association is trying to do is find a way to fair
prices while drug makers are trying to sustain unfair prices,''
Vermont state Sen. Peter Shumlin, D-Putney, said Saturday. ''This
is a war we have to win for our constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   Other lawmakers at the meeting, however, said they preferred to
take a more conciliatory approach with drug makers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to look at the big picture of health care costs and
why they are so high,'' said state Sen. Timothy F. Murphy,
R-Harrisburg. ''We need to find a way to do this without getting
any specific group in the crosshairs.''
</P>
<P>
   The group said it would meet again in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not there yet, but there is agreement that it makes
sense for us to get together,'' Rhode Island Lt. Gov. Charles
Fogarty, a Democrat, said Friday. ''With states fighting separate
battles, it is easy for the opposition to overwhelm them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sager said drug manufacturers' apparent unwillingness to lower
prices means the states may have to act with legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Average drug prices in the United States are higher than
anywhere else, he said. Prices paid in seven wealthy nations to
drug makers in 1997-98 ranged between 14.5 percent less in
Switzerland to 38.5 percent less in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The report claims the eight U.S. states have a combined buying
power greater than Germany, where prices paid to drug makers in
1997-98 were 21 percent less than in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the report estimates the eight states have 10 million
residents, or 23 percent of the total population, with no insurance
for prescription drugs. Seniors make up slightly more than
one-fifth, or 22 percent, of that group.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Massachusetts has an estimated 303,000 seniors
without coverage. But the state this year passed legislation
offering all people age 65 and older affordable prescription drug
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Sager said winning significant concessions on prescription drug
prices will force drug makers' profits down initially. But the
report claims lower prices will increase demand and eventually help
manufacturers recoup losses.
</P>
<P>
   The report, produced at no cost to the association of lawmakers,
suggested the states could jointly negotiate fair profit margins
for drug manufacturers. The states could also help finance research
on new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Senate Ways and Means Chairman Mark Montigny,
D-New Bedford, said his state recently passed legislation allowing
it to negotiate bulk purchases of prescription drugs for various
government programs. He estimated it would result in 25 to 35
percent savings.
</P>
<P>
   Fogarty said association members are also looking closely at
Maine's recent move to negotiate lower prescription prices on
behalf of more than 300,000 uncovered residents.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state law, if negotiations with manufacturers fail to
reduce prices significantly, the state could impose price controls
three years from now. A similar bill failed in Vermont this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sager said the Maine law shows states have the power to control
the rising cost of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States is the world's shock absorber for drug
manufacturers,'' he said. ''There is no functioning market to fix
the problem.''

<HEADLINE> List Dwindles for U.S. Baseball  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- The U.S. Olympic baseball team might have only
one retired major leaguer on the roster, leaving the rest of the
slots for minor leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Raines, playing in the independent Atlantic League, is a
strong candidate for the team, baseball steering committee
co-chairman Bob Watson said Saturday evening. Raines played most of
last season for Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the retired players under consideration have either
dropped out, gotten hurt or failed to impress. Terry Steinbach, who
had an inside track as a catcher, tore a hamstring and won't be
able to play next month in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was really on course to be one of our catchers,'' Watson
said, in a telephone interview. ''That would have been really great
because of his experience and ability to handle the pitching
staff.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of other retired major leaguers were invited to play in
amateur, semipro or minor leagues to get back into shape and try
out for the team.
</P>
<P>
   Raines was the only one still in the running for the team
Saturday. Countries must have their rosters set by Aug. 23.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just about everybody else has fallen by the wayside,'' Watson
said. ''It was wishful thinking that guys could have taken some
months off, mentally shut it down and then ask them to come back
and start playing again to be evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   ''Actually, Pat Kelly made a strong showing but second base is
one of the positions we're pretty deep in.''
</P>
<P>
   The selection committee is working with major league teams to
try to get some of their best Triple-A and Double-A players. This
is the first Olympic baseball tournament that will be open to
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba won the tournaments in Barcelona and Atlanta, the first two
in which medals were awarded. Introducing professionals is expected
to narrow the gap between Cuba and the rest of the field.
</P>
<P>
   Japan expects to have eight players from its major league teams,
including Seibu Lions pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka. Several Japanese
teams were reluctant to let players go for the Olympics, preferring
to keep them for the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The United States ran into the same problem last year in
choosing players for the Pan Am team that qualified for the Olympic
tournament. Watson said teams have been reluctant again this year
to part with top prospects during September.
</P>
<P>
   ''Teams are in the pennant race,'' Watson said. ''Pitchers,
center fielders, catchers, shortstops -- those guys are hard to come
by.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Suzie McConnell Serio, the Cleveland Rockers'
starting point guard since 1998, is retiring at the end of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   A news release issued on Saturday said McConnell Serio and the
team would not comment until a press conference is held Sunday at
5:15 p.m. EDT, before the team's final regular-season home game
against the Washington Mystics.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell Serio has started all 29 games this year, averaging
5.1 points. She is eighth in the WNBA in assists, averaging 3.8.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-5 guard helped the U.S. basketball team win a gold
medal in the 1988 Olympics and the bronze in '92. McConnell Serio,
married with four kids, was coaching girls high school basketball
when she decided to play professionally again in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's season-finale is Wednesday at Washington. The
Rockers, in second place in the Eastern Conference, have already

<HEADLINE> Rockies 7, Phillies 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Terry Shumpert capped a three-run rally in the
ninth with a two-out, game-winning single as the Colorado Rockies
beat Philadelphia 7-6 Saturday, extending the Phillies' losing
streak to five.
</P>
<P>
   With the Rockies trailing 6-4, Jeff Cirillo hit a one-out double
off Jeff Brantley (1-6) and Todd Helton singled, improving his
NL-leading average to .379 with his third hit of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Hammonds hit a sacrifice fly, pinch-hitter Todd
Hollandsworth singled and Brantley, who blew a save for the fourth
time in 21 chances. walked to Ben Petrick and Todd Walker, forcing
in the tying run. Shumpert singled on an 0-2 fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Jimenez (5-0) got the final out in the top half for the
win.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, which won for just the eighth time in its last 30
games, outhit the Phillies 15-9. Hammonds went 3-for-3 with home
run and two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Phillies starter Randy Wolf, unbeaten in six starts since a June
30 loss to Pittsburgh, allowed five runs and 10 hits in five
innings. Colorado's Brian Bohanon gave up five runs and seven hits
in 6 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia went ahead in the first when Cirillo let Scott
Rolen's grounder to third go through his legs for an error, but
shortstop Tomas Perez's at shortstop allowed the tying run to score
in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bennett homered for a 2-1 lead in the second, but Brian
Hunter retied it with an RBI single in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   Rolen, in a 3-for-32 slump coming in, followed Bobby Abreu's
one-out triple to the wall in left with his 19th homer, putting the
Phillies ahead 4-2 in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Hammonds hit an opposite-field solo homer in the bottom half and
Jeff Frye tied the score with an RBI single in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Glanville's run-scoring single put the Phillies ahead 5-4
in the sixth. Perez homered in the eighth off John Wasdin, his
first career homer batting left-handed and his third overall.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Philadelphia RHP Wayne Gomes pitched a scoreless inning of
relief in a rehab assignment Friday for Triple-A
Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. ... Abreu's third-inning triple was only his
fifth hit in his last 33 at bats. ... Bohanon gave up his first
home run in four starts. ... Flu forced Larry Walker out of the
starting lineup for a second straight day. ... Colorado placed RHP
Giovanni Carrara on the 15-day DL, retroactive to Thursday, with a
sore right elbow and activated LHP Scott Karl from the DL.

<HEADLINE> Mariners 6, Yankees 5  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A trip to the Yankees' pitching doctor didn't
quite cure David Cone's pitching ills.
</P>
<P>
   Cone, back from a 1&AMP;frac12;-week stay at New York's minor league
complex, struggled through six laborious innings and remained
winless since April 28, as the Yankees fell to the Seattle Mariners
6-5 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   After Cone lost his eighth straight decision on July 27, owner
George Steinbrenner banished him to Tampa, Fla., to work with
pitching guru Billy Connors, who helped Dwight Gooden resurrect his
career and Roger Clemens win AL pitcher of the month in July.
</P>
<P>
   Cone, 37, once again tinkered with his mechanics -- throwing more
over the top this time -- but the results weren't much better.
</P>
<P>
   His slider still appeared flat at times and he couldn't put
hitters away. Cone reached two-strike counts on 20 of 28 hitters,
but nine reached safely.
</P>
<P>
   Cone avoided serious damage by holding Seattle to 1-for-7 with
runners in scoring position -- an RBI single by Al Martin in the
third. Alex Rodriguez followed with his 27th homer to make it 3-2,
but that was all Seattle could get until the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Cone avoided his ninth straight loss when Jorge Posada homered
in the seventh, but the Yankees did lose their 13th straight game
started by Cone as Seattle scored three in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Stan Javier led off with a single off Gooden (5-4),
advanced to second on a sacrifice and to third on Rickey
Henderson's single. Mariano Rivera came in and gave up an infield
hit to Martin, a sacrifice fly to Rodriguez and an RBI single to
Edgar Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Tomko (6-3) pitched two innings for the win and Kazuhiro
Sasaki got three outs for his 26th save in 29 chances, giving up a
two-run homer to Posada, who had his sixth career multihomer game.
</P>
<P>
   The sellout crowd of 55,629 was supportive of Cone, giving him a
standing ovation as he walked to the bullpen before the game. They
applauded for every two-strike pitch -- all 52 of them -- and gave
Cone a standing ovation after he struck out Mike Cameron to end the
fifth, the 2,500th of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre, who tries to keep Cone's pitch count below
110, was just as supportive, sending him to pitch the sixth --
despite being at 113 pitches -- in a desperate attempt to get Cone
his first win in 15 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Cone allowed seven hits and five walks, but needed 137 pitches --
the most he has thrown since making 147 in Game 5 of the 1995
playoffs against Seattle -- to make it through six.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees gave Cone a 2-0 lead in the first inning on David
Justice's two-run single off Aaron Sele.
</P>
<P>
   New York could muster only one more runner until the sixth, when
the game got controversial and the Yankees protested.
</P>
<P>
   It began with one out when Paul O'Neill hit a line drive off
Sele's right ankle. The ball deflected in the air to Rodriguez at
shortstop. Because the umpires did not signal an out, Rodriguez
threw to first, pulling John Olerud off the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle manager Lou Piniella argued the play, and it was
overturned after plate umpire Angel Hernandez conferred with crew
chief Mark Hirschbeck and the two apparently saw shoe polish on the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on second and third, Piniella came back out of the
dugout with a trainer to check on Sele. Piniella brought in
left-hander Arthur Rhodes to face lefty Tino Martinez. Rhodes was
not warmed up at the time and was given as much time as he needed
to get ready, sparking the protest.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes got Martinez to ground out, preserving the 3-2 lead. The
Mariners said Sele had a bruised right ankle.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Yankees 2B Chuck Knoblauch missed his third straight game
with a strained right elbow. ... Rodriguez has 17 career homers
against the Yankees, tied with Kansas City for the most he's hit
off any team. ... Cone is 3-15 in 33 starts since pitching a
perfect game against Montreal on July 18, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Prescription Drug Prices Discussed  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL MELLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Northeast lawmakers seeking ways to curb
prescription drug prices discussed banding together to force
manufacturers to lower prices Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the discussion was a Boston University
professor's report suggesting that legislation requiring drug
makers to slash prices would result in increased purchases by
consumers and therefore not cut into the drug manufacturers'
profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may take a few years but if we don't start now we won't get
there. There is no alternative,'' health services professor Alan
Sager, the report's author, told the group.
</P>
<P>
   This year, drug manufacturers will be paid $18 billion for brand
name prescription drugs by private insurers, government programs
and residents of the eight Northeast states, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   A combined $6.5 billion could be saved in the first year by
forcing drug makers to offer prescription drugs at the same lower
prices paid by the federal government, under the Federal Supply
Schedule, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers from New England, New York and Pennsylvania have
been meeting on an ad hoc basis for months.
</P>
<P>
   ''All this association is trying to do is find a way to fair
prices while drug makers are trying to sustain unfair prices,''
Vermont Sen. Peter Shumlin, a Democrat, said Saturday. ''This is a
war we have to win for our constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   Other lawmakers at the meeting took a more conciliatory
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to look at the big picture of health care costs and
why they are so high,'' said Pennsylvania Sen. Timothy F. Murphy, a
Republican. ''We need to find a way to do this without getting any
specific group in the cross hairs.''
</P>
<P>
   The group plans to meet again in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not there yet, but there is agreement that it makes
sense for us to get together,'' Rhode Island's Democratic Lt. Gov.
Charles Fogarty said on Friday. ''With states fighting separate
battles, it is easy for the opposition to overwhelm them.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, 23 percent of the Northeast states'
population had no insurance for prescription drugs, with seniors
making up about one-fifth of that group.
</P>
<P>
   The report, produced at no cost to the association of lawmakers,
suggested the states could jointly negotiate fair profit margins
for drug manufacturers and help finance research on new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Sen. Mark Montigny, a Democrat, said his state
recently passed legislation allowing it to negotiate bulk purchases
of prescription drugs for various government programs, something he
estimated would result in 25 to 35 percent savings.
</P>
<P>
   Fogarty said association members also were looking at Maine's
recent move to negotiate lower prescription prices on behalf of
more than 300,000 uncovered residents. Under the state law, if
negotiations with manufacturers fail to reduce prices
significantly, the state could impose price controls three years
from now. A similar bill failed in Vermont this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States is the world's shock absorber for drug
manufacturers,'' Sager said. ''There is no functioning market to
fix the problem.''

Clinton Vetoes GOP Marriage Tax Cut
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton vetoed a Republican-sponsored tax
cut for married couples today, describing it as ''the first installment of a
fiscally reckless tax strategy'' that would erase projected budget surpluses. He
said the tax break package amounted to little more than a gift to the wealthy.
The legislation passed both the House and the Senate by less than the two-thirds
majorities needed to override Clinton's veto, but a House leader said an
override attempt will be a top priority after Congress' current summer recess.

   SCHOOLCRAFT, Mich. (AP) -- George W. Bush, campaigning by train across an
important midwestern battleground state, today sought to portray rival Al Gore
as both anti-family and timid. The GOP nominee seized on President Clinton's
announcement earlier in the day that he would veto legislation to repeal the
so-called marriage penalty in the tax code. ''Al Gore had a chance to stand up
to President Clinton and say don't veto that bill. But he was silent. He had
nothing to say,'' Bush told a railside rally in East Lansing. Gore, speaking in
Westhampton, N.Y., dismissed Bush's accusations, saying the congressional
proposal would only have benefitted the wealthy.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- David Wells doesn't want to think about winning
the Cy Young Award. He just wants to keep the Toronto Blue Jays in
contention.
</P>
<P>
   Wells became the first 17-game winner in the major leagues this
season and Tony Batista hit his AL-leading 33rd home run Saturday
as the Blue Jays beat the Texas Rangers 8-5.
</P>
<P>
   ''Winning the Cy Young Award means nothing to me at this
point,'' Wells said. ''I don't want to give it any thought.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays closed within 4&AMP;frac12; games of the first-place New York
Yankees in the AL East.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every win is crucial now,'' Wells said. ''Hopefully, we'll get
some help from some other teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells (17-4) allowed just one run before Rusty Greer's three-run
double with two outs in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed eight hits in seven innings, struck out five and
walked one, improving to 2-2 in five starts since the All-Star
break. Wells needs one more win to match his career high, set with
the Yankees in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''He mixed it up a lot, and that's why he's one of the best
pitchers in the game,'' the Rangers' Royce Clayton said.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Koch allowed an RBI single to Rafael Palmeiro in the
ninth, then ended the game by striking out Gabe Kapler with two on
for his 27th save in 31 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Koch, who has converted 16 straight save opportunities, is
sporting a mohawk hairstyle.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a streak for a streak,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto has won three straight at home following five
consecutive losses on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Doug Davis (4-3), making his first start since May 17,
gave up six runs and nine hits in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Consecutive RBI singles by Carlos Delgado, Batista and Jose Cruz
Jr. put Toronto ahead 3-0 in the first
</P>
<P>
   After Chad Curtis hit an RBI single in the third, the Blue Jays
made it 6-1 in the fifth on Delgado's RBI single and Batista's
homer. Alex Gonzlez had an RBI double in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Greer's double cut the Rangers' deficit to 7-4, but Craig
Grebeck hit an RBI double in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Wells has walked just 25 batters this season. ... Howard
Starkman, the Blue Jays head of public relations, scored the game
because the official scorer didn't show up. Doug Hobbs was caught
in traffic caused by a Caribbean festival. ... Kapler extended his
hitting streak to 19 games with a double in the sixth.

<HEADLINE> Soldiers Find Fireline Life Hard  </HEADLINE>
By KELLY TEAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURGDORF, Idaho (AP) -- Sgt. Brad Rhoden traded his M-16 for a
pick and shovel and dug in against a wildfire in the Idaho
mountains, breathing smoke and ash in thin mountain air, sweating
in triple-digit temperatures and trudging up and down rugged
terrain.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hiking is worse than in Bosnia, and the living conditions
are better there,'' Rhoden said as he and nearly 600 others from
Fort Hood, Texas, became the first Army soldiers to begin battling
blazes that have stretched resources thin across the West.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has nothing to do with what I trained for,'' Rhoden said.
''I'm here because my country needs me.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 62,000 wildfires have charred 3.8 million acres so far
this year in what officials are calling the worst Western fire
season in 50 years. Firefighters from states as far away as
Delaware continued to battle 70 large fires active across the West
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Army soldiers, 500 Marines had joined
firefighters in Idaho and a second battalion of Marines arrived in
Idaho on Saturday from Camp Pendleton, Calif. The Forest Service
also announced Friday that 200 additional Canadian firefighters and
500 additional U.S. Army troops were joining the effort.
</P>
<P>
   The White House announced Saturday that President Clinton would
visit military troops fighting wildfires in Idaho on Tuesday. ''The
president wanted to just let the firefighters know how much the
country appreciates what they are doing,'' White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Rhoden and his fellow soldiers were given two days of training
last week, shown how to cut fire lines, dig ditches and create
escape routes, then they were sent Friday to battle a 20,000-acre
fire 25 miles north of McCall in the Payette National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   The fire is far from the biggest in the West -- an Idaho blaze
near the Montana state line has blackened 102,000 acres -- but the
soldiers' presence is allowing experienced Forest Service crews to
tackle other assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Military forces have been sent in as reinforcements to help the
nation's 20,000 civilian wildfire fighters previously, most
recently in 1996. The worst year was 1988, when eight battalions,
57 helicopters and eight air tankers helped battle flames that
ravaged Yellowstone National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Rhoden and several friends talked about their new combat duty
while taking refuge from the hot sun in a relatively spacious mess
tent.
</P>
<P>
   In Idaho for less than a week, their eyes were bloodshot, feet
blistered and grimy uniforms smelled of smoke. When they have had
time for breaks, they've slept in canvas pup tents pitched on
steep, rocky ground. There are only eight showers for the entire
battalion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kuwait wasn't hard compared to this place,'' Staff Sgt. Ian
Campbell said with a wry smile. ''Here you're constantly working.
It's something I haven't seen in a while: Soldiers getting in the
dirt and just working.''
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers had been trudging through thick ash, putting out
embers inside a secured fire line that has been protecting a
settlement of several dozen homes.
</P>
<P>
   Their weapons: 10-pound pulaskis, a combination adz and ax, and
McLeods, a combination shovel and pick that weigh about the same.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd rather have my M-16,'' Rhoden said.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Sylvester Gary had been assigned to fires before and knew
some of what to expect. But struggling up and down an Idaho
mountain was taking a toll.
</P>
<P>
   ''That bad boy was hard on my feet,'' Gary said. ''I thought I
was in shape before I came here.''
</P>
<P>
   But morale is high.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're saving peoples' lives, we're helping safeguard this
property out here,'' said Lt. Col. Darryl Williams, who commands
the task force.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said firefighting gives the soldiers ''a great
opportunity to showcase what the military does best. We're able to
react to a situation very quickly, and we're doing pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't diminish their respect for the civilians who
normally hold this duty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Firefighters are the true American heroes,'' Rhoden said.

<HEADLINE> Huskers Loaded for Title Run  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD ROSENBLATT
<TEXT>
<P>
   As usual, there is no room for error at Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a 12-1 season, the Cornhuskers look mighty enough to
win 'em all this time around and play for another national
championship in the Orange Bowl on Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a great year last year, and we expect a lot out of
ourselves,'' said Eric Crouch, the quarterback who puts the hustle
in the Huskers' offense. ''We have more leadership this year, and
everybody is on the same page.''
</P>
<P>
   In coach Frank Solich's third season since replacing Tom
Osborne, Nebraska starts out No. 1 in The Associated Press
preseason Top 25 poll. Defending champion Florida State is No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   With nine starters back on offense, a solid defense anchored by
linebacker Carlos Polk and a topnotch kicking game, beating the
Huskers will take a Herculean effort.
</P>
<P>
   ''Going 12-1 was a great season, but we didn't finish it off the
way we'd like to,'' Polk said. ''In the preseason, it's very
flattering to be No. 1 or No. 2, but we're still after postseason
No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   The schedule will help. Rough spots come at the end with games
at Kansas State on Nov. 11 and home against Colorado on Nov. 24.
There's Notre Dame on Sept. 9, but the Irish don't look ready to
challenge the Huskers, who should be 9-0 by the time they arrive in
Manhattan, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Texas and Texas A&AMP;M aren't on the schedule, although the
Longhorns will probably be waiting in the Big 12 title game Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Crouch is bigger, stronger and much more confident. A year ago,
he was the backup to Bobby Newcombe, but took over in the third
game after Newcombe was moved to wingback.
</P>
<P>
   ''As soon as we made the switch, we knew right away it was best
for the team,'' Crouch said, referring to a season in which he
became the first quarterback since 1955 to lead the Huskers in
rushing, gaining 889 yards. ''Then it was just like, let's go out
and win games and a national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a 24-20 loss to Texas midway through the season prevented
Nebraska from reaching a title game against Florida State in the
2000 Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1 Crouch added 10 pounds and will play at about 205,
and his right arm is stronger after offseason shoulder surgery. He
threw for 1,269 yards and seven touchdowns, and led the nation's
quarterbacks with 16 rushing TDs.
</P>
<P>
   He better stay healthy. Crouch's backup is redshirt freshman
Jammal Lord, who injured a knee ligament in spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the backfield is loaded. Dan Alexander, Correll
Buckhalter and Dahrran Diedrick return. And there are great
expectations for junior college transfer Thunder Collins, who had
1,548 yards and 23 TDs in 1998 at East Los Angeles JC, but did not
play last season.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever can hold onto the football will get the most playing
time. The Huskers fumbled a school-record 49 times and lost a
school-record-tying 25 of them in last season.
</P>
<P>
   ''To go through the year doing that says a lot about our special
teams and how our offense developed throughout the season,'' Solich
said. ''At the end, I felt comfortable handing the ball off.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Dominic Railoa and guard Russ Hochstein are the top guns
on the offensive line, while wide receiver Matt Davison, tight end
Tracey Wistrom and the always-dangerous Newcombe return to snare
Crouch's passes.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, rebuilding is needed, especially in the secondary
with the departure of the Browns -- Mike and Ralph. And, longtime
coordinator Charlie McBride retired; he was replaced by linebackers
coach Craig Bohl.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Keyuo Craver is back, and Erwin Swiney returns after
missing last season as a medical redshirt. Dion Booker, who became
a starter the last five games of the 1999 season, is the free
safety, and Joe Walker is back at rover and will return punts.
</P>
<P>
   Polk, 6-2, and 250 pounds, is among the top linebackers in the
country, and will carry the load for the Huskers' least experienced
defensive unit.
</P>
<P>
   Along the line, tackle Loran Kaiser and end Kyle Vanden Bosch
return after strong seasons. Sophomore end Demoine Adams is a
rising star on a defense that annually ranks among the stingiest in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Punter Dan Hadenfeldt, granted a sixth year of eligibility by
the NCAA, returns after averaging a school-record 44.98 yards per
kick. Josh Brown made 14 of 20 field goals in his first season.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I want our football team to do is what I want every year,
to be as good as can be,'' Solich said. ''Where that takes us,
we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, the Huskers won national titles in '94 and '95 and
were co-champions with Michigan in '97.

<HEADLINE> Mich. City Settles Federal Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMTRAMCK, Mich. (AP) -- The city was ordered to revamp local
voting procedures in settling a federal lawsuit that accused local
poll workers of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Some Arab-Americans in Hamtramck had complained following last
November's election that poll workers questioned their citizenship
based on physical appearance and English language skills.
</P>
<P>
   A subsequent federal investigation found that Arab-Americans and
''other dark-skinned voters'' were required to take a citizenship
oath prior to being permitted to vote.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reached Friday calls on Hamtramck to ''revamp its
election procedures to ensure that all voters are treated
equally,'' the U.S. Justice Department said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the agreement requires a training program for
election officials; removal of discriminating poll workers;
bilingual election workers; notices of the new practices in several
languages; and federal monitoring of Hamtramck elections.
</P>
<P>
   Hamtramck is a city of about 20,000 near Detroit.

<HEADLINE> Va. Civil Rights Pioneer Honored  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLOUCESTER, Va. (AP) -- A black woman who refused to give up her
bus seat to white passengers in 1944 was honored Saturday as a
civil rights pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   Irene Morgan, 83, was arrested for that action in eastern
Virginia more than a decade before Rosa Parks gained recognition
for also refusing to give up her seat on a bus in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan's case, appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court by then-NAACP
lawyer Thurgood Marshall, resulted in the court striking down
segregation in interstate transportation. Marshall later became the
high court's first black justice.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 200 people packed Gloucester County's historic Colonial
Courthouse on Saturday to honor Morgan. The ceremony is an early
part of the county's 350th anniversary celebration, which will be
held next year.
</P>
<P>
   She dabbed her cheek with a handkerchief when a soloist sang,
''Oh Freedom ... Before I'll be your slave, I'll be buried in my
grave.''
</P>
<P>
   After the ceremony, she told reporters, ''We still have a long
way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   In was a muggy July morning when Morgan, then a young mother,
boarded a Greyhound bus in Hayes Store, took a seat in the back and
headed for home in Baltimore. She was recovering from surgery and
had brought her two children to stay temporarily with her mother in
Gloucester.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles down the road, the bus driver told Morgan to move
because a white couple wanted to occupy her row.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said, 'Well, no,''' recalled Morgan, who now lives on New
York's Long Island. ''That was a seat I had paid for.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, it was illegal in Virginia and nine other states
for blacks to sit next to whites on buses. Morgan was jailed for
refusing to move and for resisting arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said she willingly paid a $100 fine for resisting arrest
because she did kick the Middlesex County sheriff who tried to
remove her from the bus and she did scratch the deputy who took her
to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother posted her $500 bail, but Morgan wouldn't pay a $10
fine and $5.25 in court costs for refusing to give up her seat.
</P>
<P>
   Asked where her courage that day came from, Morgan said simply,
''I can't understand how anyone would have done otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Several speakers Saturday praised Morgan's efforts for fighting
racism.
</P>
<P>
   ''She took a stand not to stand,'' said Dorothy Cooke,
chairperson of the Multicultural Committee for the 350th
celebration. ''As a result of that,'' Cooke said, ''our lives have
never been the same.''

<HEADLINE> Pa. Meat Processor Recalls Beef  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Pennsylvania meat processor is recalling
more than a quarter-million pounds of beef that may be contaminated
with potentially deadly E. coli bacteria, a week after it withdraw
346,700 pounds of suspect ground beef, the Agriculture Department
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The latest recall involves 253,350 pounds of MOPAC brand pure
ground beef, pure ground sirloin, pure ground round and pure ground
chuck, produced by Moyer Packing Co. of Souderton, Pa..
</P>
<P>
   The products were produced on July 19 in 10-pound packages that
bear the establishment number 1311 and the date 07/19/00. They were
shipped in boxes weighing 40 to 60 pounds to wholesalers in New
York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, Virginia,
West Virginia, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The products may have been reground and repackaged at the retail
level, USDA said, and consumers may wish to check with their
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   No illnesses have been reported from this batch, whose recall
was triggered when a sample of reground beef collected July 26 from
a retail store tested positive for E. coli O157:H7, USDA said.
</P>
<P>
   E. coli bacteria can cause bloody diarrhea and dehydration, with
the very young, the elderly and those with weakened immune systems
most in danger of fatal complications.
</P>
<P>
   The first recall, announced July 29, involved 346,700 pounds of
ground beef, distributed at the wholesale level in 5- and 10-pound
packages. They also were suspected of possible E. coli
contamination, but no illnesses were reported.

<HEADLINE> Water-use fight between airport business, town goes to court  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW WINDSOR, N.Y. (AP) - A lawsuit filed by Rifton Aviation
Services would force the town of New Windsor to open the spigot to
their new multimillion-dollar corporate jet hangar at Stewart
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The town locked the valve Thursday, saying Rifton sucked more
than 100,000 gallons of town water into its firefighting pipeline
without permission, leaving leaving several airport hydrants as
well as the airport administration building dry.
</P>
<P>
   Rifton president Christian Domer is going to state Supreme Court
Monday to get a judge to impose an injunction against New Windsor
and state officials so Rifton can get its water flowing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're entitled to the water. It's in our lease with the
state,'' Rifton lawyer Gerald Jacobowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   New Windsor Town Supervisor George Meyers says the water was not
paid for because Rifton has never been able to get its water-use
permit approved and doesn't have a meter on its line.
</P>
<P>
   New Windsor is 47 miles north of Manhattan.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Protest Game  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Yankees protested Saturday's game
against Seattle after umpires allowed Mariners' reliever Arthur
Rhodes unlimited warmup pitches in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy began when Paul O'Neill hit a line drive off the
heel of pitcher Aaron Sele. The ball deflected in the air to
shortstop Alex Rodriguez. Because the umpires did not signal an
out, Rodriguez threw to first, pulling John Olerud off the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle manager Lou Piniella argued the play, and it was
overturned after plate umpire Angel Hernandez conferred with crew
chief Mark Hirschbeck and the two apparently saw shoe polish on the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Tomko started warming up as Piniella said he planned to
replace Sele to start the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   After a double by Bernie Williams and a single by David Justice
put runners on first and third, Piniella came back out of the
dugout with a trainer to check on Sele.
</P>
<P>
   ''I noticed Sele wasn't pushing off,'' Piniella said. ''He
stiffened up pretty good. We just couldn't take a chance on leaving
him in.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella then brought in left-hander Arthur Rhodes -- who was not
warming up -- to face lefty Tino Martinez. Rhodes was given as much
time as he needed to get ready, sparking the protest.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes got Martinez to ground out, preserving the 3-2 lead, as
the Mariners went on to win 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lou wanted to bring the left-hander in and the umpires allowed
it,'' Torre said. ''If I'm not mistaken, he ran off the field. They
allowed him to get away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirschbeck sided with Piniella.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can bring anybody in they want,'' the umpire said.
''We're not doctors. The team took the pitcher out due to injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Sele has a bruised right ankle and expects to make his next
start.

<HEADLINE> Steelers 13, Dolphins 10  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala, seemingly the
forgotten man in Pittsburgh's backfield, scored the Steelers' only
touchdown and set up Kris Brown's winning field goal with a 50-yard
run in a 13-10 comeback preseason victory over the Miami Dolphins
on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins ushered in the post-Dan Marino era by going without
a touchdown until the third quarter, an inept performance offset by
an even more dismal showing by a still-struggling Steelers offense
that finished with minus-5 yards passing.
</P>
<P>
   Fuamatu-Ma'afala provided about the only offensive excitement,
scoring the tying touchdown on a 3-yard run with 6:41 left, then
running 50 yards to the 15 before Brown's 21-yard game-winner with
1:34 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Druckenmiller, projected as Miami's third-team quarterback,
did what starter Damon Huard couldn't, by leading a 78-yard drive
for the game's first touchdown and a 10-3 Dolphins lead at 4:07 of
the third.
</P>
<P>
   Autry Denson broke three tackles on a 26-yard gain on a
third-and-13 swing pass to the Steelers' 23, and Denson later
scored from the 2 for the Dolphins' only lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers' offense, ineffective behind Kordell Stewart and
backup Kent Graham, finally started moving when rookie Tee Martin
of Tennessee took over and began handing off to Fuamatu-Ma'afala.
He gained 122 yards on 15 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Fuamatu-Ma'afala usually is the backup fullback, but played
mostly at running back with Jerome Bettis out with a knee injury
and Richard Huntley playing only a few plays because of an injured
hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Both offenses looked overmatched against the opposing starting
defenses in a first half in which they combined for only 66 passing
yards -- only 2 by the Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins, clearly an altered offense with Dan Marino retired
and former Cowboys coach Chan Gailey now calling the plays,
emphasized running plays and swing passes without much success.
</P>
<P>
   Huard, who apparently won the Dolphins' quarterback derby by
default when Jay Fiedler underwent hip surgery last week, had an
underwhelming debut as Marino's replacement. He was 8-of-14 for 64
yards, rarely testing the Steelers' defense with anything except
short, timing passes.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, coming off two consecutive poor seasons that have
jeopardized his future with the Steelers, was even worse. Rarely
getting time to throw by a blitzing Dolphins defense, he looked
confused and hesitant to throw, going 0-for-6 while generating
offense only by scrambling twice for 29 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, booed frequently last season as the Steelers were swept
at home by their AFC Central rivals, wasn't even out of the first
quarter before hearing his first sustained booing.
</P>
<P>
   His replacement, the slow-afoot Kent Graham, wasn't much better
even against Dolphins defensive backups, finishing 2-for-5 for 19
yards while being sacked four times for 23 yards in losses.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers' only first-half scoring was set up by a 30-yard
pass interference call on Ray Hill that set up Kris Brown's 30-yard
field goal with 11:30 left in the second quarter. Later, a 31-yard
interference call on Orlando Steinauer led to Fuamatu-Ma'afala's
tying score.
</P>
<P>
   It was a significant contrast to last Sunday, when the Steelers
-- aided by four Dallas turnovers -- scored 38 points in the first
half of a 38-10 victory over the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins, looking like a team playing its preseason opener,
tied it at 3 on Olindo Mare's 33-yard field goal at 3:40 following
Leslie Shepherd's 46-yard punt return.
</P>
<P>
   Druckenmiller went 13-of-21 for 141 yards.

<HEADLINE> Rosenfeld Wins US Junior Amateur  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH PLAINS, Ore. (AP) -- Matthew Rosenfeld led from start to
finish Saturday, and beat Ryan Moore 3 and 2 to win the US Junior
Amateur Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Ferrero won the girls title, scoring a 3 and 1 victory over
Ina Kim on the par-72 Witch Hollow Course at Pumpkin Ridge Golf
Club.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfeld, of Plano, Texas, never trailed, but was pushed most
of the way by Moore, a big hitter from Puyallup, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   After losing the first hole, Moore hit a 260-yard 3-wood to
within six feet on the par-5 fourth hole. He then made his putt for
an eagle to even the match.
</P>
<P>
   Moore couldn't hold the momentum, though, as errant tee shots
cost him on the next two holes. Moore came back for a birdie on the
next hole (No. 7) to close Rosenfeld's lead to one, but that would
be as close as Moore would come.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfeld pushed his lead back to 2-up when he sank a difficult
6-foot birdie putt on the 562-yard par-5 eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ''It felt like it was 30 feet,'' Rosenfeld said of his clutch
putt. ''I think 8 was the turning point for the match.''
</P>
<P>
   After halving the next four holes, Rosenfeld took his biggest
lead of the day, at 3-up, when he parred and Moore bogeyed No. 13,
a 381-yard par 4.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfeld immediately gave that hole back, however, when he
lipped out a short par putt on par 3 14th.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought the momentum changed a little bit there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore wasn't so sure, though.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew it wouldn't affect him much because he's such a great
player,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfeld birdied the next hole, the par 5 15th, then halved No.
16 to end the match.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the first time since 1992 that the medalist from the
preliminary rounds went on to win the championship. Rosenfeld also
became the first player to make it to the semifinals in
back-to-back years since Tiger Woods did it in 1992-93.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfeld lost last year to Hunter Mahan, who was ineligible to
play in this year's junior tournament after turning 18.
</P>
<P>
   In the girls' event, Ferrero, of Lodi, Calif., got off to a
great start by winning five of the first six holes. After giving
one back, Ferrero pushed her advantage to 6-up with a par 3 on No.
11.
</P>
<P>
   ''At that point, I knew all I had to do was tie two holes and
win one and I would win the match,'' Ferrero said.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, that pressure didn't bother Kim, of Encino, Calif.,
who won four of the next five holes with birdies and cut Ferrero's
lead to 2-up with two holes to play.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrero ended the comeback with a birdie on the par 4 17th.
</P>
<P>
   She automatically qualified for this week's US Women's Amateur
with the win. Ferrero decided against playing at the tournament, to
be held at Portland's Waverly Country Club. Instead, she will play
in an amateur tournament in the midwest.

<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Afranio Coutinho, a member of the
Brazilian Academy of Letters and a promoter of Brazilian literature
overseas, died Saturday. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Coutinho was named to the prestigious Brazilian Academy of
Letters in 1962 after teaching the country's literature to
generations of students here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   His 1955 study ''Literature in Brazil'' has been translated into
several languages, the academy said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Coutinho was a visiting professor of Brazilian
Literature at Columbia University in New York, where he also
studied in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, he amassed a personal library that served as the
foundation for the Afranio Coutinho Literary Office in Rio, a
research center and library for international and Brazilian
scholars.
Mustafa Mitwali:
</P>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Mustafa Mitwali, a popular Egyptian film and
stage actor, died Saturday of a heart attack. He was 51.
</P>
<P>
   Mitwali starred in several plays with Egypt's popular comedian
Adel Imam, including ''A Witness Who Saw Nothing,'' ''Seyed, the
Servant,'' ''The Leader'' and ''Bodyguard.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitwali started his career in television soap operas and acted
in historical dramas for many years. His first film was ''Bab
Zuweila,'' directed by Nour el-Damerdash.
Helen Quinn:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK -- Helen Quinn, self-appointed manager of the
Metropolitan Opera's standing-room tickets line for 32 years, died
Wednesday of food poisoning. She was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Each Saturday morning, Quinn arrived at the opera house with a
bullhorn and a clipboard. She took charge of the willing crowd of
opera buffs who came to buy that week's allotment of standing-room
tickets, and were then free to trickle off to do anything but wait
in line.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn had been doing this without pay every Saturday since 1968
when she decided one day while standing in line at the Met to put
an end to the bickering.
</P>
<P>
   She saw her first opera, Mozart's ''The Magic Flute,'' while
still in high school in 1943, and became such a fan that she
eventually moved to an apartment on West 57th Street near the Met.

<HEADLINE> Pa. packing firm making second recall of suspect beef  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) - A Pennsylvania meat processor is recalling
more than a quarter-million pounds of beef that may be contaminated
with potentially deadly E. coli bacteria, a week after it withdrew
346,700 pounds of suspect ground beef, the Agriculture Department
said Saturday. Some of the meat was shipped to wholesalers in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The latest recall involves 253,350 pounds of MOPAC brand pure
ground beef, pure ground sirloin, pure ground round and pure ground
chuck, produced by Moyer Packing Co., of Souderton, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The products were produced on July 19 in 10-pound packages that
bear the establishment number 1311 and the date 07/19/00. They were
shipped in boxes weighing 40 to 60 pounds to wholesalers in New
Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, Virginia,
West Virginia, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The products may have been reground and repackaged at the retail
level, USDA said, and consumers may wish to check with their
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   No illnesses have been reported from this batch, whose recall
was triggered when a sample of reground beef collected July 26 from
a retail store tested positive for E. coli O157:H7, USDA said.
</P>
<P>
   E. coli bacteria can cause bloody diarrhea and dehydration.
People who are very young, the elderly and those with weakened
immune systems are most in danger of fatal complications.
</P>
<P>
   The first recall, announced July 29, involved 346,700 pounds of
ground beef, distributed at the wholesale level in 5- and 10-pound
packages. They also were suspected of possible E. coli
contamination, but no illnesses were reported.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Power Grid Strained  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Three power plants failed late last week
during California's extended heat wave, sapping the state's power
reserves and prompting officials to declare a low-level emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The plant failures -- one in Northern California on Thursday and
two in Southern California on Friday -- weren't noticed by consumers
because other plants took up the slack, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the outages pushed the state's power reserves below 7
percent, forcing the agency that manages the power grid to impose a
stage-one emergency Friday. Stage one is the lowest level of
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, California Independent System Operator
declared stage-two alerts, which result in voluntary reductions by
large electricity customers. A stage-two alert occurs when reserves
fall below 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   California has never had a stage-three emergency, declared when
reserves fall below 1.5 percent, but it came perilously close
Tuesday and Wednesday, as heavy demand strained resources across
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Power plants went without routine maintenance under a five-day,
''no-touch'' directive. The order, which has been issued at least
17 times this year, prohibits all but emergency repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the outages are indicative of a system which has
been pushed to capacity for a long time, by hot weather, a growing
population and heavy demand from industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''This very much demonstrates the fact that we have been running
this system hard for more than two months,'' agency spokesman
Patrick Dorinson said. ''That's taken a toll, not only on the power
plants, but also on the operators and everyone else.''

<HEADLINE> Lehman Withdraws From International  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASTLE ROCK, Colo. (AP) -- Tied for fourth place at the halfway
point and visibly limping on an injured right knee, Tom Lehman
withdrew from The International on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He was scheduled to undergo an MRI for a possible torn
cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, seventh on the PGA Tour money list this season, limped
noticeably while walking down the fairway from the No. 10 tee box
on Friday. Moments earlier, he had hit an awkward shot from behind
the ninth green that cost him a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman was unable to finish his second round because of a
lightning delay late Friday. He played the final two holes of his
second round Saturday morning, then withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was OK for the first 20 or 22 holes, then I felt it and
struggled the rest of the way,'' Lehman said. ''My knee started to
swell, and after my round this morning I had it drained. It swelled
back up, however, and I just do not feel I need to take any chances
on these hills.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, I'm disappointed because I was playing really well
for those first 20 or so holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, the first-round co-leader with 15 points, had 23 points
after two rounds. He trailed second-round leader Ernie Els by 11
points under the modified Stableford scoring system used in this
event.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   LEFTY IS LURKING: Phil Mickelson, the International's only
two-time champion, stands eight points out of the lead entering the
final round -- a margin he admits is formidable but not
insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, being way back, I understand it is going to be
difficult and it is unlikely,'' Mickelson said of Ernie Els' lead.
''But tomorrow I feel like if I get hot, make some birdies and
possibly an eagle or two, I may be able to catch him.
</P>
<P>
   ''He knows if he goes out and plays solid golf, makes the
birdies on the par-5s, an odd birdie here or there, he is going to
be almost uncatchable.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson likes the fact he has been able to shoot at every pin
on the course because of the soft greens.
</P>
<P>
   ''There really hasn't been one pin that I have not tried to go
after,'' he said. ''So it won't alter the way I'm playing. I just
need to get hot with the putter and give myself a lot of
opportunities. I'm going to be ultra-aggressive trying to make
eagles. The format allows you to make up ground quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson made a miracle birdie on the 13th hole Saturday after
driving behind trees and pitching out short of the green. He
chipped in, moving to 28 points.
</P>
<P>
   He also appeared to have driven into a creek on the 17th hole
but got a break.
</P>
<P>
   ''The marshal told me my ball hit a rock in the stream and just
skipped it right across,'' he said. ''I was able to advance it by
the green and get up and down (for birdie). I was very fortunate
there.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   SERGIO SURGES: Sergio Garcia, the 20-year-old Spaniard who has
had an up-and-down season, moved up the leaderboard with a
nine-point round for a total of 30.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still there,'' Garcia said. ''We need a really good run
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia scrambled to make a birdie after someone apparently
stepped on his ball just off the 18th fairway.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure somebody did, but nobody wanted to admit it,'' Garcia
said. ''If you throw 20 balls, you're not going to get a lie like
that. The grass is lined toward the fairway. I don't know how a
ball coming across the grass can be lying so down, and there was a
little mark on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ''My dad (Victor) was there and he said the ball wasn't lying
like that, but the referees didn't believe my dad. My dad is a
professional golfer. He's never cheated, and I don't think he's
going to cheat for me.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I was able to get over that and hit a great shot and make
a beautiful putt. I hit a hard 7-iron, 179 yards into the wind. It
was a hell of a shot.''

<HEADLINE> Covention Protesters Claim Abuse  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER BROWN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Activists say the detention center is filled
with screams, that a man was handcuffed in a crucifix-position to
force him to submit to fingerprinting, and that a woman on a hunger
strike writhed on the floor from lack of water and food.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia police deny the accusations and say they have
treated the nearly 400 protesters arrested during the Republican
National Convention fairly. Civil-rights attorneys who visited the
detention center said they found no evidence to confirm abuse.
</P>
<P>
   However, dozens of protesters told similar stories after their
releases beginning Thursday afternoon. Some younger activists
appeared visibly shaken, while even veteran protesters sounded
weary and worried.
</P>
<P>
   ''I reacted by just collapsing in fright,'' said longtime
activist Paul Davis of Philadelphia ACT UP, the nation's largest
chapter of the AIDS advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested 391 protesters during six days of
sometimes-violent demonstrations coinciding with the convention,
which ended Thursday. More than 200 remained in a detention center
Saturday, most charged in connection with brawls with police and
traffic-blocking demonstrations that left 15 officers injured,
including the police commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Officials praised police for restraint during the convention
that contrasted accusations of brutality, corruption and racism
going back to the 1970s, including the 1985 bombing of a West
Philadelphia rowhouse where an anarchistic organization operated
and the July 12 videotaped police beating of a carjacking subject.
</P>
<P>
   Among those held in jail are prominent leaders John Sellers of
Berkeley, Calif.-based Ruckus Society and Kate Sorenson of
Philadelphia Direct Action Group, who are being held on $1 million
bail though they are charged with misdemeanors. Philadelphia ACT UP
leader Terrence McGuckin was held on $500,000 bail for
misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters complain that medical attention was denied, food and
water was not made available for 18 hours, and that cells were so
crowded some detainees were unable to move.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw one individual who was cuffed to his open cell door with
metal cuffs, in the cross-position. Police would move them up and
try to get him to agree to be fingerprinted. This went on for 10 to
15 minutes where he was screaming,'' said Davis, who was released
late Friday. ''I saw several people hog-tied with plastic
handcuffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Activist Jeff Ebbsen, 38, of Philadelphia told The Daily News he
saw a female police officer grab a male inmate by his genitals to
make him move.
</P>
<P>
   Two attorneys affiliated with the American Civil Liberties Union
toured the detainment center and said they saw no evidence to
substantiate the complaints, though they did not reject the
possibility of mistreatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's highly unlikely, the kinds of things that have
been described,'' Philadelphia ACLU legal director Stefan Presser
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia defense attorney Jules Epstein called the cells
''Dickensian, but not unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said protesters have been uncooperative but no
mistreatment has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of the protesters had to be carried to the arraignment.
Some had to be carried to be fingerprinted,'' Deputy Commissioner
Thomas Nestel said. ''They are being treated fairly.''

<HEADLINE> Kane Leads Michelob Light Classic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUREKA, Mo. (AP) -- Lorie Kane fired a 6-under-par 66 to take the
lead after the second round of the LPGA Michelob Light Classic on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Kane, who has never won on the LPGA tour, played her second
bogey-free round at Fox Run Golf Club to put her at 10-under for
the tournament and give her a two-shot lead over Rosie Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Kane had six birdies, highlighted by a chip from the fringe on
the 18th hole. Kane is the only player in the field not to have
made a bogey through two rounds of the 54-hole event.
</P>
<P>
   Jones shot her second consecutive 68 to claim sole possession of
second place at 8-under. Jones birdied two of her last three holes
to shave Kane's lead in half.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Dee is in third at 7-under.
</P>
<P>
   The group tied for fourth, a shot behind Dee, is led by Jeong
Jang of Korea who shot 65 on Saturday to tie the course record.
Also at 6-under is Michelle Estill who shot 68.
</P>
<P>
   Kane, 18th on the LPGA money list, has finished second nine
times in her five-year professional career. She finished second in
February at the Australian Lady Masters for her best finish this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Kane opened the second round tied for fourth and after making
two birdies on the front nine, she closed with a rush to seize a
commanding lead. She birdied three of her last four holes,
including her birdie chip on 18, to distance herself from the
field.
</P>
<P>
   The final round will mark the first time Kane has held sole
possession of the lead entering a final round. Kane finished third
in last year's Michelob Light Classic.
</P>
<P>
   The first-round leaders, Pat Hurst, Kristi Albers and Rachel
Hetherington, had their problems Saturday. Hurst was at 5-under
after shooting even par, and Albers and Hetherington shot 1-over
73s to finish at 4-under.
</P>
<P>
   The much anticipated shootout between the top two players on the
LPGA money list, Karrie Webb and Anika Sorenstam, never
materialized Saturday. The marquee players on the LPGA tour started
the day at even-par and finished the second round tied at 3-under.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam is attempting to win the tournament for the fourth
consecutive year. The previous three tournaments were held at
Forest Hills Country Club in nearby St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Play was delayed in the morning for 66 minutes because of
lightning and rain.
</P>
<P>
Divots: Jang equaled the course record set by Michael Campbell.
Campbell, who competes on the European PGA Tour, set the mark in
the final round of the 1994 St. Louis Open. ... Melinda
Daniels-Price had a hole-in-one on the fourth hole. ... Amy Benz
withdrew after playing nine holes Saturday, and Liz Earley withdrew
before the start of the second round.

   FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- Wold Harris scored in the 88th minute to
pull the New England Revolution to a 1-1 tie with the Columbus Crew
on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Warzycha scored for Columbus four minutes earlier,
getting his sixth goal of the season on a free kick from 22 yards
out on the left side.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus (10-11-5) has lost just once in its last seven matches.

Sunsing in the penalty area.
</P>
<P>

Clinton To Visit Western Fires Area
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton will visit military troops
fighting forest fires in the West next week, the White House said today. Clinton
plans a trip Tuesday to Boise, Idaho, where he will get a briefing on the status
of firefighting efforts, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said. Clinton also
is slated to make a second stop closer to the front lines of a fire in Idaho,
where he will meet some of the troops sent in to relieve exhausted civilian
firefighters. Across the West, about 70 large fires were burning today on more
than 747,100 acres, according to the National Fire Information Center.

Bush Attacks Gore for Clinton Veto

   SCHOOLCRAFT, Mich. (AP) -- George W. Bush, campaigning by train across an
important midwestern battleground state, today sought to portray rival Al Gore
as both anti-family and timid. The GOP nominee seized on President Clinton's
announcement earlier in the day that he would veto legislation to repeal the
so-called marriage penalty in the tax code. ''Al Gore had a chance to stand up
to President Clinton and say don't veto that bill. But he was silent. He had
nothing to say,'' Bush told a railside rally in East Lansing. Gore dismissed
Bush's accusations, saying the congressional proposal would only have benefitted
the wealthy.

<HEADLINE> President Visits Kennedy Compound  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HYANNIS PORT, Mass. (AP) -- Two days after George W. Bush accused
him of a failure of leadership, President Clinton said Saturday
night that Republicans had run America into a ditch in 1992 and ''I
have done everything I could to turn the country around.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''Do not blow this election. The best is still out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech that helped raise more than $800,000 for Maryland
Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, one of the Kennedy family's
rising political stars, Clinton also said that if Bush's
tax-reduction program succeeds there will be no money left for the
rest of the country's needs, including defense and fixing Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   He told his audience that the help of all Democrats is needed to
deny Republicans an election victory in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important that you do your job now and that we not sit on
our laurels won over the last eight years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I listened to a lot of those guys at the (Republican)
convention,'' he said. ''It sounded to me like they thought I had
interrupted the ordinary flow of things when I got elected.
</P>
<P>
   ''You didnt have to be a genius in 1992 to know that the country
was in a real ditch and if you were going to get out of it it was
going to take some real thought,'' he said. ''I have done
everything I could in seven and a half years to turn the country
around.''
</P>
<P>
   And without referring to Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney
by name, he said, ''No one is entitled to any of these jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe that anybody is entitled to serve but I
believe that before any one serves people have to believe they know
what they are doing,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   On his first visit to the storied vacation compound, Clinton
took a tour courtesy of Townsend, a daughter of the late Robert F.
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   His first stop was the shingled house used by John F. Kennedy
during his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Expected to seek the Democratic nomination for governor in 2002,
Townsend is a leader in the centrist Democratic Leadership
Conference, a group close to Clinton's heart.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing Clinton, Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., said he should
be considered for the Nobel peace prize for his efforts at Camp
David to broker peace in the Middle East. And referring to the last
eight years of economic growth, Kennedy said, ''Thank You Mr.
Strong Economy President.''
</P>
<P>
   Guests were paying $2,000 to $4,000 to attend the party, the
most lucrative of four scheduled this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The other three events were to benefit Hillary Clinton's Senate
campaign in New York and were expected to raise an estimated
$525,000.
</P>
<P>
   After a morning of golf on Martha's Vineyard, the Clinton
family's favorite vacation spot, Clinton bought a double-dip
raspberry and peaches-and-cream cone at Mad Martha's ice cream
store in Vineyard Haven, then stuffed some cash into the tip jar
and walked outside. There he handed what was left of his cone to
his Labrador retriever, Buddy, and said as the dog wolfed it down
in one gulp: ''Gotta share.''
</P>
<P>
   An afternoon round of golf behind him, Clinton and daughter
Chelsea, stopped the presidential motorcade at a bookstore in the
town of Vineyard Haven. Clinton bought three books, including, at
his daughter's suggestion, ''From Dawn to Decadence,'' French-born
historian Jacques Barzun's masterpiece about what he considers the
decline of Western culture since the Renaissance and Reformation

<HEADLINE> Fusion 3, United 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Diego Serna's goal two minutes into
the second half broke a 1-1 tie and helped the Miami Fusion beat
D.C. United 3-1 in an MLS match Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Lassiter secured Miami's victory with a goal in the 90th
minute as the Fusion broke United's season-best two-game winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Serna's game-winner and eighth goal of the season was set up
when Martin Machon headed a one-bounce pass to an open Serna, who
headed in a shot over D.C. goalkeeper Mark Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   United almost tied the match in the 62nd minute, but Bobby
Convey's shot, which looked like it was headed into the upper
left-hand corner of Miami's goal, got blocked by Fusion goalkeeper
Nick Rimando's diving deflection.
</P>
<P>
   Lassiter, who entered the match at the 82nd minute, kicked in an
uncontested shot just outside the 6-yard box after receiving a
crossing pass from Jay Heaps.
</P>
<P>
   The victory improved Miami's record to 8-11-5 and 29 points,
third in the MLS Eastern Division
</P>
<P>
   Defending league champion United is 6-14-6 with 24 points,
fourth in the East.
</P>
<P>
   Miami scored first on Jim Rooney's goal at the 20th minute. Jay
Heaps sent Rooney a crossing pass from the right wing and Rooney
kicked in a shot from 8 yards which beat Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Fusion's early goal, United controlled play for most
of the first half and finally came through at the 33rd minute on
Jaime Moreno's 12th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Carey Talley's pass from 10 yards inside the midfield stripe
found Moreno inside the 6-yard box, where he headed in a shot past
Rimando.

''This is a very sad day for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in the event's 21-year history that a

<HEADLINE> Unions, Verizon continue contract talks  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Hours ahead of a midnight strike deadline, a
union negotiator said Saturday that 87,200 telephone workers in 12
states from Maine to Virginia likely would walk off the job early
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A strike would delay repairs, new service orders, directory
assistance and billing inquiries for 25 million customers of
Verizon Communications, the nation's largest local and wireless
telephone company that was formed in June by the merger of Bell
Atlantic and GTE Corp.
</P>
<P>
   It would not disrupt regular telephone service, 911 emergency
service or Verizon's fast-growing wireless operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Communications Workers of America, which represents about
72,500 Verizon workers, and the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers, which represents 14,700 more, have authorized a
strike at 12:01 a.m. EDT Sunday, when the unions' contract with
Verizon expires.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, it looks like there is no chance of a settlement by
midnight tonight,'' union negotiator Vince Maisano told about 50
workers at a mid-afternoon rally outside the hotel where contract
talks were taking place. ''The company is not really serious about
its employees, who have built this company.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations continued late into the night with one company
official expressing hope they would go past midnight if necessary
to reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are here, we are talking, we are hoping the union will
continue to talk even after the strike deadline - through the night
and into tomorrow, as long as it takes,'' said Verizon spokesman
Eric Rabe.
</P>
<P>
   But told reporters Verizon managers would ''work very long
hours, seven days a week'' taking over customer service jobs if a
strike did occur.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll do whatever we have to do to provide service in the face
of the strike,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rabe said the company was not considering hiring nonunion
workers to fill strikers' slots, but added that ''anything's
possible'' were a strike to continue for an extended period.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon says its needs flexibility deciding what it pays
wireless workers in the rapidly emerging field. Verizon on Friday
submitted a proposed five-year contract that included a 3.5 percent
annual raise and various workplace concessions.
</P>
<P>
   The company says the proposed contract did not cover the unions'
request for an easier way to unionize wireless workers because
Verizon owns only 55 percent of the wireless operation, which is a
separate company run through a joint venture with Vodafone
AirTouch.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials want assurances the company will let union
workers take jobs in the expanding wireless operation and will give
the unions more opportunity to organize the 32,000 current wireless
workers, virtually all of whom are nonunion.
</P>
<P>
   Along with higher wages and concessions on working conditions
and job security, the unions also want Verizon to stop contracting
work in other rapidly growing areas, such as installation of
Internet service lines, to nonunion companies.
</P>
<P>
   Maisano said the major stumbling block was Verizon's refusal to
allow union workers to take jobs in the wireless operation and to
end contracts with nonunionized companies.
</P>
<P>
   Union members in the company's conventional telephone operation
lose union benefits if they take jobs in Verizon's wireless
operation.
</P>
<P>
   The unions want Verizon to allow organization of wireless
workers through a ''card check,'' an informal process labor leaders
say is less cumbersome than representation elections, which can
take months.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials say the company must also raise union wages and
improve job security and stop forcing employees to work overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The states involved are Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Delaware,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia, along with the
District of Columbia.

<HEADLINE> Wash. Sheriff's Deputy Fatally Shot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ANGELES, Wash. (AP) -- A sheriff's deputy responding to a
domestic violence call and possible hostage situation was fatally
shot Saturday on the porch of a home, a sheriff's spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators were trying to talk the alleged shooter, a man in
his 50s, into surrendering late Saturday. He was still in the home
and it wasn't clear whether he had any hostages, sheriff's
spokesman Jim Borte said.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Davis, 48, a deputy with the Clallam County Sheriff's
Department, was found shot in the head outside the house just
outside this coastal city on the Olympic Peninsula, about 60 miles
northwest of Seattle. He had responded to a domestic violence call
from a neighbor, Borte said.
</P>

   Police said they had heard other muffled sounds that could have
been gunshots but could not immediately confirm whether more shots
were fired.

<HEADLINE> Stowaway Man in Fair Condition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A man who survived a freezing flight pinched
in the wheel well of a jumbo jet was hospitalized Saturday in fair
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Little was known about the 6-foot, 180-pound adult, who was
pulled Thursday from an Air France Boeing 747 that originated in
Papeete, French Polynesia. University of California, Los Angeles
Medical Center officials would not say Saturday when the man would
be released.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is conscious and alert although he has not been speaking.
Attempts are being made to identify him but at this point we do not
know his name, age, or country of origin. The Immigration and
Naturalization Service and other agencies are working to identify
the patient,'' the hospital said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Brain and organ function tests were being run to determine
whether oxygen deprivation had affected him. The man's core body
temperature was 79 degrees when he arrived at the UCLA Medical
Center for treatment of hypothermia and dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   INS agents on Friday interviewed the man but would not publicly
reveal what, if any, information he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Civil aviation authorities in Tahiti said Saturday that the man
had donned a stolen ground personnel uniform to gain access to the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Airline stowaways have survived other such ordeals in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo airport officials said a lightly dressed, frostbitten
Chinese man was pulled alive from a wheel well after a three-hour
flight from Shanghai in 1998. Also in 1998, a man who hid in an
Iberia Airlines jetliner traveling from Honduras to Miami staggered
from the DC-9's left rear wheel well wearing jeans and a
short-sleeved shirt. The 23-year-old was disoriented but not
hospitalized.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Jokes At Kennedy Compound  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HYANNIS PORT, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton, making his first
visit to the fabled Kennedy family compound, raised eyebrows about
a supposed flirtation with one clan member even as he was raising
campaign cash for another.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton joked that he really wasn't there to raise money for
Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend's gubernatorial
campaign, but to see her mother, family matriarch Ethel Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The president startled the crowd when he said he would like to
stay overnight at Ethel's house -- and have the newspapers write
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ethel, you may have to put me up tonight -- and if so that
would tickle me, because Ethel's been sending me these raunchy
Valentine cards for years -- and I'm completely in love with her,''
the president said as the audience giggled.
</P>
<P>
   ''And I keep trying to get some tabloid to write something
sleazy about it, and I haven't been able to so far,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton did not linger when his speech was over.
</P>
<P>
   He flew directly back to the island of Martha's Vineyard off the
Massachusetts coast, his headquarters for a weekend fund-raising
whirlwind.
</P>
<P>
   His schedule included two fund-raisers on Martha's Vineyard on
Sunday for his wife, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is
running for a U.S. Senate seat from New York.

Clinton Vetoes GOP Marriage Tax Cut
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton vetoed a Republican-sponsored tax
cut for married couples today, describing it as ''the first installment of a
fiscally reckless tax strategy'' that would erase projected budget surpluses. He
said the tax break package amounted to little more than a gift to the wealthy.
The legislation passed both the House and the Senate by less than the two-thirds
majorities needed to override Clinton's veto, but a House leader said an
override attempt will be a top priority after Congress' current summer recess.

Japan Recalls Atomic Bombing
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HIROSHIMA, Japan (AP) -- In a solemn annual rite, Japan paused Sunday to
recall the day 55 years ago when the dropping of a U.S. atomic bomb ''created a
hell on earth.'' Broken only by the steady chirping of cicadas and the tolling
of a bell, 60 seconds of silent prayer commenced at 8:15 a.m. -- the exact
moment the bomb exploded above Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945. Many in attendance on
the grounds of Peace Memorial Park bowed their heads, while some held Buddhist
prayer beads. The city of Hiroshima estimated that 50,000 people attended the
event, but police put the number at 30,000.

his campaign said today. The vice president and former senator of Tennessee will
travel from his hometown of Carthage through southern and Midwest states, with a
''handing of the baton'' to Gore from President Clinton in Michigan on Aug. 15,
spokesman Chris Lehane said. He then heads to the convention, Aug. 14 through

Clinton To Visit Western Fires Area
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton will visit military troops
fighting forest fires in the West next week, the White House said today. Clinton
plans a trip Tuesday to Boise, Idaho, where he will get a briefing on the status
of firefighting efforts, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said. Clinton also
is slated to make a second stop closer to the front lines of a fire in Idaho,
where he will meet some of the troops sent in to relieve exhausted civilian
firefighters. Across the West, about 70 large fires were burning today on more
than 747,100 acres, according to the National Fire Information Center.

Presidential Traits Examined
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George and Al take note: A team of psychologists has
determined that great presidents tend to be take-charge guys. They are smart,
energetic and assertive, but not necessarily likable or straightforward.
''Agreeableness is highly desirable in a neighbor or spouse,'' the researchers
concluded. But when it comes to ranking the great national leaders,
''disagreeable presidents do somewhat better.'' Steven J. Rubenzer described the
research, which he conducted with Thomas J. Faschingbauer of Richmond, Texas and
Deniz S. Ones of the University of Minnesota. The three consulted with 115
presidential historians who helped rate the nation's 41 presidents on a complex,
600-question psychological scale.

India Blames Pakistan for Killings

   SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- Calling for a major overhaul of India's internal
anti-terrorism system, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee blamed Pakistan on
Saturday for a series of attacks that killed 102 people in Kashmir. Vajpayee
accused India's neighbor of everything from indulging in carnage like the
Kashmir killings earlier this week and planning bomb attacks on Christian
churches to ordering the circulation of fake currency notes and aiding a
festering insurgency in the remote northeastern states.

Morgan, 83, was arrested for that action in eastern Virginia more than a decade
before Rosa Parks gained recognition for also refusing to give up her seat on a

winless since April 28, as the Yankees fell to the Seattle Mariners 6-5. Cone,
37, once again tinkered with his mechanics -- throwing more over the top this

<HEADLINE> Fire Closes Mesa Verde Again  </HEADLINE>
By P. SOLOMON BANDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA VERDE NATIONAL PARK, Colo. (AP) -- A wildfire at the
nation's largest archaeological preserve swelled to 4,400 acres
Saturday and was burning on a mesa near several ancient cliff
dwellings.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the locations of the major cliff dewellings and lack
of vegetation around them, they aren't believed to be in danger
from the flames, said Rob Morrison of the Durango interagency
dispatch center.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're down in a canyon and there is no way for the fire to
get in there,'' he said. ''It's all rock and sand.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the park, the fire had burned picnic tables, a
shuttle bus pavilion and restrooms by Saturday evening, as well as
some canopies erected over ruins to protect them from weather, said
Randy Burgess, a spokesman for the firefighting team. Fire
commanders did not know whether any of the ruins under the canopies
had been damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, the fire was 1&AMP;frac12; miles from Mesa Verde's research
center, where artifacts from ancient Southwest cultures are kept,
and at a museum, park headquarters, and moving toward them, said
Dave Steinke of the fire management team.
</P>
<P>
   Crews were busily clearing away flammable materials and
installing external sprinkler systems at the buildings and employee
housing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new blaze was sparked Wednesday by lightning on the Ute
Mountain Ute Reservation southwest of the park, and the flames
quickly spread. Two hundred firefighters were on the scene Saturday
and 150 more were expected Sunday, Burgess said.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa Verde National Park was closed indefinitely on Friday, just
12 hours after it had reopened following a 10-day, 23,000-acre
blaze.
</P>
<P>
   None of the park's ancient Indian dwellings was damaged by the
earlier fire, but tourist traffic dwindled and local businesses
suffered. More than a third of the 52,000-acre park burned during
the 10-day blaze.

<HEADLINE> Smoke Veils Areas of Montana  </HEADLINE>
By BECKY BOHRER
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMILTON, Mont. (AP) -- Choking smoke veiled homes and businesses
here Saturday as flames turned forest to ash a few miles away in
one of dozens of blazes that have made Montana a leading hot spot
on the West's fire map.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Northern Rockies area is the hottest place in the country
at the moment, and it's mostly Montana,'' said Lynn Pisano-Pedigo,
spokeswoman at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise,
Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is expected to tour the area Tuesday and speak
with some of the more than 1,500 military troops who have been sent
in to help exhausted civilian fire crews, the White House announced
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president wanted to just let the firefighters know how
much the country appreciates what they are doing,'' White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said. Lockhart said Clinton planned to stop
in Idaho, but he didn't say whether he would announce new grants or
additional assistance from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Across the West on Saturday, about 70 large fires were burning
on more than 747,100 acres, according to the National Fire
Information Center. The biggest, in Idaho, had charred at least
102,000 acres near the Montana border.
</P>
<P>
   Montana's 16 largest fires had burned about 135,000 acres by
Saturday, and smaller fires had blackened thousands more.
</P>
<P>
   ''Montana may not have the greatest amount of acreage, but it
has more new (fire) starts and more severe weather, lightning going
through,'' Pisano-Pedigo said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The weather system hasn't changed significantly in the last
couple of weeks,'' she said. ''You do have the summer
thunderstorms. But unfortunately, there isn't a lot of moisture
connected with these. You get a lot of dry lightning.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 homes have been evacuated in southwestern
Montana's Bitterroot Valley, where more than 54,000 acres of the
national forest have burned. And officials in the Hamilton area
warned Saturday that more than 300 additional evacuations could be
necessary. North of Missoula, 20 firefighters were struggling to
contain one of the state's smaller fires, a 6,000-acre blaze
threatening 13 homes on the Flathead reservation.
</P>
<P>
   At an entrance to Hamilton, a sign reads: ''Thank you
firefighters,'' enclosed in a heart. Another sign nearby tells
people where to find evacuation centers if fire should threaten the
town.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm basing my concern on the attitudes of people around me,''
resident Vicki Lawson said Saturday at a coin-operated laundry near
her home here. ''Obviously, I don't sense much panic.''
</P>
<P>
   A health alert was issued for the Hamilton area advising people
to stay indoors because of the heavy smoke. In Helena, dense smoke
from fires south of the city obscured the Capitol dome.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, more than 62,000 wildfires, mostly in the
West, have burned 3.8 million acres. Assistant Interior Secretary
Sylvia Baca has called it the worst fire season in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian fire teams are already working in the Northern Rockies
alongside hundreds of Army soldiers and Marines sent in to help
weary civilian fire crews, and officials expect more Canadians to
be battling fires there by Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone has a high degree of concern about the forest,'' said
Forest Hayes, mayor of Darby, Mont. Solitude and scenery have led
people to live in wooded areas away from town, he said, but the
trade off is a measure of risk when fire danger rises.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the West, a blaze 15 miles east of Jackson, Wyo.,
threatened several homes and cabins, but requests for more
firefighters and planes to drop retardant were denied because of
demand elsewhere, said Forest Service spokeswoman Mary Tyler. Some
200 people had been evacuated, many for four nights.
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming got some rain from fast-moving thunderstorms Friday
afternoon, but ''it was not enough rain to really be of any help to
the firefighters,'' Tyler said. ''We would need several inches to
help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado was closed again by another
rapidly spreading blaze on Friday, just hours after it had reopened
after a 10-day, 23,000-acre fire. The latest fire in the nation's
largest archaeological preserve had blacked 4,400 acres near some
of the park's most popular sites by Saturday and was threatening a
research center, headquarters and museum.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no threat to the cliff dwellings,'' said Rob Morrison
of the Durango, Colo., interagency dispatch center. ''They're down
in a canyon and there is no way for the fire to get in there.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, a 73,000-acre blaze that has raged near Sequoia
National Forest was 80 percent contained Saturday, freeing up
firefighters and equipment to be diverted to other locations, said
Lee Bentley, a fire information officer for the U.S. Forest
Service.

<HEADLINE> Swann Files Grievance On Arizona  </HEADLINE>
By JENNA FRYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Eric Swann has filed a $3.5 million
grievance against the Arizona Cardinals concerning the way he was
released.
</P>
<P>
   Swann's agent, Steve Zucker, said Saturday that the defensive
end contends he was injured when Arizona released him last month
and therefore should not have been let go.
</P>
<P>
   Swann, now with the Carolina Panthers, has arthritic knees and
has undergone seven knee operations during his career.
</P>
<P>
   ''When a player is injured he should not be released, and if he
is, he is entitled to compensation,'' Zucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Under NFL rules, Swann had 25 days after his release to file the
grievance. He beat the deadline by one day when Zucker filed the
complaint late Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The action means the Cardinals automatically must set aside
$1.75 million -- half the amount Swann is seeking -- until the
grievance is resolved. The money counts against Arizona's salary
cap.
</P>
<P>
   Swann, 29, will also file a worker's compensation suit against
Arizona -- and possibly a malpractice suit -- next week, Zucker said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The team hasn't seen the complaint,'' Cardinals spokesman Paul
Jensen said. ''It's a Management Council issue. All comment should
come from them, not from the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The worker's compensation suit will center around claims that
Swann was forced to play when he was too injured and Arizona
routinely questioned the severity of Swann's knee problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had him come back too early after surgeries, and they
said some things like he wasn't hurt as bad as he was saying,''
Zucker said. ''And in reality, he was hurt worse than he was
saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Zucker was talking much differently just before Swann was
released by Arizona. At that time, Zucker criticized the Cardinals
for not releasing Swann sooner and made no mention of his client
being injured.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a little frustrating,'' Zucker told Tribune, a newspaper
serving the east Phoenix suburbs. ''All indications are that
they're going to release Eric. And if they're going to do it, why
don't they do it?''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Zucker said the Cardinals' delay in releasing Swann
only made the situation worse.
</P>
<P>
   ''They made statements that they were going to release him and
we wanted it to be as soon as possible,'' Zucker said. ''The sooner
they released him, the faster Eric could move on and leave Arizona
on good terms. But they dragged it on and took their time to
release him and it ended up he didn't leave on good terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Swann signed a one-year deal with Carolina two weeks after
Arizona released him for the league minimum for veterans. Zucker
said Swann's knee problems prevented him from passing Carolina's
physical, but Swann agreed to sign a waiver that allows him to play
for the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   He said Swann's willingness to do so showed how bad he wants to
play football, something he claimed was questioned in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ''His agreeing to play for this amount of money, and to sign a
waiver against injury, really shows his desire to play for
Carolina,'' Zucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Swann, a two-time Pro Bowler, missed 18 of 34 games the last two
seasons with the Cardinals because of his knees. He didn't play in
Carolina's preseason game Friday night and the Panthers have given
no indication of when he might be able to.
</P>
<P>
   But Zucker said he believes Swann will play football again this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We certainly believe he'll play this year,'' Zucker said.
''And we're working very hard to make it happen.''

<HEADLINE> Ravens 16, Eagles 13  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Shannon Sharpe caught a touchdown pass in his
Baltimore debut, and the Ravens opened their preseason by beating
the Philadelphia Eagles 16-13 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Stover snapped a tie with a 42-yard field goal with 2:43 to
go, and Anthony Poindexter sealed the win with an interception. It
was the ninth straight preseason win over three seasons for the
Ravens, who went 4-0 in both 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan McNabb played into the third quarter for Philadelphia
(0-2), completing 12 of 19 passes for 104 yards and a 1-yard
touchdown pass to tight end Chad Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore signed Sharpe as a free agent during the offseason to
enhance an offense sorely in need of a tight end. The former Denver
Broncos star showed his value on Baltimore's second series, running
a crossing pattern before catching a 7-yard touchdown pass from
Tony Banks for a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know it's only preseason, but that's my first to the Hall of
Famer, so it feels good,'' Banks said at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe, who missed the final 11 games of the 1999 season with a
fractured left clavicle, had two catches for 15 yards before
leaving after two series. Ben Coates, who also signed as a free
agent after a fine career with New England, added one catch for two
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Five Baltimore tight ends last year combined for 34 catches and
one touchdown during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Banks played two series, going 7-for-10 for 56 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis, playing his first game since
accepting a plea bargain in a murder trial in Atlanta last May,
played the first quarter and had one tackle.
</P>
<P>
   As is the case in most early preseason games, the outcome was
decided by players projected to be backups. Third-string quarter
Chris Redman completed a 17-yard pass to tight end Ryan Collins to
set up Stover's game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   Trent Dilfer moved the Ravens 61 yards in their first possession
of the second half before Stover kicked a 29-yard field goal to
make it 10-10.
</P>
<P>
   Koy Detmer came in for McNabb and directed a 59-yard drive that
ended with a 28-yard field goal by Rich Maston. Stover tied it with
a 32-yarder with 8:58 left in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles were offsides on the opening kickoff, and Corey
Harris took the second kick 61 yards to the Philadelphia 34. Nine
plays later, Banks threw incomplete on fourth down from the 1.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia failed to move, and Sharpe capped a 40-yard drive
with his TD catch over the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles pulled even against the Ravens' second-team, moving
80 yards on 16 plays to make it 7-7 with 1:07 left in the first
half. The drive lasted more than nine minutes and ended on a pass
from McNabb to Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Just before halftime, McNabb completed a 25-yard pass to Jeff
Thomason to set up a 56-yard field goal by David Akers.

<HEADLINE> Seahawks 28, Colts 16  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Shaun Alexander, drafted to give veteran running
back Ricky Watters some help, scored two touchdowns in his Seattle
Seahawks' debut Saturday night in a 28-16 victory over the
Indianapolis Colts.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks played their exhibition opener at University of
Washington's Husky Stadium, where they will play their home games
for two seasons after the implosion of the Kingdome March 26. A new
$430 million outdoor football stadium is being built for the team
at the site of the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, the 19th pick in April from Alabama, tallied on a
pair of inspiring 11-yard runs after the Colts (0-2) took a 7-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The defending AFC West champion Seahawks, who ended a 12-year
playoff drought in coach Mike Holmgren's first year last season,
went ahead to stay at 14-7 on a 75-yard touchdown drive to open the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, a 5-foot-11, 218-pounder, scored on a run around left
end when he faked out free safety Tony Blevins at the 6-yard line
and went into the end zone standing up with 3:44 gone in the second
half. Glenn Foley, Seattle's backup quarterback, had a 28-yard pass
to rookie James Williams in the march.
</P>
<P>
   Foley passed 3 yards to Darrell Jackson, another rookie, for a
touchdown with 3:10 left in the third quarter to give Seattle a
21-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Vanderjagt's 39-yard field goal with eight seconds left in
the third period made it 21-10.
</P>
<P>
   In the final period, No. 3 quarterback Brock Huard scored on a
13-yard scramble and backup Colts quarterback Kelly Holcomb passed
5 yards to free-agent rookie Trevor Insley for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The score was tied at 7 at halftime after a 52-yard field goal
attempt by Seattle's Todd Peterson was short as time ran out.
</P>
<P>
   With Holcomb at quarterback in the second quarter, the Colts
drove 94 yards in 17 plays for a touchdown with 4:38 left in the
half. Free-agent rookie Kevin McDougal scored on a 1-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks took the kickoff and drove 87 yards in eight plays
for the tying TD with 1:55 to go in the opening half as Alexander
scored on a nifty 11-yard run. He appeared stopped in the middle,
but broke outside and outran the Colts' secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Huard, playing at his former college stadium, directed Seattle's
first TD drive.
</P>
<P>
   The starting quarterbacks played only in the first quarter. In
three series, Peyton Manning of Indianapolis was 1-for-3 for 20
yards with no touchdowns and no interceptions. Seattle's Jon Kitna
was 5-for-7 for 36 yards with no TDs and one interception.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts, last year's AFC East champion and winners of 13
games, lost their preseason opener to Atlanta 20-13 at home last
Saturday night.

<HEADLINE> Titans 14, Chiefs 10  </HEADLINE>
By TERESA M. WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Tennessee Titans showed off new
receiver Carl Pickens, and the AFC champions ended a preseason
losing skid to the Kansas City Chiefs with a 14-10 exhibition
victory Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Pickens practiced with the Titans for the first time only five
days ago after signing a five-year, $20 million contract. But he
picked up enough that he played with the starters for the first two
series and caught two passes, including a 2-yarder from Steve
McNair that tied the game at 7.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Thomas' 1-yard touchdown in the second quarter turned out
to be the game-winner as the Titans beat the Chiefs in an
exhibition for the first time since the AFL-NFL merger. The former
Houston Oilers hadn't won since 1963, losing eight consecutive
exhibitions to the Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis Grbac was nearly perfect for Kansas City and left with the
game tied. He was 8-for-9 passing for 63 yards, including a 16-yard
TD toss to Tony Gonzalez on the opening drive with Tennessee
getting little pressure on him.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Moon did not play at all for Kansas City as coach Gunther
Cunningham tried to protect his 43-year-old backup quarterback from
a banged-up offensive line. That left Todd Collins, the Chiefs' No.
3 quarterback the past two seasons, to play the second quarter and
most of the third as he tries to challenge Moon for the backup
role.
</P>
<P>
   He was spotty despite completing 10-of-19 for 76 yards. His best
completion came on a 22-yarder to Kevin Lockett, but that was
helped as Titans cornerback George McCullough looked inside and the
receiver ran past him for the catch.
</P>
<P>
   It was a messy game in the exhibition opener for both teams. The
Chiefs had eight of their 11 penalties in the first half, and the
Titans had seven for 55 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Ted White nearly rallied the Chiefs' backups in the final
minute. He hit Scott Cloman on what would have been a 30-yard TD,
but Cloman only got his left toes down and the Chiefs turned the
ball over on downs two plays later.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight for the Titans was what they hope is a glimpse of
the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   Pickens, who dropped his first pass, finally connected with
McNair on an 8-yarder in the second series. McNair later found
Pickens in the left corner on a fade for the TD. The receiver whose
bitter eight-year relationship with the Cincinnati Bengals finally
ended with his release last month kept the ball as a souvenir.

<HEADLINE> Bears 20, Giants 8  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Mark Hartsell, attempting to get
back into football after missing the last three seasons, guided
Chicago to 10 third-quarter points in leading the Bears to a 20-8
preseason win over the New York Giants on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsell, who got extra playing time because of an injury to
quarterback Jim Miller, gave the Bears a 10-8 lead with a go-ahead
3-yard touchdown pass to Macey Brooks, a score set up by linebacker
Rosevelt Colvin's interception near midfield.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsell, who has not played since being cut by the Washington
Redskins in 1997, also set up a 43-yard field goal by Paul Edinger
by hitting two passes for 19 yards and running twice for 14. The
former Boston College product finished 8-for-11 for 90 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-stringer Clint Dolezel added a 17-yard touchdown pass to
former Giant Scott Dragos, and Jaret Holmes had a 24-yard field
goal on Bears' scores set up by long returns against the Giants'
special teams in the preseason opener.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Daluiso kicked field goals of 37 and 30 yards, and
defensive tackle Christian Peter added a safety for New York.
</P>
<P>
   With the teams scheduled to meet in the third week of the
regular season, neither showed much in a contest that had few
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The one serious injury appeared to be a severely sprained knee
by New York tight end Pete Mitchell in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Kerry Collins looked good, completing 15 of 18
passes for 117 yards as the Giants' revamped offensive line gave
him plenty of time to throw. Heisman Trophy winner Ron Dayne gained
48 yards on 17 carries in his debut.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago starter Cade McNown was 3-for-5 for 42 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Despite outgaining the Bears 215-70, the Giants held only an 8-3
lead at halftime, and two of those points came on Peter's safety
with 6:02 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the play give New York a 5-3 lead, it also sent
Miller to the bench with a sprained elbow on his first play and got
Hartsell into the game early.
</P>
<P>
   A 23-yard pass from Jason Garrett to Joe Jurevicius and a
17-yard run by Ron Dixon -- the Giants' third-round draft choice --
on a double reverse set up Daluiso's 30-yard field goal after the
ensuing free kick.
</P>
<P>
   Daluiso, who missed the final 10 games last season because of a
knee injury, gave New York a 3-0 lead late in the first quarter
with a 37-yard field goal. It capped a 12-play, 52-yard drive that
featured Collins' passes of 13 yards to Amani Toomer, 20 to Ike
Hilliard, and four runs by Dayne for 16 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Kennison returned the ensuing kickoff 65 yards, setting up
Holmes' field goal.
</P>
<P>
   A 50-yard punt return by R.W. McQuarters set up Dragos' TD.

<HEADLINE> Rams 31, Raiders 17  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Kurt Warner was back in MVP form for the St.
Louis Rams' preseason opener Saturday night, producing a quick
touchdown on his only drive in a 31-17 victory over the Oakland
Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, who threw 41 touchdown passes in the Rams' Super Bowl
season, was in for only seven plays but made them count. The Rams
led the NFL in offense last year under coordinator Mike Martz, now
the head coach, and they opened with three passes.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Bruce and Warner connected for a 26-yard score with 9:31
left in the first quarter, with Bruce slipping two tackles en route
to the end zone. Bruce also caught a 21-yarder and Torry Holt
caught a pair of 9-yarders. The only incompletion was a dropped
pass by Bruce.
</P>
<P>
   Warner got light duty because the opener is a month away, and
because the Rams wanted to take a longer look at backups Trent
Green and Joe Germaine. Green, the starter before suffering a
season-ending knee injury last preseason, was 5-for-7 for 61 yards
and two touchdowns as the Rams took a 21-10 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Green was called for intentional grounding his first series, but
threw two 50-yard strikes to Holt that just missed. Holt dropped
the first one at the Raiders 5 and Charles Woodson was called for
interference on the second, which set up a 4-yard touchdown pass to
Jeff Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Green also connected with Ricky Proehl for a 13-yard touchdown
pass in the second quarter. Germaine threw an interception that was
returned 33 yards for a touchdown by Calvin Branch in the third
quarter. He also set up the Rams' final touchdown, a 4-yard run by
Damon Washington in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It was an up-and-down game for kicker Sebastian Janikowski, the
Raiders' first-round pick. Janikowski made a 46-yard field goal
with several yards to spare near the end of the half, but his
35-yard attempt in the third hit the left upright and had no
touchbacks on his kickoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders starting quarterback Rich Gannon got even fewer snaps
than Warner. Gannon was 2-for-2 for 10 yards in the Raiders' first
series, going three plays and out for the night.
</P>
<P>
   Backup Bobby Hoying played most of the game for Oakland, going
11-for-21 for 107 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Jerald Moore, the Rams' feature tailback in 1998 before losing
the job due to fumbles, scored on a 1-yard run in the first quarter
for the Raiders. Moore had 38 yards on 11 carries and also was the
Raiders' top receiver with four catches for 46 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Faulk carried only twice for 3 yards for the Rams, and
several key players on both teams sat out the game. The list
included Raiders wide receiver Tim Brown and Rams defensive linemen
D'Marco Farr and Grant Wistrom. Rams cornerback Todd Lyght, who
ended a holdout on Wednesday, did not dress.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams escaped without major injury. Rams fullback James
Hodgins strained his left rotator cuff in the first half.

<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Angie Braziel scored with 2.8 seconds
left as the Charlotte Sting edged Utah 84-82 on Saturday night,
eliminating the Starzz from WNBA playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Stinson led Charlotte with 23 points, while Tracy Reid
scored a season-high 21 points on 10-for-11 shooting as the Sting
(8-22) snapped a four-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Azzi missed an off-balance 3-pointer at the buzzer for
the Starzz (16-14). The loss secured the final Western Conference
playoff spot for Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Utah rallied from a nine-point second-half deficit to take a
78-76 lead on Korie Hlede's 3-pointer with 2:22 remaining.
Charlotte bounced back with 3-pointers from Dawn Staley and
Charlotte Smith to go ahead 82-78.
</P>
<P>
   The Starzz cut the lead to two on Adrienne Goodson's layup with
15 seconds remaining. Staley, who had a game-high 10 assists,
turned the ball over on the Sting's next possession, and another
Goodson layup tied the score with nine seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Williams led Utah with 23 points, including 17 in the
second half, and nine rebounds. Goodson added 22 points and nine
rebounds for the Starzz. Reserve Amy Herrig scored a career-high 14
points, and Hlede added 14 as well.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte shot 57.4 percent from the field, its second highest
percentage of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The first half featured nine ties and 12 lead changes before
Charlotte took a 39-37 lead into the break. Sting center Rhonda
Mapp hyperextended her left knee in the first half and did not
return.

<HEADLINE> Social Security Celebrates Birthday  </HEADLINE>
By REAGAN HAYNES
<TEXT>
<P>
   HYDE PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- The historic home where Franklin D.
Roosevelt lived held a 65th birthday celebration Saturday for one
of the former president's best-known legacies: Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people, including Roosevelt's grandson, gathered to
for the event that included a re-enactment of the Roosevelt speech
that preceded the ''fireside chat'' and Social Security
bill-signing on Aug. 14, 1935.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's as Roosevelt said in his speech earlier, this is a
foundation for people, and it grows and changes with the times,''
Social Security Commissioner Kenneth Apfel said.
</P>
<P>
   James Roosevelt discussed his grandfather's efforts on the
program that was part of the New Deal, a cornerstone of the FDR
administration. He also praised Eleanor Roosevelt's role in helping
launch the program that now covers 44 million American retirees,
disabled and dependents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her role as my grandfather's eyes and ears, her reports to him
of ... poverty and older America, inspired him to fight the good
fight,'' James Roosevelt said.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven percent of American senior citizens live in poverty
despite the law, but the Social Security agency said the figure
would be 50 percent without the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an intergenerational system. I'm paying for my dad's
retirement and you're paying for your grandparents,'' Apfel said.
''It's changed with the times to last 65 years, and it will be
there 65 years from now.''

<HEADLINE> Marlins 10, Reds 5, 11 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Mike Lowell's two-run double in the 11th
finished off a wild performance by Mark Wohlers and sent the
Florida Marlins to a 10-5 victory Saturday night over the bungling
Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds fell six games behind St. Louis in the NL Central with
their fourth straight loss. The Marlins have won four in a row to
improve to 55-55, one win better than Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers (0-1), making a comeback from wildness and
reconstructive elbow surgery, got his first loss in two years
because he lost his feel for the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers, who hadn't allowed a run in five previous appearances,
walked four of eight batters he faced in one-plus inning, giving up
three runs. He threw 17 strikes out of 40 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up two walks opening the 11th, and Larry Luebbers
relieved and gave up Lowell's two-run double. Chris Clapinski added
a two-run double and Mark Smith doubled home another run,
completing the five-run rally.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati's Danny Graves and Florida's Antonio Alfonseca (4-4)
blew save chances during the final three wacky innings.
Cincinnati's Dante Bichette failed to tag from third in the bottom
of the ninth, a blunder that drew boos from the crowd of 37,369 and
sent the game to extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   There were embarrassments and breakdowns all around in a game
that started cleanly but got wild after both starters left
following a 26-minute rain delay in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Marlins starter A.J. Burnett singled for his first major league
RBI -- a moment undercut when he stubbed his left toe and tripped
into the dirt as he reached first.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kotsay and Lowell added solo homers off Rob Bell as the
Marlins pulled ahead 3-2 before the rain delay. Once the bullpens
came into play, no lead was safe until the final one.
</P>
<P>
   Benito Santiago singled with the bases loaded off Dan Miceli to
put the Reds ahead 4-3 in the bottom of the eighth. Graves blew a
save for only the third time in 21 chances by giving up Kotsay's
run-scoring double in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds had a win at their fingertips when they loaded the
bases with one out in the bottom of the ninth off Ricky Bones, who
won a corn throwing competition before the game as part of the
annual Farmers' Night promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Bichette, who was on third, took off for home when Pokey Reese
hit a liner to left. He couldn't get back to the base in time to
tag up when Mark Smith made the catch after running hard to his
left.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the Reds' only bad moment in the inning. It started
when Ken Griffey Jr. stood at the plate for several seconds after
drawing a walk -- he lost track of the count and had to be coaxed to
first by the fans and home plate umpire Tony Randazzo.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Millar's pinch single in the top of the 10th off Wohlers
put the Marlins ahead again, but Alfonseca got his fourth blown
save in 37 chances when Griffey singled to tie it at 5 in the
bottom half.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Florida's Luis Castillo, who strained his right hamstring
during Friday's game, will be out for a couple of days. He leads
the majors with 46 steals. ... Infield coach Tony Taylor felt dizzy
and had an upset stomach, prompting a trip to a local hospital.
Tests were negative and he was with the team for the game. ... Bell
singled for his first major league hit in the fifth. He had been
0-for-24 with 17 strikeouts. ... Reds SS Barry Larkin has a
sprained knee ligament and will be sidelined for up to five days.
He hurt it sliding hard into second base Friday night.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Terry Jones' single scored Lee Stevens with the
go-ahead run with two outs in the 10th inning Saturday night to
lift the Montreal Expos over the Houston Astros 10-9.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal had four homers, including three off Jose Lima,
increasing his major league-leading total to 35 in 23 starts. Lima
gave up seven runs and nine hits in 5 2-3 innings, his ERA rising
to 6.96
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who earlier tripled and homered, singled off Marc
Valdes (2-4) leading off the 10th. Geoff Blum sacrificed and Chris
Widger his a comebacker, with Stevens holding at second.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Mordecai's infield hit advanced Stevens to third, and Jones
lined Valdes' first pitch into left field.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Strickland (3-1) pitched two innings for the win and Steve
Kline, Montreal's sixth pitcher, got three outs for his 13th save
in 16 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Expos starter Dustin Hermanson allowed five runs, nine hits and
four walks in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Spiers and Glen Barker had three hits each for Houston,
which outhit the Expos 15-14.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, which had won its previous four home games, took a 3-0
lead in the first on run-scoring doubles by Daryle Ward and Moises
Alou following by Bill Spiers' RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Blum's sacrifice fly in the second drove in Montreal's first
run, but the Astros made it 5-1 on Glen Barker's second-inning
homer, just his second this season, and Spiers' RBI double in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal tied it in the fourth on Andy Tracy's 457-foot home run
to center, Stevens' two-run homer and Wilton Guerrero's RBI triple.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Seguignol hit a two-run homer in the sixth for a 7-5
lead, his first career homer as a pinch-hitter, but the Astros got
an RBI single from Jeff Bagwell in the bottom half off Felipe Lira.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Matt Mieske's seventh-inning homer, his first since
last Aug. 23, tied it 7 against reliever Julio Santana. Mieske had
been 5-for-39 as a pinch hitter coming in.
</P>
<P>
   Julio Lugo's two-run double put Houston ahead 9-7 in the eighth,
but Montreal tied it again in the ninth on Jose Vidro's two-run
homer off Octavio Dotel, who blew a save for the first time in six
chances.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Eusebio extended his hitting streak to 11 consecutive
games, one shy of his career high set in 1995. ... Houston rookie
3B Chris Truby was a late scratch from the lineup because of a
bruised left wrist. ... Kline leads the majors with 60 appearances.

<HEADLINE> Japan Recalls Atomic Bombing  </HEADLINE>
By SHIZUO KAMBAYASHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIROSHIMA, Japan (AP) -- In a solemn annual rite, Japan paused
Sunday to recall the day 55 years ago when the dropping of a U.S.
atomic bomb ''created a hell on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Broken only by the steady chirping of cicadas and the tolling of
a bell, 60 seconds of silent prayer commenced at 8:15 a.m. -- the
exact moment the bomb exploded above Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Many in attendance on the grounds of Peace Memorial Park bowed
their heads, while some held Buddhist prayer beads. The city of
Hiroshima estimated that 50,000 people attended the event, held
amid hot, muggy weather. Police put the number at 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been precisely 55 years since one single atomic bomb
created a hell on earth,'' Hiroshima Mayor Tadatoshi Akiba said in
delivering the city's annual peace declaration.
</P>
<P>
   He called for Hiroshima to make further efforts to see an end to
atomic weapons in the 21st century. ''Unfortunately, our most
fervent hope, to see nuclear weapons abolished by the end of this
century, has not been realized.''
</P>
<P>
   About 140,000 people were killed by the attack. Three days
later, the United States dropped a second atomic bomb on Nagasaki,
killing 70,000 people. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15, 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists estimate the yield of the bomb that decimated
Hiroshima was about 12,000 kilotons. A kiloton is the equivalent of
1,000 pounds of high explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Following the declaration, 1,500 doves symbolizing peace were
released into the sky at the ceremony, which is televised
nationally every year. Three hundred children sang a song of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, who attended the event for the
first time since assuming his post in April, expressed his
''deepest sympathy'' for those who were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''My heart also goes out to the people who to this day continue
to suffer from the aftereffects of their exposure to radiation,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the city announced that the names of 5,021 people
who were in Hiroshima on the day of the bombing and who have died
since last year's anniversary were added to a monument dedicated to
the victims.
</P>
<P>
   The number of names on the cenotaph now stands at 217,137.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, The Associated Press media subscribers voted the
bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as the top news story of the
20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Hiroshima is about 428 miles southwest of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   After the ceremony, a man crossed a security line and ran toward
the lead car of Mori's motorcade, but was apprehended and arrested,
said Masashi Watanabe, a spokesman for the Hiroshima state police.
Mori, who was in the second car in the motorcade, was unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   The man, believed to be in his 20s, was not carrying any
weapons, Watanabe said, and has remained silent in police custody,
refusing even to give his name.

<HEADLINE> Vikings' Moss Hurt in Exhibition  </HEADLINE>
By ARNIE STAPLETON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Randy Moss injured his left shoulder Saturday
night during the Minnesota Vikings' exhibition game against the New
Orleans Saints.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays were negative, team trainer Chuck Barta said. However,
Moss needed MRIs on his left shoulder and on his ribs, which were
bruised.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't even want to guess,'' Barta said of the possibility
that the MRIs would show a dislocation or separation. He said he'd
have the results Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Barta said results of the X-rays were promising and led him to
be hopeful that the injury wasn't serious.
</P>
<P>
   ''The X-rays didn't show anything broken,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dennis Green said he would be careful not to play Moss
until he's 100 percent again.
</P>
<P>
