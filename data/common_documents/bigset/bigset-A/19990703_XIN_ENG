<HEADLINE> Mahathir Says Malaysia On Right Growth Path </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Friday that his country is on the right
growth path and should achieve a positive growth in the second
quarter of this year as targeted.
</P>
<P>
After contracting about 10 percent in the last quarter of 1998
and 1.3 percent in the first quarter of this year, the positive
growth from the second quarter onwards would make the country more
attractive to long-term investors, he said.
</P>
<P>
Launching Intel's latest Premium III processor assembly and
test factor in Bayan Baru, he said the opening of the Intel
facility was a vote of confidence by the American company in the
country's economic climate.
</P>
<P>
He believed that more such serious companies like Intel would
expand or open up their facilities in Malaysia as all indications
point to an all-out recovery of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia had and will always welcome serious long-term
investors to the country as they had made the economy strong and
been providing good job opportunities to its people," Mahathir
said.
</P>
<P>
He said these investors had also helped in the people achieving
greater sophistication, changing from being mere food and drink
manufacturers to high-tech producers just like the foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
"The government and Malaysians greatly appreciate the
confidence shown and the good job done by these serious long-term
investors all these years since the country's independence," he
said.
</P>
<P>
But he said his government would be wary of short-term
investors who came only to make short-term gains and would leave
the country the moment they found that it was not that comfortable
the way they were used to.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malaysia would be able to achieve greater
progress and development if political and economic stability
continued to prevail in the country, and he pledged to continue to
give emphasis to political stability and racial harmony in the
country by ensuring a good and strong government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said Malaysia was confident of achieving the 2020
vision with the continued support of its people and the confidence
of serious long-term foreign investors in the country's ability to
achieve success.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the government also welcomed larger
participation from foreign and local investors in the Multimedia
Super Corridor (MSC) that is being developed in the Kuala Lumpur
area.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was doing everything possible,
especially in making available trained people who have the
capability to absorb high technology knowledge, to serve the MSC
needs.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir reiterated that there would be minimum government
interference in the MSC area of development as required under the
Bill of Guarantee passed by the government.
</P>
<P>
"We will help investors develop in the MSC area. There will be
close interaction between the government and the private sector
here. The government regards the participating private sector as
its partner," he added.
</P>
<P>
Intel, the world's largest computer chip manufacturer, has been
operational in Malaysia since 1972. It has so far invested 1.6
billion U.S. dollars in Malaysia and currently employs more than
8,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
The company expects to invest another 140 million U.S. dollars
in Malaysia this year.

<HEADLINE> Armed Bandits Attempt to Rob Texaco Office in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Angolan police confirmed Friday that
the fierce fighting in downtown Luanda Thursday afternoon took
place when some armed bandits attempted to rob the office of
world-renowned Texaco oil company here in the capital.
</P>
<P>
A report by Angola's criminal investigation police said six
bandits armed with AKM submachine gun planned to attack the Texaco
office in Alvalade district when they met resistance from the
security guards and police. Four of the six bandits were killed
while two others escaped.
</P>
<P>
The police were told that the bandits belong to a notorious
local gang named "Groupo Band" whose head is Joao Band. The gang
are often engaged in killings, car jacking and attacking
companies.
</P>
<P>
The protracted civil war in Angola has resulted in the
scattering of many weapons among ordinary citizens, hence constant
armed robberies.
</P>
<P>
The serious economic crisis in the country also gives rise to
increasing crimes.

<HEADLINE> 450,000 U.S. College Students Own Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Nearly half a million of U.S.
college students own guns, according to a Harvard University study
released Friday.
</P>
<P>
About 3.5 percent of college students surveyed said they have a
gun at school, said Dr. Matthew Miller, a researcher at Harvard's
Injury Research and Control Center.
</P>
<P>
Some 14 million students attend colleges in the United States,
so roughly 450,000 students own guns based on that percentage, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that those with alcohol problems are twice
as likely as others to have guns.
</P>
<P>
The study, which appears in the July issue of The Journal of
American College Health, is based on a sample of some 15,000
students at 130 four-year colleges, and did not account for
hunting weapons.
</P>
<P>
The study was based on a 1997 questionnaire filled out
anonymously by students.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that two-thirds of the student gun owners
live off-campus. Although most colleges prohibit guns on campus,
researchers estimate students keep at least 100,000 guns in the
nation's dormitories.
</P>
<P>
Reports say bout 200 million people own guns in the United
States.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM: No Bargain Over PKK Leader Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said Friday there was no bargaining between Turkey and the
European countries over the death sentence of outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Turkey's Ankara State Security Court gave Ocalan
death penalty on charges of treason and separatism. Ocalan is
expected to appeal to the court of appeals.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit told reporters that the judicial process against Ocalan
was continuing and he would not comment on an ongoing judicial
case. But he stated that the process would continue in conformity
with the laws of the country.
</P>
<P>
"This process will continue on its due course in accordance
with our conscience and with the needs of Turkey," he said.
</P>
<P>
Western European countries, which are against the death
penalty, called on Turkey not to hang Ocalan after his being
sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said that after Turkey's Higher Court of Appeals
completes its work on the Ocalan case, the sentence would be
carried out only after being approved by the parliament and
endorsed by President Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was captured by Turkish special agents in Kenya in
mid-February and has ever since been detained on Imrali Island in
Marmara Sea near western Turkey's province of Bursa where he was
tried on charges of treason.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan-led PKK has been fighting since 1984 a war for an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey. Conflicts
between the Turkish security forces and the PKK militants have
claimed over 37,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Troops Kill 3 Rebels on Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian security forces on Friday
killed three members of the outlawed Mujahideen Khalq Organization
(MKO) who were responsible for several explosions in Iran, the
Iranian Intelligence Ministry announced.
</P>
<P>
The shoot-out took place when the MKO rebels were trying to
flee into Iraq after carrying out several explosions in Iran, the
Islamic Republic News Agency quoted the ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
Two explosions occurred Thursday night in two cities in western
Iran, causing minor damages. No casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
The first explosion occurred in Kermanshah, capital of the
western province of Kermanshah, and the other in Ahvaz, the
capital of the southwestern border province of Khuzetstan.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the MKO members robbed a car and took its
driver as hostage while fleeing, but Iranian security forces
rescued the hostage.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, a military group which fought against the former
Iranian Shah regime, was outlawed in 1981 following political
differences with the ruling cleric regime and fled into Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Last month, several MKO members were killed or injured in Iraq
in a series of explosion attacks which were reportedly carried out
by Iranian forces.

LONDON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Former Chilean leader Augusto
Pinochet has been taken to a British hospital for heart tests, his
spokesman said on Friday.

<P>
"He had been complaining of feeling uncomfortable all week. So
the doctor decided today that he should have some tests," the

"He may be held overnight. It depends on what they think. It

General Pinochet, 83, is under house arrest on the south-west

JOHANNESBURG, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)
has welcomed a decision by the world's richest nations to ease the
debt burden of developing countries, the South African permanent
mission to the United Nations said in New York Friday.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, NAM wishes to reiterate that only an
outright debt cancellation for the heavily indebted poor countries
without due conditionality is the surest way to secure the
sustainability of the development prospects in these countries,"
South African Press Association quoted the mission as saying in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
At a recent G8 summit in Cologne, Germany, the world's eight
leading industrialized countries agreed to provide a

</P>
<P>
The G8 comprises Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
They emphasized that the money was for social programs and
conditional on better government and financial management.
</P>
<P>
NAM said plans by countries to sell their gold reserves for the
purpose of debt relief should be without prejudice to the
interests of gold- producing developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Kim Meets Clinton to Seek Support for Engagement Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung on Friday is meeting President Bill Clinton right after
his arrival in Washington in the morning.
</P>
<P>
He was said to come here to seek fresh U.S. support to offset
rising domestic criticism of his engagement policy with the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
"President Kim already has President Clinton's support. But
because of increasing domestic criticism by conservatives, he
definetely wants to confirm that support," said Moon Jung-in, a
political science professor at Seoul's Yonsei University.
</P>
<P>
President Press secretary Park Jung-ho said Kim expects his
meeting with Clinton to "serve as an opportunity to consolidate
mutual cooperation between the two countries in consistently
pushing the engagement policy and a comprehensive approach
toward North Korea."
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the third since the South Korean president took
office 16 months ago, comes at a time of recurring tension on
the volatile Korean Peninsula following high-seas clash between
the two Korean navies.
</P>
<P>
Kim also planned a meeting later in the day with former
Defense Secretary William Perry, who is conducting a lengthy
review of U.S. policy toward the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
While the Clinton administration has generally remained
silent about where Perry's policy review stands, Kim said in an
interview last week that Perry offered a comprehensive package
of proposals to Pyongyang during a visit there in May.
</P>
<P>
Kim said the proposals include normalization of diplomatic
relations and an end to economic sanctions against the DPRK. He
said they contain a "give-and-take that would end the Cold war
on the Korean Peninsula."
</P>
<P>
In return, Pyongyang would promise not to make or possess
nuclear weapons, halt development and sales of ballistic
missiles ... President Kim said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 2 (Xinhua) -- President Alexander Lukashenko of
Belarus said Friday that his country is ready "to take the most
resolute steps" toward integration into European structures.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting held in Minsk, the Belarussian capital, to
celebrate the republic's Independence Day and 55 years since the
liberation of Belarus from Nazi invasion, Lukashenko said the
country's Foreign Ministry "has completely failed" in the
establishment of smooth cooperation with the West and European
Union.
</P>
<P>
Because of that failure, Belarus "finds itself outside of
European politics," the Interfax news agency quoted Lukashenko as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to search for paths of mutual understanding
with the European Union and the United States," Lukashenko said.

He also lashed out at the Russian leadership for blocking the
integration processes and neglecting agreements within the
framework of the Belarus-Russia Union.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko warned that if Russia takes no concrete, real steps
toward integration with Belarus, he would reconsider his country's
foreign policy doctrine by giving priority to cooperation with the
West.
</P>
<P>
Observers in Minsk noted that it was the first time in the last
few years that Lukashenko had publicly avoided bellicose rhetoric
toward the West and U.S., Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Confident on Peace in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
said here Friday that he remains confident that a peace agreement
will be signed to end the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) and the Great Lakes region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba told visiting Botswanan President Festus Mogae that a
ceasefire agreement to put an end to the 11-month war in the third
largest African country will be signed as soon as the ministers of
defense and foreign affairs of the countries concerned adopt the
draft ceasefire agreement, which was approved last Sunday at the
officials meeting held here in the Zambian capital.
</P>
<P>
Everything is being done to ensure peace in DRC, said Chiluba,
who has been mandated by the Southern African Development
Community to mediate a peaceful solution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
A regional summit scheduled for last Saturday has been delayed
because the draft agreement has not been adopted by the ministers.
</P>
<P>
All the warring parties involved in the conflict will sign the
agreement at the summit after it is adopted by the ministers.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba also told Mogae it is regrettable that peace is still
elusive in Angola and fighting has raged again in the southern
African country despite the peace accord signed here in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian president expressed his hope that an end will be
put to the war as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He described the relations between Zambia and Botswana as
"extremely warm", saying the two countries have been cooperating
in various fields like agriculture, tourism, transportation and
that new cooperation will focus on combating cross-border crimes
such as drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Mogae praised Chiluba for his peace efforts in the DRC crisis,
and said Botswana supports his peace initiative.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the conflict in DRC will be resolved
 peacefully.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Second Annual ESAF Loan for Tajikistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) on Friday approved the second annual loan totaling 40
million U.S. dollars for Tajikistan under the Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility (ESAF) to support the government's 1999-2000
economic program.
</P>
<P>
Tajikistan's three-year ESAF was approved in June 1998 in the
amount of 128 million dollars, and in December 1998 was augmented
to 134 million dollars, of which 54 million has been disbursed.
</P>
<P>
The ESAF is a concessional IMF facility for assisting eligible
members that are undertaking economic reform programs to
strengthen balance of payments and improve their growth prospects.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the country's real gross domestic product (GDP) grew
by 5.4 percent and inflation fell to 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government's economic program envisages average annual real
GDP growth of about 6 percent during 1999-2002, with GDP growth in
1999 projected at 5.5 percent, largely reflecting the continued
rebound from low output levels during the civil war.

<HEADLINE> Greece Wants Good Relations With Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou said Friday that Greece wanted calm and good relations
with neighboring Turkey.
</P>
<P>
After briefing the Greek cabinet on his meeting in New York
with Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, Papandreou said that the
New York meeting was "a first step" toward this direction, but
adding that Greece should be cautious in its efforts to improve
bilateral relations with its eastern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greek government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas stressed that Greece hoped good relations with Turkey, but
would not have political dialogue with Turkey on Greece's
sovereign rights.
</P>
<P>
Greece was making efforts to have good communication with
Turkey in sectors of common interest, but the Greek government
would under no circumstances enter into political dialogue with
Turkey on Greece's sovereign rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Papandreou had talks with Cem on the sidelines of
a U.N-sponsored meeting on Kosovo. Both sides agreed to hold talks
at the level of Foreign Ministry senior officials on issues
relating to the economy, trade, environment, tourism, as well as
combating organized crime, illegal immigration, drugs and other
law and order issues.
</P>
<P>
The next meeting between the two ministers will take place in
September this year.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at odds over
decades for their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits, the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea and the Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> Kouchner Named to Head U.N. Civilian Mission in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Friday decided to appoint Bernard Kouchner, a high-ranking
French Government official, as the head of the U.N. civil
operation in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, a U.N. spokesman
announced.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came in a statement, issued by the U.N.
spokesman, saying that "the Secretary-General has informed the
President of the Security Council of his intention to appoint Mr.
Bernard Kouchner as his Special Representative to head the United
Nations Mission in Kosovo, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Annan appointed Jack Covey, who is an American, as
Principal Deputy to his Special Representative, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The four major components of the mission will each be headed by
a Deputy Special Representative as follows: Interim Civil
Administration -- Dominique Vian from France, Humanitarian
Affairs, Dennis McNamara from New Zealand -- Institution Building
-- Daan Everts from Netherlands, and Reconstruction -- Jolly Dixon
from the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the U.N. headquarters on Friday morning,
Annan told reporters that "It is, obviously, a very important
assignment -- this awesome responsibility in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"He (the Special Representative) will have to administer a
whole territory, make sure that the multi-ethnic society is able
to live side-by-side, and train about 3,000 police," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So it's quite a wide range of responsibilities, but what is
going on in the region makes it a crucial appointment," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, or UNMIK, is
currently headed by Sergio Vieira de Mello, who is the U.N.
under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, on interim
basis.
</P>
<P>
The civilian presence in Kosovo, set up under the June 10
Security Council resolution, is intended to undertake post-war
reconstruction in the Serbian province and provide an interim
administration under which the people of Kosovo are able to enjoy
substantial autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The daunting task, enormous in scope and complex in execution,
will surely last years before its completion. However, the United
Nations is facing with immediate challenges in Kosovo as the U.N.
mission lacks necessary police force to keep law and order and
funds to run the war-torn province, where revenge killings broke
out following massive returns of Albanian refugees from
neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Moves to Set up Judicial System in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The top United Nations
official in Kosovo has made the first step to establish the
beginning of a new judicial system in the province by appointing
Thursday the first group of judges, prosecutors and investigators,
U.N. officials said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sergio Vieira de Mello, who is in charge of setting up the U.N.
Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), appointed nine
judicial officials who will serve on "a kind of itinerant court,"
according to a U.N. spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The court will provide due process throughout Kosovo to people
arrested and held by the international peacekeepers, known as
KFOR, which up to now have been releasing suspects in accordance
with European Commission guidelines required detainees to be
brought before a judge or court within 48 hours of arrest.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, de Mello continued to discuss reintegration problems
and the maintenance of essential services with ethnic Albanian
political leaders. In his latest meeting with them in Pristina,
provincial capital of Kosovo, Wednesday, he also addressed the
need for Albanian leaders to call on their supporters to reject
extremism and violence.
</P>
<P>
De Mello said he would consult separately with the various
parties before making a final decision on his proposed high-level
transitional council. The council, which would include
representatives from the Albanian and Serb communities, would act
as a consultative body on Kosovo-wide issues.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to ease tensions between ethnic Albanians and
Serbs, de Mello, who is serving as UNMIK chief on interim basis,
and his UNMIK team also travelled to the Kosovar towns of
Mitrovica, Orahovac, Pec and Prizren to meeting with community
leaders.
</P>
<P>
UNMIK, set up under the June 10 Security Council resolution, is
designed to undertake post-war reconstruction and ensure Kosovars
to enjoy substantial autonomy. However, the mission is seen as
huge in scope and complex in execution, and it will surely take
years to achieve the goal.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Committee Supports Renewal of China's NTR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives Ways and Means Committee in a vote on Thursday
voiced support to President Bill Clinton's decision to extend
China's Normal Trade Relations (NTR) and called on lawmakers to
kill a resolution aimed at severing business ties with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The committee decided by voice vote to back Clinton's decision
to renew China's NTR status, formally known as MFN (Most Favored
Nation), for another year.
</P>
<P>
The powerful committee also conducted a short debate on a
resolution calling for a rejection to Clinton's decision, and
decided to present it to the full house with a recommendation that
legislators to vote against it and continue business cooperation
with China.
</P>
<P>
"We must not turn our back on the prospect of economic progress
in China...It is not only in the U.S. commercial interest, but in
our strategic interest, to renew Normal Trade Relations with
China," said Representative Philip Crane, a Republican from the
State of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, some Congressmen told Chinese Ambassador
Li Zhaoxing on the Capitol Hill that they would "continuously and
unconditionally" support the extension of China's NTR status and
its entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton's decision to renew normal trade status with
China, made public on June 3, has won widespread support from both
business and political arenas. On June 14, Senate Majority leader
Trent Lott lent his backup for Clinton's decision, stressing that
even if the house veto it, it is unlikely for the Senate to take
up the issue.
</P>
<P>
During the past 20 years, the Congress has debated annually on
the NTR (MFN) status to China, but never succeeded in defeating
the presidential decision to extend the trade status.

<HEADLINE> Spanish Ranks Third Language in Quebec </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Spanish is becoming the third most
popular language in Canada's western province of Quebec, after
French and English.
</P>
<P>
Friday's "The Gazette" newspaper said that Spanish would have
surpassed Italian as Quebec's third most widely understood
language in 2001 if current trends continue.
</P>
<P>
The province has opened the door to beef-up instruction of
Spanish in schools, while universities are already struggling to
meet demand for Spanish courses, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
More than 190,000 Quebecers were able to hold a conversation in
either Italian or Spanish in 1996, with speakers of Italian
outnumbering those able to converse in Spanish by about 1,600, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
But because knowledge of Spanish spread almost 30 times faster
than that of Italian among Quebecers in the past decade, "we can
foresee that this language will have easily overtaken Italian by
the 2001 census," the report quoted a local demographer as saying.

MAPUTO, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's 11 oppositions
including the National Resistance of Mozambique (Renamo), the
largest opposition, have decided to jointly take part in the
presidential and parliamentary elections slated for late 1999.

The 11 parties will use the symbol of Renamo during the
elections. If the alliance wins in the election, said Daniel,
they will form a national unity government enveloping all

<HEADLINE> Annan Fails to Propose End to Libya Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Friday presented a report to the Security Council, and did
not propose an official end to the sanctions against Libya due to
the delayed trial of Lockerbie suspects by a Scottish court
sitting in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The Scottish Court on June 7 granted a request by defense
lawyers of the two Libyan suspects to delay the trial for six
months, Annan said, citing a court statement that "trial is
scheduled to start on or before February 4, 2000."
</P>
<P>
The two libyan suspects, who arrived in the Netherlands for the
trial before the Scottish court, was accused of their role in the
December 1988 bombing of an American airliner over Lockerbie,
Scotland, killing a total of 270 people.
</P>
<P>
"For that reason, I am not in a position to provide any factual
information on compliance by the Libya Arab Jamahiriya with the
relevant requirements," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. chief said, "I would like to point out that
the Libyan authorities have, indeed, provided assurances that they
will cooperate with the Scottish court."
</P>
<P>
Annan reported to the Security Council on April 5, saying that
the two Libyans had made their safe arrival in the Netherlands,
ready to be tried before the Scottish court.
</P>
<P>
In turn, the Security Council, in the April 8 presidential
statement, announced the suspension of the sanctions against Libya
because Tripoli has met the requirement to surrender the two
suspects for trial in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Under relevant Security Council resolution, the United Nations
is expected to announce the lifting of the sanctions against
Libya, imposed in 1992 and tightened in 1993, 90 days after Annan
reported the Libyan compliance.
</P>
<P>
Annan hosted a tripartite meeting on June 11 between the
Libyan, British and the U.S. permanent representatives to the
United Nations in order to assist the participants in clarifying
the positions of their governments regarding the requirements of
the Security Council resolutions for the lifting of sanctions
against Libya.
</P>
<P>
"The participants exchanged views and ideas and agreed that
there was need for a follow-up meeting," he said. "I hope that
further contacts will help to develop a constructive dialogue
between the parties concerned and will parties concerned and will
eventually lead to the normalization of relations among them."
</P>
<P>
"I also expressed the hope that the spirit of cooperation now
established will be maintained and that the start of the trial
will mark the beginning of a process leading to the normalization
of relations among all parties concerned for the benefit of the
international community as a whole," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan Ministry of the Interior
 announced Friday that the police seized over 20 kilograms of
marijuana on Wednesday night at the Luanda International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the ministry said the drugs contained in 19
plastic bags were hidden in the luggage of two Angolan citizens
heading for Paris, France.
</P>
<P>
The two drug smuggling suspects were arrested on the spot,
despite their attempt to bribe Customs police with 50 U.S.
dollars. The case is under further investigation, according to
the sources.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Angolan government reportedly burnt
more than 400 kilograms of marijuana on the World Drug Day which
falls on June 26. The large amount of drugs were captured by
police during the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Police sources in the country said drug smuggling was on the
rise in the past years. The drugs, mainly from Brazil on the
other side of the Atlantic, are destined for European countries
via Angola.

<HEADLINE> UK, Ireland Launch Plan for N.Irish Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain and Ireland launched a plan
on Friday to rescue the Northern Ireland peace process, after a
week of intensive talks failed to break the deadlock over
decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
The two governments said on Friday they hoped to set up a
power-sharing cabinet in Northern Ireland on July 15 and to get
Irish Republican Army disarmament started "within days".
</P>
<P>
They set out the moves in a formula to end a deadlock that has
stalled the year-old Good Friday agreement, according to a Reuters
report.
</P>
<P>
"All the parties have agreed to consult on these proposals,"
British Prime Minister Tony Blair was quoted as saying at the end
of five days of talks in Belfast. A joint statement said the
governments felt that both Protestant and Catholic leaders "will
support it accordingly."
</P>
<P>
The plan envisages ministers being nominated on July 15 with a
range of limited home rule powers actually transferred from London
to Belfast by July 18.
</P>
<P>
Blair said disarmament, which has been the biggest block on the
road to peace, could begin "within days."
</P>
<P>
The joint statement said the disarmament commission headed by
Canadian General John De Chastelain "will confirm a start to the
process of decommissioning."
</P>
<P>
However, it remains unknown how the plan will be received by
the rivaling parties in Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Urges for Dialog to Solve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa said here Friday that dialog is the only way of solving
internal conflicts in some war-torn African countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a state banquet in honor of the visiting Mozambican
 President Joaquim Chissano, Mkapa said Tanzania does not hope to
see the bloody conflicts in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The blood which was shed in a number of African countries
during the struggle for national independence brought honor to
Africa, he said. However, the blood shed now in Africa is only a
shame to the continent.
</P>
<P>
"Why must we enter the 21st century with the shame?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa expressed hope that a peaceful solution will be found to
the present crisis facing the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
He paid special tribute to Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
for his tireless efforts and great patience in efforts to achieve
peace in DRC.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian President expressed hope that the recent
ministerial peace overtures in Lusaka, Zambia could bear fruits.
He urged the Congolese people not to let this good opportunity
toward achieving peace in their country pass, and appealed to them
to put an end to unnecessary loss of lives.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mkapa called on donors, financiers and investors to
help develop the Mtwara Development Corridor, a key regional trade
link.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa invited them to attend a special conference on the
corridor to be held later this year in Dar es Salaam. He noted
that the multi-billion- dollar project is of vital importance to
the economic development of the African countries.
</P>
<P>
The corridor, running across Tanzania's southern regions, will
be a shortcut for the transportation of goods from the Indian
Ocean to Malawi and Zambia. The project is also expected to spur
the economic development of the forgotten areas in northern
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The four countries involved have held several meetings this
year to explore ways of developing the corridor, which will link
up the deep-water Mtwara Port in southwest Tanzania with the
Mbamba Bay on Lake Malawi.
</P>
<P>
Chissano, who arrived here Friday for a three-day visit to
Tanzania, will officially open the 23rd Dar es Salaam
International Trade Fair Saturday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Somali Militia Return Guns After Kenya's Ultimatum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A Somali militia group that robbed
Kenyan soldiers of their weapons and vehicles during a
cross-border raid Tuesday, returned the ordnance Friday after
Kenya sent jet fighters into Somalia and gave an ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan military spokesman Nicholas Simani said the Somali
militia gave back two stolen vehicles and all the weapons taken
in the attack on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Simani said two Kenyan army colonels secured the return of the
hardware after meeting with 10 Somali elders and local leaders of
the Somali National Front, allied to warlord Hussein Aideed, which
apparently launched the attack.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is very serious about the ultimatum that Kenyan troops
were going to go in and collect the vehicles, Simani said.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi warned the Somali warlords
Thursday that they would face "unpleasant action" unless the
equipment was returned.
</P>
<P>
About 400 militiamen attacked the Kenyan army patrol of about
20 soldiers Tuesday and ordered them to hand over their guns.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's army has increased its presence along the Somali border
in recent weeks as a new round of fighting between rival factions
and their foreign allies inside Somalia has raised tensions and
forced thousands of Somalis to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
The Somali central government broke down in 1991 and the Horn
of Africa country has since been ravaged by endless faction
fighting.

MOSCOW, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev and his Vietnamese counterpart, Pham Van Tra, on Friday
signed an agreement on military and military technical
cooperation, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev promised "to render a comprehensive assistance to the
Vietnamese friends in the promotion of the military-technical
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, the Vietnamese defense chief also met with
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, who is in charge of

<P>
Pham Van Tra asked for a discount in the cost of training
Vietnamese personnel at Russian military schools, the Interfax
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
According to Sergeyev, Russian military academies have trained
more than 13,000 Vietnamese specialists. Russia is also a major
supplier of military hardware to Vietnam, delivering a number of
Su-27 fighter jets to Hanoi last year. Talks continue on upgrading
Mig-27 jets in the Vietnamese army, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Klebanov, in his talks with the Vietnamese defense minister,
said South-East Asia is a strategic region for both Russia and
Vietnam.

"We are allies there, and we intend to actively cooperate in
strengthening peace in the region," Interfax quoted Klebanov as
saying.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Calls for Further Action on Population, Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The current special session
of the U.N. General Assembly urged governments to attach more
importance to tackling the issue of population and development,
according to a draft document received Friday.
</P>
<P>
The draft, already adopted by the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole,
called on governments to better understand the relationships among
population, poverty, gender inequity, health, education, the
environment and financial and human resources.
</P>
<P>
Governments also are urged to implement legislative and
administrative measures to promote public awareness on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The draft, scheduled to be adopted by delegates from over 170
counties at a night session Friday, said the implementation of the
Cairo recommendations has shown positive results.
</P>
<P>
Many countries have taken steps to integrate population
concerns into their development strategies, with mortality in most
countries continuing to fall in the five years since the adoption
of the Program of Action.
</P>
<P>
"The rising use of family planning methods indicates that there
is greater accessibility to family planning and that more and more
couples and individuals are able to choose the number and spacing
of their children," it said.
</P>
<P>
Among others, the final document would call for:
</P>
<P>
-- universal access to primary education by 2015 and
eliminating the gender gap in primary and secondary education by
2005,
</P>
<P>
-- reducing illiteracy of women and men, at least halving it
for women and girls by 2005 from the 1990 level,
</P>
<P>
-- establishing mechanisms to accelerate women's equal
participation and equitable representation at all levels of the
political process and public life,
</P>
<P>
-- developing and using indicators measuring access to and
choice of family planning and contraceptive methods,
</P>
<P>
-- reducing maternal mortality,
</P>
<P>
-- increasing young people's access to information and
education to reduce vulnerability to HIV infection,
</P>
<P>
-- increasing donor funding from 5.7 billion U.S. dollars in
2000 to 7.2 billion dollars in 2015, the deadline of the Cairo
Program of Action.
</P>
<P>
Donor countries are also urged to fulfil the agreed target of
0.7% of gross national product for overall official development
assistance.
</P>
<P>
The 3-day special session ends Friday which has reviewed and
appraised the implementation of the Program of Action of the 1994
Cairo Conference at the time the world population is reaching 6
billion as a result of an annual growth of 78 million.

ROME, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Italy tried to throw water Friday on
Germany's heated threats to boycott upcoming European ministers
meetings if German wasn't included as an official EU language.
</P>

Italian foreign ministry said Friday that the 11 languages of

to a minimum."

The ministry added that maintaining the functioning of this

languages as German, Spanish or Italian.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Welcomes Northern Ireland New Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Friday hailed an agreement reached by British and Irish prime
ministers on power-sharing cabinet in Northern Ireland, calling it
a "very welcome development."
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the remarks at a photo session with visiting South
Korean President Kim Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
"It gives us a chance to fulfill the Good Friday accords. It
gives the people of Northern Ireland, both Protestant and
Catholic, a chance to shape their destiny and govern
themselves," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the British and Irish prime
ministers proposed that both Protestants and Catholics would
form an Ulster cabinet on July 15 and Irish Republican Army
disarmament started "within days."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said it would give a good opportunity to resolve
difficult problems that had caused violent conflicts over
several decades in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the United States supports the efforts made by
both Britain and Ireland in solving the difficult problem and it
will hold all the parties to their commitments.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Factory Orders Rise 1.1 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Department said
Friday that orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods
rebounded in May, rising 1.1 percent led by a big increase in
demand for aircraft, autos and other transportation products.
</P>
<P>
The Department said orders for transportation products rose 9.5
percent in May after having dropped by 12.5 percent the month
before.
</P>
<P>
In April, orders for all manufactured goods had fallen 1.4
percent, more than the government had initially estimated,
reflecting the big drop in demand for aircraft and other
transportation products.
</P>
<P>
Today's report showed that orders for durable goods also
bounced back in May, rising 1.2 percent which is slightly less
than a previous government estimate. Orders for such goods fell
2.4 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
But economists said the manufacturing sector is still not out
of difficulties because the strong dollar makes USA-made goods
more expensive for foreign buyers.

<HEADLINE> Dow Jones Moves To New Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average moved up to a new record Friday as investors got
optimistic on the U.S. economy after a strong employment report.
</P>
<P>
The blue chip index closed up 72.82 at 11,139.24, surpassing
the record closing high of 11,107.19 set May 13. The Dow rose
586.68 points or 5.55 percent for the week.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 10.26 at 1,391.22 and the technology heavy
Nasdaq index rose 34.84 at 2,741.02, both moving into record
territories.
</P>
<P>
The stock market rallied as investors welcomed the strong
economic performance while discounting the fact that it could
translate into inflation after the Labor Department released an
employment report. According to the report, a total of 268,000
new jobs were created in June and average hourly earnings, a
key gauge of inflation pressures, increased by 3.7 percent in
the same month compared to a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Two days ago, the Federal Reserve decided to raise interest
rates by a quarter percentage point to cool off the economy and
prevent inflation from accelerating and dropped its "bias"
toward raising rates later. The action relieved investors' fears
about more rate hikes.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index rose 3.79 at 655.12 and the
American Stock Exchange index rose 7.47 at 802.42. The Russell
2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.09 at 456.51.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 11-to-8 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,695 up, 1,220 down and
623 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 583.74 million shares from 828.55
million in the previous session.

WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- the U.S. State Department said

PARIS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac said
on Saturday that he hopes to visit Algeria as soon as possible,
after Algeria's new president Abdelaziz Bouteflika invites him.
</P>
<P>
"I hope I would have the pleasure to go to Algeria ...The
conditions are not ready yet. I hope they will be as soon as
possible," said Chirac at a press conference in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries have remained bitter over
the past decade due to differences over Algeria's internal
problems.
</P>
<P>
The French president said that it is important for France and
Algeria to develop "brotherly" relations on the basis of mutual
respect and benefit.
</P>
<P>
Despite tense relations between the two governments, Algeria
remains closely associated with France in the political and
cultural fields, because of the presence of a 3 million-strong
Algerian community in the country.

<HEADLINE> Russia Wins First Gold Medal in Palma Universiada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PALMA, Spain, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Russian gymnasts took the
first gold medal from the 20th Universiade here this afternoon,
finishing first in the women's gymnastic team event.
</P>
<P>
The Russian squad spearheaded by Svetlana Khorkina, the 1996
Olympic champion and 1997 world champion, collected a total of 113.
487 points, edging Ukraine to second on 112.974 points.)
</P>
<P>
Khorkina also scored the day-high 9.825 points from the uneven
bars.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women only finished third with 111.174 points as
all three world champions Liu Xuan, Kui Yuanyuan and Bi Wenjing
are off their peaks, said Gao Jian, chef de mission of the Chinese
sports delegation.
</P>
<P>
Both Russia and Ukraine have dispatched the same squads who
have concluded the Olympic qualifiers early this month in Pusan,
South Korea where in China collected five individual gold medals
with its first-string young gymnasts.
</P>
<P>
"I am satisfied with the performances of our gymnasts here
since none of them are in the peak, and only Bi Wenjing and Shi
Jia made two glarying mistakes this afternoon," said the Chinese
official.
</P>
<P>
"But we have to find the solution to the dire fact that our
women gymnasts seldom can keep their forms in their elder ages
while their peers from other countries, mostly Russia and Ukraine,
can still attain their world-class caliber."
</P>
<P>
"Apart from the physical factor, we still have to improve our
training methods," said Gao.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the star-studded Chinese gymnastic team
actually is the second-string squad as only those aged from 18-28
are eligible for the University Games, and China can only find
those five women for the Palma gymnastics competition.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's Denisse Lopez collected the event-high 9.625 points
from the vault with the most difficult routine which boast s of a
record scoring merit of 9.9 points.
</P>
<P>
Kui Yuanyuan of China scored the second day-best of 9.750
points in the uneven bars, Elena Produnova of Russia was also
awarded the same scoring from the beam while the highest mark of 9.
600 in the floor exercise was given to another Russian Elena
Dolgopolova.

<HEADLINE> GCC Forms Committee to Tackle UAE-Iranian Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) foreign ministers decided on Saturday to form an ad hoc
committee to tackle the territorial dispute between the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) and Iran.
</P>
<P>
The committee, which comprises Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia,
will devise a mechanism to discuss the UAE-Iranian dispute over
three Gulf Islands, said the final communique issued after a brief
meeting of the GCC ministerial council held in the Saudi Red Sea
port city of Jeddah.
</P>
<P>
Abu Dhabi claims sovereignty over the strategic islands of Abu
Moussa, Greater and Lesser Tunbs, which are controlled by Tehran.
</P>
<P>
While welcoming Iran's readiness for direct talks with the UAE,
the GCC foreign ministers reaffirmed full solidarity with the
UAE's sovereignty over the islands and refused the Iranian
occupation.
</P>
<P>
Iran took control of the two Tunbs island in 1971 when British
colonialist forces pulled out of the region. It shared sovereignty
of Abu Moussa with the emirates until 1994 when it seized full
control of the island.
</P>
<P>
The UAE recently expressed dismay over the warming up of ties
between some GCC states, especially the Gulf heavyweight Saudi
Arabia, and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Abu Dhabi fears that a cross-Gulf rapprochement will
relinquish GCC's support to the UAE in the territorial dispute.
</P>
<P>
Differences over the GCC-Iranian rapprochement and its possible
impact on the UAE-Iranian dispute led to a suspension of the GCC
ministerial session held in the Saudi capital of Riyadh on June 12.
</P>
<P>
A Qatari mediation later helped bridge the rift between the
UAE and Saudi Arabia, which agreed on the resumption of the
foreign ministers meeting.
</P>
<P>
Qatar's Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani traveled to
both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi on June 19 in a bid to narrow the
differences between the two GCC countries.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic alliance established
in 1981, comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and
the UAE.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Denies Infringing on Ethiopian Embassy's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Eritrea government Saturday
denied having infringing on the right of the Ethiopian embassy in
Eritrea by seizing its property.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Eritrea has never, in any way hampered the
Ethiopian embassy or infringed on any of its inherent rights,"
said the Eritrean Foreign Ministry in a press statement reaching
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The denial was made after the Ethiopian government claimed in
a press statement dated July 1, 1999 which charged that the
Eritrean government had seized Ethiopian embassy property by
"confiscating documents sent in a pouch by the Ethiopian Ministry
of Foreign Affairs to the Embassy."
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, it was Ethiopia which expelled all Eritrean
diplomatic and technical staff in 1998 and denied the Eritrean
ambassador and his deputy freedom of movement, said the Eritrean
statement.
</P>
<P>
It added that Ethiopia also "declared Eritrea's Permanent
Representative to the Organization of African Unity (OAU) persona
non grata and ordered him to leave the country within 24 hours"
and on February 11, 1999 "armed agents of the government of
Ethiopia entered forcibly the residence of the (Eritrean)
ambassador."
</P>
<P>
"Addis Ababa is issuing these claims to further 'muddy the
waters'. No one should be midled," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that the Ethiopian claims happened just one week
away from the summit of the Organization of African Unity in
Algiers, at which Eritrea's legitimate grievances regarding
Ethiopia's violations would be discussed.
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopia's violations must receive the unfettered and direct
attention they merit," said the statement.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Strengthens Water Resource Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Council of Ministers of
Ethiopia has approved the water resources management draft policy
deemed to advance the sustainable utilization of the water
resources of the Horn of African country.
</P>
<P>
The council in its ordinary session Friday said this national
policy would enable the country to utilize its water resources in
a sustainable and equitable manner, the state-run Ethiopian News
Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The council said there is uneven distribution of rivers with 80
percent to 90 percent of the water resource concentrating in the
northwest, west and southwest of the country where only 40 percent
of the population lives.
</P>
<P>
The eastern and central parts of Ethiopia in which only 10 to
20 percent of the river basins is found is inhabited by over 60
percent of the total population, it said.
</P>
<P>
The council said the policy would be instrumental in the
preservation of water resources and the augmentation of their
usage for improved socio- economic gains.
</P>
<P>
It said the policy creates a system for integrated and
efficient water management in the country.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Calls for Third-Party Involvement in Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan said Saturday that
third-party involvement is essential to resolve the current crisis
in the disputed Kashmir region as India has shut all doors to
bilateral dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"They have shut doors on all kinds of dialogue. When bilateral
course is sterile, then third-party involvement will be useful,"
Foreign Office spokesman Tariq Altaf told a regular news briefing.
</P>
<P>
He said India's obdurate refusal to hold bilateral talks has
proved that third-party involvement, "be in the form of
arbitration, mediation or any other role, is not only desirable
but essential."
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question about the possibility of a meeting
between Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and U.S. President Bill
Clinton, Altaf said: "I am confident President Clinton has a
particular role to play (in this situation), if a meeting takes
place (between Sharif and Clinton), it will be extremely
productive."

<HEADLINE> Canada Releases U.S. Fishing Boat With Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian Fisheries Department
has announced the release of an American fisherman and his boat
held for 24 hours on suspicion of illegal fishing in disputed
waters.
</P>
<P>
The Lesley Anne, skippered by Dale Bosworth of Petersburg,
Alaska, was freed Friday afternoon with a warning, the department
said in an announcement released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Bosworth, who was alone, was spotted fishing for black cod in
north Pacific waters claimed by both Canada and the United States
when he was detained on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Robert Martinolich, a Canadian Fisheries Department official,
told reporters that "based on the circumstances, the most
appropriate action" was to let the American fisherman "leave the
Canadian zone with a warning."
</P>
<P>
The seizure has sparked a strong reaction from Alaskan Governor
Tony Knowles, who expressed "collective outrage" in a letter to U.
S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
He said the seizure was "beyond the norms of international law"
and required "reparations and a formal apology by the Canadian
government."
</P>
<P>
Knowles's spokesman Bob King threatened to undo the good
relations rebuilt after a salmon treaty was signed just on
Wednesday in Washington, as a result of five years of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"It's an unfortunate time" because the U.S. Senate is still
considering the financial terms of the treaty, "and we hope there
are no repercussions," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Macao SAR Preparatory Committee Closes 9th Plenary Session (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The two-day 9th plenary session of
the Preparatory Committee for the Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR) ended here today with a number of rulings on Macao's
return to the motherland adopted.
</P>
<P>
Members passed decisions on the work of the Macao SAR's first
chief executive before December 19 and on swearing in personnel
and adopted a specific measure for producing the Macao SAR's
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, who is chairman of the committee,
said at the closing session that the documents are important for
preparatory work of the Macao SAR and that, with the successful
selection of the first chief executive, the work for organizing
the Macao SAR has entered a practical stage.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the Macao SAR's administrative, legislative,
and judicial bodies and other matters related to establishing the
Macao SAR need to be finished before December 19, Qian said,
adding that the decision on the first chief executive's work
before December 19 has provided a legal basis for him to start
right now on forming the SAR.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the adoption of a specific measure for
choosing the Macao SAR's judiciary is another important document
of the Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
The people of Macao have a good understanding and strong desire
to govern Macao in accordance with the law and pay a great deal of
attention to forming the judiciary, he said, adding that the
adopted measure reflects regulations in the Basic Law of the Macao
SAR and will surely win their support.

<HEADLINE> Macao SAR Preparatory Committee Closes 9th Plenary Session (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Qian said that the Macao SAR's court holds trials independently
and rejects any intervention, but the Basic Law is the SAR's
fundamental constitutional law and an accurate understanding and
implementation of it is the prerequisite of a good handling of the
Macao SAR's affairs and relations with the Central Government.
</P>
<P>
According to him, President Jiang Zemin and other Central
Government leaders have repeatedly emphasized that the Central
Government will stick to the "one country, two systems" policy and
will never meddle in the SAR's autonomous affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Standing Committee of the Ninth National
People's Congress passed the Law on Stationing Troops in the Macao
SAR at its 10th session on Monday and that had a good response
from Macao residents. Stationing troops in Macao is a symbol of
China's sovereignty over Macao and an effective way for the
Central Government to control defense there and conducive to
maintaining Macao's stability, he explained.
</P>
<P>
In coming months, the Preparatory Committee will study Macao's
municipal bodies, the transition of some legislators, Macao's
existing laws, financial relations with the mainland, and
preparations for celebrating the return of Macao to the motherland,
he said.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the Preparatory Committee today said that
the Preparatory Committee's next session will be held August 28
and 29 in Beijing.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 3 (Xinhua) -- This year's first flood peak on the
Yangtze River is passing through the river's Jingjiang section.
</P>
<P>
According to the Yangtze River Water Resources Committee, the
crest passed the city of Yichang near the Three Gorges Project in
Hubei Province on Thursday, where water levels were approaching
the danger mark of 52 meters with a maximum flow rate of 47,400
cubic meters per second.
</P>
<P>
Flood waters from the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze
gained force and rose above the danger level at Shishou in Hubei
and formed this year's first crest on the Yangtze. From there
downstream to the city of Jiujiang in Jiangxi Province, the flood
water will continue for the next few days, according to Professor
Ge Shouxi of the Committee's Hydrology Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The committee predicted that the flood crest will reach Jianli
in Hubei on July 6 and arrive in Wuhan, capital of Hubei, the
following day.
</P>
<P>
Water levels will be 27.2 meters in Wuhan when the flood peak
arrives and will drop to 20.52 meters at Jiujiang and further to
about 14.75 meters at Datong in Anhui Province by July 8.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Polar Expedition To Study Effects Of Temperatures On Global Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are various opinions about the impact of the rising
temperatures, but they haven't been confirmed, said Chen Liqi, the
expedition's chief scientist, who noted that the rising
temperatures are getting a great deal of attention.
</P>
<P>
Data indicates that average temperatures around the world have
gone up one or two degrees centigrade over the past 150 years and
that the phenomenon is quite clear in the polar extremes. Some
people say that the rising temperatures will cause the tundra to
shrink, resulting in a softening of the ground, which is bad for
building, while some others believe it will help fishing and the
expansion of forests in polar regions.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese expedition will try to find a proper answer to
these questions, said Chen, who believed that rising temperatures
have something to do with last year's flooding on the Yangtze
river and the drought in some parts of China.
</P>
<P>
The Snow Dragon is a very modern icebreaker that carries 124
scientists and journalists. It left Shanghai on July 1 and is
traveling at 15 nautical miles per hour and is expected to pass
the Korean Strait at 8:00 this evening.

<P>
The expedition will mainly study the effects of the North Pole
on the global climate, especially on China, the ecological system
in Arctic waters, and the atmosphere, geology, fishing, and marine
environment of the area.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Shaohong, the captain of the ship, says that it was
originally scheduled for a 60-day journey but that will be
extended about 8 days because of some course adjustments in its
trip through the Sea of Japan, the Bering Sea, and into the Canada
Basin.

BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Temperatures above 36 degrees
centigrade have hit Beijing for the past nine days, the longest
hot spell since 1942, according to Wang Guitian, of the Beijing
Meteorology Station.
</P>
<P>
He says that northern China had only 26.4 millimeters of
precipitation for June, 47.6 millimeters below average, and the
low humidity and clear skies combined with a warm high pressure
front over much of East Asia has produced the continued hot days.
</P>
<P>
However, the hot weather has benefited cold drink producers.
One factory director said that daily sales of cold drinks and ice-
cream have increased more than 50 percent. Average daily sales of
air conditioners in these days were four times that at the
beginning of June and some stores have even run out of stock.
</P>
<P>
But, Wang says, the hot weather is not affecting work or daily
life in a big way because many people now work either in offices
or at home with air conditioners and labor intensity is down
because of technological development.

<HEADLINE> Magma Moves Up Mayon's Crater, Says Volcanology Institute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' seismic stations at
Mayon's slopes Saturday recorded high frequency volcanic tremors,
which showed signs of a possible eruption in days or weeks.
</P>
<P>
In a bulletin issued here, the Philippine Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said that its stations at
Mayon's slopes continued to record high frequency volcanic tremors
representing movement of magma towards the summit of the volcano,
about 330 kilometers southeast of Manila.
</P>
<P>
"During the period from 8:00 a.m. on July 2 to 8:00 a.m. on
July 3, the network likewise detected one high frequency volcanic
earthquake," it said.
</P>
<P>
During the past 24 hours, it said, moderate levels of steaming
activity were detected and the steam was noted to be emitted
without force from the crater before being drifted by the
prevailing wind.
</P>
<P>
The Phivolcs Thursday raised Mayon's alert level from 1 to 2,
saying if "the volcanic tremor and other physical indicators
persist in the coming days, the situation at Mayon could well
likely progress towards an eruption, possibly in a few weeks time
or even less."
</P>
<P>
In its Friday bulletin, the Phivolcs also increased the danger
zone at the volcano's southeastern quadrant from six kilometers to
seven kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Mayon, however, stood rather calm in the backdrop, puffing up
white smoke carried by the wind mostly towards the southwestern
direction, residents in the area said.
</P>
<P>
The treacherous calmness of the volcano is reminiscent of the
June 22 Phreatic blast and the February 1993 eruption that killed
about 70 farmers. Both eruptions caught everyone by surprise.
</P>
<P>
Governor Al Francis Bichara of Albay province, where Mayon is
located, said all disaster task units from rescue and evacuation
to rehabilitation have been well briefed and are ready anytime the
volcano erupts.
</P>
<P>
Residents within the volcano's 10-kilometer buffer zone are
wary of a sudden blast, but they have all been prepared for
evacuation anytime, Bichara said.

ISLAMABAD, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's opposition Northern
Alliance Saturday claimed to have captured a strategic town from
the control of the ruling Taliban in the northern province of
Baghlan.
</P>
<P>
Opposition spokesman General Sayad Husain Anwari said a latest
surprise strike by alliance troops has captured the town of Karkar
in northern Baghlan province.
</P>
<P>
The fall of Karkar has cut northern Taliban supply routes to
its base in Puli Khumri and secured alliance positions around
nearby Nahrin, both in Baghlan, he said.
</P>
<P>
No independent confirmation was immediately available.
</P>
<P>
The general furthered to claim that the alliance forces have
managed to recapture more territory around Darre Suf, which has
been the site of intense combat during recent months.
</P>
<P>
The districts of Darre Jamalak, Madrassa, Alambai, Naibazarak
and a number of others were captured by the alliance, Anwari said.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Alliance also claims the Taliban are planning a
massive offensive on three frontlines -- at Takhar in the north,
Ghorband in central Afghanistan, and along the lines north of
Kabul.

<HEADLINE> Pak FM Returns With Support of Islamic Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj
Aziz Saturday expressed his full satisfaction over support of the
Islamic Countries Foreign Ministers (ICFM) to Pakistan's stance on
the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
Aziz made the remark when talking to reporters on his return
from the 26th session of the ICFM in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso,
which brought together foreign ministers from the member countries
of the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
The Pak foreign minister noted that the ICFM unanimously
adopted two resolutions to express solidarity with Islamabad in
the current border confrontation with India.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that foreign ministers of over 50
Islamic countries have adopted two separate resolutions on
Kashmir, one reaffirming its traditional stand on the core issue
of Jammu and Kashmir and the other on the current tension along
the Line of Control (LoC)," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
Describing it as a major success for Pakistan "at a critical
time", Aziz said that Islamic countries fully endorsed Pakistan's
stand on Kashmir and gave their "loud and unequivocal" support for
Pakistan's security, territorial integrity and political
independence.
</P>
<P>
The Pak foreign minister said the resolution on the Kashmir
issue reaffirmed the Kashmiris' right to self-determination,
condemned the human rights abuses in the India-held valley and
called for settlement of the issue under the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The second resolution expressed deep concern over the serious
escalation of tension caused by heavy Indian shelling and air
strikes across the LoC, said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Lauding Pakistan's peace initiatives for defusing tension, the
resolution further urged the two sides to exercise restraint and
resume dialogue as agreed in the Lahore Declaration, he added.
</P>
<P>
Aziz disclosed that the ICFM agreed to appoint a special
representative on Kashmir, whom he hoped that the OIC secretary
general will shortly appoint even if India refuses to accept.
</P>
<P>
During the four-day stay in Ouagadougou, Aziz held bilateral
meetings with foreign ministers of 17 countries. During these
meetings, he explained to his counterparts the detailed background
of the current tension in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
On his way back, Aziz made a short stay in Paris Friday where
he met his French counterpart.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Saturday that he is comfortable with the
present rate of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) composite
index which has breached the 800-point mark.
</P>
<P>
He said when the government advised investors to buy when share
prices were falling, they did not believe that the shares would
pick up sharply again. "Those who bought then will be rich now,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Friday the KLSE daily trading volume reached an all-time high
with 1.258 billion shares worth 2.524 billion ringgit traded (3.8
ringgit to one U.S. dollar).
</P>
<P>
All key indices recorded gains with the Composite Index jumping
1.2 percent or 10.31 points to 845.62, the highest in 20 months.
</P>
<P>
On the economy, Mahathir said people who did not believe that
the country's economy was recovering were free to make their own
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
"They can make whatever forecasts (they want); the recovery is
not only in the market, (there are) so many things that we can
see," he told reporters after a private visit to the Butterfly
Park in Taman Tasik Perdana here.

<HEADLINE> Pak FM Renews Invitation to Indian FM to Visit Islamabad </HEADLINE>

<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj
Aziz Saturday renewed his invitation to his Indian counterpart
Jaswant Singh to visit Pakistan to reduce tension on the Line of
Control (LoC) in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"My invitation to Jaswant Singh still stands," the foreign
minister said while talking to reporters here on his arrival after
attending the 26th Islamic Countries Foreign Ministers' Conference
in Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
Aziz first extended the invitation to Singh when he visited New
Delhi on June 12 in a bid to carry forward the bilateral dialogue
process to defuse the tension on the LoC. However, India has not
yet responded to the offer.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, Aziz said, has been pleading for a negotiated
settlement of the crisis in Kargil and also the Kashmir dispute as
a whole and that is why he went to New Delhi last month.
</P>
<P>
"Our proposal to India is clear. Let's sit down and talk," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Dispelling the impression that Pakistan has violated the LoC,
he said Pakistan respects the LoC but questioned as to where is
the LoC.
</P>
<P>
He said the LoC existed only in map, adding there is a need for
its verification by the U.N. observers. "We hope we will find a
mechanism for respect to the LoC," he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of a full-fledged war, the foreign
minister said, "Danger of war has reduced." However, he said
Pakistan will defend itself if war is imposed on it.

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo Submits Three More Nominees to Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's president Olusegun Obasanjo
Friday sent three new ministerial nominees to the Senate for
screening, reported The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The nominees include Ime Okubudo, Mohammed Shatta, Hajiya
Aishatu Ismail,
</P>
<P>
said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Okubudo's nomination is believed to replace Udoma, whose name
though had been confirmed by the senate, failed to show up on the
June 30 cabinet inauguration.
</P>
<P>
Although no reason has been given for his action, he allegedly
rejected the appointment because he was offered the post of a
junior minister.
</P>
<P>
The president, in a letter addressed to the senate president
Chief Evan Enwerem, apologized to the senators for his failure to
officially invite them to the swearing in of the ministers and
said the oversight was not deliberate.
</P>
<P>
The Senate, or the upper house of Nigeria's Legislature
confirmed 42 out of the President's 49 ministerial nominees on
June 23 after a marathon debate, and latter on June 29 okayed
another five of the president's seven nominees.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Urges Youths To Emulate Nkomo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 3 (Xinhua) -- President Robert Mugabe Friday
challenged Zimbabwean youths to emulate late Vice-President Joshua
Nkomo whom he described as a principled and committed leader who
sacrificed a lot for the liberation of the country.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe told thousands of mourners who gathered to view Nkomo's
body at Ascot race course in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second largest
city that the late Vice-president spent nearly 50 years fighting
for the liberation of the country and was never deterred by long
years of incarceration and as a refuge in other countries, the
Zimbabwe News agency Ziana reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"What we see in this great man is a leadership of commitment,
which is not tribal or regionalistic," he said, adding that Nkomo
was a true national leader and a man of the people who was above
tribal, religious and ethnic politics.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said Nkomo left a heritage of unity and that people
should view and identify themselves first and foremost as
Zimbabweans and not along their tribes.
</P>
<P>
He said Nkomo suffered a lot in prison and detention and it was
him who started the liberation struggle which brought about
independence and democracy to the country.
</P>
<P>
"It was not easy being in prison for so long where there was
poor food and torturing, but for the principled Nkomo he was
prepared to die there for the liberation of the country," Mugabe
said.
</P>
<P>
The president said the government should also be people
oriented, by taking into consideration the feelings, aspirations,
sufferings and needs of the people.
</P>
<P>
"If you feel we are not doing this, then you have a right to
complain. If we do not take care of the people's problems, then
you can say we are not walking in the footsteps of the great man,
Joshua Nkomo," he said, adding that Nkomo was a hero of heroes.
</P>
<P>
Nkomo died Thursday in Harare. His body was taken to his
Matsheumhlophe residence in Bulawayo Friday for viewing by members
of the public. The body will be flown back to Harare on Sunday,
where it will lie in State before burial on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Australian Serbs Protest at Expulsion of Serbs From Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Several hundred Australian Serbs
protested Saturday in Australia's biggest city of Sydney against
the expulsion of thousands of Serbs from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators gathered at Town Hall in central Sydney,
carrying signs and banners saying "Stop the Exodus" and "Keep the
U.N. Promise."
</P>
<P>
About 200 Australian police also gathered at Town Hall and
other places throughout the city where the protesters were
expected to march.
</P>
<P>
Ilija Glisic, president of the Serbian National Federation of
Australia, said the protesters wanted Serbs in Kosovo to get more
protection than what was currently being given by NATO and the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He said 71,000 Serbs had been forced to leave Kosovo in the
past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of civilians had been killed and hundreds of homes
had been looted and destroyed since ethnic Albanians were allowed
to return to Kosovo, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We want equal treatment to everyone in Kosovo, to make sure
everyone can go back to Kosovo, not just the Albanians," Glisic
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We want to ensure people's rights are protected, their
property is protected and the cultural and historical monuments in
Kosovo are protected," he said.
</P>
<P>
Protester Predrag Rancac said many Albanians were getting their
revenge on Serbs, torching houses and killing civilians as they
returned home.
</P>
<P>
"We are protesting at the behavior of NATO troops in Kosovo,"
he said.
"They are not following the peace agreement reached. They are
freely letting Albanians take revenge."
</P>
<P>
The demonstration ended peacefully earlier Saturday afternoon.

<P>
The Post Express:

<P>
Daily Times:

HONG KONG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals
Limited (HACTL) announced Saturday that its throughput for the

surpassed those of Kai Tak."

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will receive Mirage III
combat jets and Agosta-class submarines from France as per
schedule as there is no embargo on their delivery, Foreign
Minister Sartaj Aziz said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question during his press briefing on return from
Burkina Faso where he attended a meeting of the Organization of
Islamic Conference, Aziz said he discussed the issue with French
officials in Paris Friday and the officials said there is no
restriction on the delivery.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said he met his French counterpart Hubert Vedrine and Jean
David Levitte, diplomatic adviser to the French president, and
discussed with them a host of issues focusing on regional security
and the tension on the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that France may delay the delivery of Mirage
combat jets to Pakistan as a result of the fighting along the LoC.
</P>
<P>
"I do not think that the delivery will be stopped and according
to the program one Agosta submarine is due to be delivered to
Pakistan on July 8," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
He said that France and Pakistan agreed that meaningful efforts
be made for de-escalation in Kargil of Kashmir and dialogue be

Declaration signed by the two countries to resolve the Kashmir
dispute.

The foreign minister also conveyed a letter from Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif to French President Chirac relating to the recent
escalation in Kashmir.

<P>
Aziz said he had constructive discussions with his French
counterpart on the dangerous escalation that had taken place in
the Kargil sector on the LoC.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed on the urgent need to reduce tension between
Pakistan and India, particularly as both countries have nuclear
capability," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and France also agreed that in dealing with the Kargil
situation both Pakistan and India should respect the LoC, said
Aziz.

<P>
LONDON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading British newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart
Bertie Ahern kept alive the Good Friday peace accord on Northern
Ireland on Friday night with a new blue-print for breaking the
deadlock over IRA disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Tony Blair Friday night sought to break the impasse over the
Northern Ireland peace process when he announced an ambitious plan
to set up the province's power-sharing executive this month.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- The government could lose an early referendum on taking
Britain into the single currency by a margin of more than two to
one, according to the latest Gallup poll. Public opinion has swung
sharply against the euro in the past six months and a majority of
those questioned wants to delay a decision until it is clear
whether it is a success.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Up to 50,000 KFOR troops, on their peace-keeping mission in
Kosovo, could be struck by a "Kosovo syndrome" similar to the
illness which blighted veterans in the Gulf war, a senior
environmentalist warned Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- Tim Henman took another step towards achieving his dream of
being the first British man for 63 years to win the Wimbledon
singles title when he beat the Frenchman Cedric Pioline on Friday
to go through to the semi-finals.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaitis Start Voting For New Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti voters flocked to
the 190 polling stations across the country Saturday morning to
elect their ninth National Assembly (parliament) since 1963.
</P>
<P>
The eighth National Assembly was constitutionally dissolved by
Emir Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah in March 1998, following a deadlock
in relations between the parliament and government.
</P>
<P>
Polling stations in 42 schools across the state opened at 08:00
(0500 GMT) and will close at 20:00 (1700 GMT). Results are
expected to be made known at about midnight in the day.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, nearly 113,000 males are
eligible for the parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
A total of 288 registered candidates are contesting 50
parliamentary seats at the 25 constituencies in what is likely to
be the country's last all-male elections.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 500 people had originally registered for the race, but
over 200 of them pulled out as the deadline for withdrawal came on
June 28.
</P>
<P>
Among the 288 candidates, roughly one third are new face.
</P>
<P>
Since there are no official political parties in Kuwait,
candidates are representing different government-tolerated
political groups. Some prominent and influential political figures
are even running as independents.
</P>
<P>
Tribal groups are expected to be dominant elements in the
elections as more than half of the constituencies are considered
to be tribal areas.
</P>
<P>
Candidates in the three main Islamic groups -- the Islamic
Popular Movement or Salaf, the Islamic Constitutional Movement
(ICM) and the Shia National Islamic Alliance (NIA) -- are also
believed to be competitive.
</P>
<P>
Like other oil rich Gulf nations, Kuwait suffered grave losses
over the past couple of years due to the sagging oil prices in the
global market, domestic issues, especially economy-related ones,
have been dominating the platforms of most candidates during the
past two months of fierce campaign.
</P>
<P>
The candidates called on the private sector to play a more
important role in the country's economy by employing more
national manpower, and promised to work on it if elected to the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Some candidates also focused their speeches on the importance
of cooperation between the parliament and government.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation crises triggered by policy differences between the
legislature and the executive authority have led to the
dissolution of the last parliament and the mass resignation of
the former cabinet in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
Compared with economy, national security, the key issue in
the 1992 elections, took a backseat in the elections campaign
speeches of most candidates.
</P>
<P>
Most candidates and voters said that they are feeling "more
secure at home and the defense agreements Kuwait signed with
foreign countries after the 1991 Gulf war are the main reason for
less preoccupation with national security in 1999."

<HEADLINE> Kenya Closes Illegal Fuel Filling Stations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has closed
down 25 fuel filling stations in capital Nairobi as they have no
licenses or site plans.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary Crispus Mutitu of the Energy Ministry
Friday announced that among those closed stations, 22 did not have
licenses, 23 had on site plans while five were built on road
reserves and two had defective fire fighting equipment.
</P>
<P>
He said his government would continue to crack down on the
illegal depots until those guilty are kicked out of operation,
mass media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the illegal stations comes in the wake of deaths
of two people who were burned to death in a fuel-related explosion
Wednesday evening at a makeshift filling station in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Mutitu warned that anybody found to have set up petroleum
retailing business illegally would be charged in courts of law and
be required to demolish the installation.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that liberalization of the petroleum sector
was not meant to usher in indiscipline and reckless disregard of
the law.
</P>
<P>
A committee of all licensing organization would be set up to
approve licenses for filling stations and to avoid ambiguity in
issuing such licences, Mutitu announced.
</P>
<P>
To streamline the operation of the sector in the country, other
measures to be undertaken include no allocation of road reserves
for fuel retailing, inspection sites and installation to ensure
compliance with safety and environmental requirements before
issuing licenses, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Zookeepers have called in fire
fighters to pump water out of China's second largest zoo in
Shanghai, which has been beseiged by floodwaters for the past two
days.
</P>
<P>
The zoo is in a low-lying area in the western part of the city
and the heaviest rainfall in the century almost turned it into a
marine world with a meter of water.
</P>
<P>
Zookeepers had to move a three-day-old giraffe to the second
floor of their office building as water levels rose as high as the
mother's neck in the animal shelter, located at the lowest point
in the zoo.
</P>
<P>
The zoo bought two truckloads of bricks to build a dam around
the giraffe shelter and called in four fire engines Friday to pump
the water out.
</P>
<P>
The chimps and gorillas moved a bit faster and found
comfortable refuges on top of rockeries or trees in the primate
building.
</P>
<P>
Even though the firefighters have been working hard to move
half the water out of the zoo, half of it is still under water and
the keepers are using boats to carry feed to the animals, and,
since the kitchen lost its electricity, their meals have been cut
from three to two every day.
</P>
<P>
However, the two brown bears seem glad to have a new swimming
pool down in the front yard, but it's too bad they can't be
watched - the zoo has been closed to visitors for the past two
days.
</P>
<P>
The zoo has successfully moved all 6,000 animals to dry ground
except for two pheasants, which drowned at the height of the
flooding. "This is the first time for anything like this to happen
in the zoo's 45-year history, said the curator Shi Xinquan.
</P>
<P>
He said that now that the rainfall has stopped, they will be
able to clean up and reopen the zoo on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Ready to Evacuate Residents Near Mayon Volcano </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Saturday that evacuation centers are ready to help residents
living in the areas near Mayon Volcano if the volcano's eruption
forces them to leave their homes.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview here Saturday morning, Defense Secretary
Orlando Mercado said that regional and provincial disaster
coordinating councils have put in place disaster relief and
prevention measures in the area as Mayon has showed signs of
imminent explosion.
</P>
<P>
"Our evacuation centers are ready. We have already alerted all
those concerned. Even our armed forces are ready to help," said
Mercado, who also chairs the National Disaster Coordinating
Council.
</P>
<P>
He said that his office has made needed preparations since
Mayon started spewing smoke and ash on June 22.
</P>
<P>
While the government is ready to assist residents there, the
biggest enemy remains the stubbornness of some residents who
insist on staying at their homes, Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
Mayon, about 330 kilometers southeast of Manila, may erupt in
the coming days or weeks, and the country's disaster and relief
agencies should beef up contingency measures for an eruption,
experts warned.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology
(Phivolcs) said Friday that Mayon has showed signs of imminent
explosion and alert level two is being maintained.
</P>
<P>
Alert level two means the permanent danger zone around Mayon
has been extended from six kilometers to seven kilometers and
people within the danger zone should be evacuated.
</P>
<P>
Prompted by the imminent explosion of the volcano, the Albay
provincial disaster coordinating center hastened the evacuation of
about 18,000 residents within the danger zone.
</P>
<P>
While the Education Department Friday ordered the suspension of
classes in schools in the vicinity of Mayon, Defense Secretary
Mercado ordered the pre-positioning in Albay of resources like
food supplies, transportation and manpower.
</P>
<P>
Mayon had a mild eruption on June 22 and the eruption only
lasted about 10 minutes. No casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
During the eruption, a high column of ash and smoke was seen on
Mayon's crater, but the volcano calmed down one hour after its
eruption.
</P>
<P>
Mayon, the most active volcano in the world, has erupted at
least 40 times since 1616. The volcano's eruption on February 2,
1993 killed 78 people and affected 17,119 persons.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Govt Extends Amnesty to "Terrorists" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
decided to extend general amnesty for terrorists to surrender till
July 30 this year, newspapers here reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was voiced by Home Minister Mohammad Nasim on
Friday, when 386 armed terrorists officially surrendered to the
government in the southwestern Khulna district, laying down their
arms.
</P>
<P>
The outlaws, the second batch in a row within a month,
deposited 282 firearms, including one light machine gun, five
rifles and 45 Indian Shutter guns. Some 210 persons laid down
their arms in early June at the first surrender ceremony in
Jessore district, 146 kilometers southwest of here.
</P>
<P>
The combing operation to catch the outlaws and other gun-toting
elements started on April 22 and will continue after the deadline,
said the home minister. "A more stringent combing operation will
start immediately after the end of the deadline" and "the
operation will continue until the last bastion of terrorists is
squashed," he declared.
</P>
<P>
He urged terrorists still underground to return to normal life,
promising to do everything to rehabilitate them.
</P>
<P>
In the over-two-month countrywide operation, some 6,5000
suspects have been held by law-enforcing agencies, mainly in the
southwestern districts, in the wake of a spurt of violence.
</P>
<P>
The country's southwestern region has reportedly become a haven
for outlawed extremists, with fierce rivalry resulting in many
deaths and rising crimes. Many people there have deserted their
ancestral homes in search of security, reports said.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand FM Opposes Advocacy of Merging NZ into Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Minister of Foreign
Affairs and Trade Don Mckinnon has showed his opposition to the
advocacy of merging New Zealand into Australia.
</P>
<P>
The Evening Post Saturday quoted the minister as saying that
advocating New Zealand become "the seventh state" of Australia
would be "death" for any New Zealand political party.
</P>
<P>
Mckinnon made the remarks Friday in response to a question
raised at the University of Otago's 34th annual foreign policy
school in Dunedin, a city on New Zealand's South Island.
</P>
<P>
"If Australia becomes a republic, New Zealand will soon follow
suit," the Wellington-based newspaper quoted the minister as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Mckinnon said closer economic links are likely, given extensive
travel and other ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
If European Union countries with different languages could form
 close ties, it "would be the wrong thing" for two similar
countries in the South Pacific "to be heading in opposing
directions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gradually increased cooperation would be acceptable, Mckinnon
said, adding he is not sure that people would be prepared to
accept change over a few key issues, such as sovereignty or
separate currency, either this generation or next.

WEIHAI, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A large gold mine went into
operation here Friday in east China's Shandong Province, the
country's leading gold producer.
</P>
<P>
Daye Gold Mine, located in the City of Rushan in east Shandong,
is proved to have 19.6 tons of gold reserves of industrial
development.
</P>
<P>
The open-cut mine, with total investment of 126 million yuan,
will produce 3,000 kg of gold annually when it becomes fully
operational in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Daye Gold Mine is based on a mixed mine which went into
production in 1985, but met with difficulties because of possible
limited gold resources. A group of scientists from the Chinese
Academy of Sciences spent years on studying the local geological
structure and finally discovered a new type of gold deposits there.

<HEADLINE> DPRK, U.N. Command Meeting Yields No Agreement </HEADLINE>

<P>
PYONGYANG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Generals of the Democratic People
's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the U.S.-led United Nations
Command (UNC) remained wide apart after meeting for the third time
over the recent inter-Korean naval clash, press reports said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At the 90-minute meeting in the U.N. truce village Panmunjom on
Friday, Lieutenant General of the DPRK People's Army Ri Chan Bok
said South Korean warships intruded into the DPRK's territorial
waters more than 70 times after the two sides exchanged gunfire in
the Yellow Sea on June 15.
</P>
<P>
He said that upholding the so-called Northern Limit Line -- a
sea border unilaterally demarcated by the UNC in 1953 -- is "in
defiance of the arms truce" and "in serious violation of
international law."
</P>
<P>
To prevent further clashes in the Yellow Sea, Ri said the U.S.-
led UNC should abandon the Northern Limit Line and withdraw all
warships in the disputed area. Any aggressive act and military
provocation against the DPRK's territorial waters should be
stopped while those responsible for the June 15 crossfire should
be punished.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides should first reach an agreement in
principle at the general level before sitting down on related
practical measures.
</P>
<P>
The UNC delegation, led by U.S. Major General Michael Dunn,
defended the Northern Limit Line as sea border. The meeting broke
up without any agreement like its predecessors on June 15 and 22.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Most of the major rivers in three of
the Bangladesh's four river basins continued to rise Friday as
heavy monsoon rains pounded vast areas of the country during the

Kurigram during the past few days, local officials said, adding
that the situation still remained static on Friday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Govt Slashes Crude Palm Oil Export Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
announced a cut in export taxes on crude palm oil (CPO) to 10
percent from 30 percent in line with falling international prices,
The Jakarta Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Industry and Trade Rahardi Ramelan said the cut is
expected to give more incentives for local CPO producers to export
their products.
</P>
<P>
The new tax, however, would be effective only after the
minister of finance approves it, Rahardi said.
</P>
<P>
Export taxes on refined bleached deodorized (RBD) palm oil and
RBD palm olein were lowered to 8 percent from a previous 22
percent.
</P>
<P>
The government also slashed taxes on exports of crude palm
olein to 8 percent from 26 percent, crude palm kernel oil to zero
from 20 percent and RBD palm kernel oil also to zero from 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
It also reduced the export tax on prepackaged RBD olein not
exceeding five kilograms in volume to zero from 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
It lowered export taxes on crude stearin to zero from 15
percent and RBD stearin also to zero from 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The export taxes on crude coconut oil and RBD coconut oil
remained at zero.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, the world's second biggest producer of CPO, slapped
the levy on CPO and its derivatives after the rupiah nose-dived at
the onset of the financial crisis, making exports much more
profitable than domestic sales and leading to staggering shortages
of cooking oil.
</P>
<P>
Export tax on CPO was lowered to 30 percent early last month
from 40 percent in February and 60 percent in September last year.
</P>
<P>
The high export tax on CPO products has been widely criticized
specially after the rupiah strengthened to 8,000 rupiah against
the U.S. dollar late in May.
</P>
<P>
Many CPO producers have subsequently stopped their export
activities, adding more pressure to the already depressed local
market.
</P>
<P>
The government has estimated this year's CPO production at 6.9
million tons, or 2.8 million tons above domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
CPO production could reach 7.4 million tons in the year 2000
and 8.6 million tons in 2001, against a projected domestic demand
of 4.5 million and 5.1 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine to Send Peacekeeping Troops to Kosovo on Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's parliament issued a
statement Friday, allowing Ukrainian peacekeepers to be sent to
Kosovo, Yugoslavia, if NATO pays for the expenses.
</P>
<P>
The statement reaffirmed that Ukraine has advocated a peaceful
settlement of the Kosovo crisis since the very beginning and is
willing to take part in the U.N.-authorized international
peacekeeping mission in the war-torn Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
But the lawmakers said that the peacekeeping expenses of the
Ukrainian forces should be covered by NATO, which bombed
Yugoslavia for more than 11 weeks from March 24 to early June and
inflicted enormous losses on the Yugoslav people.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's troops should not be under the NATO command, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The parliament also expressed worries that the NATO-dominated
peacekeeping forces will not be able to prevent violence in Kosovo,
where such incidents have not ceased since NATO peacekeepers began
to be deployed in the middle of June.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo was divided into five peacekeeping sectors dominated
separately by forces from the United States, Britain, Italy,
France and Germany under an agreement reached by NATO and Yugoslav
generals last month at the end of the war.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged the ukrainian government to prepare
proposals for the parliament to consider on deployment, including
the place, concrete tasks, number of troops and weapon equipment,
after discussions with the United Nations and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that 1,400 Ukrainian troops are ready to
head for Kosovo once the parliament and the president make the
final decision.

<HEADLINE> Network to Improve Nation's Re-employment Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 100 Chinese cities are
expected to be included in an unprecedented employment information
network by 2000, according a senior labor official.
</P>
<P>
Liu Danhua, an official with the Ministry of Labor and Social
Security, said that the network will serve 45 percent of China's
cities with populations of either more than one million or between
500,000 to one million, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
And all the involved cities, located in central and western
parts of China, are with considerable economic capabilities and an
active labor flow.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, employment agencies in the medium and large-
sized cities will be computerized by the end of this century,
which will enable at least 60 percent of employment information to
be available on the network.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, there were 35,449 employment agencies, 3.4
percent more than the previous year, among which 6,732 were run by
either non-governmental organizations or individuals, 14.8 percent
up than 1997.
</P>
<P>
Labor and Security Vice-Minister Lin Yongsan said at a press
conference that 3 million more workers are expected to be laid off
from State-owned enterprises by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
And related statistics show that the number of laid-off workers
in China by last April was 5.7 million, and the national
unemployment rate was 3.1 percent by the end of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Families Spend More on Child Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese people are showing a
definite propensity to spend money on education, especially on
child education.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, the expenditures on education
for the average family in South China's Guangdong Province have
grown at some 12 percent annually for the last three consecutive
years.
</P>
<P>
And the per capita spending increased from 313 yuan (38 U.S.
dollars) in 1995 to 433 in 1998, which is higher than that of the
spending in entertainment and travels.
</P>
<P>
The money spent on child education mostly goes to tuition,
various fees and extracurricular training such as piano and art
courses.
</P>
<P>
Continuing education for Guangdong adults has also gained
popularity, with per capita spending reaching 58 yuan in 1998,
some 50 percent up than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Private schools are playing an important role in offering
educational opportunities in Guangdong, which have trained 2.6
million residents throughout the province since 1979. And some 230,
000 people attended private schools in 1998 in spite of the annual
tuition fees as high as several thousand yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Central government encourages enterprises or other
institutions to operate private schools so as to help provide more
opportunities for young people.
</P>
<P>
Major university have increased fees for their most popular
disciplines. For example, MBA majors in the South China University
of Science and Engineering will pay annual tuition and fees as
much as 10,000 yuan, with an additional 1,000 yuan for textbooks.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Women Shooters to Practice Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Three of Indonesia's top women
shooters are set for an overseas training in Brunei Darussalam in
order to adjust to local conditions ahead of the 20th Southeast
Asian (SEA) Games, The Jakarta Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Coach Benny Mamoto said Sarmunah, Rina Dwi Kusumaningtyas and
Titin Indrawati would leave the country on Saturday for one-month
intensive preparations before the biennial event.
</P>
<P>
"We want them to be able to adjust to the venue and conditions
in Brunei. We also want to find shooting partners for them. The
bullet price there is also one-third cheaper than in Indonesia,
where it costs 1,200 rupiah (0.18 U.S. dollar) each," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mamoto said the National Sports Council (KONI) had only set a
target of two silver medals, due to a crisis-induced shortfall of
funds at the Indonesian Target Shooting and Hunting Association.
</P>
<P>
Lack of competition at home also contributed to the plan to
send the shooters abroad.
</P>
<P>
"Our athletes have been training maximally despite our
financial problem. As a solution, we gave them a dry shooting
session during half of the training period since May 1," Mamoto
said.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Indonesia bagged one gold and one silver in the
clay double trap event.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Irene Truitje Joseph better her national record in
the women's 200 meters on the second day of national athletic team
selection for the SEA Games, but there was a hitch in the plans of
favored middle distance runner Supriati Sutono.
</P>
<P>
Irene clocked 23.82 seconds, 0.10 seconds faster than her 23.92
recorded during the two-day simulation event held here on April 30.
</P>
<P>
But Indonesia's best hope Supriati, the 1998 Asian Games gold
medalist, withdrew from the women's 1,500 meters due to a minor
left foot injury. Supriati is predicted to win three golds in the
Games in the 1,500, 5,000 and 10,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
Coach Hary Setiono hoped Supriati could recover in one month
remaining before the Games in Brunei Darussalam.

<HEADLINE> More Sri Lankans Find Foreign Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-five thousand Sri Lankan
workers found employment abroad during the first six months of
1999, a 28-percent increase over the corresponding period last
year, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
There was a significant increase in Sri Lankans who found
employment in Saudi Arabia during the period, said L.K. Ruhunage,
Deputy General Manager of the Foreign Employment Bureau of Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Those employed in Middle East countries account for 80 percent
of the total while the remaining 20 percent found work in Greece,
Italy, Cyprus, the Maldives, South Korea, China's Hong Kong,
Seychelles and South Africa, Ruhunage said.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-nine percent of workers found jobs in Saudi Arabia, and
17 percent in Kuwait. In the meantime, 15 percent found jobs in
the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1.2 million Sri Lankans working abroad bringing
large amount of foreign exchange into the country. In 1998, Sri
Lankan migrant workers remitted back 60 billion rupees (880
million U.S. dollars), 60 percent of which were sent by house

<HEADLINE> 20 Percent of Forest Cover Down in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's forest cover is
dwindling at the rate of 50,000 per year, according to the latest
statistics by the Sri Lankan Forest Conservation Department (FCD)
here.
</P>
<P>
Today, the country's forest cover has dropped to almost 20
percent from the 70 percent recorded in 1990, the FCD said.
</P>
<P>
It also warns that if the denudation continues at this rate
unchecked, the time when the country will lose its entire forest
cover is not for away.
</P>
<P>
The rapid denuding of the country's forest cover was mainly to
the large-scale agricultural expansion and irrigation schemes, the
FCD pointed out that shifting cultivation has also contributed to
the degradation of forest cover.
</P>
<P>
Timber and other forest resources generate an income of 70
million U.S. dollars a year, and over 98 percent of rural energy
needs and 78 percent of those of the urban population are met from
firewood, according to the FCD.
</P>
<P>
The FCD called for greater public cooperation and public
involvement to protect the country's forest cover.
</P>
<P>
Measures such as the community participatory forestry program,
the massive forest conservation and management plan have been
taken to address the problem, but there is still the need to make
people aware of the disastrous consequences, the FCD added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Sports Council Seeks Input on SEA Games Team Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports Council
(KONI) will invite coaches and sports officials to provide input
on its team lineup for the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in
Brunei Darussalam next month, The Jakarta Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
KONI's official in charge of athletes development Mochamad
Hindarto said that he would listen to the opinions of coaches and
officials from 20 sports on Monday before setting up a tentative
lineup.
</P>
<P>
Results of the discussion will be brought to KONI's chairman
Wismoyo Arismunandar on Tuesday for approval.
</P>
<P>
Hindarto said he would fly to Bandar Seri Begawan on Friday to
personally submit the team lineup to Games organizers. The
deadline for entries is July 10.
</P>
<P>
"The reason I am calling coaches and officials is because I
need to listen to second opinions from them. I can't make the
decision myself. Hopefully we can get the chairman's approval on
Wednesday at the latest," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will compete in 20 sports in the SEA Games. Most
sports organizations have submitted the names of their athletes.
The exceptions are track and field, tennis and soccer.
</P>
<P>
Hindarto said 11 sports set a gold-medal target in the biennial
event from August 7 to 15, with the remaining nine sports still in
doubt over their goals. He declined to identify the sports.
</P>
<P>
Hindarto complained that several sports, mainly team event
sports, had yet to set up competitive trials.
</P>
<P>
SEA Games training executive director Imron Z.S. said some of
the teams performed poorly during training, but he refused to
divulge the sports.
</P>
<P>
KONI is also seeking input from journalists invited to attend a
discussion on Saturday. The discussion will focus on the
possibility for Indonesia to retain its overall title and win more
than 70 golds.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KONI finally received financial funding from State
Minister of the Empowerment of State Enterprises Tanri Abeng to
finance not only the SEA Games contingent, but also sports
development in general.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum of understanding was signed on Friday by Tanri and
KONI's chairman Wismoyo Arismunandar.
</P>
<P>
A total of 159 state enterprises will allocate a portion of
their annual profits to sports development through KONI, "but we
have yet to decide on the percentage of the profits," Tanri said.
</P>
<P>
State enterprises are expected to provide between one percent
and 5 percent of the profits to struggling and small businesses
under partnership programs established by Tanri's office.
</P>
<P>
Tanri said that state enterprises could promote their products
in any sports event as part of the partnership deals with KONI.
</P>
<P>
He was confident the cooperation could also boost profits of
the state enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Castro Returns to Cuba After Attending Rio Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro
returned here Friday from Brazil, where he attended the first
summit of Latin America, the Caribbean and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day summit early this week, the 72-year-old Cuban
president expressed strong support for economic cooperation with
the EU, which he said may well serve as a counterweight against
the U.S. influence in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
"It is better to have two or three major economic blocs than
just one," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban leader said the summit was "a good start" for Latin
Americans and Europeans to sit together to discuss trade and
investment without the U.S. presence.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the fact that the summit did not explicitly
condemn in its "Declaration of Rio de Janeiro" the U.S. Helms-
Burton law that hardened the U.S. embargo against Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Panama Canal Tolls to Remain Unchanged in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Panama Canal will keep the
present tolls after its restoration to the Panamanian sovereignty
in the year 2000, Alberto Aleman Zubieta, the interoceanic
waterway administrator, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the Panamanian cabinet council has
approved the stability of tolls starting next January 1.
</P>
<P>
"However, it must be expected that as time goes, there will be
a need to increase the tolls, as it has been done in the last 85
years," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Panama Canal Commission, a United States federal agency,
that will continue administering the waterway until December 31
this year, increased the tolls on seven occasions since 1914.
</P>
<P>
The canal official said that the waterway will obtain more
resources in the next century with the modernization of its
installations and the larger number of users.
</P>
<P>
"The international maritime cargo will continue prevailing in
the future and it is expected that in the next 40 years the cargo
moved along the canal will grow from 200,000 tons to 800,000 tons
a year," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Canal Administrative Authorities, total income
of the Canal reached 734 million U.S. dollars in 1998, including
545 million dollars of transit tolls. An average number of 36
ships passed though the Canal every day last year.

<HEADLINE> No Systematic Deviations in Election: Indonesian Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Independent Committee for
Election Monitoring (KIPP) has concluded that there were no
systematic deviations in the June 7 election in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"Although there was a lot of problems and violations, there had
been no indication of systematic deceits or political engineering
during the elections," KIPP Secretary General Mulyana W. Kusumah
said.
</P>
<P>
Mulyana said the KIPP regarded the June election as fair and
free and would recognize the final vote count.
</P>
<P>
The committee however urged relevant law enforcement bodies
including the Supreme Court to investigate the violations and
deviations.
</P>
<P>
"The Supreme Court must take stern measures against all forms
of violations," Antara News Agency Saturday quoted Mulyana as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The KIPP has recorded 148,689 violations on voting day, in
which 84,950 cases disturbed the vote count process.
</P>
<P>
Mulyana said the irregularities were the result of often
unskilled human resources, the lack of law enforcement and the
lack of a campaign rules socialization program.
</P>
<P>
In its report, KIPP had also found three murder cases, 20 cases
of physical harm and 34 cases of violence during the elections.
</P>
<P>
The KIPP has also urged the General Election Commission (KPU)
and the National Elections Committee (PPI) to prioritize the vote
counting, as the two bodies would announce the election's final
results.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the PPI Jacob Tobing Friday said the PPI will start
national-level vote counting on July 6.
</P>
<P>
The PPI had previously planned to start the count on June 21
but was unable to meet this schedule because not all provincial
committees had submitted the results of their vote counts by then.
</P>
<P>
Tobing said the counting would be done in stages, starting with
returns from provinces that had already sent in vote count
tabulations and documents.
</P>
<P>
Out of 27 provinces, 12 provincial election committees had yet
to convey the results of their vote counts to the PPI because of
various problems such as the discovery of irregularities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Considering the fact that the KPU had until now not yet
finished the vote count, President B.J. Habibie Friday predicted
that the general meeting of the People's Consultative Assembly
(MPR) -- originally set for late August -- will undergo a delay.
</P>
<P>
Habibie made the prediction at a meeting with a group of House
of Representatives (DPR) members at the State Palace here,
according to DPR Vice Speaker Abdul Gafur who led the
parliamentary delegation.
</P>
<P>
"August 29 (the date originally set for the installation of new
MPR members) will be impossible. He (the president) predicted it
will now take place by the end of September or early October,"
Gafur was quoted by Antara as saying.
</P>
<P>
At its forthcoming general meeting, the MPR will elect the
country's next president and vice president.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Needs No Debt Relief Program: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia does not need a debt
relief program as it is not categorized as a highly-indebted poor
country, Coordinating Minister for Economic, Financial and
Industrial Affairs Ginandjar Kartasasmita said.
</P>
<P>
But rescheduling of Indonesia's foreign debts may be one of the
topics to be discussed at a meeting of the Consultative Group on
Indonesia (CGI) to be held in Paris later this month, Antara News
Agency Saturday quoted Ginandjar as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Indonesia had always been a good debt payer.
It was only in 1998 that it asked for a rescheduling of 4.5
billion U.S. dollars worth of debts.
</P>
<P>
At the CGI meeting scheduled for July 27-28, Indonesia would
request a rescheduling of an additional 2.6 billion to 2.7 billion
dollars in debts, Ginandjar added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, certain parties in the country proposed that the
government propose a debt relief program to the World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other donors as Indonesia's
foreign debt burden has already assumed worrying proportions.
</P>
<P>
According to Econit, an independent economic research
institute, Indonesia's foreign debts have reached a total amount
of 151.5 billion dollars, of which 67.4 billion dollars are
government debts and the rest private sector debts.
</P>
<P>
If Indonesia did not ask for debt relief, it would eventually
be unable to free itself from indebtedness, Econit researcher Arif
Arryman said.
</P>
<P>
He added that debt rescheduling would only be a temporary way
out that does not address the core of the problem.
</P>
<P>
A number of non-governmental organizations are also campaigning
for a debt relief program.

<HEADLINE> Murderer of 8 Girls Sentenced to Death in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A man who murdered eight girls in
Beijing was sentenced to death Friday by the Beijing N0. 1
Intermediate People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Lianrong, 37, a resident of west Beijing's Shijingshan
District, was found guilty of killing eight girls, aged between 18
and 24, on the early morning of May 30.
</P>
<P>
This is the worst homicide case in the Chinese capital in the
past 50 years, and aroused great public concern.
</P>
<P>
The eight women, all salesgirls at the Fujian Jindeli
Handicraft Co. Ltd, lived in a rented flat next to Zhao's in an
apartment building in N0. 23 compound on the Shijingshan Road.
</P>
<P>
Zhao, a worker of a Beijing machine tools plant, broke into the
girls' flat, searching for money and valuables at about three o'
clock on the early morning of May 30.
</P>
<P>
He stabbed the eight girls in the neck and chest more than 110
times and fled after failing to find money and valuables.
</P>
<P>
Zhao was arrested on the early morning of June 6 by the Beijing
police and was indicted on June 21 by the N0. 1 Branch of the
Beijing People's Procuratorate on homicide charges.
</P>
<P>
The court heard the interrogations Friday, carried out the
cross-examination and listened to the final statements of the
prosecutors and the defence lawyer.
</P>
<P>
Zhao committed murder, the court decided and thus reached the
verdict according to the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of
China.

BRASILIA, July 2 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government will
provide loans of 500 million reals (about 294 million U.S. dollars)
for the construction of medium-sized hotels in places of tourist
attraction across the country, Minister of Development, Industry

</P>
<P>
The loans will be provided by the National Bank for Economic

the country, with a maturity period of 12 years for the northern,
northeastern and mid-western regions, but only 10 years for other
regions, Lafer said.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rican Mission Leaves for EU to Negotiate Banana Quotas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 2 (Xinhua) -- A Costa Rican delegation led by
Foreign Trade Minister Samuel Guzowski will leave here Sunday for
Brussels to negotiate the quotas of banana exports to the EU
market.
</P>
<P>
Guzowski said Friday that is an exploratory trip, and that he
will meet in Brussels with European Commission Vice President Leon
Brittan.
</P>
<P>
He said Costa Rica wants to know the European position on the
Central American bananas exports, after a World Trade Organization
(WTO) decision made it mandatory to change the quota system now in
force.
</P>
<P>
The present system favors Costa Rica, which supplies a little
more than 25 percent of that market.
</P>
<P>
Guzowski put forward a vigorous defense of the current
arrangement, although he admitted that the WTO decision requires
analysis of new possibilities.
</P>
<P>
"We want justice for Costa Rica, because we have signed an
agreement that must be respected," he said.
</P>
<P>
Several proposals are now on the table and Costa Rica prefers a
global quota system for all banana producing countries, under
which each one exports as much as it can.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed confidence in his country's
competitiveness in the world market.

<HEADLINE> Suleimanoglu to Prepare for Fourth Olympic Title Under Abadjiev </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, July 2 (Xinhua) - Three times Olympic weightlifting
champion Naim Suleimanoglu of Turkey will prepare for the 2000
Olympic Games in Sydney under his first coach Ivan Abadjiev.
</P>
<P>
Suleimanoglu, who was born in Bulgaria, arrived here on
Thursday evening and will stay till Saturday. He used to compete
for Bulgaria but emigrated to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"I will train both here and in Turkey. After some ten days
Ivan Abadjiev will visit me in Turkey and then we will specify the
details of my training programme. I will take part in the Sydney
Olympics only if I decide I am well prepared," said Suleimanoglu.
</P>
<P>
"I will train here together with some of my major opponents. I
still do not know in which category I will compete," said
Suleimanoglu.
</P>
<P>
He will probably compete in the 62 kg category, where Sevdalin
Minchev of Bulgaria tops the world rankings, followed by Greek
Leonidas Sabanis and Nikolai Peshalov, a Bulgarian-born lifter
competing for Croatia.
</P>
<P>
"While he was training under me, Naim was a diligent and
disciplined athlete. Even though I do not have direct impressions
from his physical state at present, I know that he is training
regularly and I believe he has real chances of success in Sydney,"
said Abadjiev, head coach of Bulgaria's national team.
</P>
<P>
Suleimanoglu delivered to the Bulgarian coach another
invitation on the part of the Turkish federation to coach the
Turks, but Abadjiev once again declined.
</P>
<P>
"I have taken the commitment to prepare Bulgaria's national
team for the Sydney Olympics. I am not the kind of person who
goes back on his word," said Abadjiev.
</P>
<P>
Abadjiev coached the Turkish national team before the Atlanta
Olympics in 1996, in which Suleimanoglu and another Turkish
weightlifter Halil Mutlu, also born in Bulgaria, won the golds.

<HEADLINE> Mayon Eruption Imminent, Warn Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' most active
volcano, Mayon, may erupt in the coming days or weeks, and the
country's disaster and relief agencies should beef up contingency
measures for an eruption, experts have warned.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology
(Phivolcs) said Friday that Mayon has showed signs of imminent
explosion and alert level two is being maintained.
</P>
<P>
Alert level two means the permanent danger zone around Mayon
has been extended from six kilometers to seven kilometers and
people within the danger zone should be evacuated.
</P>
<P>
Prompted by the imminent explosion of the volcano, which is
about 330 kilometers southeast of Manila, the Albay provincial
disaster coordinating center hastened the evacuation of about
18,000 residents within the danger zone, according to a Manila
Standard newspaper report.
</P>
<P>
While the Education Department ordered Friday the suspension of
classes in schools within the vicinity of Mayon, Defense Secretary
Orlando Mercado ordered the pre-positioning in Albay of resources
like food supplies, transportation and manpower.
</P>
<P>
Mayon had a mild eruption on June 22 and the eruption only
lasted about 10 minutes. No casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
During the eruption, a high column of ash and smoke were seen
on Mayon's crater, but the volcano calmed down an hour after its
eruption.
</P>
<P>
Mayon, the most active volcano in the world, has erupted at
least 40 times since 1616. The volcano's eruption on February 2,
1993 killed 78 people and affected 17,119 persons.

<HEADLINE> Man United Rules Out FA Cup Reprieve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Martin Edwards has dismissed any
possibility of Manchester United returning to next season's FA Cup.
</P>
<P>
The United chairman remains convinced that the club have no
option but to drop out of the Cup in order to participate in the
World Team Championship.
</P>
<P>
Sports Minister Tony Banks raised the possibility of United
taking part in the Cup as long as they competed in the inaugural
FIFA tournament in Brazil in January.
</P>
<P>
Banks is willing to consider any alternatives which are better
than the current proposal, but Edwards is adamant there will be no
reprieve.
</P>
<P>
United, Banks, the Football Association and the Premier League
spent weeks going through the various scenarios and Edwards claims
this is the only answer to the problem.
</P>
<P>
He insists the World Team Championship must take priority
because United do not want to damage England's 2006 World Cup bid.
</P>
<P>
"We have been through all this a thousand times and we have
looked at every single possibility," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There's no way we can fulfill our fixtures by competing in the
FA Cup.
</P>
<P>
"We need the FA Cup dates to catch up on our two league games
lost because of the World Team Championship.
</P>
<P>
"There's also the Sheffield Wednesday game, which has been
moved because of the World Club Championship in Tokyo. That makes
a total of three league games which we need to catch up on. If we
were involved in the FA Cup we would not be able to do this."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Midfielder Oliseh Joins Juventus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria midfielder Sunday Oliseh
joined Juventus on a five-year contract, the club announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
Oliseh, 25, had initially been linked to AS Roma but Juventus
said Friday he opted for the Turin side instead.
</P>
<P>
Oliseh spent one season in Italy, at Reggiana, several years
ago but failed to make his mark. After two years at FC Koln in
Germany, he was snapped up as a bargain by Ajax, eager to replace
star midfield dynamos like Clarence Seedorf, sold to Real Madrid,
and Edgar Davids, who will be one of his new team-mates at Juve.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the '90s he has been a fixture in the highly-skilled
but erratic Nigeria team that shone but ultimately failed to
fulfill its extravagant promise at last year's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Juventus did not disclose the terms of the contract that will
keep Oliseh in Turin until 2004.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Lawmakers Urge Further Probe Into Embassy Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Some U.S. Congressmen said here
on Thursday that the United States should make further
investigation on the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade to
find out truth about the tragic event.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers made the remarks at a meeting with Chinese
Ambassador Li Zhaoxing on Capitol Hill Thursday morning. The two
sides exchanged views on the current Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congressmen expressed their willingness to advance the
U.S.-China relations, support the "One China" policy, and to make
continued efforts for furthering economic and trade ties with
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
They voiced their "continuous and unconditional" support for
the renewal of China's Normal Trade Relations, and for the
country's access to the World Trade organization.
</P>
<P>
Some of the Congressmen also castigated the Cox report, saying
that there are "unfounded facts" and loopholes. The report also
treats the Chinese Americans "unfairly", they said, adding that
they will do as much as they can to prevent discrimination against
the Chinese Americans.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Li reiterated that the bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade by the U.S.-led NATO forces is an event with
serious consequences, which violates China's sovereignty, hurts
the feelings of the Chinese people and derails the Sino-U.S.
relations.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the United States must whole-heartedly
recognize the seriousness of the event, bear all responsibilities
for it, continue the investigation, give a thorough clarification
of the truth of the matter, take those responsible to justice, and
pay adequate and effective compensation immediately to relatives
of those killed and to those wounded in the bombing as well as for
property damages of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, so that the
issue could be settled in a responsible way as seen by the Chinese
government and the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the issue of Taiwan is China's internal affairs, Li
urged the United States to abide by the three joint communiques
between the two countries as well as commitments it has made on
the issue, stop selling advanced weaponry to Taiwan, stand against
the consideration of the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act which
seriously interferes with China's internal affairs, so that new
damages to the Sino-U.S. relations could be avoided.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Li also refuted the Cox report, saying that the
report, fraught with fabrications and rumors, will go down in the
history of world diplomacy as a laughingstock and a record of
notoriety.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the Cox report has undermined Sino-U.S. relations
and the U.S. side should take concrete measures to reduce its
negative impacts.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Congress should do more that are beneficial for
Sino-U.S. relations, rather go in the opposite direction," said Li
at the meeting.
