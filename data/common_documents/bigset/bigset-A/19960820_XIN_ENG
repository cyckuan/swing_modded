<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar to Rise against Deutsche Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar will rise
against the Deutsche mark this week on increasing hopes that the
Bundesbank will cut its securities repurchase rate on Thursday,
the Journal of Commerce reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve will meet on Tuesday, but few analysts
expect it to raise rates as a means to check inflation, as a
stream of data have already depicted an economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
Either action -- a cut by Germany or an increase by the Fed --
would help the dollar, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Deutsche mark was knocked lower Friday by rumors that
German M3 money supply data for July will fall sharply.
</P>
<P>
M3 is the sum of currency, demand deposits, commercial bank
time deposits and deposits at nonbank thrift institutions.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also could benefit from the U.S. international trade
report on Tuesday, analysts said. They forecast a small
improvement in the deficit for June, in part because there was an
unexpectedly sharp widening in the May gap.
</P>
<P>
Some expect the trade deficit to narrow to 8.7 billion U.S.
dollars in June from 10.9 billion U.S. dollars in May. They
forecast a decline in merchandise imports and a gain in service
exports.

<HEADLINE> Kremlin Denies Yeltsin Plans to Have Heart Surgery Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
has no plan to have a heart surgery abroad, his spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembsky announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky made the statement after a report in Time
magazine, a U.S. news weekly, said in its August 18 issue that the
Kremlin was considering sending Yeltsin abroad for double-bypass
surgery because Yeltsin's condition was serious.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Yeltsin was undertaking "a series of
routine preventive treatments before vacation" in a Moscow
suburb. Yeltsin was still working, the spokesman said, "he is not
planning any foreign trips."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's health has been a serious concern for months. The
Russian authorities have formally announced that Yeltsin will be
on a long vacation. But the place where Yeltsin will stay during
the vacation has never been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky said that Yeltsin had decided not to make a
speech marking the 5th anniversary of the failed Soviet coup this
week. Instead, a message from the president will be read by a
representative, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Wang Fengchao Meets Hong Kong Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Wang Fengchao, deputy director
of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council,
today exchanged views on issues of common concern with a
delegation from the Hong Kong Occupational Safety and Health
Council, led by its Chairman Leung Ping Chung.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting Wang said that there are only ten months
more for the return of Hong Kong to the motherland. The
preparations for the establishment of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) are being made in a good order.
</P>
<P>
The prime task is to achieve the work of submitting names of
candidates for the Selection Committee to choose the first SAR
government according to the specific method for the setting up of
the Selection Committee adopted by the Fourth Plenary Session of
the Preparatory Committee, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that this work is being done smoothly and the Hong
Kong people are taking an active part in it, adding that he was
pleased to note that personages from various sectors in Hong Kong
have taken 8,000 forms for submitting names of potential committee
candidates.
</P>
<P>
This fully shows the Hong Kong people's positive attitude
toward making preparations for the establishment of the SAR
government, he added.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that panels for Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR,
and for the provisional legislature, will hold respective meetings
in Beijing in September.
</P>
<P>
The Selection Committee shall recommend the candidate for the
first chief executive through local consultations or through
nomination and election after consultations in accordance with
the decision approved by the National People's Congress on April
4, 1990, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that according to the Basic Law for the Hong Kong
SAR, Hong Kong's democracy will be developed in a gradual and
orderly way.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said that the general election of the first Chief
Executive of the Hong Kong SAR is not in keeping with the
stipulations of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question on what efforts the Hong Kong
Occupational Safety and Health Council should make for the Hong
Kong's stable transition, Wang said that it is imperative to
strengthen safety training and education among the different
trades in Hong Kong, and prevent or reduce accidents to
protect the safety of Hong Kong workers.
</P>
<P>
This will benefit Hong Kong's stable transition, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang expressed the hope that the relevant organizations of the
Chinese mainland and Hong Kong will enhance cooperation and learn
from each other in labor protection.
</P>
<P>
This morning, the delegation conferred with Minister of Labor
Li Boyong, on matters related to the enhancement of cooperation
on professional safety.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Crime Legislation Weak in Africa, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Weak legislation, compounded by
lack of integration, is inhibiting efforts in Africa to combat
economic crime, a Zimbabwean minister said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the first Interpol conference on economic crime in
Africa, Zimbabwean Home Affairs Minister Dumiso Dabengwa said
such weakpoints have created a favourable atmosphere for
criminals.
</P>
<P>
"Certain inhibiting factors such as corruption and other
economic crimes in general tend to frustrate economic reform
programmes," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The continent is witnessing numerous frauds involving large
sums of money and other international crime syndicates are
becoming unabating, he warned.
</P>
<P>
He urged the conference to come up with workable solutions to
ensure smooth economic development.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, organized by Interpol, is being
attended by about 100 delegates from 23 African countries.

BELGRADE, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The NATO-led peace
Implementation Force in Bosnia (IFOR) today began destroying the
ammunition found at a Bosnian Serb munitions dump in eastern
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
It will take almost a week for the IFOR to destroy the 300 tons
of unauthorized arms and ammunition found on Friday in the village
of Margetici near the town of Sokolac, the Tanjug News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Serb army general staff warned in a statement on Friday
that the IFOR's action was a very "dangerous provocation," which
would cause unnecessary incidents and hamper the implementation of
the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the munitions dump was legitimately
registered and only defensive arms were stored there, which would
not threaten the IFOR or any others.
</P>
<P>
However, the IFOR said they knew nothing about the ammunition
dump, accusing the Serbs of violating the Dayton agreement signed
last November.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Issues Warning to Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu today warned Lebanon against any escalation of
hostilities in the Middle East, Israel Television reported.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remarks today during a tour of the Israeli
self-claimed "security zone" in south Lebanon, the first one since
he was elected Israeli prime minister in late May.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also visited the North Command of the Israeli Army
and the settlements along the border, saying that Israel would not
allow any attacks on its civilians or soldiers.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came after reports that the Lebanese pro-Iranian
Hezbollah might have acquired long-range Katyusha rockets capable
of reaching as far as Karmiel and Haifa's bayside suburbs, areas
over 30 kilometers away from the northern border.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, chief of staff of the army,
told the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee of the Knesset
(Israel's parliament) that Hezbollah has amassed an immense
arsenal in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We have information, although not confirmed, that they have
acquired 240-mm Katyusha rockets with a 40-kilometer range,
which creates a significant threat, a threat of another
dimension," Shahak reportedly said.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu said today that there is still no
confirmation of the reports that the guerrilla group in Lebanon
has acquired such long-range Katyusha rockets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli premier also called on Syria to renew
peace negotiations with Israel.

<P>
BEIJING, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Central Committee of
Communist Party of China (CPC) has ordered all localities to
implement its "1996-2000 National Cadre Education and Training
Program".
</P>
<P>
The coming five years will be a crucial period for the country
to enhance its reform and opening drive, to initiate a socialist
market economy, to realize the Ninth Five-Year Plan on National
Economy and Social Development, and to march towards the country's
long-term goals for 2010.
</P>
<P>
The cadre training program has been formulated by the CPC
central committee, with President Jiang Zemin at the core, in a
bid to improve the political quality of cadres of various levels,
which is a strategic and fundamental task concerning the party's
building and the socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
The program is focused on improving the political quality of
cadres to bring up an army of cadres who will stick to the
socialist road with Chinese characteristics, are willing to serve
the people "heart and soul", are both moral and gifted, and able
to meet the demands of the reform, opening and modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
The training should follow principals, such as linking theory
with practice, focusing on training leading cadres above
county-level, as well as leading cadres and experts in large and
medium state enterprises, especially middle-aged and young cadres.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, Party School of the CPC Central
Committee will train 1,000 young cadres in the coming five years,
while all provincial party schools will train at least 100 cadres
each every year.
</P>
<P>
The program also stresses the training of public servants,
administrative cadres in state firms, scientists and
technologists, ethnic minority cadres, women cadres, non-communist
party cadres and cadres living in poverty-stricken areas.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Policy on Jobs Differs from European Governments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Resulting from different
employment policies, U.S. unemployment has dropped by almost half
in the past 15 years while most of major Western nations have
shown a strong rise with little sign of improvement.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times said today that the long-term trends emerge
from detailed figures that the U.S. Labor Department has just
published.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that the U.S. joblessness peaked at 9.7
percent in 1982, the first full year of President Reagan's
administration. It declined steadily for the next seven years,
then rose again to 7.5 percent in 1992 when President Clinton was
elected.
</P>
<P>
Then it dropped again, hovering in recent months around the 5.6
percent level it reached last year. It stood at 5.4 percent in
July.
</P>
<P>
But Japan, which kept its unemployment rate as low as below 2
percent in 1960s and early 1970s, breaking that barrier only in
1976. A slow, steady rise over two decades pushed it over 3.5
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
France and especially West Germany also had a history of
keeping unemployment low in the 1960s and early 1970s. But in
1975, West German unemployment more than doubled to 3.4 percent.
And joblessness in France also rose sharply to 4.2 percent from
2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since then West Germany's rise has continued, reaching 6.5
percent last year with the percentage in the former East Germany
not being included.
</P>
<P>
French unemployment reached 11.5 percent last year and Italy's
12 percent, more than twice the U.S. rate. Figures for Japan,
Germany, France and Italy have continued to edge up in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Britain is the only major European country whose joblessness
peaked at 11.8 percent in 1983 and dropped to 8.3 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"There's a different focus of the government, especially in
France, Germany and Italy," said Mark Anderson, director of
international trade for the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
He explained that "they focus more on a fairer distribution of
income and not throwing someone on the street to work for whatever
wage he or she can get."
</P>
<P>
European governments worry a lot about unemployment, but have
failed to reverse the upward trend, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday a new French law went into effect that encourages
businesses to cut working hours and hire more workers. But the
paper said that many economists doubt if it will work.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi,
receiving here today Kuwaiti Crown Prince Sheikh Saad al-Abdullah
al-Sabah, stressed that his country "never gives up the
foundations" of the 1991 Middle East peace conference in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi awarded a medal of the Lebanese Cedar, the medal of the
highest rank in Lebanon, to Sheikh Saad, who arrived here at noon
today on the third leg of his Arab tour which also took him to
Egypt and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the medal-awarding ceremony, the Lebanese president
said that "the process of the just and comprehensive peace is
passing through a delicate circumstance."
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon, which was committed to the unity with the (Arab)
brothers for the just and comprehensive peace based on the
international resolutions and the land-for-peace principle when it
 entered the Madrid peace conference, never gives up these
foundations," Hrawi said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria will uphold this commitment for the
implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolutions 242, 338 and
425, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese president underlined his confidence that "the
state of Kuwait will never delay in supporting our position in
the peace process."
</P>
<P>
"We are defending our right and the Arab dignity," he said,
"because of that it is the most effective way for achieving the
joint Arab goals to deepen the Arab cooperation."
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti crown prince, on his part, praised Lebanon's
position supporting his country during the 1990-91 Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
"This position will not be forgotten by the sons of this
generation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"During the months when the Iraqi forces were staying in
Kuwait, Lebanon were with us in the political field, in the
propagandist field and in the military field," Sheikh Al-Sabah
said.
</P>
<P>
"Now it is the time for Kuwait to participate in
Lebanon's reconstruction in order to make all the Lebanese
feel that there is a position that the Kuwaitis will never
forget, that is the Lebanese brave position," he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is time for Kuwait to play a role in
returning Lebanon to its previous prosperity, expressing wish for
a recovery of stability, security and safety in Lebanon.

<P>
TOKYO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Sharp Corp. has reached a basic
agreement with the government of Sarawak in Malaysia to produce
microchips called application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs)
in the state capital of Kuching from late 1998, a Japanese
business daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The total cost for the semiconductor manufacturing project is
estimated at three billion ringgits (about 1.21 billion
U.S. dollars), of which 15 percent will be covered by Sharp, the
Nihon Deizai Shimbun said in a dispatch from Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and European companies will also participate in the
project at a joint venture to be set up with paid-up capital of
100 million ringgits, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
ASICs are microchips that can be customized to carry out
specific functions. They are resistant to wild fluctuations in
market prices for computer chips.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government plans to throw support behind the
Sarawak State-led project by granting a 10-year corporate tax
exemption to those that join it, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Sarawak in Kalimantan Island is the largest state in Malaysia
with abundant natural resources such as gas and lumber.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Condemns the U.S. Power Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) condemned U.S. President Bill Clinton for
signing the D'amato Bill tightening sanctions against Libya and
Iran.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the bill showed that "Washington's power
politics will get it nowhere," said Rodong Sinmun, DPRK's official
newspaper, in a commentary today.
</P>
<P>
Rather, the paper added, developments after the move showed
that the conflict of interests between the U.S. and its allies
were getting more serious.
</P>
<P>
Clinton signed the D'amato Bill on August 5 that punishes all
non-American companies investing 40 million U.S. dollars or more
annually in the energy projects of Libya or Iran.
</P>
<P>
The paper recalled, before the signing of the bill, "American
sanctions against Libya and Iran had failed to achieve the
expected results, and made Washington lose its leading role among
its allies."
</P>
<P>
Attempting to regain its influence over the oil-rich Middle
East region, Washington, on the pretext of "combating terrorism,"
passed the D'amato Bill, the paper pointed out.
</P>
<P>
However, in the past two weeks since the bill was signed, the
U.S. had drawn wide spread condemnation and rejection from Libya,
Iran, the European Union countries and the international
community, the paper concluded.

Japan's military war dead.

A commentary in the party's organ, Rodong Sinmun, said, the

Japan should take action to abandon its militarism and make
sincere apologies and compensation to all its victims, the
commentary demanded.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 18 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will hold a national
emergency drill from August 19 to 23 to test the nation's crisis
management readiness, said a government official today.
</P>
<P>
During the five-day contingency exercise, code-named "Ulchi
Exercise '96," a curfew will be imposed, night business will be
suspended and vehicular traffic be limited in specific areas.
</P>
<P>
The government offices across the country will hold emergency
meetings, trainings and other drills under mock crisis situations.
</P>
<P>
This year's war game will be a real-situation one, a shift from
the simulated-situation exercise on the map conducted over the
past years, the official said.
</P>
<P>
During the exercise period, he said, power outages and other
mock-up contingencies will be staged area by area at night or
during time slots when inconveniences are least expected.
</P>
<P>
Tap water supply will be suspended for three to four hours in
one area after another in 34 regions.
</P>
<P>
"Sippuje," or an anti-traffic congestion formula that forces
private cars to remain parked once every 10 days, will be enforced
in 20 cities and areas.
</P>
<P>
In addition, midnight curfews, abolished in early 1982, will be
briefly revived in 13 cities and regions, affecting the operating
hours of entertainment spots.
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic element of the exercise is an unscheduled
anti-air attack drill that will be conducted nationwide at an
unfixed time on August 21, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Ulchi Exercise is designed to promote the people's sense of
national security and prepare them for any emergencies, such as
natural disasters, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 19 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and the United States
today began their 12-day annual command post exercise, "Ulchi
Focus Lens (UFL)."
</P>
<P>
The drill, which is a kind of map exercise using computer war
game programs without the mobilization of troops, will involve
military units of army corps, naval fleet and air force wing-class
and above on the South Korean side.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. side, some 15,000 American troops are expected to
participate.
</P>
<P>
At present, a total of 37,000 U.S. troops are stationed in
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The exercise is designed to evaluate and improve coordination
procedures, plans and systems necessary for the conduct of
contingency operations of the two countries on the Korean
Peninsula, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
As part of the UFL, a national emergency drill, "Ulchi
Exercise '96," also started throughout South Korea today.
</P>
<P>
During the five-day exercise, government offices across the
country involving all government administrative units will hold
emergency meetings, trainings and other drills under mock crisis
situations to test the nation's crisis management readiness.
</P>
<P>
Power outages and other mock-up contingencies will be staged
area by area at night or during time slots when inconveniences are
least expected. Tap water supply will be suspended for three to
four hours in one area after another in 34 regions across the
country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "sippuje," or an anti-traffic congestion formula
that forces private cars to remain parked one in every 10 days,
will be enforced in 20 cites and areas.
</P>
<P>
In addition, midnight curfews, abolished in early 1982, will be

</P>
<P>
The most dramatic element of the national emergency drill is an
unscheduled anti-air attack exercise that will be conducted
nationwide at an unfixed time on August 21.
</P>
<P>
South Korea and the U.S. used to hold the UFL annually from
1976 to 1990, but separated the UFL into two smaller exercises,
Ulchi and Focus lens, from 1991 through 1993.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, however, decided to combine the two
exercises in 1994 due to the judgement that the separation of the
two exercises lowered the efficiency of the exercise.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has condemned the
South Korea-U.S. exercise, which it described as "military
provocations" to the DPRK.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Continues Searching for Missing Fishermen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's navy and coast guards
today continued combing waters off the coast of Thanh Hoa Province
to search for fishermen still missing after whirlwind and
associated tropical storms hit the area last wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The disaster left Thanh Hoa, 100 km south of Hanoi, with at
least 95 fishermen dead and another 519 missing.
</P>
<P>
According to an official of the Central Committee for Flood and
Storm Control, the search for survivors was carried out despite
the rough seas in what was described as the worst disaster since
1989 when a storm killed 740 people.
</P>
<P>
The official added by last Friday noon, 614 fishermen out of a
total number of 1,785 who were fishing offshore had not returned.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the big number of missing fishermen to the
absence of effective radio communications among them.
</P>
<P>
Also in Thanh Hoa province, the disaster had left as many as
15,000 people homeless, with almost all rice fields and villages
along the coast submerged in deep water.
</P>
<P>
By this time, a third level flood warning was issued for Hanoi
while provinces south of here have been alarmed of new possible
flooding.

JOHANNESBURG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The highly destructive
Hare KRSNA computer virus is poised to strike on August 22, said
sources obtained here today.
</P>
<P>
According to South Africa's Computer Virus Helpline
Co-ordinator Ian Melamed, Hare KRSNA is at present the most
widely reported computer virus in the country and could wipe out
all information stored on the hard drives of infected computers
on that date.
</P>
<P>
The European Institute for Computer Anti-Virus has warned
earlier that the virus was spreading world-wide through the
internet.
</P>
<P>
The warning also mentioned specifically infected files on the
Internet News Groups Alt.Sex.
</P>
<P>
Technically, the Hare KRSNA Virus is a multi-partite, stealth,
slow polymorphic virus which makes it particularly destructive,
according to experts.
</P>
<P>
The helpline is offering a free, 24-hour advisory service
countrywide for the detection and removal programme of the
virus, the local sources said.
</P>
<P>
The disk from the helpline would detect and remove more than
9400 other computer viruses.

The current Socialist government, which came to power in 1992,
should finish its four-year term of office in October 1996 if no
early elections take place.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the government's commitment to exhaust the entire
four-year term had ceased to apply, Reppas said the commitment had
been made at a specific point in time.
</P>
<P>
"We are at a different point in time, in which the conditions
are different," he added, thus leaving open the prospect of the
early general elections.
</P>
<P>
Local press has reported in the past few days that Simitis is
under mounting pressure to decide whether to dissolve parliament
one year before his government's mandate expires, or to reshuffle
his cabinet while his top aides are splitting over the wisdom of
early elections.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Kills Israel's Surrogate Militiamen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Guerrillas of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, announced that they killed
an officer of Israel's client militia in south Lebanon in a bomb
attack inside the Israeli self-claimed "security zone" today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement distributed to the press in the Lebanese
capital tonight, the Islamic Resistance, the military wing of
Hezbollah, announced that its guerrillas detonated a bomb
targeting an officer in the 20th battalion of the South Lebanon
Army (SLA) militia.
</P>
<P>
It said that the SLA officer, identified as Dhaher Ramli, and
one of his companions were killed in the blast taking place in the
Jezzine area.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas detonated a second bomb when the enemy's
reinforcement rushed to the venue, "causing additional
casualties," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The attack came less than a couple of hours after Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu left the Israeli buffer zone,
according to security sources in Marjayoun, the biggest town in
the border strip.
</P>
<P>
The 45-minute visit was Netanyahu's first to the
1,100-square-kilometer buffer zone since he became prime minister
in June.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the "security zone" in south Lebanon in 1985
as a buffer against cross-border guerrilla attacks on its northern
Jewish settlements. The zone is routinely patrolled by Israeli
troops and their allied SLA militiamen.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has offered an unilateral withdrawal of the
1,200-strong Israeli forces from the area in exchange for
disarmament of Hezbollah guerrillas and a Syrian-guaranteed
mechanism of safeguarding security on the Lebanese-Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
Israel also demanded an integration of the Israeli backed SLA
militia into the regular Lebanese military forces.
</P>
<P>
Both Lebanon and Syria have refused the so-called "Lebanon
First" proposal, describing it as a "trap" aimed at separating
the Syrian and Lebanese tracks of peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
While calling for peace talks, Netanyahu said, "We will not
tolerate attacks on our forces or our settlements without
responding."
</P>
<P>
"We have no other aim regarding Lebanon except the security of
the north of (Israel)," the SLA militia's radio quoted the
Israeli prime minister as saying when touring the border strip.
</P>
<P>
"It is best for all parties concerned, be they Syria, Lebanon,
Hezbollah (or Israel), to find a peaceful settlement," Netanyahu
added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli premier met with Antoine Lahd, commander of the
2,500-strong SLA, at the militia's headquarters in Marjayoun.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense minister Yitzhak Mordechai, military Chief of
Staff Lt. Gen. Amnon Shahak and senior army officers accompanied
Netanyahu on the tour of the enclave.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese Communist Party
newspaper, "Nhan Dan," today called for stepping up renovation
process in the spirit of the August Revolution.
</P>
<P>
"The entire party and people are required to strive their best,
carry on the spirit of self-reliance and apply experience from the
August Revolution in a creative way to bring the national
construction and defense to a new stage," said the newspaper in a
front-page editorial, marking the 51st anniversary of the August
Revolution that ended French colonial rule in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is now confronted with such tasks as developing a
multi-tiered commodity economy under a market mechanism guided by
socialist-oriented state management, accelerating national
industrialization and modernization to build a strong country
where people can enjoy prosperity and social equality, the
newspaper added.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese August Revolution in 1945, which toppled French
colonial regime, won national independence and freedom for Vietnam
and established the communist party's leading role in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Sacked Greek Workers Stage Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Greek workers laid off from
Goodyear's plant in the country's Northern city of Salonika staged
protest and demonstrations today by blockading the city's
industrial zone.
</P>
<P>
The blockade was followed by a meeting at the city's labour
centre to discuss further action.
</P>
<P>
Goodyear announced it was closing the plant late last month,
leaving 350 people out of work, as part of a company restructuring
effort and plans to transfer operations to Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the sacked workers are expected in Athens on
Tuesday to meet with officials at the development ministry.
Reports said the protestors were also planning to blockade border
posts in Northern Greece.
</P>
<P>
Workers said that their call for a boycott on Goodyear tyres
had already begun to show results, claiming that sales in Northern
Greece were down by 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Duet to the high labour cost in the country, a number of
foreign companies and factories including Siemens Teleindustrial
are preparing to leave Greece, posing a new threat to the Greek
industry.

<HEADLINE> UK Army to Launch Fitness Plan for Potential Recruits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The British army is planning to
improve the fitness of potential recruits in an effort to reduce
the large number of applicants, who are not fit enough to cope
with military training, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
The scheme, a response to drastic recruitment shortages caused
by a decline in physical standards in 16-25 year olds, is expected
to be announced later next month and fully implemented towards the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Among the 3,360 applicants last year, almost one in five failed
the Basic Fitness Level (BFL) taken by all applicants before
admission, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Because of the high rate of dropping out, the army has a total
of 3,957 shortfall on its target of 15,100 new recruits, the
report added.
</P>
<P>
Senior military officers believe that improving the fitness of
those potential applicants before they take the test will help
meet the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
An army spokesman is quoted as saying, "the aim is to get them
fitter before they reach the starting line so that they have a
better chance of crossing the finish line."
</P>
<P>
On the reasons of this awkward situation, Major John Wallace,
commanding officer of the Army Training Regiment, said "the
problem is that we have produced a generation of couch potatoes.
Many have never experienced competitive sports or any sports at
all."
</P>
<P>
The decline in physical education in schools is also held as an
important factor and in 1987, only 35 percent of schools provided
less than two hours of physical training, compared to 75 percent
last year, he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Nurses Are Targets for Hospital Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 19 (Xinhua) -- New York hospitals is
accelerating their paces of cutting the number of nurses as their
measure to survive in the world of managed medical care.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, during a severe nursing shortage, jobs were
plentiful, and nurses' starting salaries were doubled at many
hospitals to more than 50,000 U.S. dollars in just two years.
</P>
<P>
But today, the newly powerful health maintenance organizations
(H.M.O.) are demanding shorter hospital stays and paying hospitals
discounted rates, putting stress on budgets. And now hospitals see
their large nursing staffs as costly burdens, while they try to
reduce the period of hospital stays of patients.
</P>
<P>
Some hospitals are now offering buyouts and early retirement
plans. Many, most notably public hospitals, have exhausted those
avenues and have turned to layoffs, according to a report of the
New York Times.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts predict that nursing layoffs would "greatly
accelerate" this year.
</P>
<P>
From February 1995 to February 1996, 1,316 nursing jobs, 3
percent of the total, were lost in the New York area, according to
the report. Public hospitals laid off 562 nurses at the end of
June this year.
</P>
<P>
The number of hospital patients dropped 8 percent last year and
many nurses moved to outpatient clinics.
</P>
<P>
Many nurses complain the reductions have hurt the care patients
receive, because they got little training before being transferred
to different floors. They also say the reductions have outpaced
the number of beds that have been eliminated.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Premier Rules out Reshuffle of Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti here today ruled out any intention to reshuffle his
cabinet over recent violent protests against higher bread prices.
</P>
<P>
Protesters and opposition parties, who blamed the prime
minister for the violence during the past few days, have been
insisting on the government's resignation and rescinding last
week's unpopular decision to double the prices of bread.
</P>
<P>
But the government and King Hussein accused external parties
of fomenting violence in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, Jordan's one-time ally, was publicly criticized as the
forces behind the riots during which several government
buildings, private banks and other public facilities were burnt.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti said the situation in southern Jordan was calm after
the troops imposed curfew on the city of Karak, where the riots
started Friday and spread to other southern cities.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters following his visit to the Court of
Cessation and Higher Justice, Kabariti said his government was
determined to continue its economic restructuring program, which
was launched in 1989 with the supervision of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Asserting the rule of law should prevail, he said all who had
caused damage to public and private properties would be
apprehended and referred to courts to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
He denied any arrest of parliamentary figures, saying all
deputies enjoy immunity under the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also reiterated the independence of the
Jordanian judicial system and the supremacy of law for realizing
objectives and inspecting justice throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
He said close cooperation and coordination between the
executive and legislative authorities were key elements for the
judiciary system to fulfill its duties with responsibility.

PARIS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Algerian government today
categorically denied a report by an Egyptian newspaper about the

</P>
<P>
The Algerian government described the report as "being devoid

</P>
<P>
A report by the Arabic daily "Al-Hayat" published in Cairo

women, children and the elderly, all of them from the hometown of
Algerian President Liamine Zeroual -- Batna, last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The victims had their throats cut by nearly 100 extremists on a
road linking M'Sila to Batna, after their buses were stopped by a
false police road-block set up by extremists armed with rifles,
hatchets and daggers.

JOHANNESBURG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Swazi Foreign Minister
Arthur Khoza said today that regionalization in southern Africa
had disadvantages for smaller countries like Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
"The more small countries become part of the region, the more
dependent they would become, both economically and politically,
on their big brothers in the region," the Swazi minister was
quoted today by the South African Press Association as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The danger of this happening is real," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Khoza stressed that different countries in the region had
their own priorities when it came to their development needs.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, it was unfair for a small country like Swaziland
to be denied bilateral aid for its won priority projects," said
the minister, referring to the call made by some larger economies
in the region for the donors to replace bilateral aid with aid
for projects of benefit.
</P>
<P>
"It was also natural for donor governments to decide how best
their foreign aid funds should be allocated," said Khoza.
</P>
<P>
"If assistance was rationalized, perhaps unwittingly or
deliberately, you are increasing small countries' dependence on
external aid," the minister stressed.

BAGHDAD, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Liberal Democratic

</P>
<P>
The nationalist leader said upon arrival that his visit comes

LUSAKA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- An Export Management Training
Program was opened here today to help businessmen enter into
international market.

Kambidima Wotela, Chairman of the Export Board of Zambia, said
there is usually lack of knowledge on the market and consumer

"There is a pressing need for exporters to be skilled to cope
with the competition," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the training program is necessary because
more rapid expansion of non-traditional exports which the Zambian
economy needs to support its development objectives requires high

PARIS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- French woman astronaut Claudie
Andre-Deshays today would offer Alsace wine to her colleagues in
the Russian space station "Mir" after entering the orbiter at
1627 GMT.
</P>
<P>
L'Alsace daily said in its Tuesday edition that a small bottle
of Hengst great vineyard wine from the Gewurztraminer grape
harvest in 1994 was brought onto the space shuttle "Soyuz-TM-24",
which docked with "Mir" today.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for Alsace wine to travel in space, said
the report. Glass is forbidden to fly in space, so the wine was
put into a plastic container.
</P>
<P>
Deshays first entered "Mir" today by swimming in the air. She
was followed by two Russian astronauts, Valeri Korzun and
Alexander Kaleri, according to local media reports.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 19 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is keen to
buy oil from Iraq in the ongoing discussions on trade between the
two countries, Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister Penuell Maduna
disclosed today.
</P>
<P>
"If the prices are right, we would accept the offers," said
the South African minister, adding that his government would
comply with conditions set by the United Nations under which
Iraq could sell off limited quantities of its crude oil.
</P>
<P>
The minister said his government was busy registering South
Africa as a buyer of Iraqi oil, as required by the U.N..
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the South African government is also considering
another offer made by a Saudi Arabian company in June. The two
governments are now holding wide-ranging negotiations on economic
cooperations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Oil remains South Africa's largest import with some 450,000
barrels being consumed daily.

UNITED NATIONS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali welcomes the fact that the
tension between Eritrea and Yemen has been defusing during last
week, a U.N. spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Fawzi, deputy spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general,
said that Boutros-Ghali expressed his gratitude to the
representative of France for his mediation efforts.
</P>
<P>
The efforts of France, Egypt and Ethiopia and the United
Nations have led to Yemen refraining from using force and to
Eritrea making commitment to withdraw its force from Lesser Hanish
Island, he said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general hopes that the agreement signed on May 21
between Eritrea and Yemen will continue to guide the two parties
to settle their dispute, he added.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea and Yemen both have claimed sovereignty over the
Greater Hanish and other islands which lies at the mouth of the
Red Sea, a strategic passage for oil transportation. The two
countries fought a brief battle over the islands in last December.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Labor Leaders Mark Anniversary of Oslo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The former Israeli Labor
government prime minister, Shimon Peres, today praised the Oslo
Accord signed between Israel and the PLO, saying in a span of
three years a number of issues ushered in by the agreement are
now irreversible.
</P>
<P>
To mark the third anniversary of the signing of the secret
accord, Peres said that the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) and Yasser Arafat are partners of the peace process and most
of the Palestinians in the territories are no longer under
Israel's control.
</P>
<P>
Peres also blasted incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's policy on the peace process, describing his "Lebanon
First" peace initiative as "laughable."
</P>
<P>
He charged that the government's detachment from negotiations
with Syria is what he termed as a fatal mistake.
</P>
<P>
Yossi Beilin, a former minister and Oslo accord architect, also
spoke highly of the agreement. "August 19 is a very important
day. Three years ago we changed the face of the region. We
changed the substance in the world. In many aspects it is
irreversible," he told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The mutual recognition of the PLO and Israel is
something of historic significance that will remain for ever."
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that there is a danger that the process
could collapse. He said that that does not necessarily mean that
the Palestinian leadership would go back to its overseas
headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia, or Israel would place the
densely-populated Palestinian areas under Israeli direct control
again.
</P>
<P>
"But there is the danger that the peace process won't go
on. There is the danger that we will not find any agreed-upon
solution since the government is not ready to withdraw from the
West Bank at all," he observed.
</P>
<P>
Beilin added, "If this is the condition, if this is the
pre-condition, I am afraid that by 1999 we will not find a
solution. That may become a very big problem."
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the timetable for the Israeli-Palestinian
Accord, the permanent settlement will take effect by April 13,
1999.
</P>
<P>
The former minister said that the problem is that one side
feels a Palestinian state is their most important aim, while the
other side is not ready to withdraw one inch from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Authority led by Yasser Arafat has strongly
demanded the establishment of an independent Palestinian state
while the hardline Likud government of Netanyahu insists on
opposition to the founding of such a country.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony marking the occasion is scheduled to take place in
Beit Garviel, a city along the Sea of Galilee, this evening. It
will be attended by the former government leaders and Palestinian
officials. But none of the current Likud government ministers
have planned to participate, according to the radio.
</P>
<P>
The Oslo Accord was initialed on August 19, 1993 and
officially signed at the White House lawn in Washington, the
United States, on September 13 the same year.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Demand Compensation for Missions in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is preparing to demand
compensation for the damage to its diplomatic missions in Greece
during last week's anti-Turkish protests, the semi-official
Anatolia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Violence targeting the Turkish minority in the Greek border
town of Komotini continued today with unknown assailants beating a
Turkish park attendant and smashing windows of a coffee house and
two cars owned by Turks, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Komotini had been the scene of a rampage by Greeks who attacked
the Turkish consulate, tore down and burned the Turkish flag and
damaged scores of Turkish shops to protest the deaths of two Greek
Cypriot demonstrators killed by Turkish troops in Cyprus last week.
</P>
<P>
Anatolia quoted unnamed sources as saying that in the request
for compensation to be conveyed to Athens shortly, Turkey would
stress that Greek officials had failed to guarantee the safety of
diplomatic missions despite the provisions of international
treaties. The Turkish government made several representations to
the Greek government over the past week, seeking enhanced
protection for the Turkish missions, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Vegetarian CJD Death Blamed on Mad Cow Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A British man died from the
strain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) linked to BSE, or mad
cow disease, after eating a "contaminated beef product," a coroner
ruled today.
</P>
<P>
The verdict, sure to arouse widespread controversy, is the
first to legally link a human death to mad cow disease, according
to BBC television.
</P>
<P>
Peter Hall, 20, became a vegetarian in 1990 but previously had
been very fond of beef, especially burgers.
</P>
<P>
Coroner Geoffrey Burt told an inquest in Durham, northeast
England, that Peter Hall died last February of a new variant of
CJD.
</P>
<P>
"I am satisfied that it is more likely than not that Peter
contracted this disease prior to 1990 through eating some form of
contaminated beef product, such as a beefburger," Burt said in his
verdict.
</P>
<P>
In March, British government scientists said they had
identified a new variant of CJD, and said it was likely people
caught it from eating beef infected with BSE.
</P>
<P>
About a dozen cases of the new variant have been identified.
Burt said Hall was one of the victims.
</P>
<P>
The new variant of CJD affects people under the age of 40,
while the disease normally affects the elderly because of its long
incubation period.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Renews in Liberia Despite Truce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A warring faction complained of
being attacked by its rivals in southeastern Liberia today, one
day after the warlords mapped out a new peace plan for the
war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The Liberia Peace Council (LPC), a minor faction in the
country, said the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) led
by Liberia's most powerful warlord Charles Taylor, attacked its
positions in the southeastern counties of Sinoe, Grand Gedeh,
Grand Kru and Maryland, according to a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
LPC spokesman Chris Farley said he has given the NPFL 48 hours
to withdraw from LPC positions, "or we will go on the offensive
to chase them out."
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman for the NPFL disputed the claim, saying
there has been no fighting in the southeast since a ceasefire was
declared in capital Monrovia three months ago.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia
(UNOMIL) said it has received "repeated complaints of ceasefire
violations", mostly involving local rival commanders in the areas.
</P>
<P>
Another ceasefire is expected to come into force later this
week following the declaration of a new peace agreement reached
in the Nigerian capital of Abuja Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the general elections will be held
in Liberia in May 1997 to end the six-year old war after the
rival factions have been disarmed and dissolved by the end of
1996.

<HEADLINE> Tudjman Meets Croat Leaders on Bosnian Federation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Croatian President Franjo Tudjman
met with a group of Bosnian Croat leaders today to discuss the
implementation of a recent agreement between Muslims and Croats in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The meeting with Bosnian Federation President Kresimir Zubak,
leader of the Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia-Herzegovina Bozo
Rajic and other senior political and military leaders of the
Bosnian Croats took place at the Adriatic island of Brijuni, where
the Croatian president is vacationing.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed recently in Geneva by Tudjman on
behalf of the Croats and Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic on
behalf of the Muslims, the shaky federation between the two ethnic
groups should be strengthened by the end of this month, with
Croats abolishing their statelet "Herceg-Bosna" and the Muslim-led
central government transferring much of its power to the
federation.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued after the meeting, Tudjman
stressed that it was necessary to carry out "the parallel transfer
of authority" in line with the Washington and Dayton agreements
which Muslims and Croats signed previously but have been never
fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
Croatia would remain committed to the full implementation of
the Washington and Dayton accords and the protection of interests
of the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the statement quoted
Tudjman as saying.
</P>
<P>
The participants agreed that it was necessary to set up a body
that would bring together and protect the interests of the Croats
in the Bosnian Federation, the satement said, without further
explaining the institution to be formed.

<P>
LONDON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets ended
mixed today, with share prices in London retreating after having
set a new record to close a quiet session lower.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that markets were kept cautious by Tuesday's
interest rate-setting meeting of the U.S. central bank's Federal
Open Market Committee and Thursday's gathering of Germany's
Bundesbank Council.
</P>
<P>
London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading
British shares had carried on last Friday's gains to a new record
trading level of 3,877.9 earlier today, but later on lost its
momentum by limited demand and closed 9.2 points down.
</P>
<P>
In Germany, the Frankfurt bourse was dominated by hopes of a
possible reduction in German interest rates Thursday and tradings
were stable ahead of next week's monetary meeting.
</P>
<P>
Share prices in Paris were spurred onwards by a steady franc
and positive bond markets and remained firm after losing some of
its earlier gains.
</P>
<P>
Market players said that although the Paris bourse was more
active today than last week, it was still very quiet as traders
were hoping that France would follow Germany's suit and cut
interest rates, too.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index ended 9.2 points down at 3,863.7.
Frankfurt's DAX-30 share index closed floor trade up 14.4 at
2,562.76. The computerized IBIS index finished down 11.71 at
2,556.25. Paris's CAC-40 index was up 6.69 at 1,986.21.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States is warning
a number of executives of the Mexican telecommunications company
Grupo Domos that they might be banned from the United States
because of their firms's links with Cuba despite repeated U.S.
threats, the U.S. State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
"We are... sending letters to a number of Grupo Domos
executives notifying them that they will have 45 days during which
time they can get back to us but after which time they will be
excluded from the United States," State Department spokesman Glyn
Davies told a press briefing here.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the U.S. government "has found the
Mexican firm Grupo Domos to be in violation of the Helms-Burton
Liberated Law." The so-called Helms-Burton law, named after its
sponsors in the U.S. Congress, tightened sanctions on Cuba by
acting against foreign firms doing business with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. law has prompted an angry response from Mexico, Canada
and nations of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Last month, seven executives and board members of Canada's
Sherritt International Corp. were the first to be warned by the
U.S. government under the Helms-Burton law.

<HEADLINE> French Ruling Party Threatens to Expel Most of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- France's ruling Rassemblement Pour
la Republique (RPR) today threatened to expel "the immense
majority" of the 300 illegal African immigrants -- or the
paperless -- who have been occupying the Saint-Bernard Church for
52 days.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Stefanini, assistant general secretary of the RPR, said
on television that he does not expect any "surprise" of a resort to
President Jacques Chirac as the opposition Socialist Party has
urged.
</P>
<P>
He said that there existed no "rift" between Chirac and Prime
Minister Alain Juppe and Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre over
the policy of immigration.
</P>
<P>
"The laws of the Republic cannot be negotiated.... There is the
ground, if he wants, for the interior minister to make an ultimate
examination on the situation of some individuals, which could
unblock a couple of regularizations, rather than that the immense
majority of these foreigners do not have the law applied on them,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some trade unions, including the powerful
Confederation Generale du Travail, today urged President Chirac
and the government to negotiate with the paperless on immigration
policy.
</P>
<P>
They also called for the freezing of expulsion of the
paperless. Union members of some French airliners said they would
refuse to work on planes that are used to expel foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Robert Hue, national secretary of the French Communist Party
(PCF), went to the Saint-Bernard Church today to "express
solidarity of the PCF with the families of the paperless
threatened with expulsion."
</P>
<P>
Some former resistance fighters against the Nazis today
boycotted a celebration in the southern city of Toulouse marking
the 52nd anniversary of the liberation of the city from Nazi
Germany to protest the government immigration policy.
</P>
<P>
"About 50 years ago, people hunted the Jews. Now people hunt
immigrants. The values of the Republic, which we defended during
the resistance, are being mocked as in the case of the paperless
in Saint-Bernard," said Jean Durand, a former resistance fighter
who was deported by the Nazis to a death camp during World War II.

its military power in Africa despite its on-going military

<HEADLINE> Chinese Human Rights Expert Calls for Poverty Eradication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese expert today called on
a United Nations panel to place poverty eradication high on its
annual agenda with a view to secure the fundamental human rights
of the 1.5 billion people in poverty worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Zhong Shukong, who specializes on human rights issues, told a
panel meeting that "poverty threatens the most fundamental human
right to subsistence and inhibits the effective enjoyment of all
human rights -- economic, social, cultural and political."
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made to an ongoing session here of the
U.N. Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection
of Minorities.
</P>
<P>
Poverty in developing countries, Zhong noted, has profound
historical root causes and has been aggravated by the inequitable
and unjust international economic order.
</P>
<P>
"The existing unjust international economic order, instead of
alleviating poverty, has contributed to the worsening of poverty
in the overwhelming majority of developing countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
To elaborate, he cited the worsening of terms of trade for
developing countries, restrictions on developing countries'
accessed to the worsening of poverty to markets under various
pretexts, unilateral and arbitrary threat and imposition of trade
sanctions and worsening debt burdens.
</P>
<P>
In order to eradicate poverty, Zhong said, serious and
effective efforts are required at both the national and
international levels.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese expert called on the U.N. subcommission to make
tangible contributions to poor people's enjoyment of the
fundamental rights to subsistence and to development.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the panel to conduct annual review of the
issue of poverty eradication during the 1997-2006 U.N. Decade for
Poverty Eradication.

<HEADLINE> Thai Opposition Targets Only PM in Censure Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's opposition in
parliament today filed a no-confidence motion against Prime
Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa.
</P>
<P>
Banharn will be the only target in a three-day debate expected
to start on September 10.
</P>
<P>
The opposition claimed that the prime minister lacked the
ability to administer the country and failed to implement the
policies he announced when he took office in July last year.
</P>
<P>
The opposition and some analysts said the government's
incompetence and lack of vision were responsible for the country's
low export growth, high inflation, the high current account
deficit and falling stock exchange index in the first half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
With the pullout of Palang Dharma (Virtue Force) party from the
seven-party coalition government a week ago, the government now
has only a precarious majority in parliament.
</P>
<P>
The six-party coalition now controls 209 of the 391 seats in
parliament, only 13 seats above the minimum number required for a
ruling majority.
</P>
<P>
Although under pressure to resign, Banharn has said he will
neither quit nor dissolve parliament, and that he will face the
opposition's challenge.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 1,000 foreign students
from 30 countries and regions today graduated from the Beijing
Language and Culture University (BLCU) after a six-week summer
Chinese training program.
</P>
<P>
Cui Yonghua, vice-president of BLCU, said that Chinese language
and culture have attracted more and more foreigners. BLCU, a
window to learn about China, receives tens of thousands of Chinese
learners worldwide every year.
</P>
<P>
Besides language study, the students have the chance to select
courses ranging from ancient Chinese history to international
economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Lijiang, head of the short-term Chinese language training
college of BLCU, said that the four to 20-week short term training
programs in the college not only teach students basic Chinese
grammar and oral Chinese, but also provide tourism projects for
the students to see by their own eyes the country's history and
culture.
</P>
<P>
The number of foreign students at BLCU ranks first in China. It
has opened a variety of Chinese educational projects, including
four-year major, two-year major, long-term training, and
short-term training, involving 500 Chinese teachers.
</P>
<P>
Learning Chinese has become popular again worldwide in recent
years. Some 37,000 foreign students came to China to learn Chinese
last year, two times the number at the beginning of 1990s.
</P>
<P>
In addition to people from Japan and the Republic of Korea,
many young people and overseas Chinese from European and American
countries became interested in China and Chinese.

Zemin, and a series of significant measures taken by the State

increasing their profits, which has accumulated experience for
state firms to improve their performances under a market economy,
he said.

by taking the responsibility system, instead of strengthening
government's administrative interference in enterprises' internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
He called for active research and bold practices to handle
both superficial and fundamental problems.
</P>
<P>
Wu urged enterprises to pay a greater attention to readjusting
the structure of their products and actively exploring
international markets. He said that pushing forward technological
progress and establishing a mechanism for technological renovation
should be made a key point for reducing loss and increasing profit
in state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of an administrative leader responsibility system
is a very important measure for dealing with the situation of
severe losses occurred in state enterprises, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
The State Council requires state firms to make efforts to make
use of various favorable factors for reducing losses and increasing
profits in a bid to curb the continuous increase in losses, Wu
said.
</P>
<P>
The Vice Premier urged local governments to reduce various
illegal levies on state enterprises and to give special care to
layoffs and unemployed workers from state firms.

<HEADLINE> Australia Retains Defense Funding Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Australia's coalition
government has decided in its 1996-97 budget to maintain a steady
level of funding for defense, according to the budget statement
released here today.
</P>
<P>
Defense is the only area that was spared from the government's
expenditure cut under the new budget.
</P>
<P>
The budget allocated 10.03 billion Australian dollars (7.82
billion U.S. dollars) for defense in the fiscal year, accounting
for 1.9 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) and
7.7 percent of the total federal government expenditures.
</P>
<P>
The 1996-97 budget outlay for defense represents an increase of
16 million Australian dollars (12.5 million U.S. dollars) over
1995-96.
</P>
<P>
"The task of defending Australia's interest is a responsibility
that this government takes very seriously," Defense Minister Ian
McLachlan said in a statement today.
</P>
<P>
The coalition also required the Defense Department to cut
administrative costs along with other government departments and
agencies. The funds saved from the expenditure reductions will be
retained within the defense portfolio.
</P>
<P>
To achieve an annual saving of 125 million Australian dollars
(97.5 million U.S. dollars), the Defense Department has decided to
reduce 1,200, or six percent, of its civilian workforce over two
years and abolish the Ready Reserve Scheme.
</P>
<P>
It will also cut operating and non-operational administrative
expenses and reduce non-operational information technology
equipment and support.
</P>
<P>
The savings would be used to enhance the Australian armed
forces' combat capabilities, McLachlan said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Army plans to start a restructuring program this
year to increase its capabilities, effectiveness and readiness.
</P>
<P>
With a long purchase list in the budget, the Defense Department
is expected to spend 2.21 billion Australian dollars (1.72 billion
U.S. dollars) on procuring major capital equipment.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of an Airborne Early Warning and Control
system for the Australian Defense Force will also begin this year.

provinces, and north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The
river basin, covering an area of 220,000 square kilometers, has a
population of 30 million.
</P>
<P>
The river has been polluted mainly by waste water from
Shenyang, Anshan, Benxi, Fushun, Tieling, Panjin, Yingkou and
Liaoyang cities in the central part of Liaoning province,
according to experts.
</P>
<P>
So far, 60 percent of the river water has been polluted to four
or five levels. The levels are set by the State to indicate the
pollution state of a certain area, and a higher figure means more
serious pollution.
</P>
<P>
The pollution has hampered the economic and social development
of the regions along the river, especially the regions in the
middle and lower reaches of the river, which boast more dense
populations.

<HEADLINE> India Vetoes Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in Geneva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- India formally vetoed the draft
treaty on global nuclear test ban here today, stripping it of the
unanimous support it needs to go forward to the U.N. General
Assembly next month.
</P>
<P>
India's veto smashed all hope that a consensus could still be
achieved at the last minute to allow the Conference on
Disarmament, which always operates by consensus, to put the draft
before the General Assembly in September for approval and signing.
</P>
<P>
India has said that a provision in the current draft treaty is
"coercive" since it states that New Delhi, one of three nations on
the nuclear threshold, had to sign the treaty in order for the
document to be implemented.
</P>
<P>
To save the draft accepted by most of the negotiating states, a
group of countries will bypass the conference and forward the text
directly to the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty has been in negotiation since
January 1994. It would ban all nuclear weapon test explosions and
other nuclear explosions.
</P>
<P>
It is intended to prevent nuclear weapon states from further
updating their nuclear arsenals and to strengthen implementation
of the current international nuclear non-proliferation regimes.
</P>
<P>
The draft states that if the treaty cannot take effect within
three years, a conference can be held to determine what "measure"
to be taken to facilitate its implementation.
</P>
<P>
Some diplomats here believe that with the disapproval of India,
it will be difficult for the treaty to enter into force even if it
could be approved by a simple majority at the General Assembly and
thus be able to be opened for signature by all U.N. member
states.

<P>
BAGHDAD, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi National Assembly will
send a delegation to the 96th International Parliamentary
Conference, due to be held in Beijing on September 16, informed
sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will be headed by Saad Kassem Hammadi, head of
the Arab and International Affairs Committee in the National
Assembly and a prominent figure in the ruling Baath Party.
</P>
<P>
The committee said that the agenda of the conference should
include the issue of "the exploitation of economic sanctions
against some countries as a means of starving and humiliating
their peoples," the sources added.
</P>
<P>
"Such exploitation endangers international peace and
stability," the committee noted.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is expected to table a working paper dealing
with the U.N. embargo on Iraq which caused serious sufferings to
women and children as well as the elderly people in Iraq, the
sources pointed out. The embargo was imposed on Iraq after its
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.

<HEADLINE> Interest rate Cut Drives Money Into Securities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- An interest rate cut earlier
this year has driven more personal savings into the securities
markets in China's capital, official data shows.
</P>
<P>
Securities transactions in May, the first month after the
interest rates for savings deposits was lowered by an average 0.98
percent, more than tripled the average for the first four months
to 32.73 billion yuan (about 3.9 billion US dollars), according to
the Beijing branch of the People's Bank of China, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate cut, coupled with the withdrawal of an
interest subsidy for savings deposits of three years and longer as
of April 1, has also slowed down the growth of savings deposits.
</P>
<P>
The monthly increase in personal savings was 2.92 billion yuan
in May and 2.7 billion yuan in June, as against a monthly average
of 5.04 billion yuan for the January-March period and 5.73 billion
yuan for April.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate policy adjustments have to some extent soured
people's enthusiasm for putting money in banks, a bank official said.
</P>
<P>
The savings deposit structure has also changed, with residents
leaning more towards shorter-term deposits.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the cutting of interest rates has had a
limited impact on the retail market, pointing to the fact that
retail sales only grew a net eight percent in the first six months.
</P>
<P>
The cut of an average of 0.75 percent in lending rates has,
meanwhile, saved the city's state-owned enterprises 1.1 billion
yuan in interest rate payments, the official said.
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, the interest policy changes have played a
positive role in improving the financial environment for large and
medium-sized state-owned enterprises, as well as in rationalizing
the public's investment habits," the official said.

The pollution of the river also affects coastal sea water.

industrial waste water discharged by the large and medium-sized

areas in the middle and lower reaches of the river.
</P>

He also said that drinking and daily-use water should be

sewage facilities in urban areas should be stepped up to protect
irrigation and offshore water from further pollution.
</P>

According to Song, by the end of 2000, all industrial pollution
sources will have to reach state-set discharge standards, all
surface water should be controlled under fifth-level pollution,
pollution of drinking water will be controlled.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2005, the Liaohe river will be fully cleaned, said

<HEADLINE> Australia Slashes Aid to Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Australia's coalition
government has decided to slash its aid to developing countries by
10 percent, according to its budget for the 1996-97 fiscal year
released today.
</P>
<P>
The country's total official development assistance (ODA) will
be cut by 10 percent to 1.45 billion Australian dollars (1.13
billion U.S. dollars) from 1.57 billion Australian dollars (1.22
billion U.S. dollars) in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
Aid to developing countries only accounts for 0.29 percent for
Australia's gross domestic product (GDP) in 1996-97, a far cry
from the United Nations goal of 0.7 percent of the GDP set for the
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government has abolished the soft loan program of
the Development Import Finance Facility (DIFF).
</P>
<P>
"The reduction in Australia's ODA directly reflects Australia's
reduced capacity to provide assistance due to urgent need to
address Australia's budget deficit problem," said the budget
statement.
</P>
<P>
"The government believes that Australia must put its own
economic house in order first before it can achieve higher aid
levels in the future," it said.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government said that some high priority projects
in the DIFF pipeline could be considered for support under
respective country program allocations for each of the four
receiving countries -- Indonesia, China, the Philippines and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
However, the total aid flow to the four countries has been
slashed to 273.3 million Australian dollars (213.2 million U.S.
dollars) in 1996-97 from 329.6 million Australian dollars (257.1
million U.S. dollars) for 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer has said that only
part of the previous DIFF projects would be re-supported under
other aid programs.

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier Urges State Firms to Reduce Loss Through Reforms (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Wu Bangguo
today called on all localities to reduce losses by state-owned
enterprises and make them profitable through adopting a
responsibility system and reforms.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks at today's national
telephone-and-television conference on reducing losses and
increasing profits in state firms. The meeting was held by the
State Council which recently approved a proposal by several
ministries to tackle the problem.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the vice premier asked local governments to
improve their understanding of the current situation, and their
tasks in this regard to make up their minds to handle the issue.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, all localities and state
enterprises have studied and carried out the decisions of the
central leadership to deal with the relationship between reform,
development and stability, and actively push forward the reforms
of the economic structure and the modes of increasing the economy,
according to Wu.
</P>
<P>
Currently, he said, the prominent problems plaguing state
enterprises include worsening economic performances, a declining
production-sales ratio, bulging stockpiles and increasing
losses.
</P>
<P>
The Vice Premier, who is in charge of industries, said that
judging from the present situation, it is an extremely difficult
task to reduce losses and increase profits for the
enterprises. However, he held, while understanding the
difficulties, "we must make clear that there are still many
favorable factors."

<HEADLINE> Australia's Economy to Keep Strong Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Australia's coalition
government, in its budget for the 1996-97 fiscal year released
today, forecasts that the country's economy would see continued
strong growth.
</P>
<P>
In the federal budget, the Treasury predicted that the gross
domestic product (GDP) would grow by 3.5 percent in the year, down
from 4.1 percent in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 8.25 percent by
the end of the fiscal year on June 30, 1997, from the present 8.6
percent, while the number of the employed people will grow by 1.5
percent during the year, said the budget statement.
</P>
<P>
The country's staggering current account deficit is also
expected to improve during the year, falling to 20 billion
Australian dollars (15.6 billion U.S. dollars) from 20.5 billion
Australian dollars (16 billion U.S. dollars) for 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
The investment outlook will remain very positive during the
year, with business investment increasing by 14 percent, the
budget statement said.
</P>
<P>
Housing is expected to experience slow recovery in 1996-97.
Though dwelling investment is expected to continue to fall by
three percent in the year, the rate of declining will be much
slower than the 15 percent for the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Inflation is expected to remain at a low level. The government
forecasts that the underlying inflation rate would remain below
three percent throughout the year after peaking at 3.3 percent in
the first quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Consumption growth in the public sector will ease, but consumer
spending will grow strongly in 1996-97, said the budget statement.
 Wages and household income are expected to grow slightly slower
than consumer spendings, resulting in a lower household saving
ratio than in 1995-96.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Budget to Remain in Red in Next 2 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Australia's budget is to remain
in red in the next two fiscal years instead of returning to a
surplus as earlier promised by the coalition government in its
election campaign, according to the 1996-97 budget released here
today.
</P>
<P>
The underlying budget deficit for the 1996-97 fiscal year,
estimated at 5.6 billion Australian dollars (4.4 billion U.S.
dollars), accounts for 1.1 percent of the country's gross domestic
product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The budget will still be in red in the 1997-98 fiscal year with
a deficit of 1.5 billion Australian dollars (1.2 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The coalition government's inability to turn the budget into
black as promised was due to a larger than expected deficit for
the 1995-96 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Federal Treasurer Peter Costello announced that the coalition
government inherited an underlying budget deficit of 10.3 billion
Australian dollars (8.0 billion U.S. dollars) from the previous
Labor government, larger than the previously estimated deficit of
eight billion Australian dollars (6.2 billion U.S. dollars) for
1995-96.
</P>
<P>
However, the coalition government has stuck to its target of
slashing the budget deficit by eight billion Australian dollars
(6.2 billion U.S. dollars) in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Costello said the government has found adequate measures to
reduce the underlying budget deficit by four billion Australian
dollars (3.1 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996-97 and a further four
billion Australian dollars in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
"The government's objective in relation to 1996-97 has been met
in full and, in addition, the measures announced in this Budget
substantially achieve the 1997-98 objective," he said in the
budget statement.
</P>
<P>
"The government is well placed to deliver its commitment to
achieve underlying surpluses during sustained periods of economic
growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
Measures taken to slash the budget deficit are focused on
cutting government expenditures. The government will cut
expenditures by 2.9 billion Australian dollars (2.2 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1996-97 and 5.2 billion Australian dollars (4.1
billion U.S. dollars) in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the coalition has managed to honor its election
promises to increase funding for a wide range of programs, such as
education and family welfare. All the money will be generated
from savings measures set out in the budget, without adding to the
burden of extra government expenditures, said Costello.
</P>
<P>
He said the government expected to turn the budget into a
surplus of one billion Australian dollars (790 million U.S.
dollars) in 1998-99.

<HEADLINE> China's Real Estate Market Expects to Pick Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Real estate markets in China's
coastal and well-developed cities have touched the bottom-line and
have started to pick up.
</P>
<P>
Climbing upwards is expected to bring about a nationwide rise of
the sector in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official with the Ministry of
Construction, the price of housing properties in major Chinese
cities has remained stable, with only slight drop since the
beginning of this year. And the drop is slowing down after nearly
hitting the bottom-line.
</P>
<P>
The price index of the sector in Beijing, Dalian and Shenzhen
is showing a moderate rise.
</P>
<P>
From January through July this year, slight rises were
observed in the price of office and commercial buildings. While
slight rises, minor drops or no change were registered in prices
of residential housing.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Beijing, Dalian, Shenzhen and Shijiazhuang which
saw slight rises in price for commercial housing, the price
index in a number of large and medium-sized cities remained the
same compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Experts held that the country's real estate market is moving
along a sound track, which is expected to develop at a moderate
pace, no longer with sharp rises or falls.
</P>
<P>
Other favorable trends show that the real estate sector has
extended its growth center from coastal cities to the central and
western parts of the country, and from metropolitan cities to
medium and small-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
More significantly, the growth mode of the sector is changing
from extensive into intensive style.
</P>
<P>
With the return of Hong Kong to the motherland approaching,
the sales of commercial housing will be brisk, and a new upsurge is
expected to emerge in China's real estate sector, according to a
senior official with the Ministry of Construction real-estate
department.
</P>
<P>
An official survey shows that more and more Hong Kong residents
are flocking to buy residences in mainland cities, particularly in
Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Zhuhai and Xiamen as well as other cities in
the Pearl River Delta area. The Hong Kong buyers now number tens
of thousands in each of the cities.
</P>
<P>
A senior official at the Ministry of Construction noted that it
will be more convenient for Hong Kong residents to cross to the
mainland after 1997. Moreover, pricing of commercial housing
in the mainland is much lower than in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Official says Indonesia Could Become Economic Giant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia could emerge as one of
the world's giant economies by 2018 when the country concludes its
second long-term development plan (1994-2018), a senior official
was quoted as saying by the Antara news agency today.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Production and Distribution Hartarto
said on Monday that by 2018 the purchasing power of the Indonesian
people will be at par with other big nations such as the United
States, China, Japan, Germany and India.
</P>
<P>
He said that given the strong economic foundation laid during
the country's first 25-year development plan period (1969-1994),
it would not be merely a dream for Indonesia to become one of the
largest economies in the world.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's economic outlook is promising as its economic
growth has averaged 7.7 percent since 1990, well above the 5.8
percent recorded in the 1980s, and the country targets an annual
average rate of 7.1 percent for the next four years, Hartarto
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Indonesia secured approved foreign direct
investments worth 30.1 billion U.S. dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing has replaced oil and agriculture as the driving
force behind the Indonesian economy, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Manufactured exports rose to an estimated 40 percent of the
country's total exports in 1995 from 12 percent in 1985, while
exports of oil/gas fell to 23 percent of the total in the same
period.
</P>
<P>
Hartarto said Indonesia will focus on the growth of the trade
sector market since it is expected to jump in line with the
implementation of trade and investment liberalization.
</P>
<P>
He was optimistic that Indonesia would be able to benefit from
the trade liberalization policies set by the ASEAN Free Trade Area
(AFTA) agreement, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum and such multinational frameworks as the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) agreed last
year to accelerate its trade liberalization schedules from 15
years to 10 years. Free trade is expected to be achieved by the
year 2003.
</P>
<P>
Hartarto said the vast economic resources, including strategic
geographical locations as well as the availability of natural and
human resources, have put Indonesia in a very advantageous
position in the world economic constellation.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen has warned the West not to interfere too much in
the country's election process, according to the Cambodia Daily
today.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen told Adelaide Advertiser, an Australian newspaper, that
he would cancel the elections if the West tried to run the poll or
decide a winner, the Cambodia Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen was quoted as saying that Western technical assistance
and foreign observers were welcome, but how to operate the polls
was a matter of "Cambodian sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a move to gauge funding to Cambodia, a number of
experts from some donor countries have arrived in Phnom Penh to
examine the country's preparations for local and general elections
scheduled for 1997 and 1998, respectively.
</P>
<P>
In another development, three election experts have come to
Cambodia at the invitation of the Ministry of Interior to provide
technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
But diplomats here were quoted by a local newspaper as saying
that vital funding may not arrive unless the government shows
determination to keep the polls free and fair.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 14 million residents of
the largest city in southwest China have found that their streets
are a lot quieter, thanks to a local ban on the use of motor
vehicle sirens and horns.
</P>
<P>
After the ban was issued in May 1995, the average noise level
on city streets dropped four decibels to 69.5, 0.5 decibel lower
than the state standard, the Guangming Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
Local traffic departments have also dealt with 1,121 motor
vehicles and 3,700 drivers who violated the ban, in a bid to give
residents a quieter environment, both for work and play.
</P>
<P>
As a further step to tackle the city's noise problem, the city
authorities issued another ruling this year, expanding the areas
where use of sirens and horns is not permitted.
</P>
<P>
In related news, Shenyang, capital of northeast China's
Liaoning Province, has issued a similar ban on automobile sirens
and horns in one-third of its urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Many other major Chinese cities have already banned the use of
motor vehicle sirens and horns.

<P>
AMMAN, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Abdul Karim
Kabariti voiced here today satisfaction with Jordanian-Saudi
Arabian relations and pledged continued support for those ties in
all fields to serve Pan-Arab interests.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti was speaking following his talks with the head of a
Saudi Committee in charge of carrying out contracts with
Jordanian teachers.
</P>
<P>
About 2,500 teachers, who will work either in public or private
schools and colleges, have already started leaving this country to
work in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said Riyadh will also hire Jordanian engineers,
doctors and nurses in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Before the 1990-91 Gulf crisis, a large number of Jordanian
workers were employed in the Gulf oil-rich kingdom, whose
remittances to Jordan had played a great role in building the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Their deportation from Saudi Arabia after the Gulf crisis led
to higher unemployment rate in Jordan and gave back-breaking
burden to Jordan whose economy suffered a great setback since 1989
Jordan dinar devaluation.

<HEADLINE> China To Improve Civil Aircraft Maintenance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- China is to build a
well-developed aircraft maintenance system with a balanced layout
of maintenance businesses across the country by the year of 2001.
</P>
<P>
Chen Guangyi, director of the Civil Aviation Administration of
China made the remark today at a national conference on civil
aircraft maintenance.
</P>
<P>
Chen told the conference that maintenance has the same
importance as manufacturing in deciding an airplane's safety
performance, and strict management must be ensured in the whole
process of the maintenance of aircraft.
</P>
<P>
China has established four major aircraft maintenance bases in
Beijing, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Shanghai. The Beijing Aircraft
Maintenance and Engineering Corporation, a joint venture between Air
China and Lufthansa, completed the construction of a four-bay
hangar, said to the biggest in Asia, earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, China's air maintenance business is
expected to be able to repair most of the planes for the country's
major airlines, with both the technical standards and required
working time meeting the average standards in the world, according
to experts.
</P>
<P>
China has spared no efforts in recent years in improving the
safety record of its civil aviation business, and there have been
25 consecutive months with no major accidents reported by its
airlines.
</P>
<P>
The CAAC also commended 12 maintenance groups and 183

<HEADLINE> China Expects Third Economic Boom (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has announced details of
a huge project on the economic triangle with neighboring Tianjin
and Hebei Province, involving one trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The three are to join forces to create a third economic boom in
north China spanning the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese capital is cooperating with Tianjin, a leading port
city in north China, and surrounding Hebei Province to spearhead
the boom.
</P>
<P>
Heads of governments from the three areas have exchanged visits
frequently to draw up concerted development programs, negotiate
new cooperation arrangements and enhance inter-regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The three partners have mapped out a 15-year investment plan
for building infrastructure, which will involve a total investment
of one trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chinese economists stated that the establishment of the
Shenzhen Special Economic Zone in early 1980s brought about the
economic take-off in south China.
</P>
<P>
Development of the Pudong New Area in Shanghai in early 1990s
spurred an economic boom in east China.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei Province will
herald a new upsurge of economic growth in north China, or a third
economic boom.
</P>
<P>
Gao Dezhan, secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), predicted that an economic zone
centered around Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei, with Liaodong and
Shandong Peninsulars as wings, will soon be formed, pushing north
China's development to a new height.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth in north China lags behind that in east and
south China as a heavy concentration of unprofitable state-owned
enterprises are based in the area.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Urges Israel to Implement UN Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime
Minister Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah urged here today Israel to
implement U.N. resolutions concerning the Middle East peace
process in order to reach a just and comprehensive peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here after winding up his two-day
official visit to Lebanon, the Kuwaiti prime minister said that
the so-called "Lebanon First" proposal put forward by Israel was
"refused on principle."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister underlined the Kuwaiti government's support
for the Syrian and Lebanese positions on this proposal.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli "Lebanon First" proposal provides for an unilateral
Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon in exchange of a
disarmament of the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah guerrillas and a
Syrian-guaranteed mechanism of safeguarding the security on the
Lebanese-Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
Both Lebanon and Syria, which has 40,000 troops in Lebanon and
is the dominant power, have rejected the proposal, terming it as a
"trap" aimed at separating the Syrian and Lebanese negotiating
tracks.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti prime minister arrived here on Monday morning on a
three-Arab state tour, which had already taken him to Egypt and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, the prime minister held meetings with
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and
other political and religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
He announced that the talks he held in Cairo, Damascus and
Beirut dealt with a number of issues, especially the challenge
Israel constituted for the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the necessity "to consolidate the unity of the
Arab rank in order to reach a united strategy to confront this
enemy," as well as the necessity to "realize the just and
honorable peace in the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
Describing his talks with the Lebanese leaders as
"constructive and fruitful," the premier said that the Kuwaiti
government was "standing on the side of Lebanon and its
sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
He called on the Arab countries to refrain from sliding into
separated positions.
</P>
<P>
On a possible Arab summit in the next months, the Kuwaiti
crown prince said that his country "supports this effort (to hold
the summit) at any time and in any place in the Arab world."

<P>
BRUSSELS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
given the green light to a German-French joint venture to produce
car cockpit subsystems, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The venture, between Germany's Siemens AG and France's Sommer
Allibert Industrie AG, will produce integrated cockpit subsystems
consisting of a dashboard and other components.
</P>
<P>
The EU, through its Brussels-based executive arm, the European
Commission (EC), hailed the project as "part of a general trend in
the car manufacturing industry."
</P>
<P>
The trend, it noted, calls for reducing "the scope of in-house
production by purchasing fully-assembled subsystems from outside
suppliers."
</P>
<P>
Siemens is a supplier of electric and electronic components for
the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
Sommer Allibert, which is already very active in the field of
automotive cockpits, is supplying synthetic material components to
car manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Although the market for integrated cockpits is still evolving,
the two parties to the joint venture have been already in
competition with several other large suppliers.

<HEADLINE> Entrepreneurs Confident Of Clothing Industry After Hong Kong's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese mainland clothing
enterprises will have more commercial opportunities, as well as
more severe market competition after China restores the exercise
of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, predicted Chen
Chengcai, president of Virtue Group, China's biggest shirt maker.
</P>
<P>
Chen said at a national gathering for industrial and commercial
leaders that the return of Hong Kong to the motherland will not
only strengthen the production force of the mainland clothing
sector, but also provide a new potential market for the whole
industry.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the reciprocal relationship" could be established
between the mainland and Hong Kong, combining the former's abundant
labor force and the latter's advanced design capacity.
</P>
<P>
Chen said, Hong Kong is a highly developed base for garment
making, with dozens of its brand-name products, such as Billy and
Jeans West, maintaining a quick growth on mainland markets in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
After July, 1997, mainland enterprises will find themselves in
a more rigorous competition era, encountering more Hong Kong
rivals, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Dong Binggen, director of China Garment Association, said that
mainland enterprises should establish more hard brands and expand
production scales, in order to survive the new challenges.
</P>
<P>
Virtue Group will set up a representative office in Hong Kong
before July, 1997, and will expand its business in the region.
</P>
<P>
The group, involving 180 million yuan in investment, was
jointly launched by firms from Hong Kong and Guangdong Province in
1990. It has a daily production capacity of 18,000 shirts, and
registered a sales record of three million shirts in 1995.

The donors linked their financial aid to Phnom Penh's efforts
to work for a market economy and enact laws to ensure social
stability, including a law regulating next general elections.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said that the final reports by the three experts
would strongly influence the amount of aid foreign donors would
provide.

<P>
Cambodian Co-Interior Minister Sar Kheng said last week that
the government would need 40 million dollars to ensure that both
local and general elections, which still remain under preparation,
go smoothly as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources predicted that the three experts would slash
by "40 to 50 percent" the amount of aid demanded by the Cambodian
government.
</P>
<P>
Some donor countries have reportedly complained that the
Cambodian government, formed after U.N.-supervised general
elections in 1993, has not moved fast enough to adopt legislations
to facilitate the forthcoming elections.

<HEADLINE> Russian Commander Threatens All-out Attack on Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moscow, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian military commander in
Chechnya, General Konstantin Pulikovsky, has ordered the civilians
to leave Grozny within 48 hours and vowed to sweep the Chechen
rebels from the war-torn city.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued monday night, Pulikovsky accused the
Chechen rebels in Grozny of making use of the peace negotiation to
consolidate their positions and launch sporadic attacks on Russian
troops, Russia's official news agency Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
Puliskovsky urged all civilians to leave Grozny through a
corridor opened by Russian soldiers ahead of the offensive.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he threatened that after the withdrawal of the
civilians, he will have the right to use all forces, including air
force and artillery, to strike.
</P>
<P>
On August 6, thousands of Chechen rebels, who have been seeking
independence from the Russian Federation, launched a surprise
attack on Grozny controlled by Russian troops, capturing most part
of the city and trapping russian soldiers in their checkpoints and
in the central government complex. Russia's federal troops
suffered heavy losses in the several days of fierce fighting.
</P>
<P>
Although a cease-fire agreement was signed by Russian military
and the Chechen rebel leaders on August 13, sporadic fightings
still continued in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
The rebel fighters reportedly made use of the cease-fire to
store up grain and ammunition, to build new firing positions and
laid mines in key blocks and on roads.
</P>
<P>
The rebel Chief-of-Staff, Aslan Maskhadov, has appealed to
President Yeltsin's special envoy in Chechnya, Alexander Lebed, to
prevent Pulikovsky from using force to drive the separatist
fighters from the city, describing Pulikovsky's order as a mad
action.
</P>
<P>
However, Pulikovsky seemed determined to use all possible means
to break the rebel siege of the Russian outposts, saying "the only
way out of the current situation in Grozny is the use of force."

ANKARA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Candidates, including women for
the first time in 35 years, are being trained as pilots
in Turkey to fly F-16 fighters, which will make up all of
the squadrons of the Turkish Air Force in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The 500 candidates, including 56 women, are admitted to the Air
Force Academy after a series of rigorous exams and are receiving
their flight and ground training, local newspaper Daily News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Their training involves flights in training aircraft or
gliders, parachuting and shooting.
</P>
<P>
First Lt. Aydan Fatma Aydin, coordinating officer for women
students, said: " Female students go through the same training
as the male students.
</P>
<P>
"They are just as successful in military and flight
training. Female and male students are trained together and they
take classes together," he added
</P>
<P>
The students, who will become the leading air-men and women of
the 21st century, have to take survival training on a
mountain. They walk in the early hours of the morning with
backpacks weighing about 40 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The students, after setting up their camp, are left alone on
the mountain for three days. Since they do not take any food
or drink with them, their priority is to ensure supplies of
nourishment. They set up primitive traps, with which they catch
tortoises, snakes, hedgehogs and fish.
</P>
<P>
They also eat mushrooms, herbs and roots, getting their
drinking water from nearby lakes and streams.
</P>
<P>

said: "We are trying to achieve the best under harsh
conditions. Honesty, friendship and tolerance prevail here."

CAIRO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The volume of trade between Turkey and Iraq is set
to reach over one billion U.S. dollars by the end of this year and
hopefully will achieve pre-1990 levels of nearly 2.5 billion
dollars next year.
</P>
<P>
The Istanbul Chamber of Commerce (ITO) has made the forecast in
the wake of a visit by Turkish government ministers to Iraq last
week, according to Turkey's newspaper Daily News today.
</P>
<P>
The delegation's goal was to secure a good share for Turkey of
the trade with Iraq following a recent U.N. decision to allow Iraq
to export two billion dollars worth of oil every six months to buy
food and medicine for the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Italy topped the list of Lebanon's trading partners
since the Lebanese annual imports from Italy are estimated at one
billion U.S. dollars, the highest among Lebanon's imports from
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
The size of Lebanese imports from Italy has already exceeded
the 500-million-dollar mark during the first seven months of this
year, Beirut business weekly Eco News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The main items of the Lebanese imports from Italy are
silverware, gold and other precious metals, light oils, shoes and
clothing. Lebanese exports to Italy are estimated at about 25 million
dollars per year.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey is expected to purchase 145 assault
helicopters worth of three billion U.S. dollars over the next 10

<P>
The bulk of the purchase would be made from the United States,
and Turkey would announce the tender within two weeks. The Bell
Helicopter Textron Company of Fort Worth, Texas, was reportedly
interested in supplying the helicopters but was afraid of
obstructions due to problems associated with Turkey's human rights
record.
</P>
<P>
This company was said to be interested in supplying AH-1W type
"Super Cobra" helicopter.
</P>
<P>
Bell has sold 10 helicopters to Turkey from 1990 to 1994.

<HEADLINE> 2 Israeli Soldiers Killed in Friendly Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldier were
killed and another was wounded when two Israeli military units
inside the so-called "security zone" in south Lebanon opened
fire on each other by mistake earlier this morning.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the Israeli-occupied buffer zone said
that the two units of the Israeli forces stationed at the
northwestern corner of the border strip exchanged fire at each
other in the darkness just before the daybreak.
</P>
<P>
Both of the units apparently believed that they were
attacked by Lebanese anti-Israeli guerrillas and fired back.
</P>
<P>
The fighting lasted about 15 minutes, killing the two and
wounding another, the security sources noted.
</P>
<P>
Israeli forces have reinforced their positions at Taibeh,
Atshit, Qasir and Gantara near the north border of the buffer zone
with a number of armored vehicles since this morning, according to
the sources.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes carried out reconnaissance flights over
south Lebanon this morning and hovered at low altitude over
the areas of Nabatiyeh and Iglim Al-Toffah.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli occupation forces shelled the south Lebanese
village of Zidgin at dawn, damaging several civilian houses.
</P>
<P>
Today's incident occurred less than 24 hours after a short
visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the
border strip, the first since the Likud leader became premier
in June.
</P>
<P>
On the heel of his departure, an officer of the Israeli client
South Lebanon Army militia in patrol was killed by a bomb
detonated by by guerrillas of the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah,
or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
"We will not bear a situation in which we and our allies are
subjected to blows from the other side and stand still," the
Israeli premier said while inspecting the 15-kilometer-wide border
strip occupied by the Jewish state since late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen Israeli soldiers have been killed by guerrillas in
south Lebanon since the beginning of this year, including 10
killed after a cease-fire was enforced on the last active
battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict in April.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa May Send Troops to Burundi, Says Nzo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The possibility of South
Africa sending troops to Burundi and other African troublespots
could not be ruled out if South Africa's counterparts on the
continent deemed it necessary, Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred
Nzo said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A local daily, the Citizen, today quoted Nzo as saying that if
there were a need in the future for the country to intervene in
Burundi, "then South Africa will play its role".
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a media briefing in Cape Town, Nzo said: "We are
talking of a diplomatic role and hopefully there should be no
need for a military intervention."
</P>
<P>
He said it should be clear that South Africa might intervene
in this manner only in cooperation with other countries under the
auspices of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Nzo's comments came in the wake of renewed fears of widespread
violence in Burundi following a military coup in the country.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Burundi's Hutu President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya
was ousted and replaced in a coup by military-supported former
Head of State Pierre Buyoya, a Tutsi.
</P>
<P>
Civil fightings between Burundi's Hutus and Tutsis has
reportedly claimed the lives of an estimated 150,000 people in
the past three years.
</P>
<P>
South Africa condemned the unconstitutional take-over of
power, saying it would under no circumstances recognise any
change of government "through force of arms".
</P>
<P>
"Mirroring its efforts to promote reconciliation internally,
south Africa has sought to assist in resolving the ethnic
conflict and thereby to avert the threat of a catastrophic loss
of live," said Nzo.
</P>
<P>
The minister also announced that South Africa's Ambassador to
Ethiopia and the OAU, Welile Nhlapo, had been appointed as
special envoy to deal with the matter. enditem

its promotional strategy which calls for total expansion of
Zambia's share of the world market.

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The latest discovery of the bodies of two little girls
kidnapped and killed by Marc Doutroux, a criminal released before
his sentence expired, added fuel to the anger of Belgians who had
been shocked by the horror of the recent serial crimes against

<HEADLINE> Ground Subsidence In China's Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The ground level in Beijing is
sinking 10 to 20 millimeters each year, with overall ground
subsidence of more than 700 mm in the eastern suburban area over
the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
The city's northeastern suburbs have also subsided more than
600 mm in the past 40 years, and the subsidence rate has
accelerated since 1987.
</P>
<P>
"The subsidence is mainly caused by excessive groundwater use,"
said Hong Libo, chief engineer of the Beijing Institute of
Surveying and Map Design Research.
</P>
<P>
Hong attributes the excessive groundwater use to increased
drinking water consumption and industrial use, caused by the
population explosion.
</P>
<P>
The subsidence has caused some damage to buildings and
underground pipelines and affected both people's lives and
industrial production.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing institute began studying Beijing's ground
subsidence in 1966, immediately after a disastrous earthquake in
Xingtai, a city several hundred kilometers from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Lin Xizhen, another engineer of the institute, says that
subsidence is also seen in the city's southern and northwestern
parts, although the problem there is not as serious as that in the
eastern and northeastern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
He urged the central and local governments to pay more
attention to the problem because it may threaten the capital
city's future even if it has not done a great deal of damage so
far.
</P>
<P>
To halt the subsidence, the municipal government has developed
a series of measures, including restrictions on groundwater use
and on pumping water back underground.
</P>
<P>
However, experts say that halting the subsidence should rely on
more effective measures such as adjusting the industrial
structure, curbing excessive groundwater consumption, and
controlling the city's excessive expansion.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Trade Volume with Iraq to Reach One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The volume of trade between
Turkey and Iraq is set to reach over one billion U.S. dollars by
the end of this year and hopefully will achieve pre-1990 levels
of nearly 2.5 billion dollars next year, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Istanbul Chamber of Commerce (ITO) has made the forecast in
the wake of a visit by Turkish government ministers to Iraq last
week, according to Turkey's newspaper Daily News.
</P>
<P>
A 27-man ITO delegation paid a visit to Iraq, which coincided
with the visit by Justice Minister Sevket Kazan and Education
Minister Mehmet Saglam.
</P>
<P>
ITO Chairman Mehmet Yildirim said in a statement after the
trip to Baghdad that during the visit, the ITO delegation held
meetings with Iraqi Minister of Trade Mohammed Mehdi Saleh,
Health Minister Omed Medhat and other high-ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
The delegation's goal was to secure a good share for Turkey of
the trade with Iraq following a recent U.N. decision to allow Iraq
to export two billion dollars worth of oil every six months to buy
food and medicine for the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Yildirim said that the Iraqi authorities viewed Turkey and
Turkish businessmen as the best possible trade partners and he
listed a number of proposals for government and private sector
firms to help them reach the one-billion-dollar trade volume by
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The ITO chairman emphasized the importance of the
International Baghdad Fair to be held in November and called on
public and private firms to take part in it. He also proposed a
permanent representation of Turkish firms in Baghdad and an
improvement in the services provided by Turkey's Baghdad Trade
Attache.
</P>
<P>
The ITO will do its best to contribute to the improvement of
commercial ties between Turkey and Iraq, said Yildirim.

<HEADLINE> Women Textile Workers Become Community Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Yu Yundi lost her job in a
textile mill three months ago, and "felt that life was meaningless
and sulked all day" when she was laid off, but learned to "shrug off
the distress" when she surprisingly got a new job -- she is now the
happy and successful director of a neighborhood committee.
</P>
<P>
In China's largest metropolis and manufacturing center, large
numbers of female textile workers have been laid off as the city
readjusted its industry.
</P>
<P>
To relieve the unemployment pressures, some of Shanghai's women
workers have been encouraged to become stewardesses or shop
assistants.
</P>
<P>
The Yangpu District of Shanghai, however, which has a number
of textile companies, took the lead in employing laid-off
female textile workers to work in neighborhood committees.
</P>
<P>
"Compared with those working for airlines or in business, my
income is not high," said Li Cunying, a female worker laid off
from another textile mill, "But my job with the community makes me
deal with various kinds of people, and I'm happy here."
</P>
<P>
In March of this year, 102 female textile workers in the
district passed exams to act as local officials in neighborhood
committees, while being paid by their former employers.
</P>
<P>
Many of them used to be foremen or model workers, and more than
half are Communist Party members. They bring down the average age
of officials in the committees but raise the efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The practice has been carried out in nine neighborhoods and one
town in Yangpu District. The new appointees come from various
industries: meters and instruments, machinery, electronics, and of
course textiles.
</P>
<P>
Of 349 laid-off workers appointed to work in neighborhood
committees in June of this year, 268 were from the textile
industry.
</P>
<P>
In October, the district plans to appoint another 220 laid-off
workers, while next year's figure is expected to be 600.
</P>
<P>
Across Shanghai, about 15,000 laid-off workers will be put to
work in neighborhood committees.
</P>
<P>
"The re-allocation of laid-off workers to neighborhood
committees is an effective measure and provides valuable practice
for Shanghai's re-employment project. The practice also helps
raise the efficiency and quality of work in communities," said an
official with the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Civil Affairs.

<HEADLINE> Income Decrease Leads to Middle Class Shrinkage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 20 (Xinhua) -- An erosion in the average annual
income of the Jordanian family has led to a shrinkage of the
middle class in the kingdom, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to a study for planning Jordan's central region,
there are 434,000 families in the central region, accounting for
65 percent of the total number of families in the country,
English-language newspaper Jordan Times said.
</P>
<P>
The annual average income per family in the central area
amounts to 3,929 dinars (about 5,500 U.S. dollars), but the per
capita income available for spending is 629 dinars (about 880
dollars) per year.
</P>
<P>
The situation differs from one area to another as the average
annual per capital income in Amman reaches 765 dinars (about
1,071 dollars) while the figure comes down to 540 dinars (about
756 dollars) in Zarqa and Balqa.
</P>
<P>
Available figures show that Jordanians enjoy high standard of
per capita income in pre-Gulf War period, but the Gulf War made
destructive impact on Jordan's economy due to its perceived
support for the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The per capita income in the kingdom amounted to 1,560
dollars in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Fairouz Masoud, director of the project for planning
the central region, explained that the figures show an erosion
in the annual income of the family and a shrinkage of the
middle class in the Jordanian society.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia's Cholera Outbreak Not Controlled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A cholera outbreak in
northern Mongolia has not yet been brought under control and, with
increasing number of cases, is feared to spread to other areas,
reported the newspaper Ardyn Erkh today quoting a Health and
Social Security Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
People's ignorance of the danger cholera might bring about,
and their disobedience of hygiene rules set by the Special State
Commission are among the factors behind the current serious
situation, the official added.
</P>
<P>
Since the first cholera patient was found on August 7 in the
remote Khoetol county in northern Selenge province bordering

<HEADLINE> Beijing Financial Sector Opens Wider </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- China's capital is leading the
country's other cities in opening up the financial sector, if one
counts the number of foreign bank offices.
</P>
<P>
There are 213 representative offices of foreign banks in
Beijing, including five branch banks, according to the local
branch of the People's Bank of China, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The five branch banks, with combined assets valued at 1.07
billion US dollars, had 300 million US dollars in deposits and
loans, respectively, by the end of July.
</P>
<P>
The branches have handled import and export business worth
nearly 200 million US dollars, about a quarter of the total for
import and export of foreign-funded enterprises in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has seen a boom in foreign financial institutions since
1979, when the Export-Import Bank of Japan was allowed to set up a
representative office here. In July of last year the Bank of Tokyo
became the first foreign bank to open a branch in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The other four overseas banks that have opened branches in
China's capital are the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation, Citibank, First National Bank of Chicago, and Korea
Foreign Exchange Bank.

<HEADLINE> Peres Calls on Netanyahu to Meet Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 20 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of the third
anniversary of the Oslo accords, Israeli opposition leader Shimon
Peres called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to drop his
boycott of Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a celebration Monday at Beit Gavriel in northern
Israel, Peres said that the Oslo accords have created a state of
affairs which is irreversible.
</P>
<P>
Peres, Chairman of the Labor Party, noted that it would be a
fatal mistake if Netanyahu refused to upgrade the current
Palestinian autonomy as part of a final Palestinian settlement to
be reached by 1999.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and
Arafat have become partners of the peace process, and most of the
Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are no longer
under Israeli rule.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the former Israeli premier slammed Netanyahu's
policies, saying dividing the West Bank town of Hebron into
civilian entities would lead to confrontation with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Netanyahu and the inner cabinet held a special
session to debate a new proposal for the redeployment of the
Israeli troops in Hebron, but failed to reach any conclusions.
</P>
<P>
The new plan was prepared by Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai with a proposal to change the Oslo accords with regard
to the extent of the Palestinian control in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the PNA would only gain civilian control over
the area, and overriding security control would remain in the
Israeli hands.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accords, the Israeli army is to pull back
from approximately 80 percent of Hebron, leaving all Arab
neighborhoods of the town under full PNA control, which is
designated as Area A.
</P>
<P>
However, under the new proposal, Hebron would no longer be
designated as Area A, but part of Area B, an area of shared
control, with the Israeli army to move freely as it deems
necessary for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Peres said that the principles of the agreement in Hebron are
no different from in the rest of the West Bank, namely, the
Palestinians will have self-government to a large extent. "If the
government wants to deprive them of that, all the rest is only
talk," he added.
</P>
<P>
The new Israeli government boycotted the celebration, which was
also attended by Palestinian officials and Norwegian
representatives who helped initiate the Oslo accords in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Launches Nationwide Drive Against Drug Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has launched a nationwide
drive against drug cirmes recently.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics show that 932 cases of drug smuggling,
stockpiling and illegal production have been discovered since
January 1995.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,241 kg of opium, 45 kg of heroin, 585kg of
marijuana, 234 kg of other narcotics, and millions drug ampoules
were confiscated.
</P>
<P>
The police also discovered nearly 3,000 cases of drug abuse.
In the past seven months of this year, the discovered cases
increased 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Cases of heroin trafficking alone increased 50 percent compared
with the whole 1995 figure.

A number of local traffickers joined hands with foreigners, and
even some corrupt officials of the drug control agency were
involved.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam now has nearly 190,000 drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, 17,000 ha out of 20,000 ha of opium
poppy in remote mountain areas were destroyed, and many drug
trafficking rings were discovered.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Create Three New National Parks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Three more national parks will
be created in Uganda soon, reported the local daily the New
Vision today.
</P>
<P>
The Acting Executive Director of Uganda Wildlife Authority
(UWA) Dr. Eric Edroma was quoted as saying that the new parks are
Kayiso-Tonya in the southwestern district of Hoima, the Ajai
wildlife reserve in northwestern district of Arua and the Pian
Upe wildlife reserve in south Karamoja, near kenya.
</P>
<P>
The three parks were formally controlled hunting areas and
games sanctuaries, Edroma said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the three parks had been renamed wildlife
reserves, community wildlife areas and wildlife sanctuaries
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Of the three, Kayiso-Tonya, covering an area of 225 square km,
used to be a home to Uganda kob (a small kind of antelope),
hartebeest, and buffalo which are facing extermination by
poachers. Ajai wildlife reserve with an area of 158 square
km was a white rhino sanctuary before its extinction in the
country, the UWA boss said.
</P>
<P>
The creation of more national parks is aimed at protecting
wildlives and developing tourism.
</P>
<P>
To preserve and manage wildlives for posterity, the Uganda
National Parks was established in 1952. The organisation presently
manages 10 national parks, namely, Murchison Falls, Queen
Elizabeth, Kidepo Valley, Lake Mburo, Rwenzori Mountains, Bwindi
Impenetrable , Mgahinga Gorilla, Kibale, Semiliki, Mount Elgon
National Parks. enditem

<HEADLINE> PA Likely To Unilaterally Build Industrial Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Authority (PA)
has reportedly decided to unilaterally build its first industrial
zone rather than a joint venture with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian development company PADICO signed a contract last
week to construct the zone at Karni in the Gaza Strip
following the PA decision.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians decided to go alone out of growing concern
that Israel and donor countries are dragging their feet in
contributing, said Muhammad Ishtayeh, Administration Director of
the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and
Reconstruction, in Gaza Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The unilateral move should come as a surprise to Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Industry and Trade Minister Natan
Sharansky, who met twice late last week to decide on Israel's policy
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Aides to the premier refrained from giving a comment on the
development, saying it is a matter for Sharansky's ministry,
where no one was available for comment Monday night.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that the two favor the zone straddling the
Gaza-Israeli border, an idea they feel will alleviate security
fears in central Israel. The U.S. and Israel originally committed
six million dollars and 14 million dollars respectively toward the
Karni project.
</P>
<P>
Initial development of the industrial zone entirely on the
autonomous area is supported by U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce
Stuart Eizenstat. "We must, must, must get this industrial
zone off the ground," Eizenstat told reporters upon his return
from a week-long visit to Israel, Jordan, Egypt and Gaza
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat also indicated the U.S. intends to have the zone to
house high industry run by American and Israeli textile companies,
which would help ease the Palestinian economic crisis due to the
ongoing closure.
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat said the key is to begin work on the first phase of
the project in Gaza immediately, and maybe at a later stage add a
second within Israel.

<HEADLINE> Absolute Poverty Population Rises in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's population at the
absolute poverty level has increased to a large extent over the
past decade, according to a recent poverty monitoring survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, jointly prepared by the Bangladesh Bureau of
Statistics and the Center on Integrated Rural Development for Asia
and the Pacific, estimated that between 47.6 and 48.5 percent of
the total 120 million people are living in the absolute poverty
level.
</P>
<P>
An earlier survey published in 1994 indicated the extent of the
absolute poverty level at 43.5 percent of the total population.
</P>
<P>
The survey attributed the reasons for the upward trend mainly
to the increase in prices of rice, the main source of calorie in
food consumption patterns of Bangladeshi households.
</P>
<P>
About 66.1 percent of the poor are landless or have lands less
than 0.49 acres. Only 9.9 percent of the poor own land of up to
two acres or more.
</P>
<P>
Among the poor, 63.4 percent household heads are found
illiterate, the survey added.

MANILA -- A total of 100 kidnapping incidents involving 147

crime as saying that the families of the victims have shelled out
some 32.4 million pesos (1.24 million U.S. dollars) in ransom.
</P>
<P>
The officials said at least 14 victims died during captivity
while two were sexually assaulted. They added that 28 of the
victims were rescued while 67 were released unharmed.

ZAGREB -- Croatian President Franjo Tudjman met with a group of

leader of the Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia-Herzegovina Bozo
Rajic and other senior political and military leaders of the
Bosnian Croats took place at the Adriatic island of Brijuni, where
the Croatian president is vacationing.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed recently in Geneva by Tudjman on
behalf of the Croats and Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic on
behalf of the Muslims, the shaky federation between the two ethnic
groups should be strengthened by the end of this month, with
Croats abolishing their statelet "Herceg-Bosna" and the Muslim-led
central government transferring much of its power to the
federation.

allow any attacks on its civilians or soldiers.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came after reports that the Lebanese pro-Iranian
Hezbollah might have acquired long-range Katyusha rockets capable
of reaching as far as Karmiel and Haifa's bayside suburbs, areas

<HEADLINE> China's Libraries Facing Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, AUGUST 20 (Xinhua) -- China's libraries have
benefited in development from economic growth, but they also face
serious economic challenges, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Du Ke, secretary general of the 62nd General Conference of the
International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA), said at a
news conference today that, "As a developing country, China lacks
funds to meet the needs of every library in buying books."
</P>
<P>
He said that the sharp rise in book prices and other factors
have forced some of the 200,000 libraries across China to cut back
on the number of books and magazines they buy.
</P>
<P>
The unequal economic growth in the eastern and western parts of
China has resulted in discrepancies in books and services at
libraries in different areas, he noted, and what is more,
documents and data are concentrated in Beijing and a few major
cities, while information cannot be used to the full in remote
regions.
</P>
<P>
According to Du, to some extent Chinese libraries mirror the
state of libraries in all other developing countries. How
libraries in developing countries contribute to economic growth
will be a key topic during the IFLA 62nd General Conference, whose
theme will be "Reform and challenge: Libraries and economic
development."
</P>
<P>
"In terms of management, we have failed to make full use of
libraries as an industry themselves," Du said.
</P>
<P>
Operating expenses for the country's libraries average 0.1 yuan
per person annually.

<P>
HARARE, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Nurses and general hands at
Parirenyatwa, Harare and Chitungwiza hospitals here went on
strike yesterday, demanding a 20 percent wage increase, the daily
Heralk reported today.
</P>
<P>
The strike has paralysed operations and placed the health of
patients at risk, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Patients went without food, minor operations were cancelled
and some patients were discharged as the nurses and the general
hands left the wards and kitchens to mill outside.
</P>
<P>
Junior doctors are also said to be considering joining the
strike today if no agreement is reached on the salary increments.
</P>
<P>
Some nurses and general hands said although the cost of living
had risen by more than 20 percent, they were surprised when only
between three and six percent increases reflected on their
pay-slips. enditem

BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Three new air routes linking the
cities of Chongqing, Chengdu, and Qingdao with Hong Kong are
scheduled to open in October, bringing the total number of cities
with the service in the inland area to 16.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong service is currently available in Beijing, Dalian,
Hangzhou, Kunming, Tianjin, Shanghai, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Guangzhou,
Shantou, Shenyang, Xi'an, and Ningbo.
</P>
<P>
According to the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC),
business of Chinese airlines has expanded in the past few years
thanks to reforms and the opening to the outside world and the
fact that more people from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan are coming
to the mainland for business and travel.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, last year Chinese airlines carried
more than three million passengers, hitting an all time high.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> More Than 250,000 Libraries In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official said here
today that the country now has more than 258,000 libraries, 600
times the number for the 1950s, after the founding of the People's
Republic.
</P>
<P>
In 1949, China had only 392 libraries, according to Du Ke,
secretary-general of the organizing committee for the 62nd General
Conference of the International Federation of Library Associations
which is scheduled to open here on August 25.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that China is one of the countries
whose libraries have expanded most quickly, and that it is a
leader in terms of number of libraries and size of collections.
</P>
<P>
These include public, university, scientific, and other special
libraries, whose combined collection exceeds 1.7 billion books,
according to Du.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the most valuable possessions of human civilization
have been preserved by Chinese libraries," Du said.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Library -- China's national library -- now ranks fifth
in the world in size. China also has the world's highest library
-- the Tibet Autonomous Region Library.
</P>
<P>
Du noted that modern technology, such as computers and laser
discs, is also being used in Chinese libraries.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Plans to Revive Cut Flower Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has planed to revive
the foliage and cut flower business for export, sources here said
today.
</P>
<P>
Under the sponsorship of the Industrial Services Bureau of the
North Western Province, a Sri Lankan-German joint venture has been
floated to revive the business, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
With the advice of a German consultant, the joint venture has
successfully carried out experiments to process wild grown and
freely available indigenous leaves, flowers, roots and seeds to
satisfy the need of an emerging market in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Having displayed their commodities at an exhibition in Europe
recently, the company has been able to clinch orders to the value
of 65,000 US dollars. Several Middle East countries and Japan are
also considered to be important buyers of Sri Lankan foliage and
cut flower.
</P>
<P>
The foliage and cut flower business commenced in Sri Lanka in
the early 1970s, flourished in the 1980s with almost six percent
of the global market and slumped in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the business' decline in Sri Lanka included the
formation of the European Union, the development of tissue culture
and preferential treatment for Latin American and African
countries in this business worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, there was a drop in orders from traditional
buyers, mainly the Netherlands, Germany, France, UK, Italy, the
Middle east countries and Japan, and most Sri Lankan companies in
the business closed down, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, a few large companies in this country have kept doing
the business with thinner profit margins in the past few years.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Refutes U.S. Republican Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) today refuted charges from the Republican
Party of the United States that defined the DPRK as a "sponsor of
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The refutal came from an article in the Rodong Sinmun, the
organ of the Workers' Party of Korea.
</P>
<P>
The article pointed out that the U.S. Republican party, in its
"Policy Manifesto" published at its recent national congress,
criticized the DPRK-U.S. framework agreement on the nuclear issue
by defining the DPRK as a "sponsor of terrorism."
</P>
<P>
"This showed that the Republicans do not want peace in the
Korean peninsula by seriously harming the dignity and reputation
of the DPRK," the article said.
</P>
<P>
The framework agreement was not only beneficial to the two
countries but also in the interest of world peace and the
development of international relations, the article noted.
</P>
<P>
What they really want is to kill the agreement, stifle the DPRK
and dominate the whole of Korea, it added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Republican has endangered the outstanding bilateral
issues in a short-sighted manner in pursuing partisan interests,
the article warned.
</P>
<P>
In the hope of winning the forthcoming presidential election,
they has resorted to every conceivable means and even magnified
the DPRK issue and slandered it, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The article demanded the U.S. Republicans view the
DPRK-U.S. issue cool-headedly and act with discretion.
</P>
<P>
If the Republican party refused to discard the thinking pattern
of cold war and continued heaping pressure on the DPRK, it would
be unfavorable to the U.S. itself, the article concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Former Bangladeshi president
Hussain Muhammad Ershad Monday was granted bail by the High Court
Division in a corruption case known as "the Japanese boat purchase
case."
</P>
<P>
This is for the first time Ershad has obtained bail in any case
against him since he was toppled down in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Anti-corruption filed the case against Ershad in

million (about 8.2 Million US dollars) in purchasing speed-boats
from Japan at a higher price.
</P>
<P>
The former president was sentenced to imprisonment of three
years in 1991. Since then he has been staying in prison as a total
of 20 criminal cases are still pending against him.
</P>
<P>
Ershad, who is still the chairman of the country's third

<P>
WELLINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government
approved this afternoon a deal with a consortium led by the NZ
company Fletcher Challenge which will buy the state-owned Forestry
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The consortium, also including New Zealand's largest investment

corporation at a price of 2 billion NZ dollars (1.4 billion US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The deal will give the consortium the cutting rights to 188,000

</P>
<P>
It is the largest state assets sale in NZ since Telecom was
sold to American interests in 1990.

But the sale has been strongly opposed by the opposition
parties, which have vowed to take back the Forestry Corporation if
they win the general election in October.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jim Bolger declared in parliament today that the
sale "will enable us to reach the position of having no net
foreign debt in New Zealand, no government net foreign debt for
the second time since 1857."

<HEADLINE> Lives of Two Young Lamas in Tibet (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIGAZE, August 20 (Xinhua) -- At 9:00 a.m. (Beijing time) Lhaba
Wangdui, a young lama in the Zhaxi Lhunbo Monastery in Tibet,
finishes boiling water, making tea, and sweeping the floor, then
goes to the main hall to chant scriptures.
</P>
<P>
His fellow monk, Purpu, takes off his kasaya (patchwork outer
vestment worn by Buddhist monks) at the same time, and heads for a
nearby store run by the monastery.
</P>
<P>
Lhaba and Purpu are both 18 years old and have served as lamas
for four years, but their lives have their differences. Lhaba has
been assigned odd jobs for the monastery's administrative office,
the Democratic Management Committee, while Purpu has been serving
as a shop assistant in a store run by his monastery for two years.
</P>
<P>
The 500-year-old Zhaxi Lhunbo Monastery, located in Xigaze,
Tibet's second largest city, serves as the seat of Panchen
Lamas. It has 800 lamas, more than any other temple in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Both Lhaba and Purpu readily accepted the assignments given
them by the monastery. Purpu says, "I am ready to do anything that
will help the development of our temple."
</P>
<P>
Life in a monastery can be monotonous, without any recreational
activity. But the lamas' standard of living has improved
substantially so that, although they used to eat very few
vegetables, they now have vegetables and rice every day.
</P>
<P>
For Lhaba, life in his monastery is good, but he does not have
enough time to recite scriptures. After having his breakfast at
6:30 every morning, he heads for the office of the Democratic
Management Committee to begin work.

ANKARA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Rebels of the outlawed

seven others late Monday night in an attack in Sivas, eastern
Turkey, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported this
morning.

The agency said that a group of PKK rebels once blocked the
Sivas-Ordu Highway in Taspinar village of Koyulhisar town in Sivas

and later strafed the civilians, killing two women and one child
and wounding seven people including one child, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The wounded had been taken to the Research Hospital of the
University of Republic in Sivas for treatment.
</P>
<P>
However, the PKK rebels escaped from the scene, and the Turkish
security forces started large-scale military operations in search
of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the agency said that the Turkish security forces
raided a den in Alibeykoy Hizir district in Istanbul earlier this
morning, killing two gunmen.

<HEADLINE> Lives of Two Young Lamas in Tibet (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His schedule is to recite scriptures with other monks once in
the morning and again in the afternoon, and to work for the
committee all day long, retiring at 9:00 or 10:00 in the evening.
</P>
<P>
"To keep up with other lamas in the study of scriptures, I have
to make the most of my time before breakfast and after work," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
He often chants for one hour after getting up at 5:30, then
studies the Tibetan language and scriptures until the wee hours of
the morning.
</P>
<P>
All the monastery's lamas have Sundays free. Many go to markets
to buy vegetables and non-staple foods. But Lhaba usually stays in
the monastery to study scriptures. He now can recite 160 pages of
text. A lama who can recite 500 pages is regarded as a senior.
</P>
<P>
Lhaba hopes that in the not too distant future he will be able
to recite even more and can study to be Gexi (the highest degree
of learning in Tibet Buddhism).
</P>
<P>
Compared with Lhaba, Purpu has even less spare time. Tourists,
pilgrims, and nearby residents all like to visit his store, which
has only four shop assistants, leaving him precious little time to
read scriptures. He studies mainly during morning religious
activity held in the monastery from 5:00 to 8:00.
</P>
<P>
Purpu lives in the monastery, but has to guard the store
throughout the night from time to time, and manages to squeeze in
some time to study while on duty then.
</P>
<P>
Although he cannot recite many pages of text, he is considered
an efficient shop assistant who has a comprehensive knowledge of
goods in the store at the ready and serves customers warmly.
</P>
<P>
An old Tibetan woman, surveying the contents of the store,
says, "I am quite satisfied with the services of this young lama."
</P>
<P>
When asked which is more interesting, reciting scriptures or
serving as a shop assistant, Purpu replies that reciting
scriptures seems to be easier because "you have to use your head
while doing business."

<HEADLINE> Election of Bangladesh's New President Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi High Court has upheld
Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed's election as the president on the
ground that the justice office is not an office of profit as
claimed by the petitioner, Abu Bakr Siddique.
</P>
<P>
The division bench of the High Court Monday ruled that the
petitioner had no right to file the writ petition and that the
office of president is not an office of profit in the service of
the republic.
</P>
<P>
Being the only candidate nominated by the ruling Awami League
(AL), Shahabuddin was elected the president on July 23 by the
Election Commission to replace president Abdul Rahman Biswas,
whose term will be due in October.
</P>
<P>
Abu Bakr Siddique, an advocate, had filed a writ petition early
this month challenging the election of the new president by
alleging that Justice Shahabuddin was disqualified to hold the
presidency as the election violated articles of the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The court, however, certified that the case involved a
substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the
constitution of Bangladesh. It will be a certificate appeal to be
filed within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
The petitioner said that he would file the appeal without
delay.

<HEADLINE> 16 People Die of Gastroenteritis in West Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 20 (Xinhua) -- At least 16 people have died
of gastroenteritis in western Nepal during the past few weeks, a
report said here today.
</P>
<P>
At least 16 patients including children have been killed so far
by the seasonal water-borne stomach disease in west Nepal's Dang
district, about 375 kilometers west of Kathmandu, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
The disease, which mainly affects the stomach and intestines,
is caused by contaminated drinking water and stale food, it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another report said that cases of encephalitis are
on the rise in several eastern Nepali districts where eight people
have died of the disease since two months ago.
</P>
<P>
A total of 56 cases of encephalitis have been recorded there
this year with more children patients, hospital sources said.
</P>
<P>
As encephalitis breaks out as an epidemic every year in the
country's eastern region with a big death toll, pediatricians
there have suggested the government to set up a research center on
the disease in the region.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Governor Placed on Probation for Whitewater Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Former Arkansas Governor Jim
Guy Tucker was sentenced to four years on probation Monday in
Little Rock for his Whitewater crimes.
</P>
<P>
A judge said Tucker deserved mercy because of his chronic liver
disease, according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, the sentencing of President Bill Clinton's
former business partner James McDougal was postponed until after
the Election Day amid words he is cooperating with Whitewater
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Tucker faced up to 10 years in prison for fraud and conspiracy,
and prosecutors had asked U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. to
impose the maximum.
</P>
<P>
But Howard agreed with doctors who testified that prison time
could kill the 53-year-old former governor.
</P>
<P>
Tucker said his chronic liver condition -- he is on a waiting
list for a transplant -- and his conviction left him suffering
intense personal, professional, family and financial anguish.
</P>
<P>
Outside the courthouse, Tucker said he was innocent and would
continue with appeals.
</P>
<P>
Howard ordered Tucker to start his probation with 18 months
home detention and also pay 150,000 dollars in restitution, plus
120,000 dollars in interest dating from the mid-1980s, along with
a 25,000-dollar fine.
</P>
<P>
Tucker, who resigned on July 15 this year under threat of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
McDougal faces up to 84 years in prison and 4.5 million dollars
of fine. He, his ex-wife, Susan McDougal, and Tucker were
convicted in a Whitewater-related case on May 28 of fraudulently
obtaining and using federally-backed loans.
</P>
<P>
In an August 9 court order unsealed Monday, McDougal's
sentencing was pushed back to November 18, two weeks after the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Susan, 42, awaits sentencing on Tuesday. She faces 17 years
and 1 million dollars of fine for fraud and other offenses.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Oil Price Continues to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The price of OPEC oil continued
its rise last week, climbing three percent to 20.12 U.S. dollars a
barrel over the previous week, the oil cartel's secretariat
announced today.
</P>
<P>
The average price of OPEC crude has risen seven percent over
the past two weeks, when it was 18.8 dollars a barrel, and is 83
cents and 1.75 dollars higher than in July and June respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, it is still lower than OPEC's 21 dollars per barrel
internal benchmark price.
</P>
<P>
The price of OPEC oil has been rising since the end of 1995, when
prices were some 16.49 dollars per barrel, partly due to
strong Asian demand, which had helped soak up over-production by
OPEC members, and low oil stocks by major consumers.
</P>
<P>
In its ministerial meeting in Vienna in June, OPEC set a
second-half production quota of 25.033 million barrels per day (mbpd),
0.513 million barrels higher than the cartel's self-imposed
ceiling of 24.5 mbpd.
</P>
<P>
But actual production in July was above the new quota at 25.59
mbpd, slightly up on June's output of 25.563 mbpd.
</P>
<P>
Former OPEC Secretary General Du Subroto said earlier this
month that he didn't believe the re-entry of Iraq onto the world
oil market next month after an oil-for-food deal with the United
Nations, would affect the price of crude oil if all members stick
to their respective production quotas.

<HEADLINE> One Coca Grower Dead as Troops Fight Peasants in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- One people was killed
and 22 others wounded when troops fired bullets and tear gas to
fend off coca-growing peasants who tried to seize a provincial
capital in southern Colombia.
</P>
<P>
A total of 6,000 peasants tried to break through military
barricades surrounding Florencia, capital of the Caqueta
province. They were protesting against stepped-up government
efforts to eradicate coca growing in their region.
</P>
<P>
Peasants claimed that their families will go hungry if they
stop growing coca because the government has not provided them
with a viable alternative.
</P>
<P>
Regional military commander Nestor Ramirez told a local radio
that his troops opened fire after gunmen who had "infiltrated" the
coca growers began shooting at the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The military has sealed off Florencia, 380 kilometers south of
Bogota, to prevent it from being overrun by an estimated 45,000
coca-growing peasants gathering in the area.
</P>
<P>
Last week, thousands of coca growers took over Mocoa, capital
of the Putumayo province further south, posing the most serious
threat yet to public order in more than a month of protests.
</P>
<P>
Six people have been killed and some 100 injured in clashes
between soldiers and coca growers since protests began last
month.

<P>
SANTIAGO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Chile's union with the South
American Common Market (Mercosur) extends this free trade area
already established among four countries.
</P>
<P>
Chilean President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle and his Uruguayan
counterpart Julio Maria Sanguinetti, in a joint declaration today,
 pointed out that the Mercosur-Chilean agreement will constitute a
decisive step in the process of regional integration as part of
the framework of the Latin American Integration Association
(ALADI).
</P>
<P>
It will contribute a lot to the global growth of an atmosphere
of peace and democracy, the document said.
</P>
<P>
The joint declaration was signed during President Sanguinetti's
visit to Chile, which is the first state visit paid to this
country by a member country of Mercosur which also includes
Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the declaration and an extradition
treaty were signed, President Sanguinetti stressed Chile's
importance in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said Mercosur was also of great political and democratic
significance, and urged that Mercosur and Chile tighten political
and civic relations so as to promote regional integration.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean president said Chile looked upon Mercosur not only
as a tariff agreement but as an organization that facilitates
regional integration in physical, energy and service aspects as
well.

MEXICO CITY, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese businessman
kidnapped by gunmen was freed today after a two million dollar
ransom was paid, a Mexican law enforcement official said.
</P>
<P>
Manmuro Konno, the President of Sanyo's Video Component

abandoned home in the northern Mexican town of Tijuana, where he
took refuge after his release, Baja California State Attorney

</P>
<P>
The businessman was released after a state police officer
handed over the ransom to the kidnappers Saturday night in
response to their demand for two million dollars for Konno's safe
return.
</P>
<P>
The Sanyo boss, who lives near San Diego, California, and

and are part of a ring operating in Tijuana and Ensenada, 100
kilometers south.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian military has
ruled out negotiations with kidnappers in Irian Jaya, the
country's easternmost province, for the release of 12 hostages,
Antara news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Irian Jaya Military Commander Major General Dunidja said Monday
that the armed forces would not negotiate with the security
disturbing group currently holding 12 employees of a forestry
company.
</P>
<P>
The security forces are still chasing them in an attempt to
rescue the hostages, he said.
</P>
<P>
The security disturbing group led by Yogi Kogoya initially took
16 of the 35 employees of Pt. Kmundan Rya, a giant timber company,
when they were taking a rest in a logging camp last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Two of the hostages were released later to send a letter from
the gang to the armed forces. And then two more hostages managed
to escape.
</P>
<P>
This is the second hostage-taking case in Irian Jaya this year.
A group of 26 Indonesian and foreign scientists were kidnapped on

They were rescued by the Indonesian armed forces through a
military operation in May.

<HEADLINE> Austria's Export Lags Behind Demands in Eastern Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Austria's export to east
European countries has lagged behind the economic
development and consumption demands there, official statistics
show.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics released by the Austrian Institute for
Economic Research revealed that despite a 25 percent increase in
1995 over 1994, Austria's export growth to east European countries
ran lower than the average export growth of east European
countries to Austria.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Austria's investment in eastern Europe fell
from 11.4 percent of the region's total foreign investment in 1994
to 9.5 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Though the figures are not so bad, Austrian economic experts
said Austria has de fac'to lost its leading position in the export
and investment markets of eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Austria has been left behind by the strong demands stimulated
by speeding economic growth in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, in 1995, import of the Czech Republic
increased 39.5 percent, while that of Poland grew 36.8 percent,
Slovenia 29.4 percent, Slovakia 28.3 percent and Hungary 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Private consumption and industrial production, two driving
forces of economic growth, have also been on the rise.
</P>
<P>
While retail sales and workers' wages increased swiftly,
industrial production in the Czech Republic climbed up 9.2 percent
last year, in Poland up 9.4 percent, in Slovakia 8.3 percent, and
in Hungary 4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, industrial production in the European Union
countries only registered an average increase of 3.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the demands by east European countries had been
underestimated and predicted that the strong demands by the middle
class in the region will continue to grow.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's Textile industry
resumed operation Monday after nearly three weeks of total closure
in protest against the government's new tax measures.
</P>
<P>
All the 210 textile mills have resumed production after Prime
Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba assured manufacturers that the
government will provide full cooperation to the industry.
</P>
<P>
The textile industry closed down all the mills from late last
month to protest against the government's decision to double the
sales tax rate to 15 percent for textile products from mid-July
when the 1996-97 fiscal year began.
</P>
<P>
The close-down of the mills had directly affected the life of
more than 20,000 workers employed by the industry.
</P>
<P>
According to an official for the Nepal Textile Industry
Association (NTIA), the association decided to reopen the textile
mills after the government agreed to provide full support to boost
domestic textile industry.
</P>
<P>
The NTIA also asked the government to check the cross-border
smuggling of textiles between Nepal and India in order to support
Nepal's textile industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The rising number of U.S. military
personnel and families has resulted in tensions and worry in the
area of an American military base at Aviano, in Italy.
</P>
<P>
The problem has prompted mayors of 10 cities and towns around
the base to write to the Italian central government and provincial
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The number of U.S. troops in the area has risen sharply from
1,700 to 3,000 and and at times has peaked at 8,500-9,000,
considerably out-numbering local people.
</P>
<P>
The mayors said that the relationship between the Americans and
local residents had become tense. The presence of the Americans
forced up local prices and occasionally depleted shop supplies.
</P>
<P>
The mayors appealed to the government to show concern over the
problem and, if it could not be solved, at least stop it from
worsening -- as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, conflict between the Americans and local people
would result in terrible consequences, the mayors warned.
</P>
<P>
American troops and families and their vehicles are are seen
everywhere in the streets of Aviano.
</P>
<P>
The local people complain of noise and air pollution caused by
aircraft, cars and trucks, and several demonstrations have
resulted.
</P>
<P>
The population spurt in Aviano led to fierce rises in the
prices of many commodities.
</P>
<P>
The Aviano U.S. military base, like Ramstein in Germany, has
been on leasehold to U.S. forces from the Italian government,
since 1956.

LONDON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Former world sprint king Linford

injury prevented him from competing against new Olympic champion
Donovan Bailey at an international athletics meet in Gateshead,
Britain on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Hui Village In Hainan Province Prosperous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sanya, August 20 (Xinhua) -- People from the Hui Village in
Sanya, Hainan Province, earned only 80 yuan per person a year, and
had 20 hectares of farmland and six small boats 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
But the 5,000 residents of the village earned 40 million yuan
(about $4.8 million), and scored over four million yuan in net
profits in 1995. The per-capita net income averaged 2,500 yuan
last year.
</P>
<P>
Ever-growing tourism has brought prosperity to the Hui village
in Sanya, south of Hainan Province, according to Hai Shiwu, the
imam of a local Moslem mosque.
</P>
<P>
Since China initiated the policy of the reform and opening up
in 1979, the tropical seaside tourism industry has been
flourishing in Sanya, which is visited by nearly two million
tourists from the rest of China and the world every year.
</P>
<P>
The Hui residents, good at business, have been working hard to
market tourist souvenirs, including pearls, gold and silver
jewelry, jadeware and coconut carvings.
</P>
<P>
Many villagers have become prosperous by marketing such
souvenirs. Running two stores selling such products, Ha Yumei, a
female villager, earns a monthly income of over 400,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Pu Ruixiong has earned nearly one million yuan a year since
1990. He now has four trucks, two motorcycles, a car and a villa
with a floor space of 1,100 square meters. He runs a car-repair
workshop and a stone-crushing mill.
</P>
<P>
In the village, well-decorated houses have replaced shabby
single-storey shacks. Spacious dance-halls and video projection
halls have replaced traditional stages.
</P>
<P>
The village also has a whole range of service facilities and
educational establishments, such as stores, hotels, schools,
kindergartens and libraries.
</P>
<P>
Many families in the village send their children to Arabic
countries for advanced study. Hai Shiwu, 30, returned home earlier
this year after studying in Iran for six years.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, ten villagers have gone to Mecca on
pilgrimages, Hai said, adding that the village has six mosques.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment Still Strong in Guangdong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 20 (Xinhua) -- In the first seven months of
this year, Guangdong Province used 6.12 billion US dollars in
overseas investment, up 5.2 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
During that period it approved 3,232 projects, a figure which
was down 22 percent. Contractual overseas investment, however,
came to 113.5 million US dollars, up 16.9 percent, indicating that
average investment for a single project has increased by a large
margin and that the investment scale is expanding, officials with
the provincial foreign trade and economic comission say.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts say that the province's overseas investment
structure has changed as state foreign trade and economic policies
are adjusted.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment in infrastructure, agriculture, and raw
materials, which are less effected by the adjustment of import
taxation policies, has apparently increased.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the province held a fair in Hong Kong to
attract business, and signed contracts on more than 360 projects
for developing raw materials, transportation, energy, and
"high-yield, high-grade, and high-efficiency" agriculture, with a
total investment of four billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Guangdong has come up with a series of measures to
allow more goods made by overseas-backed companies on the Chinese
market. This, analysts say, will be helpful for the province to
attract overseas investment, especially from multinationals.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Calls for Building Better Economic Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
called on the international community to work together in building
a more just and equitable economic order securing welfare for the
human race.
</P>
<P>
"The developing countries -- whose total population is the vast
majority of the human race -- are still living in poverty and
backwardness," the president said at a banquet he held here last
night in honor of visiting Turkish Prime Minster Necmettin
Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
"These imbalance will become a source of world anxiety. And
such a condition would in the long run benefit no country or group
of countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto underlined the urgent need for cooperation of the
international community because the opportunity now existed to
build a world that is safer and more peaceful than the present
one.
</P>
<P>
With special reference to bilateral relations, Soeharto told
his guest that the two nations and governments have the
opportunity to expand their cooperation for mutual benefit and
progress.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan, who became Turkish prime minister last June, arrived
at the Indonesian tourist resort island of Bali on Sunday and in
Jakarta Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
As his visit aims to increase economic and trade ties,
Erbakan's entourage includes 77 entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Geographical distance has limited Indonesia and Turkey's trade
volume at 60 million US dollars from January to June this year.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish prime minister will have private talks with
President Soeharto today. He is scheduled to leave Indonesia
tonight.

BANGKOK, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Some Thai businessmen and

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Curb Sea Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- China is currently working on a
strategy to curb the dumping of untreated waste water into coastal
waters, the "China Daily " reported.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Liu Xili, an official with State Oceanic
Administration (SOA), as saying that a joint survey by three
government departments involving extensive ocean water and seabed
sampling is nearing completion.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 samples of seabed soil and sea organisms were
collected from the East China Sea, the South China Sea and Bohai
Sea.
</P>
<P>
And the survey results have been presented to the National
People's Congress, China's parliament, to inform the revision of
marine environmental protection legislation.
</P>
<P>
Expert estimate that 80 percent of pollutants in China's
coastal waters come from waste-water discharge. Around 40 percent
of the population lives in the economically thriving coastal
areas, where pollution has ballooned in the last ten years, Liu
explained.
</P>
<P>
Offshore ecosystems have been seriously damaged by these
discharges, particularly coral reefs and mangroves, both of which
play important parts in the sea's self-purification.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 80 percent of mangroves have been damaged
or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Red tides resulting from overly nutrient-rich sea water and
rapid reproduction of algae have also occurred more frequently in
the past decade than in the previous one.
</P>
<P>
The survey estimated that nine billion tons of untreated waste
water annually flows into the sea from these outlets, carrying
1.46 million tons of pollutants such as organic compounds and
petroleum.
</P>
<P>
Alarmed by these developments, last year the SOA monitored 217
major sources of waste water dumping.
</P>
<P>
To gather more comprehensive information about the extent of
pollution, on which to base a strategy to limit total emission
volume, the SOA will launch another national investigation next
year.

<HEADLINE> China to Launch Asthma Prevention Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide asthma management
and prevention strategy to alleviate suffering by over 15 million
Chinese asthma patients is about to kick off, according to "China
Daily".
</P>
<P>
The drive is part of the global campaign "Global Initiative on
Asthma (GINA)" jointly spearheaded by the World Health
Organization (WHO) and the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute in the United States, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
GINA will recommend drug therapy which pinpoints the best
medicine for different conditions, and aim to educate patients and
their families about causes and preventions of asthma and improve
the health of asthma patients.
</P>
<P>
China's Ministry of Public Health will map out action programs
for asthma control in the country and launch a publicity and
education campaign on self-health care for patients, vice-minister
Yin Dakui announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chronic respiratory ailments are the number one killer of rural
Chinese, and the third biggest killer of urban Chinese, after
cardiovascular disease and malignant tumors.
</P>
<P>
There are 150 million asthmatics worldwide and the prevalence
is increasing in most countries at a rate of 20 to 50 percent
every 10 years, Dr Suzanne S. Hurd told a symposium on global
strategies for asthma management and prevention held Monday in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
At least one million unnecessary deaths each decade are caused
by asthma, said Hurd.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 experts and doctors from nearby provinces and
cities around Beijing attended yesterday's discussion on
implementation of GINA strategy in their localities.
</P>
<P>
Similar symposiums will be held later this week in Guangzhou,

for the loss is administrative problems.
</P>
<P>
The drop in the revenue from 1.68 billion dollars to 1.44
billion was another major problem for the airlines.
</P>
<P>
He said that the company's goal for the year is to gain 3.2
billion dollars with possible profits.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Expels Cuban Diplomat in Retaliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States expelled a
Cuban diplomat late on Monday in retaliation for Cuba's expulsion
of a U.S. diplomat.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department said in a written statement that Cuba
revoked the visa last week of Robin Meyer, accusing her of
carrying out activities "incompatible with her diplomatic status".
</P>
<P>
Meyer was given time until Wednesday to leave Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the Cuban assertion was protested in
the strongest terms.
</P>
<P>
The State Department said that it was taking reciprocal action
against Jose Luis Ponce Caraballo, a diplomat accredited to the
Cuban Interests Section of the Swiss Embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban diplomat will be required to leave the United States
within a week, the department said without accusing him of any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the Havana-based American diplomat had
carried out her diplomatic functions in full accordance with the
Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations worsened early this year when
U.S. President Bill Clinton signed into law the Helms-Burton bill
that strengthened the 35-year U.S. embargo against Cuba by
penalizing foreigners who invest in the Caribbean island nation.

Chen noted that economic and technical cooperation between
China and Ecuador has been expanding over the last few years.

yuan (21 million U.S. dollars) in loans and 11.85 million yuan
(1.4 million dollars) in donations to Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
Chen expressed appreciation of Ecuador's support for a "one
China" policy.

She said she hoped the new government and the National Congress
of Ecuador will continue to cooperate with China in international
affairs.

<P>
Alarcon also expressed satisfaction over the development of
economic and commercial ties between China and his country, and
the frequent legislative exchanges between the two countries over

<HEADLINE> Meningitis Increases in Uruguay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, August 19 (Xinhua) -- At least 207 cases of
suppurative meningitis have been reported across the country and
30 have died from the brain disease so far this year.
</P>
<P>
However, Gloria Ruocco, epidemiological chief of the Public
Health Ministry, said there was no talk of it being an epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Meningitis is a serious inflammation in the brain. Death rate
is high and patients usually lose some mental abilities even if
they are cured.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, cases of meningitis have increased annually in the
Uruguay, but Ruocco said a decrease could be expected after a few
years.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs Seek Suspension of Destruction of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb army today
called on the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) to suspend the
operation of destroying Serb ammunition, the Tanjug news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The general staff of the Serb army sent a letter today to the
IFOR commands, seeking the suspension of operation of destroying
300 tons of arms and ammunition found by the IFOR from a dump in
the village of Margetici in eastern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR found these unauthorized arms and ammunition Friday in
Margetici and began an operation early today to destroy the
illegal weaponry.
</P>
<P>
The halt of the arms destruction "is needed for the IFOR's
security, its further implementation of the Dayton peace agreement
and its future relations with the Serb authority," a statement
released by the press office of the general staff quoted the
letter as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Serb army general staff issued a similar statement last
Friday, warning that the IFOR's action was a very dangerous
provocation and it would cause unnecessary incidents and
jeopardize the further implementation of the Dayton accords.
</P>
<P>
Today's letter said the site had been declared to the IFOR on
March 19 and the IFOR had never asked for its dislocation.
</P>
<P>
"We ask you to inform the U.N. Security Council, the sides
which signed the Dayton agreement and the countries witnesses,
about your decision and reasons for using force, and to get them
engaged, in keeping with your peace mission, to resolve all the
emergent problems without using force," the Serb letter added.

<HEADLINE> US Spends More on Research, Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. spending on various items
of research and development (R&AMP;D) has increased these years, but
is still not enough compared with other Western countries.
</P>
<P>
The country's R&AMP;D spending totaled 171 billion U.S. dollars in
1995. Adjusted for inflation, this is 2 percent lower than the
1990 level, the Wall Street Journal reported today. But U.S.
universities spent more on R&AMP;D in 1995 than in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The report suggested that America should do more. For years
now, both Japan and Germany have spent a greater slice of their
gross domestic product on R&AMP;D than has the U.S. While Japan spends
2.8 percent and Germany 2.5 percent of GDP, the U.S. spending on
non-defense R&AMP;D is 2 percent of its output of goods and services,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Economists held that the amount of money spent on research
projects plays a great role in the country's economic health and
wealth.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is still, by far, the biggest player in science and
technology. It carries out 44 percent of all the research in the
world, and more than Japan, Germany, France and Britain combined.
In absolute dollars, the U.S. spending is huge.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, Japan's R&AMP;D is still directed heavily -- about
95 percent -- toward manufacturing. The U.S. has poured
ever-increasing amounts of funds into services, especially
computers, software and communications technology, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
Within manufacturing, the U.S. has sharply increased
pharmaceuticals and bioscience research, said the paper, adding
that it is difficult to predict whether funds are spent
effectively.

<HEADLINE> UN Appeals for Assistance to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Department of
Humanitarian Affairs today urged all nations to support a U.N.
consolidated inter-agency appeal for flood-related emergency
humanitarian assistance to the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK), which was launched in June.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. press release said this would allow United Nations
agencies to take adequate measures to address the most urgent and
outstanding problems resulting from the devastation wreaked by
last year's and recent floods.
</P>
<P>
So far, the response to the June appeal has only been slightly
more than 40 percent, concentrated mainly in the food sector, the
press release said.
</P>
<P>
Exactly one year after unprecedented torrential rains
devastated much of the agricultural sector and infrastructure of
the DPRK, heavy rainfall in July-August is once again causing
widespread flooding in that country.
</P>
<P>
Heavy damage has been sustained in 117 cities and counties in
eight provinces in the southwestern and northern parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, at least 116 people have been
killed, and approximately 3 million people affected. The country's
agricultural sector, which suffered crippling damage from last
year's flooding, has been dealt another severe blow, since
flooding was heaviest in the southwestern area, which is
considered to be its main granary. The government estimates the
latest damages to be about 1.7 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Picasso, Van Gogh, Monet Become Japanese Bankers' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- Numerous French and European arts
masterpieces, purchased by Japanese speculators in Japan's
"financial bubble" era of the 1980s, are now hostages of Japanese
banks who seized the paintings after many speculators went
bankrupt, reported the French daily Le Monde today.
</P>
<P>
Le Monde quoted Japanese arts critic Shinichi Segi as saying in
Tokyo that the public no longer have access to many of the
paintings and don't know where and in what conditions they are.
</P>
<P>
Segi estimated that these paintings, which circulated in the
Japanese market from 1987 to 1990, are worth 3,000 billion yen (30
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Two thirds of the paintings obtained by Japanese are French,
mainly impressionist works signed by Pablo Picasso, Vincent Van
Gogh, Claude Monet, Pierre Renoir, Marc Chagall and some others.
</P>
<P>
Among the "hostages" is "The Wedding Party of Pierrette" by
Picasso. The painting was sold by Swedish speculator Frederik Roos
in November 1987 for 75 million U.S. dollars to Japanese speculator
Tomonori Tsurumaki, who went bankrupt two years later.
</P>
<P>
Some Japanese bankers themselves have become speculators of the
paintings. For instance, Yasumichi Morishita, president of the
Aichi Finance credit bank, has invested 1 billion U.S. dollars in
impressionist paintings.
</P>
<P>
Many speculators made colossal fortunes by trading Western
paintings in the "financial bubble" era with speculations in
"Japanese price," a term used by Westerners to mean unnaturally
high prices.
</P>
<P>
But the transaction volume in the Japanese arts market in 1995
was only 5 percent of that in 1990, the peak year of speculations,
which is about 24 billion yen (240 million dollars), while values
of the paintings dropped by 20-30 percent as compared with several
years ago, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"The Portrait of Doctor Gachet" of Van Gogh, sold for 12
billion yen (120 million dollars) in 1990, now is priced 8 billion
yen (80 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The report said that many Japanese bankers want to throw the
paintings back to the market, but are afraid of losing
considerably by doing so.

urged all sides in Burundi to refrain from violence and to commit
themselves to a negotiated and peaceful solution of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a declaration made here today, the EU reiterated its deep
concern about the situation in Burundi and hoped that the
different sides in the country could search actively for a
political solution.

The European organization urged all sides in Burundi to call an
immediate halt to the violence and to respect the safety of all
Burundians.

<P>

without delay, bringing together all of Burundi's political forces
without exception, including representatives of civil society, in
order to negotiate a democratic, institutional consensus ensuring
security for all.
</P>

Burundi can be restored on a lasting basis only through the
participation of all sections of society in the principal
institutions and bodies of the state.
</P>
<P>
It also reaffirmed its willingness to support Burundi's
recovery efforts, once the necessary national reconciliation is
embarked upon.

<HEADLINE> UN Reports Insufficient Progress in Guatemala </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 19 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. mission in
Guatemala reported here today that the progress the country has
achieved in the human rights field was insufficient to bring about
a definitive improvement in the still-serious human rights
situation there.
</P>
<P>
The fifth report of the director of the United Nations Mission
for Verification of Human Rights in Guatemala noted that while the
human rights situation continues to be of serious concern,
involving impunity and serious public insecurity, the overall
context in Guatemala is increasingly positive.
</P>
<P>
The report recognized the efforts of Guatemala to combat crime,
and highlighted the suspension of offensive actions by the Unidad
Revolucionaria National Guatemalteca and counter-insurgency
actions by the army.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. mission also underlined that goodwill and
action by the government were not sufficient to bring about
desired results. Action is also required by national institutions
and by society as a whole, supported by the international
community.
