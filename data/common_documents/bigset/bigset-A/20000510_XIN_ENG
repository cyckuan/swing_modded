<HEADLINE> Imposition of Bank Account Arouses Debate in  Singapore Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A decision by the Development Bank
of Singapore, which merged with POSBank in 1998, to levy a two-
dollar monthly fee on POSBank accounts with less than 500
Singapore dollars and charges for POSBank cheaque services has
spurned heated debate in the country's parliament Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
One inquiry after another was put forth for Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong to answer.
</P>
<P>
Some charged that low-income earners will be penalized by the
decision and asked the deputy prime minister to explain the
rationale behind the move. Others asked the government to consider
the impact of DBS' decision and spell out the government's policy.
Still others asked the DBS to look into exempting all consumers to
pay the administrative charge and suggested the account fee be
waived for low-income earners.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who doubles Chairman of the Monetary Authority of
Singapore, the central bank, appeared to be hard in defending DBS'
decision which will go into effect on June 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
On the DBS' merge with POSBank which had provided free banking
services to all its depositors, Lee revealed that 36 percent of
POSBank saving accounts had balances less than 100 Singapore
dollars while 52 percent had balance less than 500 Singapore
dollars.
</P>
<P>
He added that in 1998 POSBank had 5.2 million savings accounts,
far more than the number of people in Singapore, and 3.8 million
out of the total were uneconomic i,e. revenue from these small
accounts was less than the costs of servicing them..
</P>
<P>
As result POSBank is losing money and its share of saving
deposits declined from 64 percent in 1979 to 47 percent at the end
of 1997 and this led to the government decision to merge the DBS
with the POSBank, he said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister said DBS is a commercial institution
and must have a free hand to make commercial decisions and it
would defeat the purpose of merging POSBank with DBS for the
government to direct DBS as to what it should or should not do.
</P>
<P>
It would prevent DBS from making decisions on commercial
grounds like other market players and make it difficult for DBS to
develop into a strong and competitive bank, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lee acknowledged that the imposition of bank charges is
consistent with the government's promotion of a cashless society
and emphasized that electronic payments still involve costs which
banks have to recover from system users and it is not possible for
banks dimply to absorb these costs and provide services for free.
</P>
<P>
On how to help lower-income Singaporeans to cope with bank
charges, he agreed to allow lower-income workers to transfer 500
Singapore dollars from their central provident fund accounts to
DBS as a fixed deposit.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Expects Wheat Output of 20.8 Million Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan expects a wheat output of
20.8 million tons this year, an increase of 3 million tons as
compared to that of last year, the Associated Press of Pakistan (
APP) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
APP quoted an official from the Ministry of Food and
Agriculture as saying that Punjab, the major wheat producing
province of the country, has estimated an increase of about 2
million tons in the wheat production against the target set for
the current year.
</P>
<P>
The production of wheat in Punjab has been reported 16 million
tons while the target is 14.2 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the production of wheat was 17.8 million tons and
the country had to import 1 million tons to meet the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
The government had fixed a target of 20 million tons for wheat
crop for 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
The local human consumption is not more than 17 million tons
while 2 million tons will be required for animals, Afghan refugees,
strategic reserves, seeds, and Kashimiris.
</P>
<P>
The official gave three main reasons for good crop which
include 60-rupee (a little more than 1 dollar) increase in the
support price, timely sowing, availability of inputs like
fertilizers and seeds.

<P>
After consultation with the other leaders of the four-party
opposition alliance, Begum Zia sent her reply to the Prime
Minister's letter received Monday night.

<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Monday night wrote a letter to the
opposition leader, inviting her to a discussion on the appointment
of a new CEC as CEC Abu Hena suddenly resigned Monday, creating a
political vacuum in the country.
</P>
<P>
Abu Hena said that he took the decision absolutely on health
grounds, despite the fact that the opposition parties have
launched a movement for the past two years, pressing for his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
BNP Secretary General Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan said Monday that the
resignation of Abu Hena was a "victory of the people and the

<HEADLINE> Mbeki Maintains Stance on Zimbabwean Land Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 9 (Xinhua) -- South African President Thabo
Mbeki will maintain his current stance on the Zimbabwean land
crisis during his upcoming tour to the United Kingdom and the
United States, a senior South African government official said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The president will reiterate that his role should be to promote
a negotiated solution for the problems in Zimbabwe, said
Director-General of South African Foreign Affairs Department Sipho
Pityana in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki will leave for Britain next week to attend the UK-South
Africa bilateral forum with British Prime Minister Tony Blair on
May 18 and 19.
</P>
<P>
He will then travel to the United States for a state visit from
May 21 to 26.
</P>
<P>
Pityana reiterated that South Africa will continue to seek a
resolution to the Zimbabwean conflict through discussions with all
the main players involved.
</P>
<P>
"Our approach is that we are better placed to assist to solve
the problems ensuing there than to stand on a high pedestal to
lecture to our colleagues across the border," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pityana agreed it is likely that Blair and U.S. President Bill
Clinton will query Mbeki on Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's
failure to honor an undertaking to regional leaders to stop land
invasions.
</P>
<P>
During his tour, Mbeki will brief Blair and Clinton on events
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola.
</P>
<P>
Other issues on the agenda include economic cooperation,
foreign debt relief for poor African states, new trade rules for
developing countries and the transfer of resources from rich to
poor nations, Pityana said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Security Council Delegation Visits Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi has held discussions here with the United Nations Security
Council delegation headed by Richard Holbrook over the settlement
of the Ethio-Eritrean border conflict.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesperson of the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry,
Meles and Holbrook, who is also U.S. Ambassador to the United
Nations, exchanged views on Monday on the peaceful resolution of
the regional conflict.
</P>
<P>
In a joint press briefing after the talks, Meles and Holbrook
described the talks as "constructive".
</P>
<P>
The talks have enabled the U.N. delegation to have a better
understanding of the whole peace process in general and the recent
Algiers proximity talks in particular, Holbrook said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that "it would be premature to say anything
definitive until we have talks in Asmara."
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which is also comprised of the ambassadors of
Britain, France, the Netherlands, Mali, Tunisia and Namibia to the
United Nations, left for Asmara, capital of Eritrea, on Tuesday to
hold similar discussions with the government of that country.
</P>
<P>
They were authorized to travel Ethiopia and Eritrea to warn
against any resumption of fighting after the failure of Algiers
indirect peace talks between the two Horn of Africa countries,
informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
Prior to its journey to the Horn of Africa, the U.N. delegation
 reportedly visited the countries involved in the conflicts in the
 Democratic Republic of the Congo, namely Zambia, Zimbabwe,
Rwanda, Uganda and the DRC.

<P>
LAGOS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- West African leaders Tuesday warn the
trouble- making Sierra Leone rebels to behave against possible
military intervention and legal prosecution by the international
community.
</P>
<P>
They said in a statement published at the end of a special
summit of the Economic Community of the West African States
(ECOWAS) that the rebels' recent attacks on U.N. troops is "a
deliberate violation of the Lome Peace Agreement under the
auspices of the ECOWAS".
</P>
<P>
They pledged to use all means, including the military options,
to foil any attempt to take over power through the use of force.
</P>
<P>
They cautioned the former rebel Revolutionary United Front that
they may lose the amnesty earlier granted to them by the Lome
agreement.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, a meeting of the Ministers of
Defense and Chiefs of Staff of the ECOWAS member states will be
convened in Abuja soon to map out the way of ECOWAS' military
involvement in the current crisis.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Clerics Express Support for Khatami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 clerics in Iran's holy
city of Qom on Wednesday expressed their strong support for
President Mohammad Khatami and the reform programs he has been
advocating since he took office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued on Wednesday, the clerics defended
reforms in the society, calling Khatami's landslide victory in the
presidential election on May 23, 1997 as an "epic and blessed
event" in the country, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The victory of President Khatami was the best opportunity given
to those who claim they love Islam and the Islamic revolution, the
communique read.
</P>
<P>
It added that the May 23 epic was a complement of the 1979
triumph of the Islamic revolution and served as fresh blood flowing
in the vessels of the Islamic revolution to help refresh it.
</P>
<P>
The clerics also castigated those who oppose the epic, saying
that they are afraid of losing what they have achieved through
illegitimate ways, the IRNA report said.
</P>
<P>
President Khatami has been pushing for social and cultural
reforms since he defeated his conservative opponent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
His policies of relaxing religious restrictions on individual
behavior and encouraging participation of the common people in
politics have won strong support from the people, but also annoyed
the conservative hardliners who feel the Islamic system is
threatened.
</P>
<P>
Because of Khatami's liberal policies, the country's reformist
campaign has become stronger and stronger, which resulted in the
overwhelming victory of reformers in February's sixth parliamentary
election, ending the long-time conservative majority in the
legislative body.
</P>
<P>
But the hardliners, who are still in control of most of the
powerful state organs, have taken tough measures to undermine the
reform campaign, including jailing reformist journalists, closing
most of the reformist papers as well as annulling election results
in certain constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The conservative crackdown has pushed the country into a "
sensitive period." There are even speculations that the
conservative Islamic Revolution Guards Corps might stage a coup to
overthrow Khatami's government.
</P>
<P>
Most of the clerics are believed to support the conservative
camp, guardians of the Islamic system based on cleric rule. So it
is considered an unusual event that so many clerics in the
religious center of Qom have expressed their support for Khatami's
reform programs.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Reaffirms Engagement with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 10 (Xinhua) The Clinton administration has
expressed its hope to see "a strong, stable, prosperous and open
China" and reaffirmed its engagement policy in a move to boost the
hottest campaign ever seen over the last decades for normalizing
trade status with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"Our objective is a strong, stable, prosperous and open China,"
which sits "at the heart of U.S. policy," said Stanley O. Roth,
Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs,
in a speech at a conference on U.S.-China relations in Washington
D.C. sponsored by the Woodrow Wilson Center on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"A strong China is a unified nation, confident of its ability
to defend its borders and its interests. It works with its
neighbors and partners to foster stability in the Asian Pacific
region and beyond," he said.
</P>
<P>
Roth said that a strong China also works in concert with others
to counter transnational problems such as narcotics trafficking
and environmental degradation, and it not only makes itself secure
and prosperous but also "increases the security and prosperity of
its neighbors."
</P>
<P>
He said that China, as an enormous country with the world's
largest population, a vast stretch of land and many neighbors, "
can be a tremendous source of stability or chaos which could
determine the future of the Pacific and thereby the peace and
prosperity of our own country."
</P>
<P>
"A strong China has a dynamic economy, which offers its
citizens an improving standard of living, attracts imports and
investments, and exports competitively," he said.
</P>
<P>
Roth noted that over the past year, the number of Internet
connections in China has more than quadrupled from 2 million to 9
million, and that number is expected to reach over 20 million this
year. "All of this bespeaks tremendous export and investment
opportunities for American technology companies," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United States stands for an open China which "
welcomes diversity and change, encouraging the best ideas from
both its own people and the international community," and which is
ready to draw new technology and to celebrate and learn from the
diverse strands of its rich history and culture.
</P>
<P>
Roth reiterated the importance of the engagement policy, which
he defines as "working with China at every level and at every
available opportunity to manage, if not resolve, specific
differences and identify and expand issues on which we take a
common approach."
</P>
<P>
The highest level of engagement is the series of periodic
summits between the President and the Chinese leadership, which "
can break deadlocks and achieve progress at critical junctures,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Roth also listed the cabinet-level and "working-level" meetings
between the two countries on a variety of topics, such as
nonproliferation, environment, reducing tensions on the Korean
Peninsula, the WTO talks, as evidence of successful engagement
which he described as "results oriented."
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, a meeting will conclude with a dramatic event that
provides results. More often, the results are not immediately
apparent, but dialogue can and does effect change," he said.
</P>
<P>
Roth said America's strategy is "to integrate China into
regional and global institutions, helping it become a country that
plays by the accepted international rules, cooperating and
competing peacefully within those rules."
</P>
<P>
He called on the Congress to support China's entry into the WTO
and grant the country Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) in
the coming vote scheduled for the week of May 22.
</P>
<P>
The trade deal on China's WTO accession reached by the two
governments last November will "significantly" advance
opportunities for American companies to export goods and services
to China, he said.
</P>
<P>
"China's WTO accession overwhelmingly benefits the United
States," but "we will not enjoy these benefits unless the Congress
grants permanent NTR to China upon its accession to the WTO," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"If it does not, these advantages, so skillfully negotiated by
Ambassador Barshefsky and her team, will go only to our
competitors in other nations. They will be able to sell their
services to China, while we will not. They will be able to use WTO
mechanisms to resolve disputes with China, while we will not.
Clearly, that makes no sense," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Bill Clinton staged a large gathering of
former presidents, including Jimmy Carter and Gerald R. Ford, and
secretaries of state under presidents Richard M. Nixon and George
Bush, in the White House on Tuesday to promote backup for
normalizing trade status with Beijing, capping this administration
's over-two-month-long campaign for China PNTR.

<HEADLINE> EC Urges More Renewable Sources in Electricity Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union on Wednesday
urged its member states to increase renewable energy sources in
electricity production.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
bloc, proposed to EU member states that they increase from 6
percent at the time being to 12 percent in 2010 the renewable
energy sources in electricity production.
</P>
<P>
Loyola de Palacio, vice-president of the commission, said that
the increased use of green electricity can contribute
substantially to the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
"Renewable energy sources will also add to the security of
energy supply and to economic and social cohesion," the
commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
The commission wanted to create a framework for the medium-term
significant increase of green electricity inside the union and to
facilitate its access to the internal electricity market.
</P>
<P>
It urged the EU member states to take necessary measures to
ensure the achievement of the set goals at community level of 12
percent by 2010, or doubling the current level.
</P>
<P>
The member states were urged to establish individual targets
for future consumption of electricity from renewable energy
sources and to set quantitative targets with a view of maximizing
renewable sources in electricity production.
</P>
<P>
The effort to significantly increase renewable energy sources
in electricity production aims at contributing to achieve the EU's
Kyoto commitments, added Palacio.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Looks for Impartiality in Lumumba Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Belgium is still looking for
experts with impartiality in its announced investigation into the
assassination of Patrice Lumumba.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian parliamentary commission in charge of the
investigation tried to find some competent personnel who are
impartial, unlike those experts who already have one theory or
another.
</P>
<P>
The country started on May 2 a formal probe into the
assassination on January 17, 1961, of the Congolese prime minister.
</P>
<P>
It intends to find out the exact circumstances under which the
independent leader and the first premier of independent Congo was
assassinated and the exact role the then Belgian authorities had
played in the assassination.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary investigation was prompted by Flemish
sociologist Ludo de Witte who has written a book entitled The
Assassination of Lumumba to try to shed some light on the
assassination. De Witte believes that Belgium is largely
responsible for the assassination.
</P>
<P>
The Congo, a Belgian colony since 1885, declared independence
on June 30, 1960. Seven months later, Lumumba was assassinated
allegedly at the order of the leaders of the secessionist province
of Katanga of the African country.
</P>
<P>
De Witte believes that Belgium has a hand in the events related
to the assassination, from the transfer of Lumumba to the province
of Katanga, the execution of the independent leader and the
disappearance of his body.

Israeli forces, restoring international peace and security and
assisting the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its
effective authority in the area."
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.N. Reports Iraq's Latest Oil Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- During the period of April
29 to May 5,2000, Iraq exported 15.3 million barrels of oil for
revenue estimated around 341 million U.S. dollars, bringing the
total volume exported in phase VII to 260 million barrels for
revenue of around 6.172 billion dollars, U.N. reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Office of the Iraq Program (OIP) said the
total number of contracts approved for the sale of oil under phase
VII, which began on December 12, remains at 101, and the approved
volume is 351.32 million barrels, OIP said.
</P>
<P>
Since the accelerated procedures for the approval of contracts
for humanitarian supplies for Iraq came into force on March 1,2000,
U.N. has notified the sanctions committee of the Security Council
of 381 applications, worth 859.010 million dollars, OIP said.
</P>
<P>
On the humanitarian side, the sanctions committee has approved
5.957 billion dollars worth of contracts in phases IV to VII and
put 1.480 billion on hold for the same period, OIP said.
</P>
<P>
OIP said in phases IV through VII, it has received a total of 2,
387 contracts worth 1.309 billion dollars for the supply of oil
industry spare parts and equipment, and of these contracts, the
sanctions committee has approved 1455, worth 748.449 million and
put 580, worth 343.786 million dollars, on hold.
</P>
<P>
This brings the total value of contracts on hold in the
humanitarian and oil sectors to 1.824 billion dollars, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990. The United Nations decided to implement the "oil-
for-oil" in 1995 to ease the suffering of the Iraqi people caused
by the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Under the "oil-for-food" program, which began to implement in
late 1996, Iraq is allowed to sell a certain amount of oil to
import the necessities for its people.

<HEADLINE> EC Rules on Vitamin, Mineral Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on
Wednesday ruled as dietary supplements the sale of vitamins and
minerals to guarantee the health of consumers.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, intended to set out a general framework and safety rules
for the sales of vitamins and minerals in the union.
</P>
<P>
"We must be clear that a varied diet remains the best solution
for a healthy development and life," said David Byrne, EU
commissioner for health and consumer protection.
</P>
<P>
"These food supplements mainly serve to compensate for
inadequate intake of essential nutrients by certain people or
specific population groups," added the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
The commission urged that labels on vitamins and minerals have
to give consumers adequate and clear information about how to use
and how not to use them.
</P>
<P>
Claims that vitamin and mineral products can prevent, treat or
cure illnesses are prohibited. Any language suggesting that a
varied diet does not provide the necessary amounts of essential
nutrients is equally prohibited.
</P>
<P>
The commission also rules that vitamin and mineral pills sold
in packaging that resembles that of pharmaceutical products must
carry the statement "This is not a medicinal product".
</P>
<P>
A warning should also be included on the labeling about
possible health risk in case of excessive use. So will be
included the statement that the vitamin and mineral pills should
not be used as a substitute for a varied diet.

NAIROBI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan army chief of staff met
his Ugandan counterpart on Wednesday in Kigali, capital of Rwanda,
to discuss recent clashes in Kisangani of the Democratic Republic
of the Congo, according to Rwandan News Agency report.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan Army Chief of Staff Jeje Odongo said that the two
countries have "the capacity to resolve their differences in the
DRC," adding that "what is going on in Kisangani should not go
beyond to spill to other areas."
</P>
<P>
As to which side provoked another,the Ugandan chief of staff
said that, "

what is important is not which side started the fighting, but
putting in place modalities to avoid further clashes in the area."
</P>
<P>
Rwandan army chief of staff Kayumba Nyamwasa said, "war
between Rwanda and Uganda is so unfortunate and should be
avoided".
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan chief of staff said that the two countries will
adopt "all possible efforts" to avoid what happened in Kisangani
recently.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that presidents of the two countries will soon meet

lost 73 soldiers in the Kisangani clashes last Friday, saying
there were only five casualties were sustained.
</P>

<HEADLINE> S. African Economy Not Affected by Zimbabwean Crisis: Mbeki </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's land crisis has not
had a significant impact on the South African economy, nor would
it affect regional stability in the medium and long term,
President Thabo Mbeki said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We don't think that the recent events in Zimbabwe will have an
adverse effect in the medium and long term on the stability and
development of the region," he said at the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's economic fundamentals are sound and the
government remains confident that growth would average 3.6 percent
over the next three years, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Mbeki, the country's manufacturing production was
up by 4.4 percent in the first four months of this year and the
exports recorded an increase of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The trade account was up by 1.3 billion to 21.3 billion rand (3
billion U.S. dollars), he said, noting that the inflation would
continue its downward trend despite the temporary distortion
caused by the recent oil price increases.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's exports to other African countries have also
grown significantly over the past six years, Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
Outside the South African Customs Union, Zimbabwe accounted for
3 percent of South African exports and is the country's biggest
trading partner in Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, South Africa's export markets into Africa have
diversified beyond Zimbabwe and the Southern African Development
Community, thereby " significantly reducing any risk the situation
in Zimbabwe might pose for our economy," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
"I think from these figures that the recent events in Zimbabwe
have had no significant impact on our real economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
On what he called fluctuations in the currency markets, Mbeki
said the weakening of the rand could be attributed to the
strength of the U.S. dollar against all other currencies.
</P>
<P>
"What we are experiencing is dollar strength rather than rand
weakness," he said.
</P>
<P>
The rand plunged to a new low of 7.14 against the U.S. dollar
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"However, as we have already stated, our economic fundamentals
remain strong and I'm certain the sentiment which is driving the
movement on the rand will change," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is understandable and natural that minorities in South
Africa are fearing what has happened in Zimbabwe could happen to
them, but this is a misplaced fear and should not be the basis for
calls for tougher action against the Zimbabwean government, Mbeki
said.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed his belief that the problems in
Zimbabwe would be resolved in the interest of all Zimbabweans and
all the people of the region.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Pledges to Carry Out Land Redistribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- South African President Thabo
Mbeki pledged on Wednesday that his government would increase the
redistribution of state-owned land to black farmers to more than
the earmarked 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The 15 percent should not be treated as a biblical decree...
it is something that is not permanently fixed," the president said
at the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The government announced earlier this week that it would
resettle 70,000 black commercial farmers on nearly 2 million
hectares of state-owned land over the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
According to Mbeki, AgriSA, a commercial agricultural group in
South Africa, has requested that the question of land distribution
be on the agenda for talks with the government in July.
</P>
<P>
This showed their willingness to address the important issue of
land redistribution, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki assured that any land redistribution would be conducted
in a manner guided by the Constitution.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Gov't Force Regains a Rebel Captured Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Pro-government troops in Sierra Leone
have recaptured a strategically important town near the country's
capital from the hands of the rebels, according to a report
reaching here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Sierra Leone's Army chief Johnny Koroma as
saying that his troops had recaptured Masiaka, a town 65
kilometers east of the capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
He said 20 rebels of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) had
been killed in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The development came as thousands of Sierra Leonean refugees
were fleeing from the rural areas to Freetown to escape a reported
rebel advance towards the city.
</P>
<P>
Fears of an attack on Freetown have been increased by the
disappearance of RUF leader Foday Sankoh from his Freetown house.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh's house in Freetown was attacked and overrun by
pro-government forces on Monday. Some people fear the rebel
leader may be back in the bush again, preparing to launch an
offensive which would lead to a complete resumption of civil war
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.N. officials said their inability to contact
Sankoh has made it very difficult to secure the release of about
500 U.N. troops whose abduction, apparently by the RUF, marked
the start of the current crisis.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Demands Command in S. Leone's Peacekeeping Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has demanded the command of
the peacekeeping operations in Sierra Leone for military
redeployment to restore peace and stability to the war-torn west
African country, said a source reaching here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Vice President Atiku Abubakar was quoted as saying
that his country could send military reinforcement to Sierra Leone
as soon as the United Nations reached a deal on the funds.
</P>
<P>
"There must be a shared responsibility. If you want us to
commit troops, then the United Nations also must be prepared to
make funds available to keep the troops there," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the command ought to have gone to Nigeria,
"because Nigeria, having been in Sierra Leone for quite some time
and quite familiar with the terrain, would have made a better job
of it."
</P>
<P>
Nigeria would expect its troops to operate under their own
command, which would give them the freedom to defend themselves,
to shoot back if attacked and to actively disarm the rebels, the
vice president said.
</P>
<P>
He made it quite clear that he did not think the rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) leader Foday Sankoh is interested
in peace, saying his intention was to keep a hold on the diamond
areas of Sierra Leone and make money.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials said earlier that Nigeria had offered to send
two battalions totalling close to 1,600 troops to support the U.N.
peacekeepers who have come under attack by RUF rebels.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, a major military power in the sub-region, has been
playing a leading role in maintaining peace and stability in the
region, especially in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The Nigeria-dominated-and-commanded West African intervention
force, ECOMOG, fought RUF rebels and helped to restore the elected
government to power in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Until last year, Nigeria had deployed more than 10,000 soldiers
in Sierra Leone.

ensure more than 200 Zambian peacekeepers held hostage by
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels in Sierra Leone last week
are released as early as possible, Defense Minister Chitalu Sampa
has said.
</P>
<P>
Briefing a press conference at his office in Lusaka on
Wednesday, the minister said Zambia hopes to get the troops
released through some meetings with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
He said a total of 256 Zambian soldiers have been held in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"As the government we will work with the leaders from the U.N.
Security Council and Sierra Leone to see our Zambian troops are
released by the rebels," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister informed the deterioration of the
security situation in Western and Northern Western Province of
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
"There have been reports recently of military incursions into
our country in the two provinces, which have been accompanied by
banditry, looting, abductions, thefts of food, livestock, loss of
life and property," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the insecurity created by these military
hostilities, he said, Zambian citizens are now being forced to
move into the hinterland abandoning their traditional settlements,
fields, grazing land and fishing areas and thereby being deprived
of their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
Sampa urged the Angolan government to take necessary measures
to curtail these hostilities.

<HEADLINE> Practical Meausres Sought to Break Embargo on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The just-concluded meeting of the
Follow-up and Coordination Committee has not only denounced the
embargo on Iraq, but also begun to seek practical measures to break
it, a senior Iraqi official said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency (INA),
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz said that the participants
of the meeting not only expressed their defiance over the decade-
long U.N. embargo, but also agreed to organize some activities that
will ultimately break the embargo.
</P>
<P>
There have been growing international criticism and condemnation
of the embargo, Aziz stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Follow-up and Coordination Committee, emanated from the
Baghdad Conference on May 1-3, 1999, held its third meeting on
Tuesday and Wednesday. A total of 57 representatives from 22 Arab,
European, Asian and Latin American countries attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Aziz highly appreciated the "courageous initiative" of Jean-
Marie Benjamin, the French priest who broke the embargo on Iraq
last month by taking a direct flight from Amman, capital of Jordan,
to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin declared on Tuesday that he will organize another
flight from Paris to Baghdad by taking a Boeing passenger plane
with much more people on board.
</P>
<P>
He was echoed by British Member of Parliament George Galloway,
one of the participants, who has decided to organize a direct
flight from London to Baghdad to challenge the embargo on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Aziz also hailed the conferences, seminars and activities
conducted by Arab and international parties and associations in
order to stop the embargo.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under sweeping U.N. sanctions since its 1990
invasion of Kuwait, and the end of the sanctions is still not in
sight.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has claimed that as many as 1.2 million people, mostly
children under five years old, have died as a direct result of
the "genocidal" embargo.

<HEADLINE> Denmark to Continue backing Egypt's Development Projects: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Denmark will continue to back Egypt's
development projects in various fields, visiting Danish
International Cooperation Minister Jan Troejborg said here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Hussein El-Gammal, managing director of
Egypt's Social Fund for Development (SFD), Troejborg said the
Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) will raise aid for
SFD's programs in the coming phase. But he did not elaborate on the
sum.
</P>
<P>
Troejborg said the step is in line with the wishes and goals of
the Danish government in mitigating unemployment and alleviating
poverty in Egypt in the light of SFD's efforts.
</P>
<P>
He lauded SFD's achievements during the past few years in
creating job opportunities, backing infrastructure construction and
developing the health sector and alleviating illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
SFD, established in 1991, is aimed at helping set up small- and
medium-sized enterprises, creating job opportunities and providing
a safety net for vulnerable sections of the society.
</P>
<P>
It has accepted 1 billion U.S. dollars in aid offered by foreign
governments and international institutions, including 13 million
dollars from DANIDA in 1996-2000. It has so far financed 102,000
small projects, creating 251,000 jobs, and 47,000 micro-projects,
creating 47,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
The Danish official left Cairo on Wednesday, ending a five-day
visit, during which he discussed ways of boosting cooperation in
various areas with Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Obeid, Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa and Minister of Electricity and Energy Fahmi
el-Saeedi.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the only Arab and Middle East country that gets
development aid from Denmark. Since 1989, the Northern European
kingdom has offered Egypt about 290 million dollars in grant to
finance its water, sanitary, energy and environmental protection
projects.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Islamists Campaign Against Novel for Political Gains: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Protests staged by Egyptian Islamists
against a novel they deemed blasphemous are clearly part of
premeditated political machinations, Egyptian Minister of Culture
Farouq Hosni said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hosni lashed out at the people who he said were "spreading lies
to score political points without considering the degree of
fanaticism and violence the accusations could provoke."
</P>
<P>
He was speaking to members of the People's Assembly (Parliament)
who questioned him about his ministry's role in approving the
publication of the novel "Feast of Sea Algae" by Syrian writer
Haidar Haidar, which Islamists say portrays Prophet Mohammed as a "
skirt chaser" and insults the holy Koran.
</P>
<P>
Hosni quoted a report by a committee of critics and academics
which said the novel depicted characters confronting the realities
of the Arab world, the Islamist movements, in particular.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Islamists launched a campaign against the book some two
weeks ago, provoking a series of demonstrations by students in
Cairo in the last three days. Their demands included the sacking of
Hosni.
</P>
<P>
Monday's protests turned violent with about 50 people injured
when demonstrators clashed with police who fired tear gas to
disperse the crowd.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-five students are now held in custody on charges of
illegal assembly, demonstrations, inciting rioting, resisting
authorities and damage of public property, which could carry a life
sentence with forced labor.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Rebel Leader Discusses Situation with Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese rebel leader John Garang
discussed Sudan's latest political crisis on Wednesday with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Garang, who arrived in Cairo Tuesday on a surprise visit, said
his trip is aimed at evaluating the confrontation between Sudanese
President Omar Hassan al-Bashir and Islamist leader Hassan al-
Turabi.
</P>
<P>
Garang, whose Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) controls
large sections of southern Sudan, said the political feud in
Khartoum could topple the Islamic government and eventually bring
about national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
"There are basic developments taking place in Sudan now and we
are trying to look at the best ways to take advantage of the
developments to turn Sudan into a new united and democratic Sudan,"
Garang told reporters after talks with Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir said on Saturday he was freezing the secretariat of
the ruling National Congress party, effectively crippling the role
of al-Turabi, its secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
"The Egyptian and Sudanese people are one people," said Garang,
whose SPLA seeks self-determination and secular rule for the black
African and mainly Christian or animist south.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has often said it is keen on helping safeguard Sudan's
unity as a possible disintegration of Sudan may endanger Egypt's
major water source, the Nile.
</P>
<P>
A regional African group known as IGAD has sponsored several
rounds of talks between the government and the SPLA. Last year,
Egypt and Libya launched their own initiative seeking to include
opposition parties in the Muslim, Arabized north in peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Havel Visits to Germany and Meets with Schroeder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic Vaclav Havel
arrived in Berlin on Tuesday and made a four-day official visit to
Germany. And it is Havel's first state visit to Germany.
</P>
<P>
German President Johannes Rau conferred the highest German
orders upon Havel for commending his contributions to promote the
bilateral relations during the past years. Havel conferred also
upon Rau the highest order of the Czech Republic, "the Order of
the White Lion".
</P>
<P>
During the talks between Havel and German chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder Havel stressed that the membership of the European Union
was the highest aim of Czech Republic and the importance of the
strengthening of the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder supported the joining in the European Union of the
Czech Republic. Until end of 2002 the Czech Republic can become
the new member of the EU. Havel thanked Germany for its supports.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic takes big importance to its relations with
Germany. Havel said : "Germany was the motor for the idea of EU.
enlargement and the Schroeder government has linked up with this."
</P>
<P>
According to the diplomats the German-Czech bilateral
relations are now the best time they have ever been and the
bilateral trade has developed good during last ten years. Germany
exported to the Czech Republic 19.6 billion marks (9 billion
dollars) last year, while Germany imported to the Czech Republic
19.9 billion marks.
</P>
<P>
The difficult point of the bilateral relations is naturally
the Sudenten issue. After the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 the
former Czechoslovak government expelled 3 million ethnic Germans
from the Sudetenland after seizing their property.
</P>
<P>
Havel said about the question : "This is about a far off part
of history which belongs to all of Europe."

<HEADLINE> More Americans to Make Summer Travels This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Although high gas prices will be
a negative factor this year, the Travel Industry Association of
America (TIA) is forecasting yet another robust summer travel
season for Americans.
</P>
<P>
According to TIA's Summer 2000 Travelometer, Americans will
take 237 million person-trips during June, July and August 2000,
up 3 percent over last summer. A person-trip is one person
traveling more than 80 kilometers, one-way, away from home.
</P>
<P>
TIA senior vice president Suzanne Cook said at a press
conference that "we are continuing to see an unprecedented
enthusiasm for summer travel primarily because the economy remains
strong, interest rates are still reasonable, inflation and
unemployment are low, and the recent volatility in the stock
market has had little, if any, impact on consumer confidence."
</P>
<P>
"Although high gas prices are a factor this summer, a majority
of Americans say that increased prices will not make much of a
difference in their summer travel plans," she said.
</P>
<P>
The TIA report showed that 86 percent of travelers plan to take
at least one trip this summer, up significantly from last summer
when 82 percent of travelers were planning a summer trip. Only 14
percent of travelers said they will not take a trip this summer,
down two percentage points from last summer.
</P>
<P>
The report said that a majority of those planning to travel
this summer will do so for pleasure, accounting for 87 percent.
Americans will be traveling longer this summer, intending to stay
away 10 nights on their longest pleasure trip, up from 8.5 nights
last summer. They also plan to spend 965 U.S. dollars on their
longest trip this summer, compared to 956 dollars last summer.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: U.N. Peace Efforts in Africa Threatened in Sierra Leone  (By Gu Zhenqiu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The hostage crisis, which
broke out last week in Sierra Leone, shocked the world and
humiliated the United Nations which is promoting ambitious peace-
keeping programs in other African countries, such as Angola and
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The crisis, characterized by the hostage-taking and even
killing of U.N. peacekeepers by the rebel Revolutionary United
Front (RUF), took place as the U.N. peacekeeping troops was taking
over the positions from the Nigerian-led West African intervention
force, known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy is also tarnishing the image and affecting the
credibility of the United Nations, which, under the U.N. Charter,
has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of peace and
security in the world at large.
</P>
<P>
At present, the success or failure of the United Nations in
Sierra Leone is being closely watched in Africa and other parts of
the world following the U.N. setbacks in peacekeeping operations
in Somalia in 1993 and Rwanda in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more than any other African country, Sierra Leone,
suffering from the lengthy civil war, turned out to be a test for
the commitment of the international community to peacekeeping
efforts in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone, called UNAMSIL, has so far
proven to be an embarrassment for the Western governments,
including the United States, which has been mounting its Africa
programs to safeguard its interests on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations force made very slow progress as it saw its
movements often blocked by the rebels in the West African country.
Peacekeepers were disarmed by rebels in several instances.
</P>
<P>
Against the repeated condemnation and appeals from U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the U.N. Security Council here in
New York, the number of U.N. staff held by rebels rose day by day.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, haunted by the memory of 18 American
soldiers killed in Somalia on a United Nations mission and mindful
of 14 Belgians slain in Rwanda as U.N. peacekeepers, feared that
the incident in Sierra Leone would have a ripple effect on current
and future U.N. missions in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Already we know what happened after the tragedy in Somalia,"
Annan has said, referring to the 1993 deaths of 18 U.S.
peacekeepers in Mogadishu. The debacle led to a U.S. withdrawal
from Somalia and all but ended U.S. support for U.N. peacekeeping
in Africa that only began to change last year with approval of the
U.N. mission in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The United States, one of the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council, has veto power on the 15-member body. The
Clinton administration has made it clear to Congress that it would
not send American soldiers to Africa again.
</P>
<P>
After the violence against U.N. peacekeepers in Sierra Leone,
Annan said, "I think there's going to be very little encouragement
for (Western countries) to get involved in operations in Africa."
</P>
<P>
The 8,500-member U.N. force was dispatched in January to
monitor a cease-fire and peace agreement signed in Lome, capital
of Togo, last July by the Sierra Leonean Government and rebels to
end a bloody eight-year civil war in the West African nation.
</P>
<P>
The world body is trying to appeal for help to bring the
peacekeeping force up to its full strength of 11,100, the largest
U.N. peacekeeping operations yet in the world.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim M'baba Kamara, Sierra Leone's ambassador to the United
Nations, said that RUF leader Foday Sankoh was clearly trying to
test the United Nations by challenging its authority. But he
warned that the failure of the U.N. force to stand up to such a
challenge would have a wider impact than in his country alone.
</P>
<P>
"Sierra Leone is a test case here," Kamara told reporters. "If
they fail in Sierra Leone, what chances are there that they will
succeed" in DRC?
</P>
<P>
DRC poses one of the biggest challenges yet to the United
Nations, which is taking great efforts to deploy a 5,500-strong U.
N. observer force in the coming weeks to oversee a peace accord
signed by six warring African countries and three rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
Security Council ambassadors have refused to speculate about
the implications that the Sierra Leone violence would have on
sentiment for the DRC mission, which is still has not received
troop commitments for the full 5,500 force.
</P>
<P>
Despite the intensified diplomatic efforts in West Africa and
the United Nations to put an end to the crisis and secure the
early, safe release of the U.N. personnel, there has been no sign
so far that the crisis would come to an end in recent days without
the forceful intervention by the international community.
</P>
<P>
"The behavior of Foday Sankoh and his troops risk complicating
the situation and the deployment of troops for the Congo because
the Member States will be discouraged from sending their troops to
Africa," Annan said.

<HEADLINE> Virtual Market of Steel to Be Formed by Four Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Four big steel producers said on
Wednesday that they were forming a global Internet-based virtual
market to buy and sell steel products.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement, issued here by Arbed, Cargill Steel, Samsung
Corporation and Duferco, said that the virtual market would offer
on-line buying and selling of steel products.
</P>
<P>
The virtual market, to be based in New York and to be
operational later this year, will also provide financing, risk
management and logistics services.
</P>
<P>
Yet the four companies have still not yet come out with a web
name for the virtual market.
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg steel producer Arbed said that each founding company
had planned to transfer some of its trading onto the virtual
market to give it commercial volume and liquidity to start with.
</P>
<P>
Cargill Steel said that the four companies had anticipated a
value enhancement for buyers and sellers of up to 15 percent on
the estimate that global steel trade amounts to 100 billion United
States dollars each year.
</P>
<P>
Duferco of Switzerland said that the Internet is believed to be
able to lead to a better way of conducting international trade.

<HEADLINE> IDB Finances Power Project in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) announced Wednesday the approval of 136 million U.S.
dollars in financing support to the construction, operation and
maintenance of a 600 megawatt, natural gas-fueled, combined cycle
power plant and related facilities in the state of Guanajuato,
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The plant, located in San Luis de la Paz, approximately 260
kilometers northwest of Mexico City, will be owned and operated by
Energia Azteca VIII S. de R.L. de C.V. (Aztec Energy), a special
purpose company sponsored by InterGen and AEP Resources, Inc.
</P>
<P>
The IDB said the benefits of the project include a greater role
for private investment in Mexico's power sector, the provision of
an efficient base load source of energy, and the use of the most
environmentally friendly of fossil fuels, natural gas. As part of
the project, Aztec Energy will treat municipal wastewater prior to
its use as a coolant in the power plant.
</P>
<P>
Aztec Energy will provide approximately 495 megawatts of power
to Comision Federal de Electricidad under a 25-year power purchase
agreement. Another 100 megawatts will be sold to third parties.
</P>
<P>
The IDB financing consists of a loan of 23 million dollars from
the bank's ordinary capital and a syndicated loan of approximately
113 million dollars with funds from financial institutions under
subscription of participation agreements with the IDB.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Trial Focuses on Suitcase, Tape Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Lockerbie trial
on Wednesday focused on fragments of a suitcase, clothing and a
cassette tape recorder as the prosecution built its case against
the accused Libyans.
</P>
<P>
The evidence produced on Wednesday in the court on Dutch soil
included a blown-up suitcase, rags of a jacket and what witnesses
said to be part of an instruction handbook for a cassette tape
recorder.
</P>
<P>
Gwendoline Horton, from 96 kilometers east of the Scottish town
of Lockerbie, testified in court that she, like other farmers,
went out to collect evidence in the fields and found a document
that made reference to a radio cassette recorder.
</P>
<P>
Police officer Brian Walton confirmed that he had accepted
Horton's find which he described as an instruction handbook for a
cassette player.
</P>
<P>
When Horton was handed a plastic bag with fragments of the
manual in court, she did not recognize it, saying that when she
handed her find to the police it was "in one piece".
</P>
<P>
The Scots Law requires that the court establish the origins of
all incriminating evidence before it can be linked to the accused.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution and the defense counsel asked for an
adjournment for out-of-court agreements that may save time-
consuming testimony on uncontroversial evidence and facts.
</P>
<P>
"I take it that without agreement we would have days of this
sort of evidence," asked presiding judge Lord Sutherland.
</P>
<P>
"More than days," said prosecutor Alastair Campbell.

<HEADLINE> Special Meeting on CAR to Begin in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A special meeting on
security and development in the Central African Republic (CAR)
will take place on May 15-16 in New York to mobilize donor
assistance in support of the Government's program to restructure
the armed forces, and demobilize and reintegrate retired military
personnel in the country, U.N. officials announced here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. deputy secretary-general, Louise Frechette, is
expected to open the meeting, co-sponsored by the United Nations
and the Permanent Mission of Germany. The prime minister of CAR,
Anicet-George Dologuele, will lead the government delegation.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, the president of the U.N. Security Council,
Wang Yingfan of China, voiced a welcome to the upcoming meeting,
saying that the Council members "underlined the need to
consolidate the progress made in the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Given that security-related programs must be anchored within
the Government's overall social and economic strategy, the meeting
will also focus on its most critical aspects, which also require
the attention and support of the international community, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
This integrated approach to security and development is in
line with the report of the U.N. Secretary-General on the causes
of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable
development in Africa, presented to the Security Council and the
General Assembly over two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which is organized in close collaboration with
the Government of CAR, the U.N. Development Program (UNDP) and the
Bretton Woods Institutions, will bring together interested Member
States, the Organization of the African Unity, the European
Commission, the International Organization of la Francophonie,
regional and international financial institutions, international
non-governmental organizations, as well as relevant U.N.
departments and agencies.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press, Wang said that the Council
members welcomed the special meeting, saying that "the members
wished to express their gratitude for the cosponsorship given by
the government of Germany, and welcomed the active participation
of UNDP, the institutions of Bretton Woods and other U.N. agencies
in the preparation of this meeting."
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Council stressed the importance of this
meeting to support the proposed reforms planned by CAR in the
fields of security and development," the statement said. "They
underlined the need to consolidate the progress made in the peace
process."
</P>
<P>
In February this year, the Security Council has officially
ended the U.N. peacekeeping operations in CAR and established a
new support office to help the government consolidate peace.
</P>
<P>
Mutinous soldiers have staged three major rebellions since
1996 against President Ange-Felix Patasse, whose election in 1993
ended more than a decade of army rule in the country.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, some 1,350 U.N. peacekeeping troops replaced French
soldiers helping to enforce a peace agreement between political
and ethnic opponents in the country.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Troops Accused of Crossing Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan troops were accused on
Wednesday by the Zambian government of repeatedly crossing into
the Zambian territory, killing one soldier and injuring two
others.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Defense Minister Chitalu Sampa was quoted by informed
sources in Luanda as saying that there were at least four Angolan
ground and air-space violations at the end of April.
</P>
<P>
Of the four alleged incidents since April 17, only one incident
on April 27 caused casualties when the Angolan troops fired on a
Zambian patrol four kilometers across the border, killing one
soldier and wounding two others.
</P>
<P>
In another incident, Sampa said, some 60 Angolan soldiers
attacked on April 23 a 30-strong Zambian patrol in the region of
Nguvu, some 20 kilometers inside the border, but fortunately there
were no casualties.
</P>
<P>
Lusaka has formally protested the incursions and will have "no
alternative but to protect our people" if the border violations
continue, Sampa said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries have been strained since
the Angolan civil war broke out. The Zambian government has been
accused by the Angolan government of giving logistic support to
the Angolan rebels led by Jonas Savimbi.

JOHANNESBURG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign Minister
 Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma will pay an official visit to Sweden,
Finland and Denmark from May 11 to 15 this year, the Foreign
Affairs Department announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement from the ministry, South Africa's
relations with all the Nordic countries have been very dynamic
over the past six years based on the invaluable support which was
given to South Africa during the anti-apartheid struggle.
</P>
<P>
Support by the Nordic countries for the development of a strong
 democracy in South Africa since 1994 has been constant, the
statement said, adding that the special relationships which South
Africa has with the Nordic countries have continued to develop.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Dlamini-Zuma will hold discussions with her
Swedish, Finnish and Danish counterparts and other cabinet
ministers on matters of bilateral interest, including the
development in Southern Africa and the African continent as a
whole.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Deploys Strong Force Along Lesotho Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- South African police and army
have stepped up patrols in the Free State bordering western
Lesotho following an anonymous letter distributed in Lesotho's
capital of Maseru last week calling on citizens to raid and loot
South African homes and shops.
</P>
<P>
The heavy police and army presence along the border is a
precautionary measure, said Free State police spokeswoman
Superintendent Johlene van der Merwe.
</P>
<P>
There is also a strong Lesotho armed force in Maseru after the
same letter called on citizens to stay away from work from
Wednesday until next Tuesday in protest against the government led
by Prime Minister Phakalitha Mosisili.
</P>
<P>
The letter even threatened reprisals against those not heading
the call. According to Lesotho police, the government has deployed
armed forces at strategic places in Maseru to protect workers and
property.
</P>
<P>
Four men have been arrested for threatening shop owners, they
said.
</P>
<P>
Copies of the letter have been extensively distributed by
unknown people with blackened faces on the streets of Maseru and
other cities.
</P>
<P>
All Indian and Chinese shops in Maseru were closed on Wednesday
for fear of victimization as happened in September 1998 when a
crisis broke out over the disputed general election results.
</P>
<P>
The United States and German embassies have advised their
nationals to go on holiday outside the country for the next six
days.

<HEADLINE> Peacekeeping Training Critical for Africa: IPA Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Regional peacekeeping training is a
vital initiative that can help restore peace in strife-torn parts
of Africa, an official of the New York-based International Peace
Academy (IPA) said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Peaceful resolution of conflicts will not be possible without
adequate training of military officers, said IPA Vice President
John Hirsch after touring the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) Regional Peacekeeping Training Center in Harare.
</P>
<P>
The official praised Zimbabwe for its role in the United
Nations peacekeeping operations in Somalia, Rwanda, Angola and
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"For a country of a dimension of Zimbabwe, that is a great
achievement," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said his institute would in future enhance its cooperation
with the SADC peacekeeping center in achieving resolution of armed
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The IPA would hold a peacekeeping conference in Southern Africa
this year of which the venue is still to be arranged, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that there would be a peaceful solution
to the escalating violence in Zimbabwe to prevent loss of lives.
</P>
<P>
Hirsch felt encouraged by the efforts of Zimbabwe and other
SADC countries to end the war in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, saying that he hoped the war in Africa's third largest
country would end so the region might improve the living standards
of its people.
</P>
<P>
As an independent organization, the IPA aims to promote
peaceful resolution of conflicts across the world.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Facilitate U.N. Peace Mission in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- South African President Thabo
Mbeki said on Wednesday that the country will dispatch an advance
military team to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to
facilitate the deployment of United Nations peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
In a special address to the National Assembly, Mbeki said U.N.
special representative to the DRC had told a recent meeting of
African leaders in Algiers that "some technical work" had to be
done before the deployment could take place.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan had since detailed the kind
of force that would be needed, which would deal with matters such
as logistics and communications, to enable the deployment of the
U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
"We are working on that particular matter together with the
United Nations, and therefore we will supply these troops," Mbeki
said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki stressed that the troops would not be part of the four
battalions to be deployed. They would be "more a headquarter group
that will enable support to the United Nations to ensure that the
infantry groups that will play the role of monitors will be able
to function properly," he said.

LAGOS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain will not commit its troops to
a combat role in Sierra Leone, the British Broadcast Cooperation
(BBC) Wednesday quoted a high ranking British official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"There are limits to how many different engagements around the
world we can be involved in," said British Defense Secretary Geoff
Hoon Wednesday in London.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark as a response to a request for help from
Sierra Leone government.

swift end to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"If the British government and British military provide

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Urged to Contain Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe
Wednesday said a concerted effort to contain inflation is critical
to guarantee a stable but credible exchange rate and lower
production costs in the country.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said in its economic highlights that low
inflation is essential for economic growth and the competitiveness
of Zimbabwe's export sector.
</P>
<P>
Inflation and escalating production costs have undermined the
viability of most productive sectors, further constraining the
efforts to generate adequate foreign currency, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said that more than 50 percent domestic inflation in the
country continues to be out of line with trading partners'
averages of under 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Production costs in agriculture have risen by 70 to 75 percent
over the past year," the bank said, adding that "given the
knock-on cost effects across all sectors, cost increases in mining
and manufacturing sectors are estimated to be 55 to 60 percent and
60 to 65 percent respectively."
</P>
<P>
In March this year, Zimbabwe witnessed a headline inflation of
50.8 percent.

companies on Lake Tanganyika to prevent overfishing of endangered
species.
</P>

According to Deputy Minister for Agriculture, Food and

fishing companies catching too much fish that would lead to the
depletion of fish.
</P>

There is need for Zambia Investment Center to scrutinize the

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Not to Take Strong Action Against Zimbabwe: Mbeki </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
is committed to a resolution of the Zimbabwean land crisis but
will not take strong actions against that country, President Thabo
Mbeki said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It would be easy to merely condemn other African leaders, but
this approach would not solve any problems, he said when answering
questions in the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"We will not respond so much as to get good publicity but to
resolve these issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Mbeki, the South African government would move
forward to ensure that the important issue of land redistribution
be resolved in a peaceful and cooperative manner.
</P>
<P>
"The whole matter must be handled in a way that provides a
permanent solution," he said, stressing that his government's
policy would be successful.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki was referring to the government's policy of a quiet
diplomacy to assist in ending the continuing political and land
crisis in neighboring Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Opposition political parties have called on the government to
take stronger actions against Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
The South African government would continue to work with its
Zimbabwean counterparts to peacefully resolve the crisis in that
country, Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has been reeling under a spiral of political violence
sparked by war veterans who have invaded about 1,000 white-owned
farms since February this year.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki acknowledged that violence continued in Zimbabwe despite
assurances after a meeting last month between himself, Mugabe and
the presidents of Mozambique and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
South African government officials are still in contact with
their Zimbabwean counterparts and would continue to pursue efforts
to find solutions, Mbeki said.

Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a message to Putin on Tuesday on his assumption of office as

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina Wednesday formally inaugurated the privately-owned Ekushey
Television (ETV),calling upon its organizers to demonstrate
indomitable courage in expressing truth to fulfill the aspirations
of the people.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister expressed her earnest hope that this first
private terrestrial television network of Southeast Asia would be
free from control, but be driven by conscience, self-
responsibility and truthfulness.
</P>
<P>
Terming the launching of this independent TV network as a
remarkable event for the democracy-loving people of the country,
Hasina said the occasion would remain as ever shining as a
milestone of the implementation of the commitment of her
government to independent and neutral mass media.
</P>
<P>
She said that less than 15 percent of the estimated 50 million
people who have access to television in Bangladesh can see cable
and satellite networks. She hoped that Ekushey TV would be a
network of the common people.
</P>
<P>
ETV, as the first independent TV network in the country,
started its commercial broadcasts through terrestrial and
satellite channels on April 14. Viewers in Australia, Malaysia and
Middle East countries could share its broadcasts through satellite
channels.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of ETV Syed Mahmood Hossain said ETV would enjoy total
broadcasting freedom and be free from government control.

<HEADLINE> Pak Bid to Push Militants to Kashmir Foiled: India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- India claimed on Wednesday that
its border security forces had foiled an attempt by Pakistan to
push armed militants into Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday night,
killing three Pakistani intruders.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani attempt to push heavily-armed militants was
foiled in the Poonch sector of the Jammu region, the Press Trust
of India (PTI) quoted an official spokesman as saying in Srinagar,
capital of India-controlled Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
When Indian forces observed militants trying to cross over to
India from Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, they signaled the
intruders to stop and asked them to lay down their arms, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
However, the latter "resorted to firing," forcing the Indian
troops to retaliate and kill three "Pakistani infiltrators," he
added.
</P>
<P>
According to the PTI, the three killed militants were all
identified as residents of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Five other people, including a special police officer, were
killed in separate incidents in Jammu and Kashmir since Tuesday,
the PTI added.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Handset Advertisement Calling for PNTR With China (by Wu Weinong) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- At the first glance, it is no
more than an ordinary handset advertisement, but you will find
something special in it after a second sight.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't sell products to China", asks a folding Motorola
GSM handset on the left side of the advertisement. And the answer
comes from a Flex pager in the middle of the right side: "Someone
else will."
</P>
<P>
Other than showing Motorola's products, the advertisement calls
for permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) with China.
</P>
<P>
The advertisement, accounting for one quarter of a page,
appears on Tuesday's The New York Times. It tells how eager U.S.
businesses want Congress to pass the PNTR bill.
</P>
<P>
"One billion three hundred million potential customers. Five
times the population of the United States. China is the world's
largest market - and one we can't afford to ignore." says the ads.
</P>
<P>
"No issue before Congress will have a greater impact on America
's ability to compete in the New Economy than the vote to open
China's market to American goods and services." says Chris Galvin,
Chairman and CEO of Motorola, in the advertisement.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Galvin's viewpoint is popular among many provident U.S.
politicians and businessmen, who said in recent speeches or
symposiums that the United States will miss out lots of
opportunities if the Congress fails to grant China the PNTR status,
and China's demand for goods and services will grow rapidly with
or without the U.S.
</P>
<P>
European and Japanese competitors will reap benefits from China
's trade liberalization, and U.S. workers, farmers and
manufacturers will lose a lot of opportunities if the bill is not
passed, Montanan Senator Max Baucus said in a recent speech in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Motorola cautions that no mistake can be made or the
result would be unimaginable. "U.S. Congress can vote to allow
American workers and businesses to participate in that growth", or
"Congress can hand the jobs and opportunities to our foreign
competitors."
</P>
<P>
If readers support Motorola's view, they can call a toll free
number given in the advertisement to make sure Congress gets the
message that trade with China means prosperity for America.
</P>
<P>
The advertisement ends with Motorola's logo and one sentence --
Tell Congress to support permanent normal trade relations with
China.

Craig County Sheriff George Vaughn said the flooding -- much of

Meanwhile, a different sort of cleanup was underway after
severe thunderstorms late Tuesday crashed through southern
Michigan, Ohio and Indiana States, ripping down power lines and
plunging nearly 300,000 customers into the dark.

In southern Michigan, severe thunderstorms overturned cars and
left 190,000 customers without power early Wednesday. In Oakland
County, car alarms rang and motorists attempted to navigate
streets littered with fallen trees and live wires.
</P>
<P>
Strong storms also moved through northwestern Ohio, blowing
several trucks off the Ohio Turnpike, causing minor injuries.
About 40,000 utility customers lost power.

<HEADLINE> Minor Changes to Be Made to Russian Cabinet: Acting PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Newly nominated Russian Prime
Minister Mikhail Kasyanov on Wednesday predicted few changes to
the Russian government formation.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet will undergo no major restructuring or
reshuffling if he is confirmed by the parliament as premier, he
said only hours after newly inaugurated Russian President Vladimir
Putin submitted his nomination to the State Duma, lower house of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
"There will be changes, but not global ones," Kasyanov told the
press.
</P>
<P>
However, "it is necessary to make some adjustments in the
structure of the federal organs of power," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kasyanov said that he would take into account the
recommendations of Duma deputies on structural and personnel
changes in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The government "will be formed in a calm atmosphere," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
On his first steps if being approved as cabinet head, Kasyanov
said the steps "are evident to any chairman of the government --
the presentation of the new cabinet structure and candidates to
ministerial posts."

<HEADLINE> S. African Businesses Hampered by National Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Yu Dabo
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Businesses in South Africa
were hampered on Wednesday as people across the country took to
the streets to protest against job losses.
</P>
<P>
The one-day national strike was called by the Congress of South
African Trade Unions (COSATU).
</P>
<P>
The South African Chamber of Business (SACOB) has estimated
that the strike would cost 3.2 billion rand (450 million U.S.
dollars) damage.
</P>
<P>
In Johannesburg, tens of thousands of people rallied at major
centers to press home their demands for better job security.
</P>
<P>
The Gauteng Province, from which COSATU draws 400,000 of its
1.8 million members, appeared to boast the largest turnout.
</P>
<P>
COSATU-affiliated unions participating in the strike include
the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa, the
Communication Workers' Union, the Police and Prisons Civil Rights
Union, the National Union of Mineworkers, the National Education,
Health and Allied Workers' Union, the SA Democratic Teachers'
Union and the Food and Allied Workers' Union (FAWU).
</P>
<P>
FAWU regional secretary, Dennis Nkomo, addressing the
Johannesburg crowd, said that only 14 million of South Africa's 42
million population were economically active.
</P>
<P>
"We are here today because we exactly understand if we don't
fight for our jobs then tomorrow we will be subjected to poverty.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty means we will be hungry and exposed to diseases which
will kill you and you don't want to die from poverty."
</P>
<P>
In Pretoria, around 9,000 protesters also took to the streets
to express their dissatisfaction with job losses.
</P>
<P>
"We are fed up," they chanted as they gathered outside the
Department of Trade and Industry offices in Pretorius Street.
</P>
<P>
They were instigated by the Pretoria Deputy Chairman of the
COSATU, Thomas Martincowitz, who said workers were "sick and
tired" of job losses caused by privatization. Workers were always
the first to suffer, he added.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum handed to the Deputy Director General of Trade and
Industry, Bahle Sidisi, said the reduction of import tariffs was
undermining local industries.
</P>
<P>
The letter also complained about the illegal importation of
foreign goods and called on the government to beef up custom
controls.
</P>
<P>
The COSATU is also pressing for amendments to labor legislation
to allow unions to negotiate terms of retrenchments and ensure
protection for workers at companies which face bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
In Cape Town, a crowd of several thousand began marching to
Parliament at noon, according to the South African Press
Association.
</P>
<P>
Traffic was also brought to a standstill in the smaller cities,
 including Kimberley, Pietersburg and Mafikeng, where scores
gathered to voice their grievances.
</P>
<P>
In KwaZulu-Natal, incidents of violence were reported. Police
fired tear gas to disperse 300 people who threw stones at passing
vehicles in Lamontville, south of Durban. The crowd was apparently
trying to prevent others from going to work.
</P>
<P>
A number of shots were fired at the police and the situation in
the area remained tense.
</P>
<P>
Despite the apparent support for the mass action by the working
class and unemployed, not all political parties agreed with the
strike.
</P>
<P>
The Malamulela Social Movement for the Unemployed (MSMU)
condemned the action, saying it was misguided and would only serve
to increase unemployment.
</P>
<P>
"Every additional rand of unnecessary cost imposed on business
is a rand less to invest and employ people," MSMU Vice President
Corley Mashego said.
</P>
<P>
"The cost in lost production of the proposed strike would
probably be enough to employ 1,000 Malamulela members for one
year."

<HEADLINE> Moscow Rebuffs U.S. Congress Resolution on Russian-Belarussian Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Wednesday sharply refuted
a resolution by the U.S. Congress last Wednesday on the Union of
Russia and Belarus, calling it "negative and provocative."
</P>
<P>
This resolution "grossly distorts the situation in Belarus and
the essence of Russian-Belarussian relations," the Russian Foreign
Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"It is strange that the U.S. lawmakers, stubbornly ignoring
the obvious facts, groundlessly assert that the treaty on
establishing the union is supposed to undermine Belarus'
independence and the prospects of democracy and violates Russia's
international commitments."
</P>
<P>
It described suggestions for putting pressure on Moscow to
make it withdraw from the creation of Russian-Belarussian unity as
"open interference in Russia's internal affairs and relations
between two independent states."
</P>
<P>
"Such initiatives by the U.S. Congress are clearly
counterproductive, do not suit the nature of the Russian-American
relations, run counter to the goal declared by the United States
to support democracy and economic development in Belarus," it
noted.
</P>
<P>
It also stressed that the integration of Russia and Belarus "
will continue to be a priority of Russia's foreign policy."

<HEADLINE> Russia Confirms Stable Food Supply for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia will be able to have a stable
food supply with an expected yield of 70 to 75 million tons of
grain this year, said Russian Food and Agriculture Minister Alexei
Gordeyev on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The grain harvest is estimated to increase by 40 percent over
the 54.7 million tons grown in 1999, Gordeyev said.
</P>
<P>
The forecast takes into account the good condition of winter
crops which may provide a harvest of 30 to 33 million tons of
grain, compared with last year's 22.5 million tons, he said.
</P>
<P>
The weather outlook is expected to be favorable, he added.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference on April 22, Russian Deputy Prime
Minister Vladimir Shcherbak said Russia will likely keep the
country safe from serious food shortages if it harvests 70 to 80
million tons of grain this year.
</P>
<P>
However, it would not be true to say that Russia's agriculture
has come out of its crisis, and it could take years to recover
completely, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Russian First Deputy Food and Agriculture Minister
Anatoly Mikhalyov said Russia will not need the so-called big
package of U.S. food aid if the estimated grain harvest for this
year is achieved.

<HEADLINE> Fundamental Technologies Important for China's Silicon Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Zhongguancun Science and
Technology Park in Beijing, known as China's Silicon Valley,
should pay great attention to research and development of
fundamental technologies.
</P>
<P>
Carl Hsu, vice president of Lucent Technologies and president
of Lucent Asia-Pasific and China Bell Labs, made the suggestion at
a seminar held Tuesday during Beijing High-Tech Week.
</P>
<P>
He said the success of the Silicon Valley of the United States
depends heavily on its solid foundation of basic science and
technology and a good environment to foster talent.
</P>
<P>
These fundamental technologies include microelectronics,
optoelectronics, data transmission, wireless telecommunications
and telecommunication software.
</P>
<P>
If Zhongguancun wants to become the equivalent of the American
Silicon Valley, it must develop its fundamental technologies, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that Chinese firms may first buy advanced
technologies from foreign countries and then train professionals
to use the new technologies. China may learn from the experiences
of Japan and the Republic of Korea, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also praised China's policy of encouraging young people to
study abroad and be exposed to the world's most advanced
technologies and accumulate a wealth of experience.
</P>
<P>
Their exposure and experiences will be a big wealth for China's
high-tech industry, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed more and more Chinese students studying
abroad will return to China to make contributions bringing
experience and money.
</P>
<P>
Zhongguancun, located in northwest Beijing, is home to nearly 5,
000 private high-tech businesses and dozens of academies and
research institutes.
</P>
<P>
About 1,100 computer companies, including IBM, Microsoft, and
Compaq, have set up companies in Zhongguancun.

<HEADLINE> China's Growth Firms to Receive Boost in Overseas Stock-listing (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The successful listing of these high-tech companies overseas
paved the way for more listings by other high-tech firms, while
boosting their confidence in getting permission to list shares
overseas, experts attending the forum said.
</P>
<P>
A survey reveals that 60 percent of China's more than 20 high-
tech enterprises chose Growth Enterprise Markets in Hong Kong,
while another 30 percent viewed NASDAQ as their first choice.
</P>
<P>
However, for those high-tech start-ups, there are other markets
as well. Mark Lee P.L., vice president of the Singapore Exchange (
SGX), said although the stock market in Singapore is comparatively
small, it could be an ideal choice for Chinese enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"Companies listed on the SGX may enjoy lower listing costs,
lower listing standards, and the widespread confidence the
Singaporean investors have in Asian technological firms," Lee said,
adding that SGX could also serve as a stepping stone for Chinese
high-tech companies to enter the NASDAQ Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
Dickson Hall, Asia business consultant for the Canadian Venture
Exchange (CDNX), proposed at the forum a more viable way for
Chinese enterprises to procure much needed funds. "Setting up a
Sino-Canadian joint venture is an easier way for a Chinese
enterprise to get listed on the CDNX. This will make it easier to
get permission from the China Securities Regulatory Commission to
list shares overseas."
</P>
<P>
The three-day forum on overseas stock-listing and international
fund-raising is part of the ongoing Beijing International High-
Tech Industries Week.

<HEADLINE> Judicial Protection on IP Effective in China: Experts (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zhang Lumin, presiding judge of the IP courtroom of the Beijing
Municipal Higher People's Court, said that the Chinese government
has made considerable efforts to establish and improve a complete
legal framework for IP protection over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Since 1982, China has promulgated and implemented a series of
laws on IP protection, including trademark law, patent law,
technology contract law, copyright law, anti-unfair competition
law and regulation on computer software protection.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country has joined a number of international IP
protection pacts and organizations, including the International
Intellectual Property Organization and the World Copyright Pact,
according to the judge.
</P>
<P>
China set up its first IP courtrooms in the Beijing municipal
higher and intermediate courts in 1993. So far, the courtrooms
have accepted 3,094 IP-related cases, of which 93 percent were
handled.
</P>
<P>
Bai Liang, an expert from the China Council for the Promotion
of International Trade, said that the country's current legal
system and judicial practice in the field of IP protection is in
urgent need of reform to meet the needs of a fast-growing
knowledge-based economy in the new century.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a new legal system for IP protection will
play a crucial role in safeguarding the country's booming economy,
cultural progress and technological advancement in the new century,
Bai noted.

self-protection and judicial protection in the field of IP
infringement.
</P>
<P>
"They used to care more about affairs in criminal courts," Sun
said.
</P>
<P>
Sun and his colleagues are attending a number of seminars on
law consultation and IP protection, parts of the ongoing Beijing
International High-Tech Industries Week.
</P>
<P>
The trial procedure is strict, Sun said, if every case of such
kind can successfully be solved through judicial means in China,
the IP protection of domestic and international high-tech firms
will be greatly ensured.
</P>
<P>
This also helps bring along an environment with legal guarantee
for attracting overseas investment and introducing high technology,
he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong-based Standard
Chartered Bank announced Wednesday that it has signed a contract
with the U.S. NCR Corporation to deploy NCR's new personal cash
deposit machines throughout its branches in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The machine is the first of its kind to instantaneously accept
bunched cash deposits in various denominations, in contrast to
traditional deposit terminals that could only accept single notes,
according to Albert Tsang, general manager of the NCR's Financial
Solution Group for China and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Implementing this self-service solution is key to our strategy
to be more competitive in the banking sector," Peter Wong, head of
Standard Chartered Bank's Consumer Banking for Hong Kong, China
and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The bank, a leading international bank with branches in more
than 50 countries, is the first bank in Hong Kong to adopt this
new and innovative machine for its customers.
</P>
<P>
The machine can process bunches of up to 30 notes and recognize
up to 50 mixed denominations or multiple currencies, with full
capabilities to detect forgeries through its multi-sensor note
recognition capacity.
</P>
<P>
The personal cash deposit leads the way in next generation cash
processing by providing a round-the-clock automated cash deposit
facility, delivering a significant reduction in transaction costs
to banks, according to Wong.

<HEADLINE> "Taiwan Independence" Harmful to HK: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) fully supports national
reunification and is strongly opposed to any proposal advocating "
Taiwan independence", said Clement Mak, acting secretary for
constitutional affairs of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the motion debate on "opposing Taiwan becoming
independent" in the Legislative Council Wednesday, Mak said the
early and satisfactory resolution of the Taiwan issue is an
important matter of principle involving national sovereignty and
territorial integrity and it is also in the interests of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"National unification is the common wish of all the Chinese
people, including those of us in Hong Kong," he said. "The results
of several opinion polls taken recently clearly demonstrate that
this represents the consensus of the Hong Kong people."
</P>
<P>
To promote national reunification, the Hong Kong SAR government
has been promoting exchanges between the people of Hong Kong and
Taiwan, Mak noted.
</P>
<P>
Since Hong Kong's return to the motherland in 1997, Hong Kong
and Taiwan have developed closer ties in areas such as trade and
commerce, culture and tourism, and Taiwan has been Hong Kong's
fourth largest trading partner in the last five years, with the
number of visitors between the two places growing continuously, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Many Hong Kong people have come to recognize that cross-strait
relations have a direct impact on our economic prospects and
social stability. It is clear that any attempt to make Taiwan
independent will deal a blow to the trade and commercial exchanges
between Hong Kong and Taiwan, adversely affect our investment
environment, and slow down our economic recovery," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Mak noted that the Hong Kong SAR government has been working
hard to implement the principles of "one country, two systems" and
"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" since its return.
</P>
<P>
"We also earnestly hope that our nation will achieve
reunification at an early date. We very much hope that that can be
achieved peacefully. That is the common wish of all the Chinese
people and that is in the best interests of Hong Kong," he said.

officials.
</P>
<P>
"It shows substantial commitment of resources and manpower,"
Kelly said. He said he felt also very impressed with the work by
the Hong Kong Intellectual Property Investigation Bureau.

BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Drug developers in China hope they
can extract powerful components from herbal medicines to produce
new drugs for major illnesses.
</P>
<P>
Chen Kaixian, an academician from the Chinese Academy of

based on foreign products. The industry will suffer setbacks as
more and better foreign products are available on the domestic

Although China has more than 6,300 pharmaceutical enterprises,
most small and medium-sized ones cannot afford huge investments in
research and development.

"China has an abundant resources of herbal medicine and a long

useful components from natural medicines," he told a seminar at
the Fourth Beijing Biotech and Pharma Industry Development Forum.

<P>
China has succeeded in developing some new drugs based on herbs

SHANGHAI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji today
hailed the Land Border Treaty between China and Vietnam, signed by
both foreign ministers on December 30 last year, as a great event
in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with visiting Deputy Prime Minister of
Vietnam Nguyen Manh Cam, Zhu expressed the hope that both sides
will as quickly as possible exchange documents so as to start
demarcation work at an earlier date, now that China's National
People's Congress Standing Committee already ratified the treaty
in April.
</P>
<P>
China and Vietnam will devote themselves to resolving the
demarcation of Beibu Bay, Zhu said, adding that it will be another
major event in bilateral relations following the settlement of the
land border issue. Zhu added his belief that demarcation work will
be accomplished on the basis of mutual understanding and mutual
accommodation.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Zhu said that Sino-Vietnamese relations
have made progress this year and that both countries have
celebrated the 50th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Manh Cam, who is here attending the 11th Annual
Corporate Conference of the U.S. Asia Society, replied that
Vietnam is satisfied with the rapid development of bilateral
relations, adding that trade and economic cooperation between the
two countries have witnessed new developments following Zhu's
visit to Vietnam last year.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the belief that the Land Border Treaty will be passed
without any difficulty in the National Assembly of Vietnam.

GAZA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Wednesday reiterated his stand that this year is the "year of
the declaration of the Palestinian independent state".
</P>
<P>
Telling a news conference held here following his return from
Egypt where he met President Hosni Mubarak, Arafat described
the meeting as "positive and constructive as usual".
</P>
<P>
The stalemate in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and the
Mideast peace process was undoubtedly the major topic in his talks
with Mubarak, said Arafat.
</P>
<P>
"I have briefed President Mubarak on what has been achieved and
the obstacles that are hampering all Palestinian tracks of
negotiations with the Israelis in Ramallah, Eilat and Jerusalem
respectively," said Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Arafat described reports published by the French "Le Monde"
daily recently on a purported agreement between the Palestinians
and the Israelis outlining the borders and deciding the status of
Jerusalem as sheer fabrications.
</P>
<P>
With the conclusion of the peace process the Palestinians would
control 90 percent of the West Bank and Gaza and take over the
civil administration of Eastern Jerusalem, alleged the paper.

<HEADLINE> 13 Islamic Militants Sentenced to Prison Terms in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian court on Wednesday
sentenced 13 Islamic radicals to prison terms ranging from three to
25 years.
</P>
<P>
The Higher State Security Court handed down a death sentence on
April 13 against Shaaban Abdel-Ghani Haridi, 30, for leading a cell
that killed three policemen, three Coptic Christians and four other
people in the past few years. The court postponed sentencing the 13
militants until May 10.
</P>
<P>
Ali Hassan Fayed was given a 25-year jail term with hard labor,
Ali Mohamed Abdel Fatah Khalaf was sentenced to 15 years in prison
with hard labor and Ashraf Sayed Riyad received a sentence of 10-
year imprisonment, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The 10 other defendants were sentenced to three or five years in
jail, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The 14 defendants were accused of belonging to an outlawed
terrorist group, believed to be al-Gama'a al-Islamiya (Islamic
Group), Egypt's most militant group. They were the survivors of a
gang of 33, whose other 19 members were killed by police.
</P>
<P>
They were also accused of attempting to kill four other
policemen and 14 civilians between August 1995 and April 1997 in
the southern governorates of Minya, Beni Suef and Fayoum as well as
robbing 114,000 U.S. dollars, gold and jewelry in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Islamic militants launched in 1992 an armed campaign in
an attempt to topple the secular government and install a strict
Islamic rule. The insurrection has been crushed in a government
crackdown following the massacre of 58 foreign tourists by al-
Gama'a al-Islamiya in Luxor in November 1997.

</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Telecoms 2000 East Africa
exhibition with the participation of 68 companies across the world
was opened in Kenya's capital Nairobi Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The exhibitors are major national, regional and international
companies from over 20 countries including Kenya, Tanzania, South
Africa, Israel, China, France, Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
On display are telecommunications equipment, video conferencing
 facilities, computer hardware and software, broadcast equipment,
global positioning systems, internet and intranet facilities,
management information systems, mobile cellular equipment, paging
systems, satellite communication and consumer electronics, among

<P>
ZTE Corporation, the only exhibitor from China, offers over 60
products in 13 categories including mobile phone,

communications.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Kenyan Minister for Information,
Transport and Communications Musalia Mudavadi said that the
importance of telecommunications, one of the vital elements in
business today, is growing as governments and stakeholders push
for the globalization of trade.
</P>
<P>

Kenya through the sale of 49 percent of its shares, floatation of
tenders for rural telecommunications operators and the licensing
of mobile telephone operators.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Signs have shown that China's high-
tech growth firms may expect a promising future in raising funds
from overseas growth enterprise stock markets which are designed
specially for small companies with little earnings but viable
technology and good growth potential.
</P>
<P>
Chinese entrepreneurs from high-tech companies who are
attending an international forum on overseas fund-raising today
said they can see great opportunities from the overseas stock
market.
</P>
<P>
Lack of funds have hampered new and high technologies in China
from becoming productive forces and profitable industries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is actively seeking to expedite the
formation of a venture capital investment system and set up an
alternative stock market for growth firms. Raising funds from
overseas growth enterprise market has also been proposed another
good choice.
</P>
<P>
"China's high-tech companies have great potential to get listed
on overseas growth enterprise stock markets, and with China's
impending entry into the WTO, enterprises will surely become more
involved in the European stock market," said Jane Zhu, head of the
Asia Pacific Global Business Development at the London Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The London Stock Exchange has launched its Technology Market
and Alternative Investment Market to suit the fund-raising needs
of high-tech firms and small companies. Chinese firms are welcome
to get listed there, Jane said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a number of Chinese Internet and e-commerce
companies listed their shares on the NASDAQ Stock Market and the

corporate conference in Asia opened this evening in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji delivered a keynote speech at an
evening banquet specially arranged for the opening of the
conference, entitled "China and Asia at the Turn of the Century:
Opportunities for World Business".
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Premier Zhu said that with the economic
globalization, it is all the more imperative to establish a fair
new international political and economic order. Furthermore, it
calls on all countries around the world, developing countries in
particular, to deepen their reforms and improve their
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
While reminding participants of China's remarkable progress
made in the past two decades, Zhu also said that marked changes
have taken place in China's economic development in the first
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, in the first three months, China's gross
domestic product (GDP) increased by 8.1 percent, industrial added
value increased by 10.7 percent, state revenue increased by 23.8
percent and profits made by industrial enterprises increased by
nearly 200 percent.
</P>
<P>
Zhu attributed the encouraging signs to five factors: the
pursuit of a pro-active fiscal policy in China in the past three
years, the establishment of a sound social security system, the
implementation of a well-thought monetary policy, increased input
in technology and education and development of high- and new-tech
industries, and accelerated reform of state-owned enterprises (
SOEs).
</P>
<P>
"The process of China's accession to the WTO is now picking up
speed. I believe that China's WTO membership will afford China an
important opportunity to develop its opening-up to a new stage,"
said Zhu. "We will make further efforts to speed up the opening-up
process in such fields as energy, transportation,
telecommunications and environmental protection. And at the same
time, we will open wider to the outside world such service sectors
as banking, insurance, tourism, commerce and trade."
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that China would try to attract more foreign capital
to transform and upgrade SOEs. Relevant laws will be revised in
accordance with WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that China is the largest developing country and has
huge market potential. "To open up the Chinese market will become
an important factor for world economic prosperity."
</P>
<P>
"We warmly welcome businessmen around the world and
international investment agencies to China to make investment and
do business. And we are looking forward to joining hands with them
in creating a better future," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the Asian community, China is very much
concerned about the stability and development of the Asian economy,
said the Chinese premier. "Asian countries hit by the financial
crisis are now experiencing an economic recovery."
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that an important lesson that the Asian financial
crisis has taught people is that we need to guard against
financial risks, check excessive speculation and set up a sound,
efficient and safe financial system.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that the Asian economy will successfully
readjust and improve its model of development, become dynamic and
vibrant, and take an even more important position in the global
economy in the new century. We have full confidence in the bright
future of the Asian economy," said Premier Zhu.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,100 Chinese and overseas delegates, Chinese and
foreign government officials and diplomats attended the evening
banquet. Among them were Huang Ju, a member of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (
CPC) and also Party Secretary of Shanghai, and Deputy Prime
Minister of Vietnam Nguyen Manh Cam.
</P>
<P>
Before the banquet, Premier Zhu met with thirty-eight foreign
government officials and conference sponsors, including Alwi
Abdurrahman Shihab, Indonesian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lee
Hun Jai, Korean Minister of Finance and Economy, Tarrin
Nimmanahaeminda, Thai Minister of Finance, and Maurice R.
Greenberg, Chairman of the Board of the U.S. Asia Society and  14
main Board members of the U.S. Asia Society.
</P>
<P>
The Asia Society of the United States is one of the largest non-
gpovernmental, nonprofit institutions in the United States. The
Asia Society has held 10 other similar conferences in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The 11th annual corporate conference of the Asia Society will

<TEXT>
<P>
At the important juncture of the turn of the century, China has
come to a crucial stage of deepening reforms and readjusting its
economic structure for its economic development. In spite of many
favorable conditions on our road ahead, we also face a lot of
difficulties and challenges. At the moment we are confronted with
such problems as insufficient effective demand, an irrational
economic structure, mounting employment pressure and a slowed-down
income growth for farmers. These are problems that should not be
neglected. They are also problems that are likely to occur in the
process of development and can only be solved step by step through
development.

<TEXT>
<P>
Marked changes took place in China's economic development in
the first quarter of this year. Our GDP increased by 8.1 percent,
industrial added value by 10.7 percent with visibly better
economic returns, the state revenue by 23.8 percent, and profits
made by industrial enterprises by nearly 200 percent.
</P>
<P>
All this is attributable to the following factors. Firstly, we
have pursued a pro-active fiscal policy in China for the past
three years, which has played an important part in spurring China'
s economy. We have intensified efforts in the construction of
infrastructure in particular, which has helped open up the
traditional industrial market. Secondly, efforts have been made to
put in place a sound social security system. We have increased the
pension for the retired and the subsistence allowances for the
laid-off workers and the salaries of the employees of the
government bodies and institutions. All these measures have
improved the expectations of our workers and staff members about
the reforms, which has helped boost consumption. Thirdly, we have
implemented a well-thought monetary policy, which has stabilized
the exchange rates of RMB. In addition, we have adopted a tax
rebate policy to encourage export. As a result, our export volume
expanded from zero or even negative growth to a positive increase
of 6.1 percent last year, and 39.1 percent for the first quarter
of this year. Fourthly, we have increased input in science,
technology and education to boost the development of high- and new-
tech industries and improve our industrial structure. Fifthly, we
have intensified the reform of SOEs (state-owned enterprises).
Some of these enterprises have been reorganized, listed in the
stock market and adopted a share-holding system. Some loss-making
ones have started to make profits through better management,
technical upgrading the debt-to-equity swap. In key large and
medium-sized SOEs, the modern enterprise system has been, by and
large, put in place. They have transformed their operational
mechanism and instituted a sound supervision mechanism. All these
measures will help most of the large and medium-sized loss-making
SOEs out of the their predicament this year.

And at the same time, we will open wider to the outside world such

We will try to attract more foreign capital to the transformation
and upgrading of our SOEs in various forms. We will review and, if
necessary, amend the existing foreign-related laws and regulations
in light of the requirements of WTO rules and set up an economic
and trade system consistent with both the international practice
and our national conditions at an early date.
</P>
<P>
China is the largest developing country and boasts a huge
market potential. The improved living standards of over one
billion Chinese and the upgrading of their consumption pattern
will definitely create mammoth consumer demands. And the massive
infrastructure construction, the upgrading of the industrial
structure and the vigorous development of China's west will
certainly push up phenomenal investment demands. In the next
decade, it is estimated that China will have an average annual
growth rate of 7 percent or so for its GDP and over 10 percent for
fixed assets investment. Its import volume will have reached over
two trillion US dollars. These foreseeable huge business
opportunities in China belong not only to Chinese entrepreneurs,
but also to those far-sighted and courageous businesspeople around
the world. Opening up the Chinese market will become an important
factor for world economic prosperity. We warmly welcome
businessmen around the world and international investment agencies
to China to make investment and do business. And we are looking
forward to joining hands with them in creating a better future. (

<P>
As a member of the Asian community, we are very much concerned
about the stability and development of the Asian economy. China's
economy would not develop without Asia, and Asia's economic
prosperity would also be impossible without China. Over the past
decades, Asia has seen a rapid economic growth and has become one
of the most dynamic regions in the world. We have noted with
gratification that the Asian countries that were hit by the
financial crisis are now experiencing an economic recovery. An
important lesson that the Asian financial crisis has taught us is
that we need to guard against financial risks, check excessive
speculation and set up a sound, efficient and safe financial
system. All countries must deepen their own national financial
restructuring and improve financial supervision and regulation so
as to place their financial sector in a better position to support
economic growth and protect themselves from financial crises. At
the same time, they must take an active part in the reform of the
international financial system and strengthen global and regional
cooperation in the financial area. I am convinced that the Asian
economy will successfully readjust and improve its model of
development, become dynamic and vibrant, and take an even more
important position in the global economic pattern in the new
century. We have full confidence in the bright future of the Asian
economy.

<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will give preferential

<HEADLINE> Central Bank Governor Urges Commercial Bank Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Governor of the People's Bank of
China (PBOC) Dai Xianglong said today that the reform of
commercial banks must be accelerated according to law.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inaugurating ceremony of the China Association
of Banks and a seminar on the 5th anniversary of the promulgation
of China's commercial bank law, Dai said that efforts should also
be made to further improve the corporate management structure in
commercial banks, establish a modern financial enterprise system
and develop new businesses.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that over the past five years the commercial bank law
provided legal guarantees for the growth of China's commercial
banks, and promoted the reform and development of the country's
commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
He said the law provided a basis for improving China's
commercial banking system and protecting the rights of commercial
banks in making business decisions. The central bank has ratified
the establishment of a number of share-holding commercial banks,
city commercial banks, and branches of foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
He said that the central bank has reinforced its supervision
over the financial sector in the past five years according to
related provisions in the law.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the commercial bank law and other related rules and
regulations, China's banking sector has been developing steadily.
By the end of 1999, total assets of all financial institutions in
China amounted to 17.75 trillion yuan, with 12.41 trillion yuan or
70 percent of the total for commercial banks.

<HEADLINE> Food Imports Decline in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's imports under the food
group amounted to 946.86 million U.S. dollars in the first 10
months of the current fiscal year as against the 1.39 billion
dollars a year ago, marking a 32-percent decline.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of food imports was mainly due to a sharp decline
in the import of edible oil during July 1999-April 2000,according
to the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP).
</P>
<P>
The food imports during April 2000 were recorded at 67.3
million dollars -- a decline of around 60 percent over the
corresponding month of last year.
</P>
<P>
Through a reduced import of edible oil, the country has been
able to save 443 million dollars in the 10 months with official
quarters predicting over 400 million dollars of savings by the end
June 2000.
</P>
<P>
In the 10 months, major decline was witnessed in the import of
soybean oil which recorded a cut of over 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
The soybean oil imports, which amounted to 190.5 million
dollars in the first 10 months of the previous fiscal year,dropped
to 75.8 million dollars this year -- a net saving of 114.76
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the import of palm oil in the 10 months declined by
47.22 percent to 267.79 million dollars from 507.3 million dollars
during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
"Duty-free import of oil seed and improved domestic production
has helped to substantially reduce its import bill,"APP quoted
official sources of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government is making efforts to increase the production of
edible oil in the country by increasing area of cultivation and
introducing new seeds with high yield, the officials added.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Rebels to Decide on Talks on Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Abu Sayyaf holding 21 hostages,
mainly foreigners, in the jungle of the southern Philippine island
province of Sulu said they will decide whether to hold formal
negotiations on the release of their captives within 24 hours,
Philippine News Agency said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed Wednesday by Presidential adviser Roberto
Aventajado after a closed-door meeting with Sulu Governor
Abdusakur Tan at his residence in downtown Asturias, Jolo, the
capital city of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Present in the meeting were former Libyan Ambassador Abdulaziz
Rajab Azarouq and government negotiator Ustadz Ghadzali.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held upon the return of the third medical
mission to the Abu Sayyaf lair in Patikul town Wednesday afternoon.
The medical mission was headed by Nelsa Amin, Sulu provincial
health officer.
</P>
<P>
Only former Libyan Ambassador Azarouq was allowed entry to the
Abu Sayyaf hideout where the 21 hostages are being kept.
</P>
<P>
Thus the former Libyan envoy is privy to what Abu Sayyaf leader
Abu Pula had communicated to him.
</P>
<P>
"With regard to the condition of the sickly German woman, the
Abu Sayyaf asked for another 24 hours before they can decide to
release her," Aventajado was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We will get word from them (Abu Sayyaf leaders) tomorrow with
regard to negotiation on the hostages," Aventajado said.
</P>
<P>
"This being the first meeting with the Abu Sayyaf group holding
the 21 hostages, laying down the framework as to how the
negotiation should be carried out was required," he added.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado said Pula told Azarouq they "will consult with their
leaders and they will see us again tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
He said the Abu Sayyaf also assured Azarouq that the health of
the German woman, Renata Waler, has improved.
</P>
<P>
"We need a little patience but I'm quite optimistic this
problem will soon be over," Azarouq said with confidence regarding
the fate of the hostages, who were taken from Sipadan Beach Resort
in Sabah, Malaysia, on April 23.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Opposition Renamo Members Attack Police Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Four people died and several others
were seriously injured when about 100 men believed to be members
of the opposition party Renamo attacked the police station at Aube
in the northern Mozambican province of Nampula.
</P>
<P>
A source in the Nampula provincial police command was quoted by
 Wednesday's daily "Noticias" as saying that Alvaro Julio, head of
the Aube police station, is among the seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry told Xinhua that
the local police commander had been stabbed to death in the attack
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The group of attackers, led by local Renamo delegate Valentim
Bartolomeu, set free two detainees and escaped with two stolen
AK-47 rifles, said the source, adding a police officer opened fire
and shot dead two attackers on spot. Two other attackers were
found dead hours later.
</P>
<P>
An unspecified number of attackers have been detained and sent
to the district police command for investigations.
</P>
<P>
The former rebel movement Renamo has not made any response to
the incident.
</P>
<P>
This attack followed threats made a few days earlier by Renamo
leader Afonso Dhlakama that he could regroup demobilized Renamo
soldiers, and seize control of the country.
</P>
<P>
Cited by the pro-Renamo newspaper "Imparcial", Dhlakama had
boasted that these men would know where to find the weapons they
needed.
</P>
<P>
The incident was believed to be the latest in a series of moves
by Renamo to reject the ruling Frelimo party's victory in the
presidential and parliamentary elections last December on the
pretext of fraud.

<HEADLINE> France Says Not Worried About Ties With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said on Wednesday that he is not worried about the future
of French-Russian relations although the two countries have
different views over the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"In regard to the most fundamental, I am not worried," said
Vedrine during a meeting with the press.
</P>
<P>
He repeated France's criticism of the war in Russia's breakaway
republic of Chechnya, saying it was "a wrong policy" and "a very
grave error." Moscow has said the war is an anti-terrorist
campaign.
</P>
<P>
"We have said what we should have said and I don't think that
this should jeopardize the French-Russian relations," said Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
Russia launched the massive campaign in August last year
following separatist Chechen rebels invaded neighboring Dagestan
and allegedly authored a series of apartment blasts in Moscow and
two other cities that killed more than 300 people.
</P>
<P>
France has expressed hopes that Russian President Vladimir
Putin can pay a visit to Paris before the summit of the Group of
Eight most industrialized nations in Okinawa, Japan, in July. But
the date for such a visit has not been fixed yet.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Arizona Senator John McCain Tuesday endorsed his rival
George W. Bush for his presidential bid two months after their
bitter primary battle.
</P>
<P>
-- Philippine investigators hunting the author of the "Love Bug

young Manila students and hackers Tuesday after a Philippine
prosecutor, citing lack of evidence, released a 28-year-old bank
employee who was taken into custody Monday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee voted
overwhelmingly Tuesday to require Congressional approval for
United States peacekeepers to remain in Kosovo beyond July 2001.

<HEADLINE> China Unstoppable for Uber Cup Victory, Thomas Cup Widely Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 10 (Xinhua) -- One thing of the most truth
before the launch of the Thomas/Uber Cup Finals here is China's
reigning of the Uber Cup, but the men's Thomas Cup could be widely
open with at least four nations capable of taking the top honor.
</P>
<P>
Led by world number one women's singles player Gong Zhichao,
China had foreseen nothing but the pressure to be perfect to slow
down their footsteps on the way to the final victory.
</P>
<P>
"We're the one to beat," coach Tang Xuehua said on Wednesday.
"And we're confident to win the Uber Cup again."
</P>
<P>
The tiny Gong, who won the All-England and the Japanese Open
titles earlier this year, will be the first seed to stamp Chinese
domination in the singles.
</P>
<P>
And world's top-ranked pair Ge Fei and Gu Jun will put things
beyond doubt in the doubles games, accompanied by Yang Wei and
Huang Nanyan, who won in Japan by beating the Chinese top-seeded
duo.
</P>
<P>
China are of the class of their own, leaving Indonesia, who
lost to China 4-1 in the previous Cup finals, and Denmark and
South Korea competing for the second place.
</P>
<P>
The Thomas Cup could be more unpredictable with Indonesia,
China, Malaysia and Denmark all being required to perform their
best to pocket the trophy at the end of the 11-day tournament
which start here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Defending champions Indonesia are the hottest favorites in the
men's zone, but their slim advantage from the doubles only makes
the bids more interesting.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team is headed by All-England champion Xian Xuanze
and the Japanese Open winner Ji Xinpeng. But the doubles pairs,
Yu Jinhao and Chen Qiqiu and Zhang Wei and Zhang Jun might carry
less load for their glory.
</P>
<P>
Denmark, who lost to Indonesia in the Finals two years ago,
have singles world number one Peter Gade-Christernsen and Poul-
Erik Hoyer-Larsen in the squad to boost their chance to win the
first Thomas Cup Final from the Asian contenders.
</P>
<P>
While hosts Malaysia, which had called back veteran Rashid
Sidek, might be the real challengers to Indonesia had they turned
the home advantage into a winning standpoint.
</P>
<P>
South Korea and Sweden are also out in both lines as the four
top contenders, but they are short of top players to create
surprises.

<P>
SHANGHAI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
delivered an important speech at the US Asia Society's 11th Annual
Corporate Conference in Asia, which opened here this evening.
</P>
<P>
The following is the full text of his speech (Translation):

Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Friends,
</P>
<P>
In the month of May overflowing with the spirit of spring, the
US Asia Society meets here in Shanghai for its 11th Annual
Corporate Conference. At the same time, China Investment Forum
2000 is also being held in Shanghai. Allow me to extend, on behalf

</P>
<P>
With the advent of the new century, the scientific and
technological revolution piloted by IT development is advancing
forward at a lightening speed. It is profoundly altering the
modality of production and people's way of life. And it has become
a major driving force behind the contemporary economic growth. The
process of structural readjustment and reorganization of the world
economy is being accelerated, with new industries rising up and
growing rapidly. In short, the trend toward economic globalization
is visibly gaining momentum. It presents both new economic
development opportunities, and inevitably, serious challenges to
all countries, developing countries in particular. To promote
economic globalization, it is all the more imperative to establish
a fair and reasonable new international political and economic
order. And furthermore, it calls for all countries in the world,
developing countries in particular, to deepen their reforms,
restructure their economy and improve their competitiveness.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Up Association of Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The China Association of Banks (CAB)
was officially established here today and passed at its first
meeting a constitution and a self disciplinary convention of the
association.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the association said that the establishment of
the association will play an active role in reinforcing member
banks' self discipline and coordination, standardizing their
business activities, protecting member banks' legal rights and
interests, and promoting the healthy development of China's
banking industry.
</P>
<P>
The CAB is a non-profit social group organized voluntarily by
commercial and policy banks registered in the People's Republic of
China. It will play a self-disciplinary role in China's banking
sector.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the People's Bank of China show that by the end
of 1999, China had had 109 banks of its own, 156 branches of
foreign banks, and 13 joint-ventures or wholly foreign-owned
commercial banks, with a total asset of about 12.4 trillion yuan (
about 1.59 trillion U.S. dollars), constituting 70 percent of the
total assets of all financial institutions in China.
</P>
<P>
The CAB has 22 initiating member banks, including policy banks,
wholly State-owned commercial banks, share-holding commercial
banks and city commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the CAB plans to expand the scope of
the association's membership and will accept foreign-funded banks
as its members.

<HEADLINE> China to Deepen Financial Reform: Senior Banker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China will deepen the reform of its
banking system in the coming several years to raise the
competitive power of Chinese banks while more foreign banks expand
their business in China, a senior Chinese banker said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
China will gradually get rid of the debt burdens of state-owned
commercial banks and build a modern commercial banking system with
the introduction of joint-stock mechanism, Liu Tinghuan, deputy
governor of the People's Bank of China, said at a commercial
banking conference held in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Such reformed share-holding commercial banks and city
commercial banks throughout the country will compete with each
other and only the strong ones survive, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Step by step, the management of interest rates will be actually
based on monetary supply and demand in the financial market with
the interest rates of the central bank acting as the basic
regulating level, the banker said.
</P>
<P>
The control over the interest rates of foreign currencies will
be lifted first and the rates of Renminbi afterwards. The control
over interest rates at financial institutions in rural areas will
be lifted first and in urban areas afterwards. The control over
lending rates will be lifted first and deposit rates afterwards,
he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, foreign capital is not allowed to set foot in China
's securities market. The central bank will exert active efforts
to achieve capital-account convertibility in accordance with the
country's financial reform and the supervising capability of the
central bank, the deputy governor said.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, China will improve the financial legal system
along with the opening-up of the financial market, the operation
of foreign financial institutions in China and the international
trend of financial supervision, Liu Tinghuan said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Launches Taxi Training Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A mandatory training program for
new applicants for taxi driving licenses and a self-learning
program for existing taxi drivers will be launched by the
Transport Department of Hong Kong to further improve taxi service
quality.
</P>
<P>
Proposed in accordance with the recommendations of a review
conducted by the Transport Advisory Committee and developed by a
consultant commissioned by the department, both training programs
will focus on five aspects including customer service, basic
Putonghua and English communication skills, knowledge about
destinations and routes, taxi regulations and Road Users Code as
well as safe driving habits.
</P>
<P>
The 12.5-hour mandatory training program will be given in the
form of lectures and peer discussions and attendants will be
assessed at the end of the program. For the self-learning program,
tapes, CDs, videotapes and VCDs will be made available to help
drivers improve their knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Introducing the proposed programs at a press briefing held
Wednesday, Chairman of the Quality Taxi Service Steering Committee
Jeffrey Lam said the proposals had gained the support from the
committee.
</P>
<P>
"These two programs serve to enhance taxi service quality
through imposing compulsory requirements on the one hand and
offering flexible ways for self-improvements on the other," Lam
added.
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of a mandatory training program which
requires legislative amendments will be realized after the
department consults the trade later this year on the detailed
proposals," Lam said.

<P>
SHANGHAI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji today
hailed the Land Border Treaty between China and Vietnam, signed by
both foreign ministers on December 30 last year, as a great event
in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with visiting Deputy Prime Minister of
Vietnam Nguyen Manh Cam, Zhu expressed the hope that both sides
will as quickly as possible change documents so as to start
demarcation work at an earlier date, now that China's National
People's Congress Standing Committee already ratified the treaty
in April.
</P>
<P>
China and Vietnam will devote themselves to resolving the
demarcation of Beibu Bay, Zhu said, adding that it will be another
major event in bilateral relations following the settlement of the
land border issue. Zhu added his belief that demarcation work will
be accomplished on the basis of mutual understanding and mutual
accommodation.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Zhu said that Sino-Vietnamese relations
have made progress this year and that both countries have
celebrated the 50th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Manh Cam, who is here attending the 11th Annual
Corporate Conference of the U.S. Asia Society, replied that
Vietnam is satisfied with the rapid development of bilateral
relations, adding that trade and economic cooperation between the
two countries have witnessed new developments following Zhu's
visit to Vietnam last year.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the belief that the Land Border Treaty will be passed
without any difficulty in the National Assembly of Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> China Determine to Boost Biotech Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China is determined to build itself
into one of the world's biotechnology leaders in the next decade,
according to a Chinese official.
</P>
<P>
Initial goals of a 10-year development plan include
establishing 20 world-level research and development centers and
10 biotech centers with an annual output value of 300 billion yuan
(36 billion U.S. dollars), said Liu Qian, director of the China
Bio-engineering Development Center under the Ministry of Science
and Technology.
</P>
<P>
"The biotech industry will become one of China's pillar
industries in the 21st century," Liu said today at the Fourth
Beijing Biotech and Pharma Industry Development Forum.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that these goals will not be realized unless the
government injects enormous investment while creating a healthier
environment for developing the industry.
</P>
<P>
"Research and development investment makes up only 0.5 percent
of China's gross domestic product, compared with 2 percent or more
in developed countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The government should make determination to strengthen its
biotech industry, just like what it has done in developing the A-
bomb and building the Three Gorges Dam," said a scholar at the
seminar.
</P>
<P>
Biologist Chen Zhangliang urged the government to pay attention
to the reserve of hi-tech personnel.
</P>
<P>
"Personnel shortages could be a serious issue if little is done
to train more researchers and attract overseas Chinese scholars to
return home," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 100 hi-tech companies involved in
biotechnology and nearly 20,000 researchers.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat told
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Wednesday the Palestinian-Israeli
peace talks need a push, as little progress has been made in the
final-status negotiations, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after an Egyptian-Palestinian summit,
Moussa said that Arafat briefed Mubarak on the latest developments
on the Palestinian track and the outcome of the latest round of
talks in the Israeli Red Sea resort of Eilat, which ended on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said during the meeting that no progress has been
achieved in the recent negotiations, according to Moussa, who
warned that the two sides would fail to reach agreement as
scheduled if the current situation continues.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel had planned to reach a framework
agreement this month for a final peace deal in September on the
thorniest issues including borders, Jerusalem, refugees,
settlements and water resource.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that Egypt will hold contacts with Israel and the
United States in a bid to seek ways to overcome difficulties and
salvage the Mideast peace process on various tracks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat left Cairo after meeting with Mubarak, ending a two-day
visit. The Palestinian leader often visits Egypt to consult with
Mubarak on the peace march and seek his advice.

<P>
ANKARA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The assassination seven years ago of
Ugur Mumcu, a famous columnist of Turkey's leading newspaper
Republic, is now closer to being solved following a series of
secret operations carried out by the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The liberal journalist was killed in a car bomb attack in front
of his house in the capital city of Ankara on January 24, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Nine suspects have been arrested recently on clues found on
computer disks and in documents seized during a raid against the
radical Islamic terrorist group Hezbullah in Istanbul on January
17, local press reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The police also seized an amount of C-4 plastic explosives, the
kind used in Mumcu's assassination.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that one suspect claimed the bombing was planned
and carried out by Iranian culprits, adding that he only watched
out for the police while the Iranians planted the bomb.
</P>
<P>
The suspect also said that he went to Qom, Iran in 1989 and was
trained there by agents of Iran's Savama intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian Embassy in Ankara issued a statement,
denying any links with the assassination or the Turkish Hezbollah,
which has no connection with the Iranian-backed anti-Israel
Lebanese guerrilla group that bears the same name.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Hezbollah, which reportedly sought to turn the
overwhelmingly Muslim-populated but secular Turkey into a strict
Islamic-rule regime by terrorism, has been accused of involvement
in many cases of kidnapping, blackmail and murder across the
country.
</P>
<P>
Despite mounting allegations against Iran, Turkish Foreign
Minister Ismail Cem adopted a cautious attitude, saying his
ministry has to wait and see the government's decision before
taking any action against Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said that nothing has been clarified yet, so it was out of
the question for the ministry to issue a statement over alleged
Iranian involvement.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the case was very sensitive because it might
overshadow efforts made by Ankara and Tehran to improve their
relations.
</P>
<P>
With the process of the case underway, Istanbul No. 6 State
Security Court imposed a press blackout, warning to indict
newspapers and television stations that break the news ban.
</P>
<P>
The possible lifting of the blanket of fog over the Mumcu
murder, analysts said, could also shed light on the murders of
several other leading intellectuals in Turkey in the past years.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Holds Talks With Indonesian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
and Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid met here Wednesday at
the Government House to exchange views on bilateral and regional
issues.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Akapol told reporters after the meeting
that the Indonesian president briefed Chuan on his country's
general situation, saying that the situation is basically under
control and his government is striving to stimulate economic
growth, especially exports.
</P>
<P>
Wahid expressed wishes to strengthen bilateral relations and
stressed the need for Indonesia to learn from Thailand's
experiences in solving economic problems and for the two countries
to cooperate in rice and rubber trade.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed regional political issues,
agreeing that both countries can be made models in developing
democracy in the region.
</P>
<P>
Early Wednesday morning Wahid received an honorary law
doctorate from Thammasat University and made a keynote speech
there at the centennial commemoration of Pridi Banomyong, the
founding father of Thai democracy.
</P>
<P>
Pridi, a former law professor and founder of Thammasat
University, joined a group of disenchanted bureaucrats and army
colonels to depose Thailand's absolute monarchy on June 24, 1932,
and helped draft the legal framework for a constitutional monarchy
that opened the door for democracy in the country.
</P>
<P>
Comparisons have been drawn between Pridi and Wahid in the way
that both used non-violent strategies to fight for democracy in
their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
Wahid arrived here Tuesday afternoon and paid a courtesy call
on Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej. He will leave here for home
Thursday, ending his three-day official visit to Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Medical Mission Delivers Items to Hostages in Sulu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A Philippine government medical
mission led by Sulu Provincial Health Officer Nelsa Amin has
successfully delivered needed relief items to the 21 hostages
being kept by Abu Sayyaf terrorists in Patikul, Sulu, reports
reaching here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have delivered the relief goods, clothing and foodstuff to
the 21 hostages kept in a forested area in Patikul, Sulu, and
found them all well," Amin was quoted by Philippine News Agency as
saying upon completion of their delivery mission at noon Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Amin, however, said not all members of their group saw the
hostages since only former Libyan Ambassador Abdulaziz Rajab
Azarouq was allowed to enter the Abu Sayyaf lair where the 21
hostages are being kept.
</P>
<P>
"We found out that the German woman, Renata Waler, is okay,"
Amin added. The German woman is reportedly suffering from cardio-
pulmonary disease and hypertension and needs immediate medical
attention.
</P>
<P>
Azarouq was allowed to talk with the Abu Sayyaf leader, a
certain Abu Pula, a medical practitioner turned Abu Sayyaf
commander, Amin said.
</P>
<P>
According to Amin, Pula was once employed by the Integrated
Public Provincial Hospital in Sulu as a member of the Barefoot
Doctors for the Villages Program of the Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
The 21 hostages were abducted from Malaysian resort island of
Sipadan on April 23.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) invests
monthly more than 1 million U.S. dollars in Angola's basic health
service, according to the EU representative to Angola Antonio
Cardoso Mota.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference marking the EU's Day, May 9, Mota said
that 50 percent of the costs of the operations being carried out
by the World Food Program (WFP) in Angola are covered by his
institution.
</P>
<P>
Humanitarian assistance, training of personnel, food security
and the reinforcement of bilateral cooperation are the priorities
of the EU's aid to this southwest African country.
</P>
<P>
In the field of basic health operations, EU is currently
engaged in the vaccination campaign against measles, a disease
regarded as the third cause of the infant mortality in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Mota also showed EU's great interest in the fisheries in
Angola. A second round of talks on fisheries between the two sides
will take place next week in Luanda.
</P>
<P>
To this end, an EU delegation is expected in Luanda from
Brussels to discuss with the local authorities the modalities for
the accord.
</P>
<P>
The precursor of the EU was established in Paris on May 9, 1950
under an accord of partnership between France and Germany in the
field of exploration of coal and steel, and the main industries.
</P>
<P>
The accord later was backed by Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands
and Luxemburg, which made up the first six countries that
subscribed the creation of the European Community.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Rally of China will be replaced
by the Rally of Cyprus in this season's world championship
calendar, the International Automobile Federation (FIA) announced
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The World Motor Sport Council has approved by fax vote that
the Rally of Cyprus will replace the Rally of China in the 2000
FIA World Rally Championship calendar," the motor sport's ruling
body said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The China Rally was axed from the calendar at an FIA hearing
last month after sponsors pulled out. The British-American
Tobacco (China), which had sponsored the race for the past four
years, decided not to sponsor this year's race and the organizers
failed to find new sponsors before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time that Cyprus's rally has featured as
part of the world championship.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the Rally of Cyprus will be based
in Nicosia from September 7-10, sandwiched between Finland and
Corsica.

KUALA LUMPUR, May 10 (Xinhua) -- World mixed doubles champion
Ra Kyung Min of South Korea, who had injured her thigh at a
national competition in April, will miss the Uber Cup Finals
starting here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ra, who paired with Kim Dong-moon in the world championship in
Denmark last May, strained ligament in her right thigh in a women'
s singles game at the domestic tournament.
</P>
<P>
Her absence severely crashed South Korea's hope of blooming in
the Uber Cup after their second-place finish in the Asian Zone
qualifying competition. They are bracketed with China, Sweden and
the Netherlands in the same group.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's head coach Kwon Seung Taik said Ra, who is
staying in hospital in South Korea, needed three weeks to recover.
"Ra is peaking for the Sydney Olympic Games in September," Kwon
said.
</P>
<P>
Ra and Kim could be South Korea's major challenge to Chinese
top mixed pair Liu Yong and Ge Fei for the Olympic gold in Sydney.

<HEADLINE> WTO Access to Improve China's Economic Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and foreign experts
attending a forum on Developing Countries &AMP; the World Trade
Organization (WTO) believe that China's admission into the WTO
will accelerate the adjustment of the country's economic structure.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Hanlin, executive vice chairman and secretary general of
the WTO Research Institute, noted that the proportion of
agriculture, manufacturing, and tertiary industries in China's
gross domestic product (GDP) will be changed after China enters
the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, who is also a professor at Beijing's University of
International Business and Economics, said that tertiary industry
is replacing manufacturing as the criteria for judging a country's
modernization.
</P>
<P>
In China, the proportion of tertiary industry accounts for 39
percent of the country's GDP, far below the world average of 61
percent, Zhang noted, adding that 38 percent of China's labor
force is employed in tertiary industry, compared with 50 percent
in some developed countries and 75 percent in the United States.
</P>
<P>
He called for a change in employment structure, and reform in
the education and training sectors to prepare for the challenges
brought about by WTO admission.
</P>
<P>
Charles Changming Yan, general manager of the Alumni Consulting
Center of Cadavisa International Consulting Inc., a Canadian firm,
called on Chinese enterprises to learn advanced management
experience from abroad and establish a complete and rational
management mechanism to prepare for the upcoming challenges.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Chinese enterprises to set their eyes not only on
the domestic market, but also on the international market.
</P>
<P>
As a country with 870 million rural people, Yan added, China
should stimulate the development of small towns to absorb the
surplus rural labor force, and produce more value-added
agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, China had 55,000 small towns, and some 10,
000 more small towns will be created to further enhance the
development of the rural economy.
</P>
<P>
Wang Kangmao, a fellow with the National University of
Singapore, called on the Chinese government to focus on the
construction of high-tech industrial parks, to produce new goods,
and commercialize scientific and technological achievements.
</P>
<P>
Special attention should be paid to upgrading the level of
China's computer and manufacturing industries, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The forum was held during the ongoing China International High-
Tech Industries Week which opened in Beijing on Monday.

BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The first Internet laboratory in
China is under construction at Qinghua University in Beijing, one
of the country's most prestigious universities.
</P>
<P>
The lab is designed for the study of Internet content to
provide information and offer advice to China's electronic media.
</P>
<P>
A book on the on-line journalism compiled by Qinghua University
will be published later this year, the first of its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
"We should never miss an opportunity which may occur only once
in a thousand years," said Zhao Qizheng, director of the
Information Office of the State Council, at a seminar on media
communication via the Internet held at Qinghua today.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that China has been left behind in some areas since
the first industrial revolution, and this is a a rare chance for
China to begin even with the developed countries in developing and
applying Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people began to have access to the Internet in 1994,
and the number of Chinese citizens who use the Internet
skyrocketed to nearly 10 million only five years later.
</P>
<P>
"A decade ago, the Internet was used by scientists for data and
discussions," according to Zhou Guangzhao, former president of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). "Today, it has become a
necessary tool for journalists, who report on deadline," he said
</P>
<P>
Wang Yan, general manager of Sina, the largest news website in
China, compared the Internet with the steam engine, saying that
when the Internet is combined with the traditional media it can
play a much more efficient role in mass communication.
</P>
<P>
Sina, along with the Legend Group, the largest computer
manufacturer in China, will cooperate with Qinghua University in
developing electronic media and Internet content and training
editors and reporters for the electronic media.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 scholars and experts from China and abroad

<HEADLINE> Profits of State-owned Enterprises Soar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A big jump in state-owned
enterprise (SOE) profits pushed up the overall profitability of
Chinese industrial enterprises in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Figures released here today by the National Bureau of
Statistics (NBS) show that net profits of SOEs was 27.28 billion
yuan, 6.6 times that of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
From January to March, losses of SOEs dropped by 0.9 percent
from the same period last year to 30.78 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The higher profitability of the SOEs was based on improved
efficiency of capital input. By the end of the first quarter, the
total amount of capital used for finished products was 0.9 percent
smaller than one year ago.
</P>
<P>
The figures also show that the overall index of profitability
of all industrial enterprises in the country jumped by 13.9 points
to 99.2 points in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Net profits of industrial enterprises totaled 55.41 billion
yuan, 1.6 times that of the same 1999 period, and losses dropped
by 2.9 percent to 44.33 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In the first quater, sales of industrial enterprises grew to 1.
658.49 trillion yuan, 19.6 percent more than a year ago. Taxes
from these enterprises grew by 14.3 percent over last year to 108.
45 billion yuan, and taxes paid by SOEs jumped by 13.4 percent to
79.64 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> China's Coal Sector Trying to Turn Loss into Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China is planning to expand coal
exports and cut coal production this year in a bid to ease the
country's large domestic coal stockpile and achieve a balance
between coal supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
According to Shi Wanpeng, vice-minister of the State Economic
and Trade Commission, China has eased the situation of coal supply
exceeding demand in some parts of the country. Coal prices rose
moderately and coal exports climbed month by month, he added.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a televised telephone conference held here today,
the senior official said that in the first four months this year,
China exported 15.99 million tons of coal, representing an
increase of 4.9 million tons compared with the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The coal sector is showing a favorable growth trend and the
government's policy of cutting coal production and closing down
illegal small coal mines is paying off, the official stressed.
</P>
<P>
China reduced annual coal output to 1.1 billion tons last year
by cutting 250 million tons of coal production, which will be
further reduced to less than 900 million tons this year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, large state-owned coal enterprises will produce
according to market demand, and take steps to adjust product mix
and lower production costs.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that expanding coal exports is of great
significance for the sustainable development of the country's coal
industry, which can help reduce coal stockpile and achieve balance
between coal supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the expansion of coal exports will make the
country's coal sector more open to the rest of the world, and help
turn the coal sector from extensive to intensive in terms of
management and operation.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's largest coal producer, accounting for one
third of the world's coal output. However, the country exports
only 34 million tons of coal annually, amounting to merely six
percent of the world's total coal trade.
</P>
<P>
The official said that China is set to tap the huge potential
for coal exports, targeted at 38 million tons this year.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Third-Round Senate Election Date Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The third round of Thailand's first
senate election in history is to be held on June 4 if necessary,
provided the result of the second round can be announced by May 15,
Thailand News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An election commissioner was quoted as saying that the
tentative date has been set although it could be put off by a
further two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The election commission has on Tuesday endorsed 22 of the 78
winners in the second round of senate elections in 35 provinces.
Among them, 11 were suspended winners in the first round.
</P>
<P>
The commission expects to complete its consideration of
election results in the remaining provinces by May 13.
</P>
<P>
Thais voted for the second time on April 29 for a new senate
after 78 of 200 winners in the country's first senate election on
March 4 found to have won dishonestly.
</P>
<P>
Though criticized for the expenditure in the second round of
election, the commission said it would choose to hold elections
again and again rather than let even one cheat go to parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government is expected to discuss with the commission
this week on ways to address political hurdles, following a recent
ruling of the constitution court that an incomplete senate cannot
function, stalling the debut of the newly-elected senate, as well
as other legislative procedures, as the parliament is scheduled to
be reconvened on June 24.
</P>
<P>
The commission, however, pledged that official results of the
third round of the senate poll, if any, would be known before the
reconvention of the Lower House.
</P>
<P>
The March 4 election was widely seen as the first test of the
country's political reform under its 1997 constitution, which
seeks to foster democracy and clean up politics.
</P>
<P>
The election marked the first time since the country adopted
constitutional rule in 1932 that senators had been elected rather
than appointed.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Share prices plunged to a two-
week low on Singapore Stock Market Wednesday dragged down by
overnight sharp losses on Wall Street and hit by selling on
financial stocks.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) dropped 32.26 points to
close at 2,057.22, maintaining a downturn trend for the whole day.
</P>
<P>
The total volume increased to 464.59 million shares worth 555.1
million Singapore dollars (about 320.92 million U.S. dollars).
Declining issues overwhelmed advancers by 215 to 113 with 209
counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The largest block was a 57.58 million parcel by Nucleus which
was transacted at 0.57 Singapore dollars per share. Chew EuHock
was the second most heavily traded stock with a turnover of 44.19
million units. Medi-Rab was the next with 25.07 million counters
changing hands.

buying sentiment.
</P>
<P>
Dealers sold interest rate-sensitive stocks on fear of higher
domestic rates, especially if the U.S. Federal Reserve raises the

<HEADLINE> Luxembourg Freezes Abacha Accounts Totalling $600 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Eight bank accounts in excess of 600
million U. S. dollars alleged to be owned by Nigeria's late head
of state Sani Abacha in a Luxembourg subsidiary of an unnamed
foreign bank have been frozen, a leading Nigerian newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report by "The Post Express" quoted Luxembourg deputy state
 prosecutor Georges Heisbourg as saying that the money was
deposited in the name of different offshore oil companies
operating in Nigeria during Abacha administration from 1993 to
1998.
</P>
<P>
The freezing of the accounts came after an investigation,
conducted by Luxembourg officials at the request of the Nigerian
government, found that two of Abacha's sons profited from the
companies.
</P>
<P>
Heisbourg said searches had been carried out and the case would
soon be sent to the Nigerian government.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the freezing of the accounts, Nigerian
presidential spokesman Doyin Okupe said: "if this is true it is
excellent news."
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo has made repeated calls
for repatriation of the country's wealth illegally stashed abroad
by the Abacha administration, since his coming into power last May
after the long-term military rule of the country.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that more than 4.3 billion U.S. dollars were
stolen from Nigeria by the late General Abacha and his associates.
Among the amount, 2. 3 billion dollars were taken directly from
the country's treasury and one billion dollars from contracts
Abacha awarded to himself but which were either partially executed
or not done at all, while another one billion dollars were
extorted from contractors.

LAGOS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone has urged Britain to
commit combat troops to enforce peace and stop the deteriorating
situation resulted from the abduction of the United Nations
peacekeepers in the west African country, the British Broadcasting
Corporation reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Sierra Leonean Information Minister Julius
Spencer as saying that the British military intervention would
bring a swift end to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"If the British government and British military provide
significant support with men and materials to the UN force, the
whole situation will change very quickly," said Spencer.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Britain should take the lead in ending
"major discrimination" against African countries when it comes to
peacekeeping, saying the Sierra Leone public expected much more
than what the British seem to be giving.
</P>
<P>
Britain has sent paratroopers to evacuate Britons and other
nationals from Sierra Leone but has stressed that its troops are
there only to secure the safety of evacuees.

<HEADLINE> 40 Tons of Illegal Sugar Impounded in Tanzanian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania Revenue
Authority (TRA) in Dar es Salaam has impounded a total of 40 tons
of sugar valued at 20 million Tanzanian shillings (about 25,000
U.S. dollars), which were being imported into the country
illegally, newspapers here reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The sugar was seized in three different incidents following
patrols mounted by TRA between April 26 and May 7, the
Commissioner for Customs and Excise George Lauwo was quoted as
saying on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Two suspects were arrested in connection with the contraband,
said the official.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, in the first incident, about 6.8 tons
of sugar was impounded in Temeke District in Dar es Salaam suburb
on April 26.
</P>
<P>
Following that, customs officials seized 25 tons and 7.5 tons
of sugar respectively on April 29 and May 7 in the city's coastal
Kinondoni District.
</P>
<P>
To meet the increasing domestic demand, some Tanzanian sugar
importers are channeling consignments evading tax through the
Indian Ocean islands of Zanzibar, from where it is taken to
Tanzanian mainland through unofficial entry points on the
country's porous 1,000-kilometer coastline.
</P>
<P>
Sugar experts say the government loses about 21 billion
shillings (about 26.3 million U.S. dollars) a year in revenue from
local illegal sugar importers.

ATHENS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The flame that will burn at the
Sydney Olympics was ignited Wednesday in a ceremony in the ancient
birthplace of the games.
</P>

Cloudy conditions prevented the flame from being lit in a

handed over May 20 to the Sydney organizers in a special ceremony
in Athens' all-marble Panathenaic stadium, where the first modern
Olympiad was held in 1896.
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony that for the first time included men, the
priestesses carried the flame in an urn about 100 meters through
the ruins of Ancient Olympia, about 325 kilometers southwest of
Athens.
</P>
<P>
Two men blew horns to announce the flame was lit. A young girl
then released a dove symbolizing peace as Papacostas ran out of
the stadium where athletes competed from 776 B.C. to 394.
</P>
<P>
In Greece, it will travel 2,550 kilometers through 207 cities,
towns and villages before starting its trip to the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Michael Knight, the president of the Sydney Olympic Committee,
said: "Indeed, when the flame reaches Australian soil it will not
only signify the real start of the Australian Olympic games, but
it will also ignite a celebration of Australia and what it means
to be Australian."
</P>
<P>
After leaving Athens, the torch is scheduled to land May 22 in
Guam to commence the Oceania leg, which will see it touch down in
11 South Pacific nations.
</P>
<P>
On May 29, the torch will cross the international date line
when it visits Vanuatu and Samoa. It will then travel to American
Samoa and the Cook Islands before crossing back over the dateline
en route to Fiji and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The final leg of the relay will begin June 8 when it lands at
Uluru, also known as Ayers Rock, in the Australian Outback. In the
northern state of Queensland, the flame was expected to be carried
underwater for three minutes by a scuba diver on the Great Barrier
Reef. It will remain alight using a special underwater-burning
fuel.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Lin Laibao was executed today in
the city of Shanwei in south China's Guangdong Province for
trafficking in women, in accordance with a court ruling.
</P>
<P>
Lin was first sentenced to death on July 8, 1999 by the
Intermediate People's Court of Shanwei after being found guilty of
trading women under the pretext of providing jobs. Lu Guixiang,
Lin's wife, was given a 12-year prison term for aiding Lin in his
crime.
</P>
<P>
The two later lodged appeals with the Guangdong Provincial
Higher People's Court which concluded after extensive
investigation that Lin's death sentence should be carried out and
Lu's 12-year imprisonment should be upheld.
</P>
<P>
A court verdict said that from March 1995 to August 1998, Lin
collaborated with Lu and Sun Mutong, lured 14 women from areas
outside Guangdong Province under the pretext of offering them jobs,
and then sold them for profit.
</P>
<P>
Sun Mutong was dealt with separately.

<HEADLINE> China Steps Up Legal Administration Of Coal Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China is launching a massive
nationwide drive to strengthen legal administration of coal
production and management in a bid to ensure safe production and
rational exploitation of coal resources.
</P>
<P>
The current drive focuses on coal development plans, approval
systems for the establishment of coal mines, the issuing of coal
production permits, safe production, and special protection for
coal miners, according to a nationwide televised telephone
conference held here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Baoming, director of the State Administration of Coal
Industry, said that the legal administration of coal production
and management is an important means for ensuring sound
development of the coal industry, adding that China is the world's
largest coal producer and consumer, and the coal sector accounts
for 75 percent of the country's energy resources production and
consumption.
</P>
<P>
However, in some parts of the country there is still rampant
illegal mining of coal resources, overall waste, accidents leading
to injuries and deaths, coal mines being damaged, and irregular
transportation and marketing of coal products.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China is taking active measures to
cut coal production and reduce huge stockpiles in a bid to strike
a balance between coal supply and demand and keep annual coal
output within 900 million tons this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Baoming, director of the State
Administration of the Coal Industry, China has so far closed down
33,000 illegal small coal mines nationwide, and cut coal
production by 300 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a televised telephone conference here today, the
senior official said the coal supply exceeds demand in the country
at present, causing serious losses in the sector.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China is planning to close down another 18,900
small coal mines this year and cut coal production by 120 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
In addition, large state-owned coal enterprises will take steps
to produce according to market demand, adjust their product mix,
and lower production costs in a bid to turn losses into profits.
</P>
<P>
So far, effective results have been scored in the provinces and
autonomous regions of Shanxi, Henan, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Guizhou,
Inner Mongolia, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and other coal-producing areas.

<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China's top think tank, the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), has established a web page to
combat cults and expose their evil intentions and activities.
</P>
<P>
The web page covers six parts, such as the theories of Marxism,
atheism, and materialism, analysis and exposure of the Falun Gong
cult, and a general survey of cults in other countries.
</P>
<P>
Most of the content at the page, containing 540,000 Chinese
words, has been written or compiled by scholars and experts with
the CASS.
</P>
<P>
The research fellows at the academy already make public their
up-to-date studies through their website: www.cass.net.cn.
</P>
<P>
According to CASS sources, the monthly hits for the website
have reached more than 500,000.
</P>
<P>
China has been waging a prolonged campaign against Falun Gong,
an evil cult that has disturbed social stability, swindled people'
s money, and resulted in many deaths among its practitioners.
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily, the leading newspaper in China, published a
story Tuesday about how Falun Gong members organized subversive
activities in the national capital on the eve of the last Spring
Festival, along with a commentary warning not to treat Falun Gong

<HEADLINE> Local Lawmakers Trained for Implementation of Legislation Law (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- To promote the faithful
implementation of the Legislation Law which will take effect on
July 1 this year, a five-day training program began here today for
local officials in charge of legislative affairs in provinces,
regions, and major cities.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the National People's Congress Standing
Committee, told those attending the program today that lawmaking
itself should also be regulated by law to ensure that laws are of
the people, and the unity of China's legal system is maintained.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978, which marked the beginning of China's reform and
opening up, the national legislature has promulgated 375 laws, in
addition to formulating the nation's fourth Constitution in 1982
and amending it three times, the top lawmaker said.
</P>
<P>
With another 800 administrative regulations formulated by the
State Council and more than 7,000 local legislative items, a legal
framework with Chinese characteristics has come into being over
the years, he said.
</P>
<P>
The promulgation and implementation of the legislation law is
of important significance to the standardization of lawmaking
activities and improvement of the country's legal system, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the new law, local legislation must never
contravene the Constitution and the national laws, he said.

<HEADLINE> Victory Achieved in Fight Against Falun Gong Cult (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China's official news agency Xinhua
released an article today reviewing the country's year-long
campaign against the Falun Gong cult.
</P>
<P>
The article said that under the leadership of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, the Chinese people have
achieved a decisive victory in the fight against the Falun Gong
cult headed by Li Hongzhi.
</P>
<P>
The victory has greatly raised the political vigilance of the
nation, saved and protected a large number of the cheated,
punished the evil, and maintained the social stability of the
country.
</P>
<P>
"This has been a major political struggle that has bearing on
our country's future. It has also been a big promotion of the
scientific world outlook of Marxism," it said.
</P>
<P>
The article said that directed by Li Hongzhi, over 10,000 Falun
Gong practitioners illegally gathered outside the Zhongnanhai
government compound in Beijing on April 25, 1999.
</P>
<P>
In addition to spreading fallacies like "earth explosion" and "
Doomsday," Li and his followers purposely exerted pressure on the
Party and government.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core
took decisive measures to bring an end to the illegal gathering
and expose Falun Gong's anti-science, anti-human, anti-society,
and anti-government evil face.
</P>
<P>
In July, the CPC Central Committee publicized its decision on
dealing with the Falun Gong cult. The Ministry of Civil Affairs
outlawed the Falun Dafa Study Society and its Falun Gong
organization, and the Ministry of Public Security issued a warrant
for the arrest of Li Hongzhi.

<P>
The decision of the CPC and the government received the support
of all ethnic groups in the country, and a nationwide campaign
against Falun Gong was waged in all parts of China.
</P>
<P>
After reeducation, over 98 percent of all Falun Gong
practitioners saw through the reactionary nature of Falun Gong and
severed their links with the organization.
</P>
<P>
This victory broke up the Falun Gong cult and isolated the die-
hards headed by Li Hongzhi, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong has brought enormous harm to the Chinese people.
Over 1,500 people died as a result of practicing it, and over 600
people were diagnosed with mental disorders.
</P>
<P>
In October 1999, the Standing Committee of the National People'
s Congress passed and promulgated a decision to outlaw and prevent
cults and cult activities. The Supreme People's Court and the
Supreme People's Procuratorate also made public their
interpretations concerning laws dealing with cult crimes.
</P>
<P>
On December 26, 1999, the No. 1 Intermediate People's Court of
Beijing sentenced four Falun Gong core members to imprisonment on
charges of undermining implementation of the law, causing death as
a result of preaching, and illegally obtaining state secrets.
</P>
<P>
By March 25 of this year, the courts at various levels had
handled 91 Falun Gong cases, with 84 persons punished and 15
others exempted from punishment.

The article notes that cults have been a major social problem
facing all countries, and China's fight against Falun Gong is a
part of the international community's struggle.
</P>
<P>
According to incomplete statistics, there are over 3,000 cults
in the world with many million practitioners. Anti-human, anti-
society and anti-science has been the essential feature of the
cults.
</P>
<P>
The latest cult incident in the African country of Uganda
resulted in 530 practitioners burning themselves to death. The
culprit proved to a cult called "Movement of Restoration of Ten
Commandments of God".
</P>
<P>
The article said that in the fight against the Falun Gong cult,
the CPC Central Committee has been wise in calling for the
promotion of science and technology and the strengthening of
ideological work.
</P>
<P>
The reason so many people were cheated by Li Hongzhi and his
followers is that the practitioners lacked scientific knowledge
and a correct world outlook to see through the fallacies spread by
Li Hongzhi.
</P>
<P>
Now, more and more people in China have once again realized the
importance of scientific knowledge and plunged themselves into
learning science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The article notes that despite their defeat, Li Hongzhi and his
followers refuse to resign themselves to it, and will continue to
make trouble at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The fight will be a prolonged and complicated one, and the
Chinese people are determined to carry through their fight against
the Falun Gong cult, the article concluded.

Hishammuddin who returned unopposed as head of the movement
said the performance of Malays in science and mathematics was
still not satisfactory and hence there should be increased efforts
to improve their position in the field of education.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern over the low command of English among
Malay students during the present IT era for over 80 percent of
information and knowledge in the Internet is in English.
</P>
<P>
"In our determination to uphold the sovereignty of the National
Language, efforts to improve the command of English should be seen
in the context of acquiring knowledge so that our race will not be
left behind," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He pledged the UMNO Youth Movement will make efforts to expand
the Malay middle class society in the country and help in efforts
to develop the talents of young Malay entrepreneurs so that they
would be actively involved in small and medium scale industries
and in franchise and other business programs.
</P>
<P>
Malay race is Malaysia's largest race accounting for more than
half of some 22 million population.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A Malaysian senator Wednesday
urged ASEAN countries to enhance cooperation in the field of
expanding knowledge and seeking new technologies.
</P>
<P>
Such cooperation would enable the countries in this region to
be more competitive in the economic field and also be able to
compete globally, senator Abdul Aziz Abdul Rahmanhe said in the
Senate, Bernama news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The senator proposed that Malaysia forge closer cooperation
with India in the field of computer technology as India is a
leader in this field, saying this would help Malaysia to make a
success of its Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC), a 50 by 15
kilometer area specially designed for hi-tech development.
</P>
<P>
He was of the view that Malaysia should use Western knowledge

<HEADLINE> Donors Urged to Give African Countries Relief Aid Generously </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) has urged both independent and government donors to
give relief aid more generously for the millions of starving
populations in countries of the Horn of Africa and other part of
the African continent.
</P>
<P>
A UNICEF press release available Wednesday said that millions
of dollars of additional support is needed to save the lives of
children this summer and to lessen the impact of future droughts.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy was quoted as saying
that donors should remember that in addition to Ethiopia, five
other countries in east Africa -- Djibouti, Eritrea, Kenya,
Somalia and Sudan -- are also affected by the drought.
</P>
<P>
The stated countries are also in need of rapid international
assistance, Bellamy stressed.
</P>
<P>
Close to 16 million people in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti,
Kenya, Sudan, Somalia as well as Uganda are facing starvation
after years of drought, the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID) reported in early March.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNICEF, it has in the past 15 years spent 50
million U. S. dollars on water projects in Ethiopia alone,
resulting in nearly 2,000 new or expanded water systems and
directly improving the lives of as many as one million people.
</P>
<P>
Over the same years, the UN specialized agency also spent more
than 150 million U.S. dollars on health programs providing
Ethiopia with almost 100 percent of the vaccines it uses to
immunize children against diseases.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- UBS shares will begin trading on the
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on May 16, 2000 under the symbol
UBS, the Swiss bank announced Wednesday in the Swiss city of
Zurich.
</P>
<P>
UBS is the first non-U.S. financial services group to list its
Global Registered Share directly on the NYSE, UBS said. The
listing will give UBS easier access to U.S. investors and provides
it with the strategic flexibility to benefit from potential
expansion opportunities in the United States. UBS will have a
global share traded in Zurich, New York and Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
"We are delighted to be able to list in New York so soon after
announcing our intention. A globally traded share is symbolic of
UBS as a global firm," said UBS Group CEO Marcel Ospel. "Our U.S.
listing will give us the strategic flexibility to benefit from
potential expansion opportunities in the U.S."
</P>
<P>
NYSE chairman and CEO Richard A. Grasso said, "as a leader in
global business, it is fitting that UBS will be the first company
to issue global shares in this new millennium. This move
solidifies its position as an innovator dedicated to customer
commitment. We are proud and privileged to welcome UBS to the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> China Accelerates Government GIS Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- It may take months for China, the
world's most populous country, to finish a census through
traditional means, but it may take only several days to do the
same thing if the so-called GIS (geographic information system) is
widely used.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Qingpu, a research fellow with the China Academy of
Surveying and Mapping, showed the prospects for this technology
today at a forum sponsored by the Organizing Committee of the
Third Beijing International High-Tech Week.
</P>
<P>
"Better application of GIS by government departments will help
make timely and better decisions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As part of the efforts to build a 'digital China,' the
government GIS project launched years ago should be accelerated,"
he told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
China started to build a comprehensive GIS for the State
Council in 1992, and the system is expected to be completed by the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, China so far has completed 14 provincial
digital map systems and a number of information systems such as
the basic national situation system and the flood-control and
weather-forecast information service system.

<HEADLINE> State Councilor, Belgian Crown Prince Hail Trade Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua)-- Chinese State Councilor Wu Yi and
visiting Belgian Crown Prince Philippe lauded trade relations
between China and Beligium and expressed optimism for further
development of trade relations at a seminar on port administration
here today.
</P>
<P>
Expressing satisfaction with the development of bilateral
relations, Wu said that cooperation in the fields of politics,
economics and trade, culture, and technology and education have
witnessed substantial progress since the two countries forged
diplomatic ties nearly 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The two countries' economies are highly mutually-complementary
and there is great potential for the development of economic and
trade cooperation, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Belgium has become one of China's most important European
trading partners, she said.
</P>
<P>
China's opening and development will provide more extensive
market opportunities for business circles in various countries
including Belgium, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the Chinese Government has recently made the strategic
decision to develop its western region, and she expressed the hope
Belgian enterprises would seize the opportunities to assume an
active role in the historic undertaking so as to contribute to
bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Prince Philippe, who last visited China four years ago at the
head of a large trade mission, said that his second trip has
brought him keen awareness of the great changes that have since
taken place in China's economy, and that will greatly increase the
interest and confidence of Belgian companies in enhancing
cooperation with their Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Ports administration plays a significant part in the Belgian
economy, he said, adding that he believed the two countries'
operation in this sector will bear fruits, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu and the Belgian Prince also pressed the button at the
opening ceremony for Euro-China-Online (www.ec3286.com), an e-
commerce website dedicated to trade cooperation between China and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Prince Philippe arrived May 5 for a week-long official goodwill
visit at Wu's invitation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 10 (Xinhua) -- An Omani products fair kicked off
here Wednesday, the first of its kind since the U.N. sanctions were
imposed on Iraq in 1990.
</P>
<P>
In a brief speech at the opening ceremony, Iraqi Minister of
Finance Hikmet Mizban Ibrahim Al-Azzawi said Iraq is very
interested in promoting economic cooperation with Oman as well as
with "all Arab countries."
</P>
<P>
The fair, which will last a week, showcases products of food,
medicine, leather, detergent, perfume, daily necessities,
electricity and oil equipment from 22 Omani companies.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries have been improving in
recent years. Oman, one of the six member states of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC), has reopened its embassy in Baghdad,
which was closed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Omani companies have signed contracts worth 33 million U.S.
dollars with Iraq under the U.N. oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations oil-for-food deal, implemented since late
1996, allows Iraq to sell limited amount of oil in every six months
to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Arafat Discuss Palestinian-Israeli Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met
on Wednesday with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat for discussions
of the latest developments in the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
After a tete-a-tete session of talks, Mubarak and Arafat were
joined by their aides, including Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa and Secretary General of the Palestine Liberation
Organization Mahmoud Abbas.
</P>
<P>
Details of the talks were not immediately available. But
Palestinian Ambassador to Egypt Zohdi al Qedra has said that Arafat
would brief Mubarak on his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak last Sunday in the West Bank town of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Arafat would discuss with Mubarak ways of overcoming obstacles
hindering the progress of the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, al
Qedra said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Barak failed in their meeting to find means of
breaking the stalemate in the Palestinian-Israeli final-status
negotiations on the thorniest issues, including Jerusalem, final
borders, settlements and refugees.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak will also be updated on the outcome of Arafat's recent
visits to France and Portugal and his talks with leaders of the two
countries, the Palestinian ambassador added.
</P>
<P>
Portugal holds the rotating presidency of the European Union for
the first half of this year. The 15-nation European bloc and its
member states, especially France, sympathize with Arab countries'
stances in their peace negotiations with Israel and have been
exerting efforts to help push the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's visit to Egypt comes within the context of his constant
coordination and consultations with Mubarak in a bid to remove
difficulties and exchange views on problems facing the peace march,
al Qedra said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here on Tuesday. He frequently visits Cairo to
seek advice on the peace talks from Mubarak, who plays an active
role in mediating the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel in 1979.

<HEADLINE> British MP to Organize Flight to Iraq to Protest U. N. Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 10 (Xinhua) -- British lawmaker George Galloway,
who is currently visiting Iraq, has announced that he will organize
a flight to Baghdad to protest the U.N. embargo on Iraq, the
official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Galloway told INA that he intends to organize a direct flight
from London to Baghdad "in a gesture of solidarity with the Iraqi
people in their resistance to the unjustifiable embargo."
</P>
<P>
There is no legal text banning flights to or from Iraq, said
Galloway.
</P>
<P>
Flights to or from Iraq, according to relevant United Nations
resolutions, must get prior permission from the U.N. Sanctions
Committee, with few exemptions.
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Galloway arrived in Baghdad by plane to protest
the U.N. embargo, becoming the first European to fly to Iraq since
the imposition of sanctions in 1990 following Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Galloway's plan coincided with the announcement Tuesday of the
French priest Jean-Marie Benjamin that he will organize another
flight from Paris to Baghdad by taking a Boeing passenger plane
with some 300 people on board.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin, along with three other people from Italy, arrived in
Baghdad on April 3, becoming the first European group flying to
Iraq without getting prior U.N. permission since 1990.

<HEADLINE> Australia, UK Reach New Crime Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Australia and Britain have widened
an agreement on seizing crime bosses' ill-gotten gains, federal
Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
She said cooperation in investigating, freezing and
confiscating proceeds of crime was now wider than just drug money.
</P>
<P>
"This agreement is a substantial improvement upon an earlier
agreement which was confined to the proceeds of drug-trafficking
offenses," Vanstone said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The profits from drug trafficking are a very significant
target of our proceeds-of-crime laws but we are also keen to
pursue the laundered profits from other serious criminal
activities, such as trafficking in people, and cyber-crime," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Vanstone said confiscating criminal profits was now recognized
worldwide as of vital importance in combating all types of crime
which used profits to expand.
</P>
<P>
"To address any form of organized criminal activity, we need to
focus on the principal organizers - the kingpins - who are
responsible for directing such activity," she said.
</P>
<P>
The best way to track down these kingpins was by following the
money trail, she said.
</P>
<P>
"If you can find the money, you can identify and deal with the
principals behind the crime," she added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Plunges Sharply Into Lowest Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian currency of rupiah
plunges into a lowest level, the worst since mid October last year,
as it traded on Wednesday afternoon at 8,155 rupiah per U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning session, the rupiah started at 8,105 (
buying)and 8,135 (selling) per U.S. dollars or down from the
previous day session trade when it ended at 8,000 (buying) and 8,
080 (selling)against the greenback.
</P>
<P>
The Antara News Agency quoted analysts as saying that the
weakening of the rupiah was triggered by the increase of the U.S.
interest rate and the country's political situation which is still
considered unstable.
</P>
<P>
"It (the weakening of the rupiah) is also due to the slow pace
of the country's economic growth," analysts said.
</P>
<P>
They speculated that the Indonesia's central bank, Bank
Indonesia,may consider to inject the greenback into market to hold
the further fall of the rupiah.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Fact-finding Mission to S.Leone Deferred </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A fact-finding mission of Kenyan
lawmakers and senior officials to Sierra Leone has been put off
indefinitely due to insecurity there.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper Wednesday quoted Minister of State
Julius Sunkuli as saying that the trip was postponed because the
situation in the west African country was so fluid that the plane
from Kenya could not land there.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 U.N. peacekeepers, including 25 Kenyans, have been
held hostage since a week ago by Sierra Leone rebels. One Kenyan
soldier is reportedly still missing.
</P>
<P>
The mission comprising 11 lawmakers and military officers was
scheduled to leave Tuesday for the war-torn Sierra Leone to
collect information about the hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
Sunkuli told the parliament on Tuesday that U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan had assured Kenyan President Daniel
arap Moi that his organization would ensure the safety of the
peacekeeping troops.
</P>
<P>
Some Kenyan lawmakers Tuesday demanded that the government
recall its troops from the troubled country and the United
Nations guarantee their security during evacuation.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government is currently working with the United
Nations to secure the release of the hostages and to find the
whereabouts of the missing Kenyan soldier.

LUANDA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government will restore
the state administration this month at all newly liberated towns
in southeast province of Kuando Kubango, which had been under
control of the rebels led by Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Those localities freed by the Angolan Armed Forces (FAA) in
recent months include Cuangar, Savate, Calai and Jamba, said an

LONDON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Satellite television company British
Sky Broadcasting announced on Wednesday a deal of 301 million
pounds (about 466 million U.S. dollars) to acquire the soccer
website Sports Internet.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, BSkyB said it believed that the all-share
recommended offer would enable BSkyB to occupy "a leading position
in the broadband era."
</P>
<P>
The announcement coincided with publication of BSkyB's interim
results for the nine months ended March 31 -- as well as the
deadline for bids for the lucrative broadcasting rights to
Premiership soccer from 2001.
</P>
<P>
BSkyB already has exclusive broadcasting rights until 2001 to
Premier League soccer and minority stakes in leading soccer clubs.
</P>
<P>
BSkyB won 219,000 new subscribers during the period bringing
the total to 8.623 million and total digital sales were 3.4
million.

<HEADLINE> World's Purest Inbreed-line Pig Developed (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As pigs are similar to humans in terms of organ location in the
body, physiological variation, and metabolism, and scientists
around the world are transplanting modified pig organs into humans.
Britain's PPL Therapeutics, the company that gave the world Dolly
the cloned sheep, developed the world's first cloned pigs,
potentially heralding a breakthrough in animal-to-human organ
transplants.
</P>
<P>
A nine-member group of genetic engineering experts said that
the inbreed-line pigs are superior to cloned pigs because cloned
pigs are merely a replica of a specific cell, and organ
transplants using cloned pigs are subject to harmful gene
reactions.
</P>
<P>
"But the inbreed-line pigs can be likened to a precision
instrument in physics research or pure reagents in chemical
reactions. They serve as highly sensitive and reproductive donor
material," said one expert. Inbreed-line pigs are also ideal donor
animals for testing new drugs to ensure product safety.
</P>
<P>
Overseas medical experts predict that animal-to-human
technology will take an enormous leap forward in the next five
years. China plans to have mass reproduction of inbred-line pigs
and intends to market them next year.
</P>
<P>
An industrial firm in one coastal area recently signed a 23-
million-yuan contract to reproduce inbreed pigs.

MACAO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Edmund Ho Hau Wah, chief executive of
the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR), said here Wednesday
that the government has been taking an active attitude to ensure
the long-term development of financial institutions in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a commercial banking conference, Edmund Ho said
that the Macao government supports and encourages the cooperation
between financial institutions and other economic sectors in Macao.
</P>
<P>
"To great extent, the overall recovery and development of the
local economy depends on the steady expansion of financial
businesses," the chief executive said.
</P>
<P>
Macao was not struck directly by the Asian financial
disturbance which erupted in 1997, but some sectors of its economy,
such as export, tourism and consumption, suffered unavoidable
impacts.
</P>
<P>
Edmund Ho said the conference makes financial institutions have
a better understanding of their role in Macao where the advantages
can be better explored.
</P>
<P>
Macao's advantages lie in the aspects of geographic ties with
other parts of the motherland, historical relations with European
Union countries and Portuguese-speaking countries, fine
telecommunication infrastructure, free trade, free monetary
exchange and low taxation rates.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, the financial institutions will find more
opportunities of cooperation when they seek business partners in
Macao, the chief executive said.
</P>
<P>
Senior representatives from 40 commercial banks were present at
the one-day seminar to explore future collaboration and
development of banking institutions in the Asia-Pacific region.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President and
national chairman of the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) Benjamin
Mkapa has said he will not bow to opposition pressure on how best
to run the government.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a public rally in Zanzibar North Region on Tuesday,
the president said his administration has always reflected and
respected wishes of the people and pledges made by CCM in its
election manifesto and not otherwise, local media reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The president attacked the opposition for launching a smear
campaign to discredit the CCM-controlled Union and Isles
governments by saying that the governments have failed to improve
the welfare of the people.
</P>
<P>
He said in the first place, the opposition parties are free to
air their opinion but the final decision should be made by CCM.
</P>
<P>
The president, who is on a three-day tour of the
semi-autonomous Zanzibar region, cautioned the party members not
to underrate the opposition parties in the forthcoming general
elections to be held simultaneously in Zanzibar and Tanzanian
mainland in October this year.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar joined with mainland Tanganyika to form the United
Republic of Tanzania after a revolt in 1964 that ousted the sultan
and Omani Arabs who ruled the island.

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Rwanda Mass Troops on Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Uganda and Rwanda have massed
troops along their common border after their forces clashed last
Friday in Kisangani, northeast of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC), the New Vision daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Uganda People's Defence Force (UPDF) has been deploying at
Mpaama and Mirama hills since Sunday, the report said, adding that
about 1,000 UPDF troops have maintained positions less than four
kilometers from Kagitumba on the Rwandan side.
</P>
<P>
More UPDF troops have dug trenches at Kizinga, Rushenyi, four
kilometers from Kizinga in Umutara District of Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
It quoted UPDF sources as saying that the Rwanda Patriotic Army
(RPA) on Monday morning ferried troops to reinforce their
Nyamiyonga and Nyabweishongwezi positions about four kilometers
from the border.
</P>
<P>
"We got suspicious when the Rwandan moved their troops close to
the border last week. They ferried in more soldiers on Monday
after we had taken position here," a UPDF source was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwandan on Monday agreed to withdraw their forces
from Kisangani before the end of May. Leaders of both countries

<HEADLINE> Kenya Denies Invasion of White Farms as Political Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has said that
it was wrong to describe the invasion of two white-owned farms as
a political event because it was only an ordinary land dispute.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper Wednesday quoted Head of
Civil Service Richard Leakey as saying that the land dispute
started in 1998, long before the occupation of white-own farms by
war veterans in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Leakey said Tuesday in a statement that the inference by a
Reuters news story that the seizure of a white Kenyan's farm had
followed the recent pattern in Zimbabwe was inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it was entirely misleading to suggest or imply a
racial or political aspect to the land dispute.
</P>
<P>
Basil Criticos, a Kenyan of Greek origin, who is also assistant
minister for Public Works and Housing Ministry, claimed Tuesday
that over 300 families invaded his farm and burned 2,000 acres of
sisal in response to a call by Member of Parliament Stephen Ndichu
that indigenous Kenyans seize all farms owned by foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Criticos also alleged that calls by Minister of State Shariff
Nassir that the government take over unutilized farms for
reallocation to landless Kenyans had instigated the invasion.
</P>
<P>
Another group of 200 squatters families had taken over the land
owned by a foreign company, Criticos said.
</P>
<P>
However, Provincial Commissioner of Coast Province S. Limo said
that squatters had been on the sisal farm for years and Criticos
had never complained.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government on Tuesday reiterated its position that
private and commercial properties are fully protected by the
country's laws and constitution.

<HEADLINE> World's Purest Inbreed-line Pig Developed (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Inbreeding among human beings is
generally acknowledged as detrimental to the successful generation
of positive genetic factors. However, the inbreeding of pigs has
been found to be a successful way of developing pig organs
suitable for transplanting into human beings.
</P>
<P>
Scientists in southwest China's Yunnan Province have
successfully developed pigs born of a sow mated with its own son
or parents, in the same brood, for 18 successive generations. The
number of these inbreed-line pigs has increased to over 400, which
were divided into 18 sub-lines, since the experiment began in a
remote village of Yunnan Province in 1980, said Zeng Yangzhi, a
research fellow in charge of the project.
</P>
<P>
No ill effects from the inbreeding have been recorded in the
inbreed-line pigs. The survival rate of the 17th inbreeding
generation, developed last year, exceeded 80 percent, and no pigs
had deformities, compared with a three percent survival rate in
the early stage of the experiment, he added.
</P>
<P>
Reproduction of two more generations on this basis has marked
the birth of the world's purest pig, that is to say, 98 percent of
their chromosome are identical. The resulting animals are
scientifically called a highly homogeneous pig species
</P>
<P>
"This is an unparalleled result of full-sibbling inbreeding,"
said D. Morgen, a professor at South Dakota State University,
after studying the experiment in Yunnan. D. Morgen has been
engaged in rat and chicken inbreeding research for many years.
</P>
<P>
There is no record of the inbreeding of large mammal for more
than 10 successive generations in elsewhere of the world,
according to the Information Research Institute of the Chinese
Academy of Medical Sciences. The United States and Britain
experimented with the inbreeded-line of 200 pigs, but they had to
give up half way because of poor results, or academically
inbreeding-depression.
</P>
<P>
The success of the Chinese biologists lies in their formulation
of a workable plan and persistence in choosing the beneficial
genes and eliminating the harmful ones in each generation, Zeng
said.

<HEADLINE> Eight Overseas Banks in Shenzhen Granted Yuan Business Permits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Eight overseas banks in Shenzhen
in south China's Guangdong Province have been given licenses to
engage in yuan business in China.
</P>
<P>
They include the Shenzhen branches of the Sanwa Bank and the
Fuji Bank, two Japanese bank branches which have passed testing
conducted by the Shenzhen Central Sub-branch of the People's Bank
of China (PBOC).
</P>
<P>
Sanwa Bank is the second largest bank in Japan. It opened a
representative office in Shenzhen in 1983, and the representative
office was upgraded to bank branch in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Now, Sanwa Bank has four bank branches and two representative
offices in China. Among these branches, the Sanwa Shanghai Branch
was among the first overseas banks granted licensed to do business
in Chinese currency, the yuan, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
China opened yuan business to foreign banks in early 1997 when
the PBOC approved nine foreign banks on an experimental basis in
the Pudong New Area of Shanghai. To date, the PBOC has given yuan
licenses to 32 foreign banks, including 24 in Shanghai and eight
in Shenzhen.

<HEADLINE> Polish Diplomat to Be Acting U.N. Envoy in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Former Polish representative to the
U.N., Zbigniew Wlosowicz, is expected to be appointed as acting U.
N. special representative in Cyprus, the Cyprus Mail newspaper
reported Wednesday, quoting U.N. sources in New York.
</P>
<P>
The term of James Holger of Chile, now acting United Nations
special representative in Cyprus, will expire in June.
</P>
<P>
Wlosowicz, 45, would also be acting chief of the U.N.
peacekeeping force which has been stationed on the island since
1964 and now composed of 1,250 troops and civilian police.
</P>
<P>
Wlosowicz took up his post as Poland's U.N. envoy in February
1993.
For the past two years, he has been a special adviser on
intergovernmental affairs with the U.N. Development Programme.
</P>
<P>
When U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan last year appointed
Alvaro de Soto of Peru as his special adviser on Cyprus, it was
also announced that de Soto would move to Cyprus in spring 2000 as
Annan's special representative.
</P>
<P>
But Annan has now decided that de Soto should remain in New
York, as the secretary-general's special adviser, to involve
himself in the U.N.-sponsored indirect talks on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the tiny island after a failed coup seeking union
with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of indirect talks on Cyprus have been held between
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash, with an aim to prepare the ground for substantive talks
which may lead to a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The next round of talks is scheduled to begin in New York on May
23 but a postponement is likely since Clerides, 81, underwent an
operation last week to remove a polyp from his intestine.

area where the hostages are being held so that they can attend to
the weak and sick.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government hopes the kidnappers would allow
the safe release of two ailing women hostages -- a French and a
German.
</P>
<P>
The government is working for the safe release of 21 hostages,
mostly foreigners, abducted by Abu Sayyaf bandits on April 23 in
Malaysia, and now being kept in Jolo in Sulu.

HARARE, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean white commercial farmers
Tuesday held further talks with war veterans who have occupied
hundreds of their farms to discuss continuing violence on the
farms, The Herald newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But the white farmers failed to win assurances that the

Stewart Dunn, on Sunday after he was attacked by six men at his
farm.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the war veterans Chenjerai Hunzvi told reporters
after the three-hour meeting that the surrender of white-owned
land to blacks was the key to ending the violence.
</P>

"We are making progress, but our aim is to take our land. The
farmers agree we must take some land back," he said.

<P>
The farmers who attended the meeting said there had been no

<HEADLINE> EyePass Introduced in U.S. Airport  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A new technology -- iris
recognition technology -- was introduced Tuesday in the United
States for controlling airline and airport employees access to
restricted areas, sources reaching here reported.
</P>
<P>
The technology, called "EyePass", appears at the Charlotte
Douglas International Airport in North Carolina, marking its first
official introduction in airline and airport environments around
the world.
</P>
<P>
Designed for pilots, flight attendants and airport employees,
the EyePass begins with an enrollment, said Stewart Mann, Chairman
and CEO of EyeTicket Corporation, which designed the new product.
An enrollment occurs only once and consists of a simple digital
picture taken of the iris of the eye with a video camera, then a
one-second glance into a camera gains instant recognition of the
authorized crew members and employees, he said.
</P>
<P>
Eyepass provides the airline industry and airports with a
revolutionary alternative for easing the cumbersome identification
process and ensuring the security and well-being of its customers
and employees, Mann said.

<HEADLINE> Over 2,000 Laid-off Workers Find Jobs in the Countryside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Twenty years ago, country girl Zhang
Xunxiang realized her long-cherished dream of becoming a worker in
a leather factory in the city. Now laid-off Zhang has returned to
the countryside and become rich by raising chickens.
</P>
<P>
Her success has inspired more laid-off workers in her hometown
in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region to return to the
countryside either to raise cattle and sheep or grow vegetables
rather than staying idle in the city.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang Changyuan, assistant to the chairman of the
regional government, more than 2,000 such workers are now working
in the countryside raising livestock and growing vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Zhang was laid-off in 1994 and found it very hard to find a job
in the city. She and her husband decided to go to the countryside
to raise chickens after leaning scientific raising technology.
</P>
<P>
In just one year, they made profits by selling chickens and in
later years helped many of her former colleagues to get rich by
the same means.
</P>
<P>
The regional government also encourages laid-off workers to
work in the countryside, offering them low-interest loans and
reducing various taxes.
</P>
<P>
Huang said in the Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture of Bayingolin
alone, 90 laid-off workers set up 516 "green houses" and produce
nearly 2,000 tons of vegetables and fruits a year, earning a total
of 1.97 million yuan (237,000 U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientist Spots Mistake in Feathered Dinosaur Research (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A prominent Chinese paleontologist
announced here today that a fossil regarded as an important
indication of evolutionary links between dinosaurs and birds is
just a composite of several different fossilized creatures.
</P>
<P>
"The tail of the animal introduced by National Geographic
magazine belongs to a kind of theropod. Therefore, the dinosaur-
like bird is a sheer fiction," said Xu Xing, a Ph.D. with the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) Institute of Vertebrate
Paleontology and Paleoanthropology.
</P>
<P>
In a story titled "Feathers for T. Rex?" in its November 1999
issue, a National Geographic reporter said that "new bird-like
fossils are missing links in dinosaur evolution."
</P>
<P>
Xu's dispute of the fossil called Archaeoraptor liaoningensis
has been accepted by the National Geographic Society in the United
States which publishes the magazine.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the society recently acknowledged their mistake
publicly.
</P>
<P>
"The dispute aroused the close attentions of people both within
and without academic circles," Xu said.
</P>
<P>
Excavated from a layer dated at 120 million years ago in
northeast China's Liaoning Province, the fossil was smuggled out
of China and sold to the Dinosaur Museum in Blanding, Utah.
</P>
<P>
Several world-famous scientists supported the research carried
out by Stephen Czerkas, curator of the museum.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference organized by National Geographic for the
new find, Xu and his colleague Wang Yuanqing, a researcher of the
CAS institute, had the opportunity to closely observe the specimen
and were suspicious of the fossil, which is broken between the
bird's body and the tail.

<P>
"Although broken fossils are common in the field," Xu said, "
when it was bought by Czerkas it lost much valuable archaeological
information."
</P>
<P>
"Smugglers often manufacture fake fossils for economic gains,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Researchers believe the fossil pieces were glued together by
smugglers doing illegal business in China.
</P>
<P>
In November last year, Xu and other researchers happened to
find a fossilized creature which has the same tail as the so-
called Archaeoraptor liaoningensis. After careful study, Xu
reported his find to the National Geographic Society.
</P>
<P>
Czerkas tried to find solid support for an evolutionary
relationship between dinosaurs and birds, which became a hot topic
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"This fossil is perhaps the best evidence since Archaeopteryx
that birds did, in fact, evolve from certain types of carnivorous
dinosaurs," Czerkas was quoted as saying by National Geographic.
</P>
<P>
Global scientists have been disputing the dinosaur-bird
relationship for more then 100 years.
</P>
<P>
The find of a feathered dinosaur, Sinosauropteryx, from the
same place in Liaoning stimulated another round of heated
discussion.
</P>
<P>
National Geographic and the British academic journal Nature
published reports and thesis on the topic several times.
</P>
<P>
Dong Zhiming, an authoritative dinosaur expert and also a
researcher at the CAS institute, said, "All scientific discoveries
must be based on real evidence."
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chinese scientists have once again proposed an
effective international ban on fossil exporting and smuggling.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Not to Be Tested for Legionnaire's Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard Wednesday said he does not need to be tested for
Legionnaires' disease despite the confirmation that federal
Finance Minister John Fahey had been infected.
</P>
<P>
A Liberal Party function was held at the source of the outbreak
of the disease, the Melbourne Aquarium, although it is not yet
known if Fahey caught the disease at that time.
</P>
<P>
Howard, who attended the function with his wife Janette, said
there is no need for him to be tested.
</P>
<P>
"But I am fine, I've not been tested for it, I don't have any
of the symptoms," he told Sydney radio 2BL.
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't tested, I don't need to be, I'm very well and I'm
fighting fit on every front," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Fahey issued a statement saying that on medical advice
he would be spending the next few days at home.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to make a full recovery and be back at work in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 people have been identified with Legionnaires'
disease following an outbreak in Melbourne last month. Two elderly
women died after contracting the disease.

<P>
At the same time, the price of a 50 gram packet of roll-your-
own tobacco has increased by 1.5 U.S. dollars to between 7.2 and 9.
6 U.S.dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion reported Wednesday that the price increase was a
tightly guarded secret till the New Zealand Government introduced
the bill Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, entitlements to duty free cigarettes are also
being cut from June 7, people entering New Zealand will be allowed
to bring in one carton of 200 cigarettes duty free, rather than
two.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper quoted New Zealand Finance
Minister Michael Cullen as saying the tobacco price increase will
add an extra 9.6 million U.S. dollars to the government's coffers
this financial year and an extra 52.8 million U.S. dollars next
year.
</P>
<P>
He added the bill is aimed at promoting health. "A 2 percent
increase in the price level is roughly equivalent to a 1 percent
decrease in the level of consumption is my understanding," the
minister said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The New York Knicks Tuesday edged
Miami Heat 82-76 in Miami to even the best-of-seven series at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
New York built an 18-point lead midway through the fourth
quarter and withstood a late Miami charge.
</P>
<P>
Game 3 will be on Friday at Madison Square Garden of New York.
</P>
<P>
The Knicks shot 26 percent in the first half and still led by
four. They finally pulled away in the third quarter and held on to
negate the Heat's homecourt advantage.
</P>
<P>
Ewing and Charlie Ward had 13 points each for the Knicks, who
had six players in double figures.
</P>
<P>
Jamal Mashburn had 25 points for the Heat, who shot just 34
percent. Alonzo Mourning added 17 points and 17 rebounds. Tim
Hardaway had 13 points and three assists in 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
After Miami closed to 51-50 late in the third period, New York
went on a 21-4 run. Three-pointers by Ward and Chris Childs
sparked the spurt that gave the Knicks a 72-54 lead with seven
minutes to go.
</P>
<P>
Miami staged a 13-2 run to close to 78-67 with 2 1/2 minutes
left, but Ewing hit a follow and two free throws to clinch the win.
</P>
<P>
The Heat held their last lead at 13-12 before New York scored
11 consecutive points.
</P>
<P>
In Portland, Oregon, Trail Blazers outclassed Jazz 103-85 and
led best-of-seven series 2-0.
</P>
<P>

12 points.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Govt to Involve Army Against Guerrillas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has decided
to station Royal Nepal Army in guerrillas affected districts to
ensure public security, the Kathmandu Post Wednesday quoted a
government official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The government has decided to station army personnel in 5 to
6 districts," Minister for Information and Communication Jay Gupta
told local reporters Tuesday in Banke district in mid-western
Nepal. "It is an important decision taken by the government to
make people feel safer."
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time for the army to be stationed to
deal with the ultra-leftist insurgency that has claimed in the
past four years over 1,300 lives, including police, guerrillas and
civilians.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ultra-leftist guerrillas have been active for
the last four years and police are not trained enough to confront
with the ultras. "That's why we in line with the decision of
National Defense Council have decided to station army in these
areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gupta did not name the districts where the army will be
stationed, but said that the army would go to "such areas that are
most prone to guerrillas activities."
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas are most active in mid-western districts such as
Rukum, Jajarkot, Dolpa, Rolpa, Kalikot and Surkhet.
</P>
<P>
However, the decision to involve the army is under fire from
some political parties, which argued strongly for peaceful
solution of the guerrillas issue.

<P>
CANBERRA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Another boatload of suspected
illegal immigrants has been intercepted off Australia's northwest
coast, Justice and Customs Minister Amanda Vanstone said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The boat, carrying 66 people of Middle-Eastern origin and six
Indonesian crew, was spotted by a customs coast watch aircraft off
the Ashmore Islands.
</P>
<P>
It is now being escorted to the mainland by navy patrol boat
HMAS Bendigo, Vanstone said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the operation illustrated the need for a
special escort vessel, provided for in Tuesday night's government
budget.
</P>

The budget also included 52.1 million Australian dollars (30.7
million U.S. dollars) to build new boat-people detention centers
in the cities of Darwin and Brisbane and 12.4 million Australian

<HEADLINE> Roundup: New political Crisis Ahead in Bangladesh  By Pan Xiaozhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Will the opposition leader's refusal
to sit with the prime minister to discuss about appointing a new
Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) lead to a new political crisis
in Bangladesh?
</P>
<P>
Many people expressed such concern because any tug of war
between the government and the opposition on the issue will turn
the Election commission inoperative at a time when it was going to
update the electoral rolls.
</P>
<P>
Abu Hena, the seventh CEC, resigned on Monday, some 11 months
before his tenure expires. In a letter to the president, he said
that he was resigning on health ground.
</P>
<P>
However, his decision to quit the job was seen by observers as
sudden and surprising. Because he had earlier declared on his
return home after treatment abroad that he would resign before the
next polls under the caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in a letter on Monday, invited
Leader of Opposition in Parliament and Chairperson of the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Begum Khaleda Zia to hold a
formal meeting with her on Tuesday to discuss the appointment of a
new CEC.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition leader categorically rejected the offer.
In a formal letter addressed to the prime minister Tuesday,
Khaleda Zia expressed her willingness to talk to the president on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
She wrote that since the CEC's post was a constitutional
position and the appointment of the CEC fell under the
jurisdiction of the president, she preferred to discuss the matter
with the president.
</P>
<P>
Before sending the reply, Khaleda Zia had an hour-long
discussion at her office with the leaders of the four-party
opposition alliance.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's office Tuesday night reacted sharply to
the opposition's move to discuss with the president the issue of
choosing a new CEC.
</P>
<P>
Briefing newsmen at his office here on Tuesday, the PM's Press
Secretary Jawadul Karim said that the opposition bid to hold talks
with the president "was nothing but to flout the existing
constitutional provision in selecting the CEC."
</P>
<P>
Karim stressed that under the provision of the constitution,
the president would appoint the CEC, "but on advice of the prime
minister." "This has nothing to do with the honorable president as
the matter is exclusively the prerogative of the prime minister to
recommend a person for the post," he said, adding that Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina "will now proceed as per constitution for
appointing a new CEC."
</P>
<P>
Experts here pointed out that the president is the authority to
appoint CEC. Constitution expert Zahir said Tuesday that the
president may consult with the prime minister, the opposition
leader or any one else on this matter if he wishes.
</P>
<P>
He said that the prime minister may discuss with the opposition
leader and if there is any understanding then the president may
give importance to that consensus. But if there is no consensus,
then the president is the authority to choose who will be the CEC.
</P>
<P>
Observers here pointed out that ostensibly, Abu Hena has
resigned on "health grounds." But his decision to resign could not
have been devoid of "political reasons" to get the burden off his
shoulders in the face of opposition criticism and non-cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Both Abu Hena and his predecessor Abdur Rauf appeared to have
been crucified due to their "failure" to conduct an general
election in a way that produced victory for the opposition parties.
Rauf was blamed by the Awami League for its defeat in the 1991
election while the BNP could not get over the feeling that Hena's
conduct of election somehow ensured their fall from power in 1996.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman: China's Foreign Policy Aims at Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) Li Ruihuan said Tuesday that the goal of
China's foreign policy is to strive for peace.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks at a meeting with Prime Minister of Canada
Jean Chretien here Tuesday afternoon. "The Chinese people values
peace very much and China's development needs peace especially,"
said Li, who is here for a six-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
Li said over the past 100 years, China has undergone endless
wars and turmoil, and that the Chinese people have undertaken
hard struggles to strive for independence and liberation, for
which they have suffered great losses and sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people, who have suffered enough from wars and
turmoil, have a special penchant and demand for peace," Li
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"China's development also needs peace especially," he said. "
Without peaceful international environment, it will be impossible
for us to concentrate on construction and conduct international
exchange and cooperation," the Chinese leader added.
</P>
<P>
"China has no intention of having resentment, contradictions
or conflicts with any countries. We hope to establish and develop
friendly relations of cooperation with any countries on the basis
of the five principles of peaceful co-existence," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Thus, he stressed, it has been China's long time stance to
safeguard world peace firmly, which accords with the realistic
need and long-term interest of China itself.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Li said, China will not yield an inch on
issues concerning national sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
China holds the point that countries, no matter big or small,
rich or poor, strong or weak, and regardless of the difference of
their social systems, cultural tradition, and concept of value,
are equal members of the international community, and that they
should enjoy mutual respect, seek common ground and leave aside
their differences, treat each other equally and co-exist
peacefully, Li elaborated.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Canada are countries in the Asia-Pacific region,
and enjoy great potential in the economic, scientific and
technological and cultural cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are also among those states of important
influence over international affairs and they can play a positive
role in establishing and safeguarding a just and reasonable new
international order, said Li, adding that China hopes to
strengthen exchange and cooperation with Canada and make due
contribution to promoting world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Chretien said that it is very important for
Canada and China to make concerted efforts to create and safeguard
a peaceful and friendly world.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Denies Breaking U.N. Sanctions Against Angola Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian government announced on
Tuesday that Bulgaria has neither exported weapons to, nor
provided training for, the Angolan rebel group as alleged in a
United Nations report.
</P>
<P>
"There is no evidence that Bulgaria has violated any embargo
regulations instituted by the U.N.," chairman of an
intergovernmental committee formed to analyze U.N. charges and
Justice Minister Teodossii Simeonov said.
</P>
<P>
In March, the U.N. Security Council Sanctions Committee
released an explosive report, identifying violators of sanctions
against the rebel National Union for Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA).
</P>
<P>
A dozen countries were charged with helping UNITA rebels
smuggle diamonds to buy arms and oil for their 30-year civil war.
Bulgaria was accused as the origin of most UNITA arms and a
training base for UNITA members.
</P>
<P>
A Bulgarian government report on the issue will be considered
by the Council of Ministers on Thursday. If approved, it will be
submitted to the U.N. Security Council Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
Once famous for producing Soviet-style weapons, the Balkan
state witnessed a deadly decline in its arms industry since the
end of the Cold War. However, it is reported that the Bulgarian-
made weapons are stilled in demand in conflict areas.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Build Coal-Fired Power Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A Myanmar private company will build
a coal-fired power station in Tachilek, a border town in Myanmar's
Shan state, some 1,260 km to the northeast of Yangon.
</P>
<P>
The cornerstone of the station, to be built by the Golden
Triangle Hydro Electric Power Pte Ltd under the Mayflower Group,
was laid on Tuesday in the presence of Vice-Chairman of the
Myanmar State Peace and Development Council General Maung Aye,
official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 12-megawatt coal-fired power station will be built on a
land of 9.89 hectares on the bank of Maikhaungno Creek near
Tachilek at a cost of more than 6 million U.S.dollars plus 2
billion Kyats (6.25 million dollars), the report said.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's electric power is mainly supplied by the state-run
Myanma Electric Power Enterprise (MEPE), which generated a total
of 4.309 billion kilowatt-hours in 1999, produced by hydropower,
natural gas, steam power and diesel.
</P>
<P>
The installed generating capacity of the MEPE was 1,058
megawatts at the end of 1999, the statistics show.

Kosovo and he appealed to them to make efforts to stop the
violence against the non-ethnic Albanians in the province.

Ortuno stressed his force would do its best to improve the

<HEADLINE> Over 6,800 Poor Families in NW China Move Into New Houses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- After living at a cave house for
65 years, Ma Fengwu, a poor Muslim farmer in a village in
northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, was delighted to
move into a big tile-brick house built with government financial
supports.
</P>
<P>
The Ma's is among the 6,800 families living in Ningxia's
mountainous Xihaigu prefecture, one of the poorest area in China,
that benefited from a house renovation program launched by the
regional government three years ago.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the regional government conducted a survey in the
eight counties of the Muslim-dominated prefecture and found 30,000
families were still living in dilapidated houses.
</P>
<P>
It has soon made a plan to help all the 30,000 poorest families
in the prefecture live in new and good houses in three years.
</P>
<P>
In a trial move soon after the survey, the government invested
more than seven million yuan (about 843,370 U.S. dollars) and
built new houses for more than 2,000 of the poorest families who
either had no houses or were living in collapsing caves.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the government allocated 6.25 million yuan (about 208,
333 dollars) for rebuilding or repairing 16,000 houses for a total
of 4,900 families in the area. The move was very popular among the
local people.
</P>
<P>
This year, the regional government has earmarked another seven
million yuan (about 843,370 dollars) for repairing houses in
danger for a total of 7,000 poor households.

BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Introducing a venture capital

of China's high-tech industry over the next few years, China Daily

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Sets Terms For Lease of Islets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investors wishing to lease
islets in Indonesian waters must comply with conservation
standards and their businesses have to be community-based,
according to Minister of Maritime Exploration Sarwono
Kusumaatmadja.
</P>
<P>
"Small islands are rich (in resources), but they are vulnerable.
A small mistake could mean an island's destruction," the minister
was quoted by national newspapers Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Investors would have to conform to conservation standards, and
their businesses would have to be a part of local economic
activities involving the participation of the people living in the
vicinity, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry and various nongovernmental organizations are
currently drafting a set of rules for the management of small
islands which will be used as a basis for investors to lease the
islands.
</P>
<P>
Sarwono said islands will only be rented out if certain
conditions are met. First, the islands must be leased to the
highest bidders; second, the money will go to local governments;
and third, the rentals must be approved by the respective
provincial government in each region.
</P>
<P>
Many members of the House of Representatives criticized the
government for making the announcement without prior consultation
with the House, and some feared that leasing the islets without
strict supervision would lead to their destruction.
</P>
<P>
The Riau provincial administration, which oversees the hundreds
of islands in the Riau archipelago south of Singapore, also
opposes the plan, fearing the move will have psychological impacts
on local people.
</P>
<P>
Sarwono said the outbursts of rejection were based on fears
that the central government would act on its own in allowing
destructive economic exploitation of the islands.
</P>
<P>
Asserting that the final decision would be in the hands of
provincial administrations, Sarwono pointed out that leasing the
islets would bring in significant revenue for a region.
</P>
<P>
He said the plan will not cause serious problems for locals,
because the islets to be rented out are uninhabited and the
program will increase marine environment conservation.
</P>
<P>
Rokhmin Dahuri, director general of coastal areas, beaches and
small islands, said that initially between 100 and 200 islets
would be put up for lease. These would be islands in North
Sulawesi, South Sulawesi and West Nusa Tenggara.
</P>
<P>
"But again it will depend on the provincial administrations,"
he was quoted by the Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has 17,508 islands, of which around 10,000 were
uninhabited.
</P>
<P>
Dahuri said foreign investors from Japan, Kuwait, Hong Kong of
China, Singapore, the Netherlands and Australia had expressed
interest in renting islands, particularly for tourism purpose.

<HEADLINE> Earthquake Death Toll Reaches 46 in Sulawesi, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from last week's
powerful earthquake that caused extensive damage in Central
Sulawesi, Indonesia, increased to 46 persons, according to press
reports here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At least 30,000 people rendered homeless by the earthquake have
insufficient food and water, the reports said, adding that
disrupted roads and communication failures have hampered the
delivery of food and medicine for the refugees and quake survivors
in isolated areas.
</P>
<P>
"If adequate medical and food aid don't come soon, the
condition of the refugees, especially those who are injured, will
worsen," Banggai regent Imran was quoted by the Jakarta Post as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake occurred last Thursday and measured 6.5 on the
Richter scale. Banggai islands regency and Luwuk Banggai regency
on mainland Central Sulawesi were struck the hardest. The
epicenter of the earthquake was in Peleng strait, some 2,000
kilometers northeast of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The strong quake, which caused huge tidal waves, was followed
by at least 200 aftershocks.
</P>
<P>
in Jakarta, Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare and
Poverty Eradication Basri Hasanuddin said his staff were examining
data on the damage caused by the quake, and had been attempting to
find out how much assistance is required by those rendered
homeless by the quake.
</P>
<P>
"On Saturday I will go to Banggai to make sure that everything
is working well and that all of our assistance is trickling down
to those who are in need of our help," the minister was quoted by
the Indonesian Observer as saying.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese PM to Visit Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van
Khai will pay a goodwill visit to Myanmar soon to strengthen the
bilateral ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Phan is to pay the visit at the invitation of Senior-General
Than Shwe, chairman of the Myanmar State Peace and Development
Council and prime minister, an official announcement said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Phan's trip comes more than five years after Than Shwe visited
Vietnam in March 1995, during which the two countries signed three
documents including an agreement on mutual cooperation in drug
abuse control and a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on forestry
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in May 1994 when former Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo
Van Kiet came to Myanmar, the two countries established a joint
commission for bilateral cooperation, thus paving the way for the
further development of bilateral ties and cooperation between the
two nations.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, relations between Myanmar and Vietnam
continued to develop with exchange of visits by high-ranking
officials.
</P>
<P>
In June 1998, Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister Nguyen Manh Cam toured Myanmar, during which an MOU on
mutual exemption of visas to each other's citizens holding
diplomatic and official passports was signed.
</P>
<P>
In a visit to Vietnam by Myanmar Foreign Minister U Win Aung in
March 1999, the two countries agreed to promote cooperation in
trade, agriculture and forestry.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavians have conducted
commemorative activities in recent days all over the country to
honor the 55th anniversary of the victory of anti-fascist victory.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavians paid great contributions to the victory and made
enormous sacrifices in the war, said Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic during a meeting with representatives of Yugoslav
veterans of the war.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia gave the largest number of lives of its sons and
daughters in terms of its population among all the countries, the
president noted.
</P>
<P>
After 55 years since the victory, a new fascist force emerged
in the late 20th century with an attempt to seek hegemony over the
whole world, similar to the Nazis in the 1930s, warned Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
"We can surely defeat the new fascist force together with the
people of other countries as we won over the Nazis more than 50
years ago," he assured the audience.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the veterans laid wreaths at the tomb of
Josip Broz Tito, the supreme commander of the resistance during
the war. Government officials, political parties and mass
organizations also paid their respect to the martyrs with flowers
and wreaths.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Adds Funding for EPO Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- As part of the federal budget, the
Australian government allocated an extra funding to the blood
testing for the banned hormone EPO at September's Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
Australian Sports Minister Jackie Kelly said on Tuesday that 1
million Australian dollars (590,000 U.S. dollars) would be given
to the Australian Sports Drug Agency.
</P>
<P>
The government has previously allocated Australian dollars 1.5
million (885,000 U.S. dollars) to develop a validated test for EPO
in time for the Games.
</P>
<P>
EPO, which enhances endurance by boosting the production of
oxygen-rich red blood cells in the body, cannot be detected by
standard urine tests.
</P>
<P>
In its 2000-2001 budget, the government announced it would
increase its funding for the Games to Australian dollars 535
million(316 million U.S. dollars), including the new funding for
the EPO test.
</P>
<P>
Most of the new funding -- Australian dollars 5 million (2.95
million U.S. dollars) -- will be given to Australian athletes and
coaches, while other money will go to the Australian Quarantine
Inspection Service to help deal with the increased volumes of
visitors, air and sea cargo and ships.

utilization of solar energy.
</P>
<P>
At present, the province has some 200 solar water heater plants

<P>
URUMQI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Tourism has become one of the pillar
industries in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
after 20 years of development, said Nayimu Yasin, director of the
regional tourism bureau.
</P>
<P>
With its unique landscape, plenty of cultural relics and folk
custom, Xinjiang's tourism has developed rapidly in the last 20
years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Xinjiang attracted more than 220,000 overseas
tourists and some seven million domestic visitors, earning over 85
million U.S. dollars in foreign exchange and 6 billion yuan (722
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, Xinjiang will make efforts to promote
tourism activities such as sightseeing to freshwater lakes,
trekking along the ancient silk road and skiing on snowy mountains.
</P>
<P>
Yasin expressed the hope that international air routes will be
opened sooner between the regional capital Urumqi and Japan, Hong
Kong and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The planned Urumqi-Zurich air route will make it easier for
more European tourists to come directly to Xinjiang, he said.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang now has opened dozens of domestic air routes linking
Urumqi to major Chinese cities and operated several special trains
to the region.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang has 160 star hotels offering good service and
accommodations for both domestic and overseas tourists.

ATHENS, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Yianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, former
Parliament deputy from Crete and attorney, was appointed Tuesday
as president of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games Organizing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The replacement, announced by Greek Prime Minister Costas

delays in several areas of Olympic preparations endangered the
2004 Games' smooth running.
</P>

Simitis said that the Greek government would from now on treat
the 2004 Olympics issue in the same urgent manner that it treated
mobilizations and initiatives that followed a destructive
September 7 earthquake that struck the greater Athens area last
year.

LONDON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Sheffield Wednesday, who had a
dramatic 3-3 draw against Arsenal in a premier league match on
Tuesday, were relegated to the first division after nine seasons
in the top flight.
</P>
<P>
Just as Wednesday seemed to be keeping alive their hopes of
avoiding the drop with a 3-1 lead with 20 minutes to play, Arsenal
came back to snatch a draw with two superb shots from Brazilian
Silvinho and Frenchman Thierry Henry in the last 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, promoted to the top flight in 1991, needed to defeat
the second-placed London club who have already qualified for next
season's Champions League behind champions Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
They go down with bottom club Watford.
</P>
<P>
With one game remaining, Bradford City and Wimbledon, level on
33 points above Wednesday, are battling it out to avoid being the
third team to go down.

<HEADLINE> Rams Boss Smith Charged by FA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Derby manager Jim Smith has been
charged with misconduct by the Football Association of England -
for the second time this season.
</P>
<P>
The Rams boss was excluded from the Pride Park dug-out during
Derby's 1-1 draw with Tottenham last month.
</P>
<P>
Derby were reduced to 10 men when Stefan Schnoor was sent off
for two bookable offences, and had five other players yellow-
carded by referee Neale Barry.
</P>
<P>
Smith said then: "He's a bad referee. I've got to be honest. I
knew he was bad before the game and so he didn't disappoint me.
</P>
<P>
"I asked him how he sleeps at night because poor refereeing can
affect players' livelihoods and make teams lose vital games. There
were 10 bookings and he sent Schnoor off for what was an
accidental handball and then a tackle that was not the worst in a
game that only had one really bad one," he said..
</P>
<P>
"My lads were magnificent to get a result with 10 men but at
the end of the day we feel cheated because it is very difficult
playing 10 against 12," he added.
</P>
<P>
Smith was also charged with misconduct in December last year
after an outburst aimed at an assistant referee following the
Premiership fixture with Manchester United on November 20.
</P>
<P>
Smith was quoted as saying referee Mike Reed's performance was"
biased" after the Birmingham official sent off Schnoor and booked
four other home players at Pride Park as United won 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month Derby assistant manager Billy McEwan and
player Craig Burley were charged with disrepute by the FA for
comments they made to match officials following the Rams' April
clash with West Ham.

<HEADLINE> Batistuta's Man United Move Ruled Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Gabriel Batistuta will be staying in
Italy and not heading to Manchester United or any other English
side when he leaves Fiorentina in the summer - according to his
agent.
</P>
<P>
The Argentinian hitman, who has a statue erected in his honour
outside the Florence side's Artemio Franchi stadium, is keen for a
move and now looks likely to join Inter Milan or Lazio.
</P>
<P>
"The president would have sold him already if the interested
team was not Italian," said Settimio Aloisio on Argentinian radio
station Radio La Red.
</P>
<P>
"But Gabriel wants to play a pair of years more here (in Italy)
and that is what we are looking for," local reports said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speculation has linked the 31-year-old with a move to United
for many months, and Alex Ferguson is known to be an admirer.
</P>
<P>
The temporary breakdown of Ruud van Nistelrooy's transfer
reignited the Batistuta link, but the latest news seems to have
killed that possibility.
</P>
<P>
Aloisio concluded: "He does not wanted to go because he is
badly paid or because he is treated badly. Gabriel wants a change
of environment, because he no longer feels stimulated at
Fiorentina."

After Real had won the first leg last week in Madrid 2-0, the

could not get two more it needed to advance.

<HEADLINE> Hannay: There is Historic Opportunity to Solve Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The British government envoy for
Cyprus Sir David Hannay said here Wednesday that there was now a
historic opportunity to resolve the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
"We are very conscious that there is a historic opportunity
here not just for Cyprus," Hannay said after talks with Greek
Foreign Minister George Papandreou in Athens.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that all foreign envoys involved in the peace
effort did what they could without interfering in any way beyond
what was proper to do.
</P>
<P>
The envoy said that all core issues should be addressed in the
new effort to reach a settlement on the divided island.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has set out four core issues that are being addressed
in the talks, namely, territorial adjustments, security, refugees
and the constitutional aspects.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Papandreou said that both Greece and Britain had
decided to cooperate closely to promote a settlement in Cyprus in
view of the proximity talks between the two communities in Cyprus,
which has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a failed
coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
So far, two rounds of U.N.-sponsored talks between the two
communities on the island have been held in New York and Geneva
respectively, and the third round of such talks is expected to
begin in New York late this month.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Increases Foreign Sales of Orimulsion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Bitumenes del Orinoco, a subsidiary
of the state oil company Petroleos of Venezuela, said Wednesday
that this year it will triplicate the 12 million U.S. dollars it
got last year.
</P>
<P>
Last year the subsidiary registered orimulsion production and
export historic records. Orimulsion is a coal substitute fuel,
which results from a mixture of water and heavy based crude found
in the Orinoco River of the South American nation.
</P>
<P>
Despite the 4.88 million metric tons of orimulsion produced
last year, Bitumenes del Orinoco was 1.5 million metric tons short
on its customer's orders.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Venezuela exported 3.5 million tons of orimulsion and
3.8 million tons in 1997. In 2000, the production capacity is
expected to reach 6.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Experts from China will come to Venezuela in June to study the
feasibility of developing a second orimulsion production center.
</P>
<P>
If the project is approved, its construction will start in 2001,
and the first barrels produced will be sent to China by 2003.
</P>
<P>
In this way, the yearly production of orimulsion will go from 6.
5 million tons to 13 million tons. China will purchase 4 million
tons that will make it the first importer of Venezuelan orimulsion.

<HEADLINE> Strong Sterling Tames UK Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain is still on course to meet
its 2.5 percent inflation target, but it is worried about rising
pay pressure and consumer demand, a report from the Bank of
England said.
</P>
<P>
In its latest inflation report released Wednesday, the bank
said that the effects of stronger-than-expected wage growth have
been kept in check by the strength of the pound.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank suggested consumer demand would probably need
to slow if cost pressures, especially wages, were not to increase
further.
</P>
<P>
The report also revealed that the bank's Monetary Policy
Committee was divided over the economic outlook, primarily due to
uncertainty about sterling.
</P>
<P>
The nine-member committee sees the exchange rate falling over
the next two years, but warns of uncertainty surrounding this
prediction.
</P>
<P>
The rise in the pound over recent years bears down on inflation
but hits industry hard by making exports more expensive.
</P>
<P>
A survey of regional industrial trends, by the Confederation of
British Industry (CBI), shows business confidence falling in five
regions over the past four months.
</P>
<P>
Sudhir Junankar, CBI associate director of economic analysis,
said, "There are worrying signs that the manufacturing sector is
taking a turn for the worse."
</P>
<P>
"Our last regional analysis showed a fragile recovery spreading
slowly across the UK. This survey suggests that sterling's
strength could now bring the manufacturing recovery to a premature
end," he added.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Grandparents Criticize U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The grandparents of the Cuban
shipwrecked child Elian Gonzalez Wednesday described as inhuman
the rejection of U.S. authorities to immediately give them visas
to visit their grandson.
</P>
<P>
Before journalists gathered at an official residence in Havana,
all of Elian's grandparents -- both maternal and paternal --
criticized the decision of the State Department of the United
States, and said they will insist in their request.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a T.V. debate Tuesday, the Cuban government
revealed the rejection of the U.S. government to issue visas for
the boy's relatives: Mariela Quintana and Juan Gonzlez (parental
grandparents), and Raquel Rodrguez and Rolando Betancourt (
maternal grandparents).
</P>
<P>
According to an official communique, all of them, as well as
Elian's step-brother's maternal grandparents, whose visas were
denied, wanted to see the survivor of the shipwreck of last
November before the audience before the Court of Appeals of
Atlanta, Georgia, announced this Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Juan Gonzalez told the press that Washington's measure "deeply
affected them in their hearts."
</P>
<P>
Raquel Rodriguez, who lost her only daughter, Elizabeth Brotons,
the mother of Elian, in their unsuccessful try to illegally
migrate into the United States, said by crying: "The only thing I
have left is Elian."
</P>
<P>
All the grandparents agreed in pointing out that the kid is not
only kidnapped, but his close family as well, for "they do not
allow us to see them," saying this in relation to the little boy's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, Nersy, Juan Miguel's wife, and
Hianny, Elian's six-month-old step-brother.
</P>
<P>
When asked about this Thursday's audience before the Court of
Appeals, which has to attend Elian's Miami relatives' request of
political asylum for the minor, said they did not know what to
expect.
</P>
<P>
"We have already received so many blows that we do not know
what is going to happen to us next," said the paternal grandfather.
"There you can expect anything."
</P>
<P>
At the end of the press conference, the president of the Cuban
Parliament, Ricardo Alarcon, said that there are no precedents in
over two centuries of American history in which any judge or court
has taken away a child from his father.
</P>
<P>
Elian was found floating on a tire's inner tube in Florida
coastal waters on November 25 after having survived the shipwreck
in which his mother along with other 10 people died.
</P>
<P>
Since then, he had been held by a grand uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez,
in Miami against the will of the child's father, who traveled from
Cuba to the United States in an effort to claim the kid.
</P>
<P>
On April 22, federal agents raided Lazaro's house to retrieve
the kid who was then taken to Juan Miguel in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Elian and his close relatives, besides four of his classmates
in the company of an adult, a teacher and a Pediatrician, remain
in an estate at Wye Plantation, in Maryland, waiting for the court
decision authorizing the definitive return of the kid to Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Asks Federal Judge to Reject Breakup Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Microsoft Corp. on
Wednesday asked a federal judge to reject the government's plan to
break up the software giant, saying the penalty would far exceed
the antitrust violations the judge found the company to have
committed.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft offered its own remedies to correct what U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled last month was
illegal anticompetitive behavior.
</P>
<P>
In its proposal, the company said it was willing to stop
displaying the desktop icon in its Windows operating system that
leads users to its Web browser, Internet Explorer. In addition,
the company would allow computer makers to prominently feature any
software, including from Microsoft rivals, on the Windows desktop.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Justice Department and 17 state attorneys general
asked the judge April 28 to break the company into two parts, one
company to develop and market the Windows operating system and the
other to develop Microsoft's other software and Internet holdings,
including the Microsoft Office suite of programs.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Microsoft also said that it would be willing to
offer equal contracts to computer makers, regardless of whether
they agreed to support competitors' software. It would also
provide equal access to technology that would allow any software
maker, including the company's competitors, to easily write
programs for Windows.
</P>
<P>
In Jackson's April 3 ruling, Microsoft was found to be a
monopoly that illegally stunted innovation and harmed consumers in
violation of federal antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft maintains its aggressive practices were nothing more
than competitive behavior and insists it did nothing wrong. Under
Jackson's orders, however, it submitted its own proposed remedies.
</P>
<P>
The government has until May 17 to counter Microsoft's response,
and Jackson has scheduled a May 24 hearing to consider the issue.
Microsoft has made it clear, however, that it needs more time to
gather depositions and evidence to combat the government's
proposal.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that even if the government's plan is eventually
accepted by Jackson, it is unlikely to be implemented for years
because of challenges it faces on appeal.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defense Department Urged to Delay Development of New Fighter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recommendation runs counter to the Pentagon's assertion
that it is ready to move ahead with the project at a cost of 220
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The fighter, known as the Joint Strike Fighter, is one of three
enormously expensive fighter projects the Pentagon is pursuing
simultaneously. The other two are the F-22 stealth fighter to
replace the Air Force's current F-15 fighters, and the Navy's F/A-
18 Super Hornet, billed as an improved model of the existing F/A-
18 Hornet.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Strike Fighter project has come under criticism from
congressional cost-cutters recently, a year after Congress came
close to killing off the F-22 bomber.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress so far has supported the project, although on
Tuesday the Senate put a new restriction on how quickly the
Pentagon can spend funds on the fighter project in the fiscal 2001
budget now being worked out.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a Senate Armed Services subcommittee began
discussing delaying the Joint Strike Fighter, although the full
committee on Tuesday rejected that approach. Instead, the senators
decided to alter the program's funding for next year, eliminating
money that had been earmarked for taking the plane into the next
stage of development.
</P>
<P>
At present, U.S. Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. are
competing to build the Joint Strike Fighter.

<TEXT>
<P>
The "Million Mom March" will take over the National Mall, while
supporters plan to gather in nearly 70 other communities in
support of greater gun control. Scheduled participants include
entertainers, politicians and parents who personally experienced
gun violence.
</P>
<P>
Sponsors want to convince Congress that ordinary Americans are
leaving their living rooms to fight for gun control, and mothers
are willing to spend their special day in this untraditional way.
</P>
<P>
Among the expected speakers are Democratic lawmaker Carolyn
McCarthy,whose husband was killed and her son injured by gun
violence.Maryland's lieutenant governor, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend,
daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy, intends to talk about
losing a parent who was the victim of a shooting.
</P>
<P>
Participants will hear from mothers from Dunblane, Scotland,
where a gunman burst into a school in 1996 and shot students in a
kindergarten class. Mothers whose children attended Columbine High
School in Colorado will share their stories, as will Veronica
McQueen, mother of 6-year old Kayla Rolland, who was fatally shot
by a classmate in Michigan State last February.
</P>
<P>
Hillary Rodham Clinton, running for the Senate from New York,
is expected to march as a mom but does not plan to address the
rally.President Bill Clinton is expected to participate but the
White House has not decided what form this would take.
</P>
<P>
Symbolizing the dozen children killed by gunfire every day in
the United States, 12 young people will ring a bell created by a
community-based coalition in Bridgeport, Connecticut State.

<HEADLINE> Britain Denies Colonialism in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain Wednesday called for free
elections in Zimbabwe and rejected charges that London's pressure
on the African nation amounted to "colonialism."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in Edinburgh that freedom and
respect for law were universal values that applied just as much to
Africa as the rest of the world, a Reuters report said.
</P>
<P>
"That is why I totally reject the claim being made by ministers
of Zimbabwe that it is colonialist of me to demand proper
standards of democracy for their country," he said in a speech
outlining British policy on Africa.
</P>
<P>
Britain, the former colonial master in Zimbabwe, was a vocal
critic of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Even before violence broke out in the African country last
month, Britain had always sought to rally international pressure
against Mugabe, the man who led Zimbabwe to independence 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe says Britain is still behaving like an imperial power.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Peasants Block Panamerican Highway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of peasants from around 20
towns in the northeast, northwest and north of Colombia Wednesday
blocked two sections of the Panamerican Highway in protest against
the establishment of a buffer zone that allows for the peace talks
between the government and the guerrillas of the National
Liberation Army (ELN).
</P>
<P>
Other roads of regional and national importance within the same
region were also blocked by the peasants, the authorities of
localities told the press.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the peasants who identified himself as "Carlos"
told radio stations from Bogota that the main concentration is in
two sections of the Panamerican Highway, close to the city of
Barrancabermeja, which has a harbor in the Magdalena river and is
the most important industrial center of the state oil company.
</P>
<P>
The government of the conservative President Andres Pastrana
and the ELN reached a preliminary agreement last month for the
establishment in the northern jungles of a buffer zone, or "zone
of encounter."
</P>
<P>
From this zone, about 5,000 square kilometers, which is part of
the territories of the localities whose people is blocking the
roads, some 1,200 troops will be withdrawn as part of the
agreement once Pastrana orders by decree the creation of the
mentioned zone.
</P>
<P>
Local residents fear the ELN commits violations like those
supposedly happening in a similar zone, which the government set
up with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the
main guerrilla group in the country.
</P>
<P>
The blocking of the Panamerican Highway has interrupted the
traffic between the north of the country and the interior, where
this road goes into Ecuadorian territory.

The suspension of administrative activities in all the
municipalities of Antioquia, will last 24 hours and is supported
by the Colombian Municipal Federation and the province's governor,
Alberto Builes.
</P>
<P>
The protest is the first of its kind by Colombian mayors, and
was agreed upon on May 3 after a proposal of local governors from
towns located east of Medellin, the capital city of the Antioquia
province.
</P>
<P>
In a public communique, the organization's spokespersons
explained that what is pretended is to "show the grave situation
of insecurity we (the mayors) are living in."
</P>
<P>
The closing of the offices is also intended to make the
President of Colombia, Andres Pastrana, meet with them, in order
to look for solutions to the security problem.
</P>
<P>
Antioquia's mayors warned that the guerrillas and the
paramilitary have threatened them with death, kidnapping and
resignation.
</P>

According to the Colombian Municipal Federation, 22 mayors have
been murdered since January 1998.

<HEADLINE> Second U.S./SADC Forum Opens in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The second Southern African
Development Community (SADC)/the United States Forum opened here
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Current chairman of SADC, Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano
stressed that the southern African region remains committed both
to securing peace and stability and to democratization.
</P>
<P>
The SADC region wishes "to take firm steps in the difficult
process of democratizing each of its members states, so that there
may reign within them justice based on the effective participation
of citizens in economic, political and social life, and on respect
for the human rights of all citizens," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chissano stressed SADC's interest in attracting more U.S.
investment and in "the transfer of technology and know-how, as
well as support in improving the region's production systems so as
to capitalize on abundant African raw materials."
</P>
<P>
As for trade relations, he said "we are interested in
mechanisms that allow us to maintain the non-reciprocal
preferences currently in force in some regions, so as to
facilitate the gradual and harmonious integration of our states
into the multilateral trading system."
</P>
<P>
He called for further access of SADC products, "particularly to
the North American market, in order to allow greater
competitiveness and participation of our businesses, without
excessively high customs impositions."
</P>
<P>
At the function, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbot
described SADC as "a corner stone in the effort to coordinate
development in this region, and to speed integration into the
global economy."
</P>
<P>
He praised the SADC trade protocol as an instrument that would
"make the region attractive for investment."
</P>
<P>
As SADC moves toward the creation of its own free trade area,
Talbot added, "we will share with you our experience in
negotiating NAFTA (North American Free Trade Area)."
</P>
<P>
On regional security, Talbot stressed that the security and
peacekeeping roles of the United Nations and the Organization of
African Unity need buttress from sub-regional organizations such
SADC and the Economic Community of West African States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S./SADC forum aims to bring together political leaders,
business figures and other experts to discuss a wide range of
issues. For the current forum, the agenda ranges from controlling
arms proliferation, U.S./SADC trade and investment and fighting
against AIDS to disaster preparedness and minimization.
</P>
<P>
The first U.S./SADC forum was held in Botswana in April 1999.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Workers Cancel Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The trade union committee at the
Cahora Bassa dam and hydroelectric complex (HCB) in the western
province of Tete, Mozambique has called off a strike that was to
have begun on Wednesday, Radio Mozambique reported.
</P>
<P>
Last minute talks between the union committee and the
management averted the strike, but it is not yet clear what
concessions the management have made on the workers' key demand
for the same pay and same conditions as their Portuguese
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Over 80 percent of the shares in HCB is owned by the Portuguese
state and there are a significant number of foreign technical
staff, mainly Portuguese, employed at the plant.
</P>
<P>
Cahora Bassa has a total work force of 1,300, with 900 of them
are Mozambicans while the rest are foreigners.
</P>
<P>
According to HCB Managing Director Fernando Cunha, his company
is working on "social convergence" between its Mozambican and
foreign staff.
</P>
<P>
The problem would be overcome by the gradual replacement of
expatriates by Mozambicans, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that HCB is facing economic difficulties with
both of its main clients, South Africa and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The supply of power to South Africa was interrupted in February
when massive flooding on the Limpopo river knocked down nine
pylons on the transmission lines from Cahora Bassa to the Apollo
sub-station in South Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the normal supplies would not be re-established until
the end of May.
</P>
<P>
As for Zimbabwe, the power supply is normal, but the Zimbabwean
 electricity company has stopped paying, Cunha said, adding that
the Zimbabweans currently owe HCB 30 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Meteorological Services Improved: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has made progress in
offering reliable weather forecast and related meteorological
information in the last five years, said General Manager of the
National Meteorological Agency General Manager Bekure Tsion
Kassahun on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said in a press conference that the improved performance in
weather information services is directly attributed to the opening
of new stations in the regional states, the installation of new
equipment and the training of professionals at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
A total of 131 new stations have been established, 68 existing
ones upgraded and 24 radio communication systems installed over
the past five years, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Tsion, his agency has consolidated its manpower
and material capacity and has managed to supply weather forecast
information five days a week.
</P>
<P>
Meteorological services were in a rudimentary stage five years
ago when the agency had acute shortage of professionals to supply
weather forecasts accurately, he said.
</P>
<P>
But conditions have considerably improved now that the society
is now able to protect itself against disasters like floods on the
basis of meteorological information, he added.

<HEADLINE> Britain Rejects Sierra Leone Call For Military Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Wednesday rejected calls
from Sierra Leone, its former colony, to use British troops to
enforce peace in that western African nation.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon said British troops had been sent
to Sierra Leone purely to help the evacuation of Britons there.
</P>
<P>
"That's why they were sent there, that's the job they will
continue to do. There are limits to how many different engagements
around the world we can be involved in," Hoon told Sky television.
</P>
<P>
His remark was made shortly after a Sierra Leone minister urged
British troops to help ease the situation there.
</P>
<P>
In Freetown, the capital city of Sierra Leone, Sierra Leone
Information Minister Julius Spencer on Wednesday urged Britain to
contribute "men and materials" to the United Nations force as pro-
government forces and U. N. peace-keepers rushed to bolster the
defenses of the capital ahead of advancing rebels.
</P>
<P>
He said British intervention would bring a swift end to the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"If the British government and British military provide
significant support with men and materials to the U. N. force,the
whole situation will change very quickly," he told the BBC.
</P>
<P>
earlier, a spokesman for British forces told reporters in
Freetown that his men and helicopters were giving logistical
support to U. N.peace-keepers, who are under separate command.
</P>
<P>
"If we can, we help moving troops and equipment," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that there were 687 British troops on the
ground in Sierra Leone by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, Britain sent a battalion of paratroops and five
warships to help Britons who may need to be airlifted from Sierra
Leone.

<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas, in a speech to a conference on "U.S.-China Relations
since the End of Cold War" here Tuesday, said legislation like the
TSEA is "both unnecessary and would actually decrease stability in
the region".
</P>
<P>
Passage of the TSEA would cause a large, serious and immediate
disruption in U.S.-China relations, he said at the conference,
which is hosted by the Woodrow Wilson Center.
</P>
<P>
The senator noted that the central issue in U.S.-China
relations is the Taiwan issue. "At the core of the stability of
the relationship is the principle that there is but one China, and
that Taiwan is part of China."
</P>
<P>
Thomas also reiterated his engagement position, saying "the
best way to influence China is to engage it, to draw it
inextricably into the world community".
</P>
<P>
He said that isolating China off may be the "feel good"
solution, but it will not work. "You can't unilaterally isolate a
country like China."
</P>
<P>
The senator said U.S.-China relations have improved over the
past 20 years though there are ups and downs.
