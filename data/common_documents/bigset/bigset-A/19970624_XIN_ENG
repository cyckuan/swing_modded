<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Spells out Upcoming Agenda in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana on Monday spelled out a mild four-item task in the coming
months for the NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference here that "there are still major
obstacles in the implementation of the Dayton peace agreement",
although the military provisions have been well carried out.
</P>
<P>
"We have many challenges to face in the months ahead," Solana
said, adding that four of them are the most urgent.
</P>
<P>
The challenges are to remove illegal local police checkpoints,
open more airports to civil air traffic, put into function the
standing military committee to foster confidence among the Bosnian
parties and provide secure environment for upcoming municipal
elections.
</P>
<P>
Besides Sarajevo airport, NATO peace-keeping forces are ready
to turn over those in Banja Luka, Tuzla and Mostar for civilian
use, Solana said.
</P>
<P>
But the initiative was still blocked by local politicians
concerned with "little politics than the benefits of opening those
airports", he said.
</P>
<P>
Solana reiterated his demand that Bosnian leaders do more in
ensuring a lasting peace in the country in the following 12 months
before the expiration of the current mandate of the NATO
peace-keeping mission.
</P>
<P>
"These months will pass quickly. The leaders of Bosnia must use
this time efficiently and productively to lay the basis for
enduring peace. I don't think they will have a better opportunity
than the one in front of them now," he said.
</P>
<P>
Solana was on a one-day visit to Sarajeva, during which he met
with leaders of the Bosnian parties and the international
community's new High Representative Carlos Westendorp, who is also
a former Spanish foreign minister like Solana himself.

<HEADLINE> Electornic Scoring in Mediterranean Games Overturned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 23 (Xinhua) -- An Italian heavyweight boxer was
stripped of a gold medal earned in the Mediterranean Games after a
committee ruled that electornic scoring was wrong.
</P>
<P>
It was believed to be the first time that the high-tech
computerised scoring way applied at Olympics and world
championships had been overruled.
</P>
<P>
The ruling came despite the earlier insistence of world amateur
boxing body AIBA that the verdict was good.
</P>
<P>
Italian Giacobbe Fragomeni won the gold last Thursday when he
outpointed Algerian Mohammed Benguesmia 3-2 on points.
</P>
<P>
Algeria made a formal complaint when it emerged that four of
the five judges had Benguesmia ahead on their back-up scorecards.
</P>
<P>
The International Committee of the Mediterranean Games declared
after a hearing that Algeria's protest was upheld and Benguesmia
should be awarded the gold. Fragomeni was given the silver medal.

<HEADLINE> CIS Becomes Cyprus' Main Tourist Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia and other former Soviet
Republics have become the most expanding tourist market for
Cyprus since the number of tourists from this area is increasing
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released here today by the Association of Cyprus
Travel Agency (ACTA) show that in 1996, about 130,000 tourists
came to Cyprus from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS),
representing 6.7 percent of the year's total number of tourists,
while in 1993, only 21,000 tourists visited Cyprus from that
region.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.K. is still the dominant tourist market for
Cyprus with 720,000 visitors in 1996, representing 36.9 percent
of the total, followed by Germany with 240,000 (12.3 percent),
the Scandinavian countries with 235,000 (12.0 percent) and Russia.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, visitors to the island spent an average 382
Cyprus pounds (about 764 U.S. dollars) per visitor, compared
with 389.6 pounds (about 779.2 U.S. dollars) spent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier announcement, in 1996, a total of
1,950,000 foreign tourist visited this Eastern Mediterranean
island, showing a slight drop from the previous year of 2.1
million tourist arrivals.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus launched a publicity campaign abroad this year to
challenge the competitiveness from other tourist destinations.
</P>
<P>
The tourist sector, on which the island's economy heavily
relys, earned about 1.6 billion U.S. dollars every year,
representing about 40 percent of the total revenue from the
export of goods and services together.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Pak, India Agree to Agenda for Future Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 23 (Xinhua) -- There has been a significant
forward movement in the second round of Pak-India foreign
secretary-level talks as the two countries agreed to an agenda,
including the long-running issue of Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The two South Asian nations have also agreed to the
establishment of a mechanism, including joint working groups for
conduct of future talks on all outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
This is the major achievement of the three-day talks which
ended here earlier today between the foreign secretaries of
Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement released today at the end of three-day
intensive discussions said that "with the objective of promoting a
friendly and harmonious relationship between Pakistan and India,
the two countries have agreed to address all outstanding issues of
concern to both sides."
</P>
<P>
These issues include peace and security, Jammu and Kashmir,
Siachen, terrorism and drug-trafficking, economic and commercial
cooperation and promotion of friendly exchanges in various fields.
</P>
<P>
As a major breakthrough in the bilateral talks, Pakistan and
India also agreed to setting up a mechanism, including working
groups at appropriate levels, to address all these issues in an
integrated manner.
</P>
<P>
According to the joint statement, the core issues of peace and
security and Jammu and Kashmir will be dealt with at the level of
foreign secretaries who will also coordinate and monitor the work
of all the working groups.
</P>
<P>
During the second round of talks, Pakistan's Foreign Secretary
Shamshad Ahmed and his Indian counterpart Salman Haider also had a
preliminary exchange of views on the composition of the working
groups and their methodology.
</P>
<P>
It is decided that the two countries will continue the
consideration of this matter through diplomatic channels, and the
next round of foreign secretary-level talks will be held in the
Indian capital of New Delhi in September this year.
</P>
<P>
As a good-will gesture, the two countries will release fishing
boats and their crew presently in the custody of either side and
take all possible steps to prevent hostile propaganda and
provocative actions against each other.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference held here at the end of the
talks, Shamshad Ahmed said that "Pakistan and India have
successfully completed the first stage of the task on identifying
the outstanding issues between the two countries and on devising a
mechanism to address them purposefully."
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the mechanism on which we have agreed will
initiate progress towards the settlement of all outstanding
issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani foreign secretary stressed that his country will
continue the dialogue "with sincerity and serious purpose."
</P>
<P>
Shamshad Ahmed, however, said that "we have no illusions about
the complexity of the work ahead of us." "It is important for both
sides now to take steps to create conditions conducive towards the
process purposeful and resultful."
</P>
<P>
Salman Haider, who led a six-member Indian delegation in the
talks, said on the occasion that the joint statement issued at the
end of the talks provided "the basis for comprehensive,
constructive and sustained dialogue between India and Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
While commenting the latest round of bilateral talks, Pakistani
Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan said, "it is a very progressive
step."
</P>
<P>
"Our satisfaction is that for the first time that the Jammu and
Kashmir issue has been put on the agenda for working groups along
with other issues," the foreign minister said, adding that the
talks were "positive, progressive and constructive."
</P>
<P>
The latest round of foreign secretary-level talks was held as
agreed upon by the prime ministers of Pakistan and India at their
meeting during the Summit of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation in Male last month.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India resumed their foreign secretary-level talks
in New Delhi late March after a suspension of more than three
years due to the increased tension.

<HEADLINE> UK Has Europe's Longest Working Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- British employees work longer hours
and take shorter holidays than their counterparts in the rest of
Europe, according to a new survey.
</P>
<P>
After questioning more than 8,000 small and medium-sized
businesses in Europe, 3I, the investment capital group, found that
British employees work the most hours in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed German workers work the least and that
additional employment costs were lowest in the UK and highest in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half the British workforce work more than 40 hours a
week even though less than 10 percent are asked to do so in their
contracts.
</P>
<P>
In Germany only 14 percent work more than 40 hours a week, a
figure which drops to 10 percent in France.
</P>
<P>
Nearly one in 10 British employees said they worked more than
50 hours a week while none of the workforce in the rest of Europe
said that they did.
</P>
<P>
For holidays, the European average is 26 to 30 days a year.
some 94 percent of german workers have more than 26 days and none
has under 20 days.
</P>
<P>
Only 22 percent of UK employees have more than 26 days, and 40
percent have fewer than 20.
</P>
<P>
In Italy more than 10 percent of the workforce take more than
seven weeks' holiday a year. Only 1 percent do in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that high levels of unemployment and wide-scale
"efficiency drives" in both the public and private sector during
the 1980s produced a British workforce more willing to take on a
greater burden at work.
</P>
<P>
Employment protection and a generous welfare system on the
Continent meant that the workforce there felt better able to
defend its rights, they added.
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Thomas, a lecturer at London University, said "Workers
in Britain had to be willing to take offers of extra work in the
belief that when the crunch came they may be at the back of the
redundancy queue rather than at the front."

<HEADLINE> India's Janata Party Chief Charged in Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- India's Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI) today filed a charge sheet against Janata
Party President and Bihar State chief minister, Laloo Prasad
Yadav, and 50 others for their alleged involvement in a
multi-crore rupee fodder scandal, Press Trust of India said.
</P>
<P>
The 50-page charge sheet, along with 1,000 pages of annexes,
was filed in the designated court of Justice S.K. Lal here this
evening.
</P>
<P>
In the scandal which involved 9.5 billion rupees (about 270
million U.S. dollars), 56 people, including Yadav, was accused of
looting the Bihar state treasury through embezzling public funds
sanctioned for fodder supplies in the state.
</P>
<P>
Though the alleged fraudulent withdrawals from the state
treasury started in 1985, the scandal did not erupt until January
last year.
</P>
<P>
As the investigations into the case went on, huge pressures
have been amounted upon Yadav in the past few months for him to
resign.
</P>
<P>
Yadav has refused to quit saying that the case was a conspiracy
masterminded by the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party and the CBI
to dislodge him and his government in Bihar, the second most
populous state in India.
</P>
<P>
The other accused included one former Bihar chief minister and
several former central government ministers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters soon after the CBI filed the charge sheet
against him today, Yadav reiterated his unwillingness to quit
office.
</P>
<P>
"I will not resign unless my guilt is proved in the court," he
said, adding that mere submission of charge sheet does not prove
anybody guilty.

Internet access product, which it hopes to stay ahead of the
industry for long.
</P>
<P>
Called CellularVision Digital Network(SM) or CVDN 500, the
product uses wireless LMDS technology. The service enables
consumers to bypass over-burdened telephone lines to access the
Internet at 500 kbps -- four times the speed of an ISDN line (128
kbps) and about 20 times the speed of a typical consumer's 28.8
kbps modem.
</P>
<P>
The cost of installation and monthly access are affordable for
commercial and home users, according to the New York-based
company.
</P>
<P>
The technology's highly flexible nature will allow CVUS to stay
ahead of the market, and the company will offer such Internet
access at even higher speeds in early 1998, the company said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the company also announced recently that it has
signed an agreement with NYNEX, the local telephone company, which
will allow it to bundle local telephone service to consumers along
with its high-speed Internet access and subscription television
service.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Host SADC Transport Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe National Chamber of
Commerce (ZNCC) today said it will hold a Southern African
Development Community (SADC) regional conference next month on
harmonization of transport and communication systems.
</P>
<P>
The chamber said that inter-state transport and communications
infrastructure are "grossly" inadequate to support the level of
market integration and intra-regional trade envisaged.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the strategy for economic integration recognizes
the need to develop adequate transport and communications
facilities as a prerequisite for economic development in general
and for the expansion of intra-regional trade in particular," it
said.
</P>
<P>
Target groups include government officials, ministries of
transport and of posts and telecommunications, transport
operators, chambers of commerce, trade associations, trade
unions, importers and exporters, freight forwarders and other
associations with similar functions.
</P>
<P>
Topics to be discussed will include harmonization of freight
market access policies on the SADC region, elimination of
regional operational constraints, the role of regional
governments in facilitating efficient transport networks and
harmonization of road transport tariffs under the Common Market
for East and Southern Africa.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Opposes U.S. Decision on Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Salam al Majali said here today that his country supports efforts
by Arab countries to stop the implementation of a U.S. Congress'
vote on recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's unified capital.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at a press conference before his departure
for Bahrain after a three-day official visit to the United Arab
Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representative vote was passed on June 10 and
set aside 100 million dollars to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel
Aviv to Jerusalem, a city also claimed by Palestinians as the
capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
Majali stressed that his country always insists on Israel's
withdrawal from occupied Arab lands and that Jerusalem is Arab
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Majali discussed with UAE senior officials
the latest developments in the Middle East region and bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a recently-singed Israeli-Turkish military
cooperation pact, Majali said that Jordan will be against the pact
if it aims at Syria or Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"A military coalition brings no settlements (to conflicts) in a
period of peace because the world has rejected such ways," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that his country is concerned by the stalled
Middle East peace process, urging Israel to commit itself to UN
resolutions and agreements signed with Arabs on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace talks have been deadlocked since March
when Israel started the construction of Jewish settlement in East
Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> East Africa Starts Insurance Plan to Attract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A newly-launched insurance scheme
seeks to increase confidence amongst foreign tourists to eastern
Africa by offering medical care or evacuation in case of
accidents or serious illness.
</P>
<P>
For 30 U.S. Dollars for each holiday-maker per month, tour
firms can ensure that their clients have insurance cover valid
throughout eastern Africa and the Seychelles Islands.
</P>
<P>
A related medical insurance cover is one offered by the Kenya
Flying Doctors Service at 25 Dollars within a 500-kilometer
radius of Nairobi, covering the whole of Kenya and parts of
northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Those seeking cover beyond that limit pay 50 Dollars for a
flying doctor service that goes as far as Ethiopia and the Indian
Ocean island nation of Mauritus.
</P>
<P>
"Through this scheme, the 30-Dollar offers insurance cover of
up to one million Dollars in the event of accident or other
emergency-related eventualities," Job Kareithi, a former Kenya
Air Force captain who designed the scheme, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Tourism has become increasingly sensitive due to issues of
safety and some of the cost cannot be met by individual tour
operators," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The scheme is sold directly to individuals or through tour
firms.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Flying Doctors Service said they handle an
average of four to five evacuations every week, mainly malaria or
diarrhoea cases, in the region.
</P>
<P>
During the tourist-peak season, the number of evacuations are
higher, he said. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif has termed the inclusion of the Kashmir issue on agenda of
Pak-India talks a major "breakthrough".
</P>
<P>
Talking to the local media here today, Sharif said that the
long standing disputes between India and Pakistan will be resolved
through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"It has raised the hope to solve the core issues between the

</P>
<P>
"Our sincerity yielded the success which could not be achieved
during the last fifty years," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Pakistan's Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan also said

<HEADLINE> PNA Officials: More Violence Possible Over Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Senior Palestinian officials
today renewed warnings to Israel about the possibility of a new
wave of Palestinian violence if the current impasse in the peace
talks continues.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Jerusalem Affairs of the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Faisal Husseini told reporters in Gaza that the
continued Israeli settlement activities could trigger a new wave
of Palestinian violence.
</P>
<P>
He demanded Israel fulfill its commitments to the signed
agreements with the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Husseini also attacked the United States Congress for its
recognition of Israel's claim to the whole Jerusalem as its
eternal capital and for its decision to move the U.S. embassy from
Tel Aviv to the holy city.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PNA Culture and Information Minister Yasser Abed
Rabbo warned Israel that the Palestinian people were ready for
war in which they would defend their land to death.
</P>
<P>
The warnings followed the recent confrontations in the
Gaza Strip and the West Bank city Hebron, where stone-throwing
Palestinian protesters had clashed with Israeli soldiers for
several days in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
A day earlier, PNA President Yasser Arafat also expressed deep
concern over the peace deadlock caused by the hardline policies
of the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to visiting members from Israel's leftist Hadash
Party in Ramallah, Arafat said Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu did not realize the seriousness of his actions and the
possible consequences in the regional context, as well as in the
terms of Israeli-Palestinian relations.
</P>
<P>
Today, Arafat met in Ramallah with Assad Assad, Netanyahu's
adviser on Israeli Druse affairs, who reportedly conveyed a
message from the Israeli premier to the PNA leader on the
current situation.
</P>
<P>
Assad said that Arafat asked him to bring back a message to
Netanyahu after the meeting, but he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
He quoted Arafat as saying that Israel and the PNA should
resolve their differences in direct dialogs, including a meeting
between himself and Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egyptian peace envoy Osama el-Baz is expected, by
the end of this week, to renew his efforts for the resumption of
the Israeli-Palestinian talks, which have been frozen since
March when the Israeli government gave the order to begin
building the Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Baz's previous shuttle missions have failed to break the
deadlock between the two sides. The PNA demands Israel stop all
settlement activities before resuming the talks, while Israel
insists that the PNA should resume security cooperation with
Israel and sit down to talk without preconditions.

<HEADLINE> Photo Exhibition on Hong Kong's Return to China Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A photographic exhibition on the
history and development of Hong Kong opened here tonight to mark
the historic occasion of Hong Kong's return to China, which will
take place on July 1.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition features more than 200 photographs and is
divided into four broad categories -- "History of Hong Kong," "The
Link between Hong Kong and the Inland of China," "The Course of
Hong Kong's Return," and "Hong Kong Today."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, George Yeo, Minister for
Information and the Arts and Second Minister for Trade and
Industry of Singapore, said the return of Hong Kong on July 1,
1997 to China is an historic event. "It marks the final closing of
a difficult chapter of history for East Asians."
</P>
<P>
The key reason for the loss of Hong Kong to the British was not
British might but Chinese weakness, the minister observed, adding
that in the same way, the return of Hong Kong to China on July 1
this year reflects the resurgence of Asia and its ability now to
deal with Western powers on the basis of equality.
</P>
<P>
"If China were still backward and mired in civil war, the
coming return of Hong Kong to China would probably not take
place," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We in Singapore are not only observers of the important event
that is to take place on July 1, we are also participants in it
because of our stake in the promotion of peace and prosperity in
Asia and the world," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, "This exhibition of the history and
development of Hong Kong not only reminds us of the past, it also
points our way into the future."
</P>
<P>
Fu Xuezhang, Chinese ambassador to Singapore, said he is
confident that after its return, Hong Kong's links with Singapore
will grow closer and the economic cooperation between the two will
be more fruitful.
</P>
<P>
"Under the new circumstances, Hong Kong and Singapore will grow
and prosper together," he said, noting that the Singapore
government had expressed its full confidence in Hong Kong's future
and its commitment to continued investment in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated that after its return, Hong Kong will retain
its existing social and economic systems, legal framework and way
of life. It will enjoy a high degree of autonomy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's status as a trade, transportation and financial
center in the region will not be affected. Rather, it will be
consolidated and grow further, the ambassador stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Facts will prove that 'one country, two systems' will be the
optimal formula for China's great cause of national
reunification," he said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Somalis Make Money by Exporting Junk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Somali businessmen are making
money by exporting junk lying in the streets of the war-divided
capital, Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
As debris of different kind lies in heaps in the main streets
of Mogadishu due to poor sanitation, the idea of exporting some
of them is also some relief for the people.
</P>
<P>
The item which is being added to the few exportable items of
Somalia is animal bones. There are mountains of bones of camel,
goats and cattle in Mogadishu, of which the largest, 13 meters
high and about 50 meters wide, lies in North Mogadishu while the
second largest is in South Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to Mohamud Cattivo, the owner of one of the two bone
grinding plants in Mogadishu, their business is booming with a
lot of revenue being made.
</P>
<P>
He said they grind the bones in three different sizes: gravel
size, millet size and powdering, adding that "those are the
required sizes for exporting the stuff to the United Arab
Emirates."
</P>
<P>
"We would get the bones free of charge just a month ago, but
now the people came to know that they're worthy while," he said,
"and we're obliged to buy from them in kilograms."
</P>
<P>
The bones are sold in two categories, some containing its bone
marrows and others dried up. According to Cattivo, the bones
containing its marrow are two times more expensive than the
others since the fats are extracted and resold again for the
local consumption.
</P>
<P>
Each quintal of the dry bones are bought from local collectors
about one US Dollar and the same quintal can be sold in the UAE
about 100-120 US Dollars after the process and shipment, said
Cattivo. He added that they also export dried blood and animal
waste which they grind together as food for cattle and chicken.
</P>
<P>
The process of the bones collection is also creating numerable
jobs for many of the poor Somalis. Over 200 people are currently
busy in collecting animal bones from the streets of Mogadishu and
its surrounding districts every day.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 51 people permanently work in the South Mogadishu
Bone Grinding Machinery, who so far ground 100 tons of bones in
less than 20 days. Abdulle Awleh, the owner of the North
Mogadishu Bone Processing Plant said his factory employs more
than 100 people permanently.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the hard currency injection to the already dead
economy of the country, this business is on the other hand taking
part in the improvement of the sanitation and hygiene in the
capital.
</P>
<P>
Other businessmen are also planning to get a market for the
other residues such as the peels of the fruit, worn-out shoes,
the plastic bags for export.

<HEADLINE> Earth Summit+5 Opens at UN Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The 19th special session of
the General Assembly of the United Nations, also known as Earth
Summit+5, opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The week-long session aims to review action taken in the five
years since the United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development met in Rio de Janeiro and to set priorities into the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session, President of the General Assembly and
Malaysia Ambassador Razali Ismail said reviewing the
implementation of the Agenda 21 must go beyond simply calculation
ratios of progress versus deterioration. This was a time for
critical reflection and concrete action.
</P>
<P>
Razali said there had been notable achievements since Rio.
Prime among them had been the unfolding of Agenda 21 into a living
document beyond the realm of conferences. National strategies,
local initiatives, public consciousness and environment had
proliferated, accompanied by tentative reforms of institutions and
aid programs. On the global level population growth rate had
stabilized, infant mortality fallen, life expectancy increased and
nutrition improved.
</P>
<P>
The elaboration of the Rio Declaration into legal principles
and international law was also a notable achievement. But the end
result remained paltry, due to the slowness in dealing with
issues, the inconsistent fulfillment of agreements, and the weak
ability to enforce compliance and to ensure the equitable benefits
for all, the president said.
</P>
<P>
He said five years on from Rio, the international community
still faced a recession of the very political will that was
essential for realizing real change. Failure in the management of
natural resources continued to create scarcities, to invite
conflicts, to pose dangers to public health and to incite social
disintegration. Those at Rio who made serious commitments had not
followed through on their promises.
</P>
<P>
Challenging governments North and South to tackle the real
obstacles to implement the Agenda 21, he stressed it is necessary
to avoid the temptation to concentrate on just so-called emerging
issues. The crucial issues were the cross-sectoral issues, those
that linked environment and development.
</P>
<P>
"Governments and NGOs from the developed world vigorously
promote environmental protection, without shouldering the greater
burden of adjustment of consumption and production patterns. Nor do
they emphasize with equal balance the importance of fulfilling
global responsibilities with national ones," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Levels of development assistance are not even graced with the
tag of 'business as usual'. Official development assistance has
sharply declined from 55 billion dollars to less than 50 billion
dollars since Rio. There no signs the decline will be reversed and
this remains a blow to international cooperation," he added.
</P>
<P>
He urged governments, private sector and members of civil
society to address new challenges so as to fulfill the global
commitments and realize sustainable development.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Flower Growers Seek International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Banks from France and Holland
are competing with the Bank of Israel over the financing of the
Israeli flower industry projects valued at 19 million
U.S. dollars, according to a report of bi-weekly Israel Business
Today.
</P>
<P>
A statement to this effect was issued by the Horticulturalist
Council earlier this month following government approval of
guarantees for flower growers.
</P>
<P>
The council said that it is conducting negotiations with a
number of international banks with regard to the financing of
flower-growing projects. The financing in question would be
provided in the form of loans granted to the agriculturalists as
complementary funding to equity and a grant given by the
Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, agriculturalists have experienced
difficulties in returning bank loans and this has generated
delays in investment in flower-growing projects due to lack of
funds.
</P>
<P>
A number of banks from Israel and abroad have applied to the
Horticulturalist Council with a request to participate in the
credit program. The Council's comptroller, Micha Kenig, flew to
Europe earlier this month to hold talks with senior managers at
the Commercial-Industrial Bank of France and the Dutch
International Bank to discuss the terms and level of financing.
</P>
<P>
Israel is a major flower-exporting country, only after Holland
and Columbia. However, flower growers recently went on strike
against the lack of government support for the industry, which,
according to them, caused the decline in flower exports to
Europe.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Calls for Global Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan today called for global efforts for sustainable development
at the Special Session of the General Assembly on review of the
implementation of Agenda 21.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session, Annan said our task in this
session was to turn that political will into deeds and actions. We
must set a sure course for the world community into the new
millennium, on this most urgent and vital global issue.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the United Nations Conference on Environment and
Development (UNCED) in 1992 was a landmark in the new global
diplomacy. It brought together governments, non-government
organizations and concerned individuals as never before. Its
objectives, scope and focus were loftier than any previous
conference, its basis of support broader, and its implementing
partners more varied.
</P>
<P>
Annan said UNCED marked a conceptual breakthrough, too. It gave
practical effect to the relationship between environment and
development in the new concept of "sustainable development", which
embraced the human and social dimension of sustainable
development. It generated new hope that poverty and deprivation
could be attacked with greater clarity and coherence.
</P>
<P>
On progress achieved in the last five years, he said many
countries established national coordinating mechanisms for
sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21, all three
conventions on climate change, biodiversity and combating
desertification entered into force, and notable progress was made
in switching to renewable energy sources.
</P>
<P>
On the negative side, he noted that more than a quarter of the
developing world's people still lived in absolute poverty, no
progress had been made in following up UNCED commitments for the
transfer of concessional finance and environmentally sound
technology to developing countries, carbon dioxide emissions
continued to rise, one third of the world's population lived in
countries facing moderate to severe stress on water resources and
majority of species subject to fishing in oceans were now fully
exploited or over-exploited.
</P>
<P>
He called on the governments and the United Nations to join
with the private sector, civil society and non-government
organizations in a new partnership based on a recognition of
mutual interests and a readiness to share responsibilities,
which would link all global environment stake-holders in an
alliance to implement the Agency 21.

<HEADLINE> World Crude Oil Reserves Reach Record High, Esso Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The world's proven crude oil reserves
grew by over 1.5 billion tons, or one percent, to an all-time high
of some 140 billion tons last year, a study of the Esso oil
company said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the study conducted by the German subsidiary of
the Esso company, the global crude oil production rose by 97
million tons to nearly 3.4 billion tons last year, mainly thanks
to higher oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The world crude oil consumption also increased by 44 million
tons last year to 3.3 billion tons. About one-third of the
increase was accounted for by China and Southeast Asian countries,
the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia remains the world No.1 oil-rich nation with more
than one-fourth of the global reserves, while members of the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) as a
whole account for three-quarters of the world crude oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia was also the world's largest oil producer which
accounted for 12 percent of the world oil output last year.
</P>
<P>
The United States was the world largest oil user with a
consumption of 814 million tons, or almost one-fourth of the world
total, last year.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Government Pledges Lasting Solution to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government today said
that it is taking "urgent and drastic measures" to solve the
issue of fuel scarcity that has paralyzed the country's economic
and social life.
</P>
<P>
The country's No. 2 leader, Chief of General Staff
Lieutenant-General Oladipo Diya, told reporters in Abuja today
that the government is aware that Nigerians are feeling really
bad about it.
</P>
<P>
He said the Defense and Security Council will meet today in
Abuja to discuss the issue, and will try to find a lasting
solution to it.
</P>
<P>
The fuel scarcity in Nigeria has caused wide confusion and
huge losses in the last few months. Commuters are stranded at
many bus stops. Some people have to go off their work earlier
because they have to walk for home. Many simply choose to stay at
home.
</P>
<P>
The persistent fuel scarcity has caused a war of words between
Petroleum Minister Chief Dan Etete and Finance Minister Anthony
Ani about the cause of the problem.
</P>
<P>
Lagos State Administrator Colonel Mohammed Marwa has also said
that for a major oil producer like Nigeria, the fuel scarcity is
not only embarrassing, but also scandalous. item

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President to Go to New York for Direct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides will go to New York next month, accompanied by
parliamentary party leaders, for direct negotiations with Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, it was announced here today.
</P>
<P>
"President Clerides is going to New York and the presence of
the party leaders will facilitate the assessment of developments
at any given moment," government spokesman Manolis Christofides
said in statements following a four-hour meeting of the National
Council, which comprises five parliamentary party leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Council, the top advisory body to the president, met
today in a bid to forge a strategy which Clerides will follow in
the U.N.-sponsored direct negotiations with Denktash in New York
from July 9 to 13.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Clerides was satisfied with today's
meeting, during which no disagreements surfaced and party leaders
suggested ways on how the negotiations will succeed.
</P>
<P>
"They have responsibly expressed views and made suggestions
on how these negotiations could succeed," Christofides said.
</P>
<P>
The government spokesman said that there was understanding on
issues faced by the Greek Cypriot side and that "the picture
presented today is very encouraging."
</P>
<P>
He also noted that party leaders going to New York are, for
the time being, accompanying the president to the first round of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a recent report to
the U.N. Security Council on his good offices mission in Cyprus
that a second round of direct negotiations will be held in
August and a third one may be held if deemed necessary.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also expressed the hope that Turkey will
demonstrate flexibility during the talks.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey's stance concerns us because it presents a picture of
intransigence. But we look forward to these negotiations and we
expect there will be some flexibility if the goal is to find a
solution to the Cyprus problem. That is our goal," Christofides
said.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when
the island was divided after the Turkish troops occupied its
northern third in the wake of a pro-Athens coup.

<HEADLINE> British Court Jails Kray 12 Years for Drug Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The British court today sentenced
Charlie Kray, the elder brother of former British gangland twins
Reggie and Ronnie Kray, for 12-year imprisonment for masterminding
a 39 million pound (65 million US dollars) cocaine plot.
</P>
<P>
But the 70-year-old Kray protested his innocence, saying that
during his whole life he had "advised people never to be involved
in drugs."
</P>
<P>
However the jury, which on Friday convicted Kray of supplying
and offering to supply cocaine, was clearly of the opinion that he
had failed to follow his own advice.
</P>
<P>
Kray was convicted of offering to supply two undercover police
officers with five kg (11 lb) of cocaine every fortnight for two
years. He was also found guilty of actually supplying two kg (4.4
lb).
</P>
<P>
Kray's friends and relatives have said he will appeal against
his conviction.
</P>
<P>
His brothers Reggie and Ronnie, London's most prominent gang
bosses during the 1960s, were jailed for life in 1969 for the
murders of fellow criminals George Cornell and Jack "The Hat"
McVitie.
</P>
<P>
Ronnie died of a heart attack last year in Broadmoor
psychiatric hospital, home to many of Britain's most disturbed
criminals. Reggie, 62, remains in prison.

<HEADLINE> Britain Urges Sinn Fein to Deliver IRA Truce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- British Northern Ireland Secretary
Mo Mowlam once again urged Sinn Fein today to step up efforts to
deliver an IRA ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
"I think Sinn Fein ought to be concentrating on giving me an
unequivocal ceasefire before they tell me what else I should be
doing," she told reporters in Londonderry city.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein is the political wing of the Irish Republican Army
(IRA) which has been fighting against the British rule of the
divided province of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Her call for an IRA ceasefire, adding fuel to Anglo-Irish and
U.S. demands, came on the eve of an attempt by London and Dublin
to break the deadlock over arms decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who broke off low-level
contacts with Sinn Fein last week after the IRA killed two police
officers in Northern Ireland, urged Saturday the IRA to deliver a
truce so as to gain a seat in the multi-party peace talks on
Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein is barred from the multi-party discussions because
the IRA refuses to restore a truce it broke in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam also said Britain and Ireland were working very hard to
reach an agreement which would be discussed in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Martin McGuinness, chief negotiator for Sinn Fein, said
yesterday the disarmament issue remained a major obstacle in peace
process.

<HEADLINE> Greenpeace to Sue UK Govt over Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Greenpeace spokesperson Mirella
Lindenfels said today the environmental group is seeking to take
the British Government to court this week over plans to open up
Atlantic waters for oil exploration.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to lodge papers sometime this week to ask leave from
the High Court to pursue the case," Lindenfels said.
</P>
<P>
She explained that the government had failed to apply the
European Habitats Directive when it awarded permits in the 17th
offshore licensing round for oil exploration, mainly in the
Rockall Trough west of the Hebrides and north of the Shetland
Islands earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Last March, Greenpeace had applied for all the licenses with
the intention of turning the 35,000 square km into a marine
wildlife sanctuary. The bid was rejected by the Department of
Trade and Industry (DTI) and the licenses were granted to 14 oil
companies.
</P>
<P>
If the High Court grants Greenpeace leave, the case will go to
court and the group will call for the oil exploration to be
suspended until the case is concluded.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, greenpeace activists occupied the London
office of U.S. oil company Conoco, which among others was awarded
the right to explore for oil in the 17th licensing round, for
about four hours.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Department of Trade and Industry said the
government's position was to go ahead with the oil plan and it
would go to court if it had to.

<P>
LONDON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Shares on Europe's major stock
markets mixed today, with London and Frankfurt ending lower while
Paris going up slightly.
</P>
<P>
In London, uncertainty about the course of Britain's monetary
and fiscal policy, a further appreciation in the value of sterling
and a weak start on Wall Street conspired to drive leading shares
lower for the sixth straight session. The FTSE-100 closed at
4,575.8, down 18.1 points.
</P>
<P>
German shares ended bourse trade lower, hurt by profit taking
after the DAX index on Friday surged to a new all-time high on
buying tied to the expiry of DAX futures and options and stock
options. The DAX-30 index closed at 3,754.72, down 33.55 points.
</P>
<P>
On Paris market, French shares finished slightly higher in a

<HEADLINE> Egypt Welcomes U.S. Peace Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said today Egypt welcomed the U.S. government's stance on the
Mideast peace process that reaffirmed the importance of abiding by
previous agreements.
</P>
<P>
Telling reporters here, the Egyptian top diplomat echoed the
recent remarks by U.S Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on the
importance of abiding by the Palestinian-Israeli deals and staying
away from unilateral measures to prejudice the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Albright's remarks followed an Arab uproar over a
U.S. Congressional vote on June 10 recognizing Jerusalem as the
Jewish eternal capital despite the Palestinian claim of the city's
eastern sector as their future capital.
</P>
<P>
"I consider Albright's remarks as basis for pushing forward the
Mideast peace process," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Unlike her predecessors who had frequented the Middle East,
Albright is yet to pay a visit to the region since she took
office in January.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries have been urging the U.S., the main sponsor
of the peace process and the only country that has a leverage over
Israel, to put up its pressure on the Jewish state for an early
resumption of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Moussa declined to say if Egyptian presidential political
advisor Osama el-Baz is to launch a new mediation tour to the
Palestinian self-rule area and Israel later this week.
</P>
<P>
But the Egyptian Middle East News Agency quoted informed
sources as saying Sunday that Baz will travel to Israel by the
weekend, after his rounds of shuttle diplomacy between the
Palestinians and Israelis during the past month have failed to
produce a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Saying that Cairo wants to overcome, rather than ignore,
difficulties on the road of peace, Moussa maintained that the
Egyptian diplomacy aims to create an atmosphere favorable for
salvaging the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"The Egyptian role has never slowed down in any stage of
Arab-Israeli talks and Egypt will seize any opportunity to rescue
the negotiations from the present pitfall," he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has intensified its efforts at mediation after
U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross failed to restart the talks that
broke down in March after Israel began the construction of a
Jewish housing project in Arab East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Inter-African Force, French Troops Attack Mutineers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chadian-led Inter-African
intervention force, backed by French troops, attacked a major
barracks of the mutineers in the Central African Republic's
capital, Bangui, this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that the soldiers of
the Inter-African Mission of Supervision of the Accords of Bangui
(MISAB) launched a mopping-up operation against the mutineers in
the southwestern "pro-mutiny" districts of Bangui, after pounding
the Kassai camp of the rebels with heavy artillery fire.
</P>
<P>
French troops also struck the rebels from military helicopters
flying above the camp, after four shells fell today at the French
embassy without causing any casualty or damage, reported AFP.
</P>
<P>
The latest attack brought the number of people killed to about
50 and those wounded to 100, after fighting broke out last Friday
between the mutineers and the MISAB forces.
</P>
<P>
MISAB soldiers "cleaned up" all resistance pockets of the
rebels in the districts of Kouanga, Bacongo, Kpetene, Petevo and
Sica-1 in southwestern and central Bangui.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president of the International Follow-up
Committee of the Accords of Bangui, General Amadou Toumani Toure
of Mali, is expected to arrive in Bangui Tuesday from Libreville,
where he held talks today with Gabonese President Omar Bongo, who
heads a mediation mission of several African heads of state for
the Central Africa crisis.

WASHINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Supreme Court ruled
today that states can keep violent sexual predators locked up
after they serve their prison sentences even if they are not
mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
In a decision that bodes well for the country's "Megan's laws,"
the court has reversed a lower-court ruling that struck down
Kansas's Sexually Violent Predator Act as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
In effect, the act allowed the state to confine sexual
predators to a mental institution after they served sentences, but
without any further crimes or convictions.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Designate Holds Talks for New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister designate
Mesut Yilmaz today began rounds of hard talks in effort to form a
new coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, chairman of the second largest Motherland Party
(ANAP), was appointed by President Suleyman Demirel to set up
a new government following the resignation of Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan on June 18.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz met with leaders of several political parties,
including Tansu Ciller, chairwoman of the True Path Party (DYP)
and also deputy prime minister of the caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at a press conference here, Yilmaz said
that the new government would be one of cohesion and
reconciliation, adding it aimed to solve the problems of the
country within democracy.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that he would not hold talks with the Welfare
Party (RP) led by Erbakan and the Grand Unity Party (BBP) led by
Muhsin Yazicioglu.
</P>
<P>
BBP, which has eight seats in the parliament, had said that it
favored a DYP-led coalition government.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, Yilmaz has enjoyed 265 votes of the
parliament, not enough to survive a possible vote of confidence in
the 550-seat parliament with a vacancy of two.
</P>
<P>
This means Yilmaz has to win over at least nine DYP deputies to
secure the new coalition government, political analysts said.
</P>
<P>
If the new government failed to win a vote of confidence in the
parliament, the mandate to form a government will naturally go to
Ciller, whose party ranks third in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan resigned under the pressure from both the military and
his junior coalition partner DYP who criticized the government's
failure in curbing the rapidly expanding fundamentalist force in
the secular republic.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Opposes Cyprus EU Membership Application </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu
Ciller today reiterated Turkey's opposition for Cyprus' EU
membership application.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement issued by the Foreign Ministry, Ciller
said that Cyprus cannot be admitted to the European bloc before
Turkey becomes a full EU member state.
</P>
<P>
She made the statement as Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash will begin a
face-to-face talks in New York on July 9.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has repeatly voiced its concern over unilateral EU
talks with Cyprus on the island country's membership issue,
saying the Cypriot government has no right to represent Turkish
Cypriots living in the north.
</P>
<P>
Ciller, also deputy prime minister of the caretaker coalition
government, said that this was clearly stipulated in the Cyprus
agreements signed in 1959 and 1960, which gave guarantor status
to Turkey, Greece as well as Britain.
</P>
<P>
"In this context, we have repeatedly emphasized that Cyprus
cannot become a member of the EU before Turkey," Ciller said.
</P>
<P>
She added that the Cypriot government could not start its
negotiations unilaterally with the EU officials before the
Cyprus problem was resolved.
</P>
<P>
"Only after an agreement has been reached on the solution of
the Cyprus question can a joint delegation, in which the Turkish
Cypriot and Greek Cypriot communities are represented on an equal
basis, take part in accession negotiations with the EU," said
Ciller.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that she had transmitted this
opinion to both Britain and the Netherlands which currently
holds the EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
Turkish troops landed on Cyprus in 1974 in response to a
pro-Greek coup, dividing the East Mediterranean island into Greek
and Turkish communities.

KUWAIT CITY, June 23 (Xinhua) -- A week-long photo exhibition
showing Hong Kong's history and Chinese government's measures to
guarantee the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong after its
return to China from British rule opened at the Center of Kuwaiti
Fine Arts here today.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony of the exhibition which starts on the eve
of Hong Kong's return to China on July 1, was inaugurated by
Kuwaiti Minister of Social Affairs and Labor Ahmed Al-Kulaib and
Chinese Ambassador to Kuwait Zhang Zhixiang.

The exhibition, entitled "Hong Kong's Past, Present and
Future," was held jointly by the Chinese Embassy in Kuwait and
Kuwaiti Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor.
</P>
<P>
A total of 99 pictures taken by Chinese and foreign
photographers are on display.
</P>
<P>
The photos cover the history of the Hong Kong people's struggle

<P>
The exhibition also shows the various measures taken by the
Chinese government to guarantee Hong Kong's smooth transition and
continued prosperity and stability in accordance with the
principles of "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong".
</P>
<P>
Al-Kulaib, in a brief interview with Xinhua after the

to the motherland and expressed his good wishes that "Hong Kong
would become more prosperous and beautiful" in the future.

past under the British colonial rule and helped people understand
Hong Kong's present and future.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Embassy would also organize a film festival in
cooperation with Kuwait Film Club and hold a grand reception on
June 30 to commemorate the historical event, Ambassador Zhang told
Xinhua.

<P>
AMMAN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has obtained a loan of some
24.5 million U.S. dollars from two financial bodies of the United
Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
This was announced after Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Salam
Majali returned home this evening from his three-day official
visit to the UAE, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in the UAE, Majali met with UAE President
Sheikh Zayed Ben Sultan Al Nahyan and other senior officials. He
also attended the signing ceremony of three agreements today.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a loan agreement worth 12 million dollars with
the Arab Monetary Fund (AMF), said Radio Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Ziyad Fariz, governor of the Central Bank of Jordan,
signed two agreements with the Arab Financing Program (AFP) and
the oil-poor kingdom was thus provided with 12.5 million dollars
of credit from the AFP.
</P>
<P>
The UAE is among the Arab countries that severed ties with
Jordan during the 1991 Gulf War to drive Iraqi troops from
Kuwait. But in the recent years the bilateral ties have begun to
improve since the kingdom distanced itself politically away from
Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Business Leaders in California Positive on Hong Kong's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 23 (Xinhua)--Hong Kong's return to China will
create a new era not only of relations between China's inland and
Hong Kong, but also of Pacific Rim trade and investment, according
to a business leader here.
</P>
<P>
"You will find a strengthening of China's economic engagement to
Asia as well as the rest of the world," said Richard King, a
founder of the Hong Kong Association of Southern California and
known as one of the pillars of Los Angeles international trade
community.
</P>
<P>
King, president of the King International Group, a consultant
company promoting Pacific Rim business relations, said that he was
very positive about China's "takeover" of Hong Kong. "I found most
of the business people I talked to are also positive about the
takeover," he said.
</P>
<P>
He has spent a lot of time over the past few weeks on giving
lectures on the transition of power in Hong Kong to various
organizations in southern California, trying to put the event in
perspective and explain the Chinese cultural aspect of it. The
average Americans, he said, came to know the transition by reading
newspapers which tend to pick up unrealistic issues. "We should
make people better informed and I don't think our economic
relations should be dictated by the media," he said.
</P>
<P>
China is the second largest trading partner of California
with the seventh largest economy of the world. According to
preliminary statistics, in the first quarter of this year,
California's exports to China's mainland and Hong Kong
respectively increased by 14 percent and 20 percent. China and
Hong Kong together brought 1.4 billion US dollars worth of goods
from California.
</P>
<P>
Headquartered in Los Angeles, King's company has affiliates
in Hong Kong, Taipei, Tokyo and Chongqing in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
King predicted that Hong Kong's transition will strengthen
China's economy and greatly influence southern China which is
already a huge market.
</P>
<P>
He said that American and Chinese firms can team-up not only
in Asia but also in central America and Africa.
</P>
<P>
"That will be an exciting development and Hong Kong's return
might contribute to it," said King, who believed that economic
collaboration could increase mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
King's views are shared by John Coleman, a lawyer and
president of the Hong Kong Association of Southern California,
an organization of over 700 corporation members aimed at
promoting business with Hong Kong and southern China.
</P>
<P>
According to Coleman, the business community in southern
California has been very positive about Hong Kong's transfer.
"I think it is not only a great opportunity for China and Hong
Kong, but also for the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Confidence in Hong Kong is strong," he said.

<HEADLINE> Criminal Use of Guns Drops in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The criminal use of guns appears to
be declining in Canada, despite a wide-spread belief to the
contrary, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
An exception is in Canada's three largest cities of Toronto,
Montreal and Vancouver, where firearms are the weapons most
frequently involved in homicides.
</P>
<P>
Across the country, the use of firearms in homicides has
gradually decreased since 1975, according to a study by the
Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics.
</P>
<P>
And the use of firearms in spousal homicides also declined
slightly, from 36 percent of all victims from 1985 to 1994 to 28
percent by 1995.
</P>
<P>
More significant, the use of firearms declined in types of
violent crimes that are on the rise, mostly notably robbery.
</P>
<P>
"While the proportion of all weapons involved in robberies has
remained relatively stable over the years, the involvement of
firearms has decreased by 41 percent since 1975," the study said.
</P>
<P>
Of about 1,100 deaths from gunshots in 1995, 13 percent were
homicides, while 81 percent were suicides and 6 percent were
attributed to accidents.
</P>
<P>
The study echoed earlier surveys that found the rate of violent
crime in Canada, after nearly doubling between 1975 and 1992, is
on a downward trend.

PARIS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
today expressed deep dissatisfaction over the Denver G-8 summit
held last weekend in the U.S. Rocky Mountain city, which he
described as "a circumstance not so comfortable for our country
and Europe."
</P>
<P>
Without naming the United States, Jospin said that he felt a
"certain tendency of hegemony" from the host of the summit. He
also deplored that France and Europe failed to convey a strong
enough message at the summit.
</P>
<P>
"We feel a certain tendency of hegemony which is not strictly
identifiable with the simple exercise of responsibilities of a
great power, even though a friend," said Jospin in front of the
parliament deputies.
</P>
<P>
He said that although he himself did not take part in the
summit, he asked Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine and Finance
Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn to accompany President Jacques
Chirac on the trip, because he did not want to "leave (Chirac)
alone in this circumstance which is not so comfortable to our
country and Europe."
</P>
<P>
"Europe, and the capacity of France, and my government and
this (parliamentary) majority should take up the challenge that
next time, the concerns of Europe should be taken into account
with more force," said Jospin.

<HEADLINE> France in Favor of International Force for Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- France today expressed its
willingness to send an international peace-keeping force to the
Republic of Congo to help end the factional fighting in the
country.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux told reporters
here that the deployment of an international force
alone would not be enough to resolve the crisis in the republic.
</P>
<P>
"But it could, in the framework of a negotiated settlement,
contribute, in a decisive manner, to consolidating a peaceful way
out and a lasting ceasefire," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also confirmed that fighting in the Congolese capital
Brazzaville between troops led by President Pascal Lissouba and
militia loyal to former president Denis Sassou-Nguesso died down
today after Monday's violent shooting and shelling.
</P>
<P>
The crisis in Congo erupted in 1992 when a coalition government
led by Lissouba, head of the Pan-African Union for Social
Democracy, and Sassou-Nguesso, head of the Congolese Labor Party,
spilt due to sharp differences over power distribution.
</P>
<P>
Factional fighting broke out in 1993 when Sassou-Nguesso
refused to accept the result of a fresh election in which Lissouba
won and established a new government.
</P>
<P>
Fresh fighting erupted on June 5 when forces loyal to
Lissouba surrounded Sassou-Nguesso's home to disarm his private
militia ahead of the planned presidential elections on July 27.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed to a three-day ceasefire last Tuesday and
to extend the truce for another seven days last Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, sporadic fighting resumed on Monday after mortars were
fired on the parliament building in Brazzaville, aiming to prevent
deputies from attending a meeting called by Lissouba to review the
conflict with Sassou-Nguesso.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reaffirms Stance on Mass Destruction Weapons, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government, in a reply
today to a statement issued at the summit of eight developed
nations (G-8), reaffirmed its stance on issues of weapons of mass
destruction and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi declared that Iran
is opposed to all sorts of terrorism but it will continue to
support the people of south Lebanon until the liberation of the
area from the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman termed the advice by the summit in the
U.S. city of Denver, Colorado to ban military cooperation with
Iran as "an excuse to ban the transfer of technology to developing
countries."
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that Iran has no need for the help which the
summit referred to as the nuclearization of Iran.
</P>
<P>
"Iran considers all kinds of control and monopoly by the
industrialized nations as efforts to create a rift between
developing and developed countries and rejects it as being
contrary to all international norms and conventions," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Iran has proved its commitment to
international norms and its opposition to any investment on the
production of all weapons of mass destruction by signing the
international convention on banning chemical weapons and its
subsequent ratification by its parliament.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, "Iran invites all developing countries
to demonstrate greater solidarity to halt such bans and
monopoly."
</P>
<P>
Describing Iran as the main victim of terrorism sponsored by
"certain states," the spokesman said Iran calls on "these states
to seriously avoid selective approach to the phenomenon of
terrorism and not to allow supporters of terrorist organizations
by using their discriminatory double standards to promote inhumane
and violent methods."
</P>
<P>
The G-8 group, comprising the United States, Britain, France,
Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan and Russia, discussed, in its
two-day annual session ending Sunday, voiced their determination
to fight terrorism and oppose concessions of terrorist demands.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that Iran attaches great importance to stability
and security in the Middle East and considers the "Zionist
regime" as the "instigator of crisis in the region and the main
agent of insecurity and state-sponsored terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi called on the industrialized countries to stop using
"double standards in arming Israel with destructive weapons as
well as bring pressure on the regime occupying Qods (Jerusalem) to
honor its commitments to international norms particularly
regarding the control of its atomic weapons centers and make the
region free of mass destruction weapons."
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the official Iranian news agency IRNA as
saying that the summit leaders neglected what he termed as the
expansionist policies of Israel in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman criticized the G-8 leaders for having acted
against U.N. resolutions and the rights of the Muslims and the
Arabs, calling for the complete restoration of the rights of the
Palestinians and the liberation of all occupied Arab territories
including the Golan Heights of Syria and south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> HK's Financial Status Guaranteed by Basic Law and Sino- </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The successful implementation of
the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) and the Sino-British Joint Declaration will safeguard Hong
Kong's current status as an international financial center.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came from Rafael Hui Si-yan, secretary for
Financial Services in the current and future Hong Kong
governments, at a press briefing in the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center here today.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR stipulates that after its
return to China, Hong Kong will maintain its status as an
international financial center. The markets for foreign exchange,
gold, securities and futures will continue to open with a free
flow of capital, and the Hong Kong dollar will continue to
circulate and remain freely convertible.
</P>
<P>
"All these stipulations will guarantee Hong Kong's status as an
international financial center," Hui said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the future HKSAR government will strive to
keep its commitment to the principle of non-interference in the
operation of the financial market, while making every effort to
provide a business environment that is open, flexible, fair and in
compliance with the international standard.
</P>
<P>
"To enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness, the SAR government
will further improve the mechanism of settlement in the banks, set
up a complete financial supervisory set-up, and expand cooperation
with securities exchanges in other countries and regions," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, the government will also try to change the
way of flow in the bonds market, to promote further development of
the insurance sector.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the rapid economic growth in the
Asia-Pacific region, especially in China's interior areas, will
provide more opportunities of development for the financial sector
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, Hong Kong is also obliged to play a more important
role in the modernization drive of China's interior areas, by
making greater efforts to raise funds for the economic development
of the interior areas," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said that to date 29 companies from the interior
areas have been listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and
arrangements are being made for matters relating to the listing of
five other companies.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the People's Bank of
China are now discussing their cooperation in the field of
settlement," he added.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Different Areas To Fight Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- China's State Flood Control and
Drought Relief Headquarters and the Ministry of Water Resources
jointly issued an urgent notice today asking different areas to
work hard on drought relief.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of June, many parts north of the Yangtze
River have been plagued by high temperatures and little rainfall,
while record high temperatures hit northern China and western
parts of northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The drought has caused damage to about 17.3 million ha of
crops, 5.8 million ha of which were hit by a severe drought, the
notice said. In late June most parts of north China will have less
rainfall, it noted, and the middle and lower reaches of the
Yangtze River will also suffer from a summer drought.
</P>
<P>
The notice called on areas to take immediate steps to fight the
drought in the following ways:
</P>
<P>
-- Not being overjoyed by a summer harvest that was partly due
to good spring weather, but getting ready instead for the next
harvest in spite of the drought.
</P>
<P>
-- Taking steps to make the most of limited water resources and
to plant as much as is allowable.
</P>
<P>
-- Drought relief organizations should do all they can to
provide farmers with services.
</P>
<P>
-- Departments concerned should be sure that all the capital,
fuels, and other materials needed are available.
</P>
<P>
-- Flood control and drought relief preparations should be made
simultaneously for large rivers and reservoirs for the flood
season.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Sees Market Growth In HK and China's Inland Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Boeing Co. of the United
States has full confidence in the airline industries of Hong Kong
and China's inland areas, a senior company official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Hong Kong International Aerospace Forum, Michael
Zimmerman, president of Boeing China, said that sustained economic
growth in Hong Kong and China's inland areas will promote the
development of airline industries there.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that, in the next 20 years, airline industries in
China's interior areas and Hong Kong will record an annual average
increase of 8.7 percent, double that of the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the number of people flying into and out of
China will rise sharply, far exceeding the annual growth of 4.9
percent in the number of travelers globally," he said.
</P>
<P>
The aviation market in China's inland areas will be one with
the fastest growth in the world, he said. "Our latest estimates
indicate that the aviation market in China's inland areas will
expand at an annual growth of 10.3 percent on average and that the
market in 2016 will be seven times as large as that of today."
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, that is good news for Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that, "as an international financial and
commercial center, Hong Kong will play an increasingly important
role in the economic development of China's inland areas after its
return to China (on July 1 this year), and in return it will
benefit from the economic growth in the inland areas."
</P>
<P>
All these demonstrate that Hong Kong will continue to play its
role as the hub of airline industries in the Asia-Pacific region,
he said.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Executive Council Decided Package of Remunerations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Executive Council (ExCo) of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) today
announced the decision on package remunerations concerning some
members of the bodies of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The decision was based on the recommendations from the
Independent Commission on Remuneration for Members of the
Executive Council and the Legislature of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Chief Executive Office of the HKSAR said
that the Executive Council has taken into account the nature and
volume of the workload of the Chief Executive, the Executive
Council and the Provisional Legislature, both before and after
July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said that the HKSAR ExCo decided that the Chief Executive's
remuneration will be the same as the existing package for the Hong
Kong governor (whose monthly salary is 253,312.5 HK dollars),
including leave, passages, and medical benefits.
</P>
<P>
As a local person, the Chief Executive should pay income tax on
his salary, non-accountable entertainment allowance and contract
gratuity.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive should also pay excise duty on alcoholic
beverages purchased for official entertainment.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the HKSAR ExCo also endorsed the
recommendation of the Independent Commission that members of the
Provisional Legislature should be paid a lump sum of 100,000 HK
dollars for their service between February and June 1997, adding
that members who also serve on the existing Legislative Council
will receive half the amount, i.e. 50,000 HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that the provision for the president of the Legislative
Council is doubled to 200,000 HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chief Executive has accepted the Commission's
recommendation that non-official members of the HKSAR ExCo should
receive the same amount of taxable honorarium as existing ExCo
members, which is 66,270 HK dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
The convenor of the HKSAR ExCo, like the former senior member
of ExCo, is entitled to a higher level of honorarium of 106,110 HK
dollars. This is to give recognition to his role in coordinating
among the non-official members and assisting the Chief Executive
in taking forward ExCo-related matters.
</P>
<P>
The Independent Commission was appointed in March this year.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Help Small Businesses With New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Department of
Trade and Industry (DTI) is planning to replace its existing
export assistance scheme with a new export scheme, hoping to add
benefits for small businesses, local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The the new export scheme, the Export Marketing and Investment
Assistance Scheme (EMIA) is aimed to compensate exporters for
costs incurred in developing export markets, said DTI Assistant
Director Mohammed Vawda at a function in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
The EMIA, divided into eight sub-schemes to assist exporters
in areas ranging from export market research, offshore
exhibitions, and attracting foreign investors, is expected to
come into full operation early August.
</P>
<P>
The project will offer participants benefits including
subsidized airline tickets, a daily subsistence allowance for
overseas travel, payment of transport while in the export market,
and grants to set up industry export councils offshore.
</P>
<P>
Vawda said attracting local enterprises to attend
international trade exhibitions is an important and popular
benefit offered by the DTI.
</P>
<P>
However, the benefits provided by EMIA will only be available
to exporters of goods of South African origin, and will not be
provided to service industries, said Vawda.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Meets With Russian First Deputy Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing, meeting
with Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov here today,
said that bilateral relations have developed smoothly since the
meeting of Premier Li Peng and Russia's Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin last December.
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov is here to make preparations for the second regular
meeting between Li and Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
Li said that President Jiang Zemin's Russia visit in April was
successful and that the strategic and cooperative partnership has
made new progress. This is significant for the long-term
friendship and mutual beneficial cooperation between the two
countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
China places great importance on cooperation with Russia, Li
said, and political, economic, and trade ties are a major part of
bilateral relations, and that economic and trade ties are the
basis for political relations.
</P>
<P>
Li said that to increase bilateral trade to 20 billion US
dollars by the end of the the century, the two should first
implement the agreements reached at Li and Chernomyrdin's meeting
in December.
</P>
<P>
At same time we should take advantage of the economies and
geography of the two countries, tapping the cooperative potential,
seeking new channels and ways, and improve economic and trade
relations between the two sides to meet Sino-Russian strategic and
cooperative partnership demands.
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov said that he was pleased to have a chance to visit
China at this time on the eve of the return of Hong Kong to the
motherland and expressed his pleasure with the smooth development
of bilateral relations. He said that Russia places great
importance on its relations with China, and bilateral cooperation,
and hopes that the two countries can work together to advance
bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that bilateral trade volume is less than 7 billion US
dollars at present, and that this is very small and not fitting
for the status of the two countries as big powers,
</P>
<P>
Saying that the two countries' aim in bilateral trade of 20
billion US dollars by the year 2000 is high, he noted that the two
countries will try their best to reach that goal. Russia and China
should increase their cooperation in the fields of energy and
fuels, and engage in some major projects.
</P>
<P>
Nemtsov arrived here Monday at the invitation of vice-premier
Li Lanqing.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Deputy Minister Briefed on Lesotho's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho High Commissioner to
South Africa Lincoln Mokose has briefed South African Deputy
Foreign Affairs Minister Aziz Pahad on tension between political
parties in Lesotho, said reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued in Pretoria by the Department of Foreign
Affairs of South Africa confirmed the meeting between Mokose and
Pahad on Monday, but did not elaborate on their discussions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Lesotho Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle
resigned from his ruling Basotholand Congress Party (BCP) to form
a new party, the Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD), and
transferred the government power to the newly formed party.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle's move stunned the small land-locked kingdom, forcing
opposition parties to form a coalition with the BCP, which
condemned the move and termed it unconstitutional, said the
reports.
</P>
<P>
The coalition called for the resignation of Mokhehle and
planned a series of protest actions in Maseru, capital of the
kingdom, making the situation even worse.
</P>
<P>
On Monday,South African Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo,
who met Lesotho government officials a few days earlier, said
South Africa would be prepared to help resolve the conflict
between Lesotho's political parties if it was asked to do so.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lesotho high commissioners in Zimbabwe and Botswana
had also been instructed to brief their host governments on the
situation in Lesotho, the source said.

<P>
Nicholas Ng Wing Fui, Secretary for Constitutional Affairs,
told a press briefing held here that the Sino-British Joint
Declaration is far-sighted in concept, with emphasis placed on
maintaining Hong Kong's vigor and characteristics, and on making
sure that Hong Kong will implement the policy of "one country, two
systems," "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong," and a "high
degree of autonomy" after its return to China.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is under such a general framework that Hong
Kong will continue to enjoy long-term prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary told Chinese and foreign reporters that the
establishment of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) was
intended to facilitate the consultation between the Chinese and
British governments on the implementation of the Joint
Declaration, the discussions about matters related to Hong Kong's
handover, and the exchange of views on matters decided upon by the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of the JLG in 1985, the Chinese and
British sides have reached many agreements falling into four
categories, i.e., maintaining the rule of law, the guarantee of
human rights, improving construction of the economic foundation
and the related systems, and ensuring the smooth transfer of
power.

<HEADLINE> Problem For Many Chinese Elderly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- About 80 percent of the elderly
Chinese suffer from the bone disease osteoporosis and that females
are more susceptible, a Chinese doctor told a symposium on
osteoporosis marking the first World Osteoporosis Day today.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Liu Zhonghou, chairman of the Osteoporosis Committee of
the China Gerontological Society, warned that because of the rapid
aging of the Chinese population, if effective disease-prevention
measures are not taken, the number of patients will increase to
some 110 million by 2010, and exceed 200 million by the middle of
the next century.
</P>
<P>
"At present, China has about 84 million osteoporosis sufferers
out of 110 million people 60 years of age or older, the largest
number in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Female osteoporosis patients are six times the number of males
in China, Liu said, and that as they get older their bones are
more susceptible to fractures.
</P>
<P>
But many people still underestimate the danger of the disease
and pay little attention to it. Studies show that only ten percent
of Asians know about osteoporosis, and the percentage is even
lower in China.
</P>
<P>
In order to increase people's awareness, the European
Foundation For Osteoporosis began World Osteoporosis Day
activities this year.
</P>
<P>
Experts have suggested old people eat more calcium-rich food,
get some sun, and do proper physical exercises to prevent the
disease.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was attended by some 500 experts from the China
Gerontological Society and the Chinese Medical Association. They
also discussed a new calcium-rich supplement developed by France's
Innotech International, sponsor of the symposium.

<HEADLINE> Senior Chinese Official on Housing Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councilor Li Tieying
told a recent symposium on housing reform of some provinces and
municipalities that reforms should be intensified along with the
acceleration of housing construction in urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee, told those gathered for the symposium in Baotou City,
in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region that civil housing should
become a new economic growth area and a new consuming area.
</P>
<P>
He called for further implementation of various reform
policies, saying that since the economic situation is sound it
provides a good opportunity to increase them.
</P>
<P>
An efforts should be made to apply the system of raising funds
for housing publically in more places, and that some enterprises,
institutions, and cities with better conditions should halt the
practice of providing housing for employees as welfare, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He urged related departments and institutions at all levels to
draw up plans to help people with special difficulties buy houses.
</P>
<P>
"A housing management system that caters to the socialist
market economy should be set up as soon as possible," Li
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Urges Enterprise Groups To Play Bigger Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng, meeting in
Beijing today with leaders of eight enterprise groups, said that
enterprise reforms should be combined with reorganization,
renovation, and improved management in state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
This is in keeping with the goal of setting up a modern
enterprise system to make enterprise groups play a bigger role in
economic development and restructuring, he said.
</P>
<P>
Developing enterprise groups not only meets the need of the
country's economic development but also is a trend in world
economic development, Li said.
</P>
<P>
These groups should be formed in accordance with their
situation and under the guidance of the state's macro-economic
controls and policy, he said, noting that 120 enterprises have
been approved by the State Council to test the group policy.
</P>
<P>
The 120 firms account for a fourth of the total assets, sales
and pre-tax profits of all state-owned enterprises, while their
net profits exceed half the total, Li said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Diplomat on Hong Kong Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, the 44-year-old career diplomat
said that the Australian government announced in late May it
accepts the passport of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region(HKSAR) for visa-issuing purposes, according it equivalent
treatment to that given to the British National (Overseas)
passport issued by Britain.
</P>
<P>
"This illustrates Australian government's support to the
confidence in Hong Kong's future", the consul general said.
</P>
<P>
As two important economic powerhouses in the Asia-Pacific
region, Australia and Hong Kong traditionally share important and
strong economic and trade relations. In 1996, Hong Kong was
Australia's fourth largest source and the sixth largest
destination of foreign investment, and the twelfth largest export
market. Meanwhile Australia was Hong Kong's eleventh largest
export market and the thirteenth largest source of imports.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are about 350 major Australian companies
operating in Hong Kong, plus smaller presence of other 1,000
Australian companies.
</P>
<P>
In a survey done last year, Australian business people in Hong
Kong overwhelmingly expressed the view that Hong Kong will
continue to be a good place to do business with and from.
</P>
<P>
"This shows the sentiment of the Australian business community
here is basically optimistic", noted Mr. Walsh, who has been
working in Hong Kong for two years.
</P>
<P>
"All the economic fundamentals of Hong Kong have been pointing
to the good outlook of Hong Kong," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Education and immigration are also two important fields for
exchange.
</P>
<P>
Australia is the second largest overseas destination only after
the United States for Hong Kong students seeking studies, with new
enrollment of about 4,000 each year.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are over 100,000 Hong Kongers settling down
in Australia, composing an important force of the local economy.
</P>
<P>
According to the consul general, while education exchanges have
remained strong, the applications for immigrating to Australia has
been declined in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the movement of people will remain as smooth as
before and this will be conducive to the economic and trade
exchanges," Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
Walsh, who has been to China at regular intervals with
high-ranking Australian government delegations since 1984, said he
has been deeply impressed by the "dramatic changes taking place in
China".
</P>
<P>
"The Sino-Australian relationship has been strengthened by our
prime Minister John Howard's recent visit to China and by Chinese
Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to our country," he observed.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, as an international business center, has always been
a link between Australia and the broad interior areas of China.
The handover will surely enhance the already strong
Sino-Australian bilateral relations, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"It's exciting and challenging to work in Hong Kong at this
period of time. With the number of Australians visiting Hong Kong
on constant rise, the work of the Consulate has been very busy,"
Walsh said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Language Course Increasingly Popular in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 20 middle-aged Hong
Kongers are learning and practising a song entitled "The
descendants of the Dragon" in standard Chinese (Putonghua) at a
civil servants' training center when the reporter entered the
room.
</P>
<P>
This is the ninth class for the intermediate Putonghua course
with three hours for each session, said Teng, a learner who is
working at the Rating and Valuation Department of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Teng said he couldn't speak a single word of Putonghua before
attending the course. Nevertheless, upon his graduation from the
junior class, he applied to study at the intermediate class and
has since made great progress.
</P>
<P>
It is worthwhile to learn Putonghua though it takes much time
and effort in the wake of the growing exchanges between Hong Kong
and the interior areas over recent years.
</P>
<P>
Wong Hsien-hua, director of the civil servants' training
section, said his section started to teach Putonghua back in 1982,
and then merely 40 people were recruited. As Hong Kong's
cooperation with the interior kept growing, 7,000 civil servants
came to study in 1996, and the number of trainees this year will
be same as last year.
</P>
<P>
Lam Wei-wen, a native of Macao who raised in Hong Kong, was
seen  practising hard with the song "A Crescent Moon". He said
that as a Chinese, he should be good at speaking the Chinese
language.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua that he often practises speaking Putonghua with
his wife and his son at home so as to speed up his learning in a
hope to communicate with people from interior areas at an early
date.

PARIS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- France today formally joined the
international process to ban anti-personnel mines by the end of
the century, an initiative first proposed by Canada.
</P>
<P>
Joelle Bourgois, French ambassador to the International

today supporting the process which will lead to the signing
of an international treaty in December calling for a complete
ban on the mines, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported.
</P>
<P>
France banned the production of anti-personnel mines in October
1996, but had failed to renounce the use of such mines by its
armed forces in security operations.
</P>
<P>
"France decided to renounce, from the coming into force of an
effective treaty and by the end of 1999 at the latest, the use of
the mines," Bourgois told a conference on the so-called Ottawa
Process attended by representatives from 161 countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Religious groups in Beijing who
held a symposium today to greet the return of Hong Kong to the
motherland said that the return of Hong Kong will not only erase
the Chinese nation's disgrace of suffering from foreign
aggression, but will also inspire members of religious groups to
strive for the peaceful reunification and prosperity of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Puchu, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), spoke
about how Hong Kong was ceded to Britain and how the struggles of
the Chinese people against foreign invaders began.
</P>
<P>
He praised the "one country, two systems" concept, saying that
it will help maintain the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong as
well as world peace, and will increase international exchanges and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Zhao, who is president of the Buddhist Association of China,

patriotism and the "one country, two systems" concept among their
people.
</P>
<P>
Ye Xiaowen, director of the Bureau of Religious Affairs of the

<HEADLINE> German Firm, Singapore Monetary Exchange Agree on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore International
Monetary Exchange (SIMEX) and Deutsche Borse AG, the holding
company of DTB Deutsche Terminborse, signed here today a linkage
agreement to trade DTB's BUND and BOBL futures and options as well
as SCHATZ futures contracts on the floor of the SIMEX.
</P>
<P>
SIMEX Chairman Victor Liew said at a press conference, "This
linkage with DTB represents an important step towards developing
European products for trading during the Asia-Pacific time zone."
</P>
<P>
"The linkage marks a historic milestone for SIMEX in its drive
to develop as a major center for risk management in its time zone
for the trading of interest rate products to complement its
Eurodollar and Euroyen interest rate contracts," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first such linkage between the DTB and an overseas
exchange," said Jorg Franke, member of Deutsche Borse's Executive
Board.
</P>
<P>
"It is significant in that it makes the way for DTB products to
be traded more intensively in the Asian time zone," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed, the contracts traded on the SIMEX
floor will be fungible with the identical contracts traded at DTB.
All such contracts traded at SIMEX will be transferred at the end
of each trading day to DTB's clearing house for clearing.
</P>
<P>
As part of the cooperative arrangement, SIMEX will sponsor
DTB's application to the Monetary Authority of Singapore for
approval of the installation of DTB trading terminals in Singapore
for the exclusive utilization by SIMEX members which are
authorized by DTB to trade all the contracts listed by DTB on its
electronic trading system.
</P>
<P>
The linkage agreement will have an initial term of five years
with provisions for renewal for successive periods of five years.
</P>
<P>
Subject to regulatory approvals in Singapore and Germany, both
exchanges are working towards having the linkage arrangement put
in place by March 31 next year. But SIMEX officials said that they
believed it would be there much earlier.

BRUSSELS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- High economic growth has put
pollution reduction goals in the Netherlands out of reach, a
report by the national public health and environmental authority
has warned.
</P>
<P>
Despite earlier progress made in curbing greenhouse gases,
including carbon dioxide, experts at the State Institute for
Public Health and Environment now say the situation is likely to
worsen again as an expanding economy and wealthier citizens use
more gas-generating fossil fuels such as coal, oil and petrol.
</P>
<P>
The institute, in its recent report, stressed the need for
stricter controls on pollutants such as animal manure,
which can pollute groundwater sources and when vaporized becomes
a component of acid rain. Acid rain is blamed for deforestation
and the dwindling of aquatic species.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Editor to be Tried on Espionage Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Judiciary Chief Ayatollah
Mohammad Yazdi today assured the European countries that an
editor of Iran's liberal magazine caught on charges of espionage
for Germany will have a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Yazdi rejected allegations
that the trial of Faraj Sarkouhi would be politicized because of
tensions in Tehran-Bonn ties in the aftermath of a verdict by a
German court holding top Iranian officials responsible for 1992
killing of four Kurdish dissidents in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
"Sarkouhi's case is merely a legal case. However, he will be
tried for a charge which is political," he said, adding that
Sarkouhi would definitely have a lawyer that would represent him
in court.
</P>
<P>
"We will not allow his trial to proceed if he does not have
an attorney to defend himself," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Yazdi said that he could not confirm reports that
Sarkouhi's trial started Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Based on the instructions I have given, the court
responsible for Sarkouhi's trial is supposed to start the trial
any day," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I have been against delaying his trial. I think enough
information has been gathered and that the courts should not
have delayed the trial," he added.
</P>
<P>
Faraj Sarkouhi, editor of the Persian weekly Adineh, was
arrested along with his brother and two other smugglers while
attempting to make an illegal exit in Bushehr, a port city in
southern Iran in February.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Foreign Ministry had earlier rejected German
intervention in the arrest of the editor, who sought political
asylum in Sweden and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mohammadi, spokesman of Iran's Foreign Ministry, said
"the arrest of the Iranian editor was simply a national issue
that did not warrant the interference of any foreign
government."
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic government could not possibly ignore its own
laws and principles when dealing with a person who has committed
heavy crimes," he said.
</P>
<P>
After Sarkouhi's disappearance in February this year,
international efforts spearheaded by Sweden and Germany have
been made to find out what has happened to the Iranian
journalist who has disappeared twice in three months.

<HEADLINE> China Will Observe Basic Law, Lee Kuan Yew Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Senior Minister Lee
Kuan Yew expressed belief here today that the Chinese leadership
will observe the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law
since this is in their own national interest.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a conference entitled "Countdown to 1997: Roadmap to
Hong Kong's Continued Prosperity," Lee said, "Those groups
pressing China on Hong Kong may find they have helped to frustrate
themselves, because China will make doubly sure it does not breach
the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law."
</P>
<P>
China is aware that the world is watching, and it will go out
of its way to show that Hong Kong can thrive and prosper
economically after its return to China, the senior minister said.
</P>
<P>
China wants a Hong Kong which can "attract funds from abroad
and be an interface with the international community," he noted.
</P>
<P>
For the next 50 years, Hong Kong will be a Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of China, enjoying full autonomy,
except in foreign and defense affairs, under "one country, two
systems," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
"The monetary system will remain intact, and the Hong Kong
people will determine fiscal policy. Equally, if not more
important, the entire legal system will continue to operate as
before," he continued.
</P>
<P>
Lee pointed out that currently, public confidence in the
economy is at a record high, as shown in a survey by Hong
Kong-based South China Morning Post in January this year, and this
confidence is reflected in the strength of the stock and property
markets.
</P>
<P>
The international community shares this confidence, he added.
In September, three months after the handover, the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank will hold their joint annual
meeting in Hong Kong to lend their support for Hong Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
Li told the conference, "Over 800 multinational companies have
their regional headquarters in the city, one-third of them
established in the past five years. Another 1,500 overseas
companies have regional offices in Hong Kong. A recent survey
found that over 90 percent intend to stay after the handover."
</P>
<P>
"They cited favorable banking and financial facilities,
infrastructure and the tax regime as the top three attractions
and, clearly, they believe these attractions will remain
unchanged," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong residents who emigrated are coming back, he said. The
Hong Kong government has estimated that some 12 percent, or about
50,000, of the 420,000 people who left in the decade before 1994,
have returned, while foreigners are flowing in with their
families, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lee also declared Singapore's interest in Hong Kong and in the
Chinese mainland. As of the end of 1995, Singapore's private
sector investments in Hong Kong amounted to 4.5 billion US dollars
and, in the mainland, 2.1 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore government investment, on the other hand,
amounted to another 2 billion US dollars, adding Hong Kong and the
Chinese mainland together, he added.
</P>
<P>
If Singapore did not have confidence in the future of China, it
would not have been investing either in the mainland or in Hong
Kong, he said, adding, "We expect fair returns on these
investments."
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference was organized by the Far Eastern
Economic Review, Asia's premier business newsweekly.
</P>
<P>
S. Y. Chung, convenor of the Executive Council of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region, and Edgar Cheng, chairman of the
Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, among other speakers, addressed the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Business Leader Envisions More Opportunities for HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is expected to
continue to benefit from the strengths that have led to its
success, and to be at "a pole position" to seize the opportunities
created by China's economic growth and opening-up.
</P>
<P>
This is the focal point of a written speech by Henry Tang,
chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries and Member of
the Legislative Council, presented at a symposium on Hong Kong's
continued prosperity after its return to China on July 1 here
today.
</P>
<P>
"As part of one country with two systems," Tang noted, "Hong
Kong is poised to capture the best of both worlds, and that the
combination of Hong Kong's distinct strengths with those of the
mainland is likely to make us a formidable competitor for
companies based anywhere else in the world."
</P>
<P>
After its return to China, Tang said, Hong Kong's status as a
metropolitan heart of an increasingly affluent south China region
will be enhanced now that the barriers to official contact come
down, and both Hong Kong and other south China cities will benefit
from a joint planning of an industry base in the region, and
co-marshalling of the region's human and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will continue to play the role as the main source of
foreign capitals for the interior area, Tang observed, adding that
a growing number of mainland companies will seek to build links
with banks and investors in Hong Kong -- which "are among the main
sources of new jobs and new technologies."
</P>
<P>
Sharing Tang's view that Hong Kong's return to China will
prompt among Hong Kongers an increasing sense of comfort of being
a part of a modernizing China with a bright future, Raymond
Ch'ien, chairman of Hong Kong's Industry and Technology
Development Council, said that Hong Kong should promote the
high-tech sector for its sustained development in the future.
</P>
<P>
The two-day symposium, named Countdown to 1997: Roadmap to Hong
Kong's Continued Prosperity, was sponsored by Far Eastern Economic
Review, one of the most influential economic periodicals in the

<HEADLINE> Growth Triangle Progresses Well in Right Direction: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The
Indonesia-Malaysia-Singapore Growth Triangle (IMS-GT) has
progressed well enough to warrant more and more members being
added.
</P>
<P>
The assessment was made by Linda Low from the National
University of Singapore's Business Faculty in her paper "Overall
Reassessment of the IMS-GT Triangle" at the International
Conference on IMS-GT which opened today in Johor Baharu, about 370
kilometers southeast of here, according to the Malaysian national
news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
The IMS-GT appears to be progressing in the right direction
while several issues and problems are raised for reflection and
rumination, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Indubitably, the biggest challenge facing the pioneer in
growth triangles is the intense growing competition of similar
configurations within ASEAN like IMT-GT
(Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle), BIMP (Brunei,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines) and other projects revolving
around the Mekong River," she observed.
</P>
<P>
She was of the view that the IMS-GT must be consistent and
supportive of wider frameworks of co-operation including ASEAN,
AFTA, APEC and even WTO.
</P>
<P>
She said progress in growth triangles adds incremental value
and confidence to bigger frameworks and they should be tapped as
useful appendages rather than treated as outside these structures.
</P>
<P>
She also said quantity and quality of labor in the IMS-GT as a
competitive attraction needs more attention.
</P>
<P>
Information technology (IT) and networks become an area for
co-operation as skills training and wide application of IT would
be in line with the countries' aspirations as well as investors'
needs, she added.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: The World Has Confidence in Hong Kong (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency today published a
commentary on the return of Hong Kong to the motherland, entitled
"The World Has Confidence in Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Over 8,000 journalists from around the globe are now gathering
in Hong Kong. As the day for the return of Hong Kong approaches,
the territory has become the focus of world opinion. Listening to
the current tide of talk and discussion over Hong Kong, we are
deeply impressed that people from all walks of life place great
confidence in the future development of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The world is watching Hong Kong, for the return of Hong Kong to
the motherland is an extraordinary event in world history. It
serves as an example to the international community of a way to
peacefully resolving historical disputes between countries; it
signals an end to the colonial rule of Britain in the
continent of Asia; and it is a turning point from which peace and
development in Asia and even the whole world could be improved.
</P>
<P>
The world is watching Hong Kong, for it is a global economic
center where a host of countries direct investment and encourage
trade relations, and where all countries find their respective
interests connected to this stable and prosperous land.
</P>
<P>
The world has confidence in Hong Kong, because people have as
much confidence in the principle of "One Country, Two Systems."
Looking back upon the year 1984 when the Sino-British Joint
Declaration was signed, the then British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher applauded the peaceful settlement of the Hong Kong issue,
attributing it to Deng Xiaoping's brilliant concept of "One
Country, Two Systems."
</P>
<P>
The following 13 years has witnessed both social stability and
continual economic development achieved in Hong Kong. All
countries around the globe, in turn, benefit from the stability
and prosperity in Hong Kong. All these testify to the truth that
the policy of "One Country, Two Systems" tallies with the
practical situation, and is in full accordance with that required
of the development of Hong Kong. The goal of long-term prosperity
and stability is sure to be realized with the implementation of
the principle of "One Country, Two Systems."
</P>
<P>
The world has confidence in Hong Kong, because people have
confidence in the stability and the economic development prospects
in China. People rest assured that the Chinese government will
fulfill the Sino-British Joint Declaration and strictly abide by
the Basic Law.

<HEADLINE> Flexible Approach Proposed for Growth Triangle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The
Indonesia-Malaysia-Singapore Growth Triangle (IMS-GT) will have
the best long-term success if local investors develop a flexible
specialization approach.
</P>
<P>
This was suggested by C.P.F. Luhulima, senior fellow of
Indonesia's Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS),
at the two-day international conference on IMS-GT which opened
today in Johor Baharu, about 370 kilometers southeast of here,
according to the Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
He said as the global economy kept shifting towards flexible
specialization, manufacturing firms must be able to meet the
client's need in order to survive and, to build a stable base for
long-term development within the framework of sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
Presenting his paper "Profitability and Sustainability:
Reconciling Conflicting Pressures" at the conference, Luhulima
said the pattern of flexible specialization is appearing
world-wide in which companies develop their own specialization in
one step of industrial processes and then work as sub-contractors
to produce a variety of customized products for different clients.
</P>
<P>
He said there are economic benefits from sub-contracting each
stage of the production process to an enterprise which specializes
in that stage.

<HEADLINE> Black American Detained in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A black American named Joseph
Morris has been detained and put in prison for unlawful
entry into Iran, Iranian judiciary chief revealed here today.
</P>
<P>
The arrest was revealed by Iran's Judiciary Chief Ayatollah
Mohammad Yazdi at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
An aide to the Judiciary chief added that "the gentleman, a
black Muslim, was caught in Ahvaz eight months ago. He has been in
detention since then."
</P>
<P>
A well-informed source at the Judiciary who has met Morris told
Xinhua that Morris is suffering from psychological disorder.
</P>
<P>
"He entered Iran through Pakistani border. When he was caught,
he revealed that he had taken part in the Operation Desert Storm
to drive Iraqis out of Kuwait (in the 1991 Gulf War)," he added.
</P>
<P>
His background has made the official worried that perhaps he is
a spy, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Yazdi denied that there were any other U.S. nationals held
in custody in Iranian jails.
</P>
<P>
"As you know, most Americans left Iran after the Islamic
revolution (in 1979)," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the legal disputes between Iran and the U.S., Yazdi said
that Iran was successful in getting the full reparation from the
U.S. for the families of those killed aboard an Iranian passenger
plane shot down by American forces stationed in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Some 290 Iranian passengers aboard an Airbus-A300 were killed
after their plane was hit by a missile fired by USS Vincenne, a
U.S. Navy Cruiser, in July 1988.
</P>
<P>
"Americans did not want to accept the responsibility for the
downing of the Iranian plane, but in the end they had to accept the
responsibility," Yazdi said.

<TEXT>
<P>
The world has confidence in Hong Kong, because people are
optimistic towards the economic development prospects in Hong
Kong. According to the headquarters of the World Trade
Organization (WTO), a group of internationally prestigious
organizations that specialize in evaluating economic freedom
status, ranked Hong Kong in first place. At the beginning of June,
the "World Economic Tribune" elected Hong Kong as the second most
competitive economic system throughout the world. During the first
half of this year, Hong Kong registered over 20,000 new companies,
324 of which were opened by foreigners, a 12 percent rise compared
with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
It is due to people's confidence in Hong Kong that investment
from various countries is increasing; It is due to people's
confidence in Hong Kong that 34 countries have granted Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) the visa-free treatment; And
it is due to people's confidence in Hong Kong that nearly a
thousand political VIPs and celebrities from all countries will
attend the handover ceremony and the inauguration ceremony of SAR.
</P>
<P>
Because it will return to the motherland, Hong Kong is
receiving unprecedentedly close attention; Because it will return
to the motherland, Hong Kong is winning honors never thought of
before; Because it will return to the motherland, Hong Kong is
gaining new opportunities for development. With the effort of over
six million Hong Kong people, together with the support from its
strong motherland and high-degree attention of the central
government, the concept of "One Country, Two Systems" will
undoubtedly achieve successful implementation in Hong Kong, and
the territory's long-term stability and prosperity will come true
in all likelihood.

<HEADLINE> Macao-Born Portuguese on "One Country, Two Systems" Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Macao-Born Portuguese (MBP) believe
Hong Kong's experience in implementing the concept of "one
country, two systems" will be of importance to Macao, and they
wish the policy every success here in the territory.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Marreiros, who was head of the Macao Cultural Institute
and plans to stay on in Macao after the handover in 1999, said
Hong Kong's experience will help ensure the success of the policy
to be carried out also in Macao.
</P>
<P>
"I think Macao can learn a lot from the valuable experience in
Hong Kong in turning the concept into reality," the 40-year-old
architect told Xinhua in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
Born in Macao but educated in Lisbon, Marreiros and others
founded a MBP organization called "Root in Macao" last year,
which, he said, shows their confidence in Macao's future beyond
1999.
</P>
<P>
The MBP community, whose population totals about 10,000, showed
its strength for the first time last year when it participated as
a group in the election of the 6th Macao Legislative Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely hope that the concept of 'one country, two
systems' will be carried out successfully in Macao," he
said. "That is the fundamental guarantee of the life of us MBP."
</P>
<P>
His views were echoed by another MBP, Antonio J. Dias Azedo, a
solicitor who has also decided to continue to dwell in Macao after
1999.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that the promise of lifestyle remaining
unchanged after 1999, which is written into the Basic Law of
Macao, will become a fact," he told Xinhua. "I will stay on so
long as I have a job and can live here. Macao is my hometown."
</P>
<P>
"Macao should take vigorous future-oriented measures concerning
its administration and legal structure," said Azedo," so that
Macao residents can keep their current lifestyle in the future."
</P>
<P>
An MBP member at Macao Legislative Assembly, Leonel Alberto
Alves, said the current (political) structure could not meet the
challenges ahead if further efforts were not made.
</P>
<P>
"Although some major work has been done in the past decade
since the signing of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration," he
said, "we must take further reforms in our legal and
administrative structure."
</P>
<P>
Jose Maneiras, former chairman of the Macao Municipal Council,
was optimistic about the future, as the governments of both China
and Portugal have been carrying out promises in the Joint
Declaration faithfully.
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing to worry about Macao's future," he said. "I
will continue to live in this place where I was born, and continue
to serve Macao as a citizen of the city."

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Remain international Financial Center: Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The historic handover on June
30, 1997, will not affect adversely Hong Kong's status as an
international financial center in the next five or ten years,
according to an economist with Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, Dr. Miron Mushkat, Lehman Brothers' chief
economist for Asia-pacific Region, said here today that Hong
Kong's return to China will prove beneficial for the Hong Kong
economy in the short term.
</P>
<P>
In a panel discussion on Hong Kong's future in an investor's
perspective, the Warsaw-born economist said: "Hong Kong's economy
is moving smoothly. Looking forward, we believe the growing
momentum will sustain."
</P>
<P>
At one-week countdown to July 1, 1997, when China resumes the
exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong, the chief economist
expected greater economic integration between Hong Kong and the
inland areas in the flow of capital and labor. A well-performed
Chinese economy plus the growing integration will produce an
incentive to Hong Kong's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Hong Kong is becoming the center of a
larger region, which covers Macao, and the coastal special
economic zones in southern China, including Zhuhai and Shenzhen.
"With the growing economies of scale, we expect greater efficiency
and greater economic strength. This is the feature of Hong Kong's
economic environment in the next a few years," said Dr. Mushkat.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Hong Kong's status as an international
financial center will be preserved in the medium term.
</P>
<P>
"In an economic perspective, the more China opens up, the more
China reforms, the more China decentralizes, the more China needs
a middleman like Hong Kong, which serves as a bridge between China
and the rest of the world," said Dr. Mushkat, now a Hong Kong
permanent resident, who has been living in this Asian city for 18
years.
</P>
<P>
In the provision of intermediary services, he noted that Hong
Kong continues to enjoy a comparative advantage in economies of
scale, supporting industries of international trade, a
cosmopolitan outlook and a biculatural and bilingual character.
"Shanghai will have no realistic challenge to Hong Kong in the
medium term," he added.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Mushkat said that to maintain its status as an
international financial center, Hong Kong needs to maintain its
present legal system, keep an effective and neutral civil service,
ensure a free flow of information, keep corruption at bay, and
maintain a free and market-driven economy.

<HEADLINE> Building A Mighty, Civilized Force to Be Stationed in Hong Kong (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The People's Liberation Army
(PLA) troops to be stationed in Hong Kong are strictly following
requirements set for the whole army by Jiang Zemin, Chairman of
the Central Military Commission (CMC), that they be qualified
politically, competent militarily, have fine style of work, strict
discipline and adequate logistical support.
</P>
<P>
A working group of the CMC and the PLA's General Staff
Headquarters, General Political Department, and General Logistics
Department recently examined the troops' performance and found
their military and political quality, awareness of legal affairs,
level of culture, and logistic support up to high standard. They
were found to have acquired the ability to carry out the duty that
they are sworn to in the defense of Hong Kong in an exemplary way.
</P>
<P>
They were established on the basis of Deng Xiaoping's concept
of "One Country, Two Systems" and are a strong ground, naval and
air force.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee and the CMC
have paid a great deal of attention to building the force and have
placed great importance on it. Jiang Zemin and other CMC leaders
have visited the troops repeatedly to inspect them and guide their
work.
</P>
<P>
Jiang emphasized the high standards and strict requirements for
the PLA Hong Kong troops and said they must be first-class in
ideology, military training, style of work, discipline, education,
and logistic support, and must demonstrate that the PLA is a
mighty and civilized force.
</P>
<P>
The troops have conscientiously followed Jiang's instructions
and have put ideological and political construction at the top of
their agenda. The officers and men have studied Deng Xiaoping's
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the
Party's basic line to develop their convictions firmly.
</P>
<P>
The officers and men have been taught a revolutionary world
outlook, a sense of duty and of regulations. They have come to
realize that duty and discipline are first and foremost and that
they represent the strength of the country and the military.
</P>
<P>
The PLA troops to be stationed in Hong Kong place great
importance on organizations at the basic level, and 77 companies
have been chosen as advanced units, while 28 units and 65 officers
and men have been commended by the CMC, or by the three general
departments of the PLA, or the military area command.

<HEADLINE> Reduced Habitat Forces Tigers to Maul People: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- An expert of the Worldwide Fund
for Nature has blamed the decreasing size of the Sumatran tiger's
habitat for the attacks that killed three people in Indonesia's
West Lampung province recently.
</P>
<P>
"The dwindling size of their natural habitat has caused the
Sumatran tigers to go on a rampage," expert on tigers Ron Lilley
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Natural Resources Conservation Center in Lampung said
Monday it is trying to catch a Sumatran tiger that has killed
three people and injured three others in Sumerjaya subdistrict
between June 7 and 20.
</P>
<P>
Lilley said people have converted the tiger's habitat into
plantations or settlement areas, prompting the animal to retaliate
by attacking people.
</P>
<P>
Lilley, who is also head for conservation of animal species,
thus called for integrated planning on the use of the country's
natural resources.
</P>
<P>
He also urged local administrations to preserve the natural
habitat of wild animals and provide a buffer zone for them.

The PLA Hong Kong troops have made improving the culture of
their officers and men the main part of their work. There are
specific regulations on ethics, behaviour, and language of all
officers and men, including drivers, telephone operators, mess
hall personnel, medical workers, and guards. And officers and men
are taught to strictly abide by these rules.
</P>
<P>
In order to educate officers and men about the law, the troops
have organized 37 seminars and more than 40 speech contests and
competitions. They have invited experts who participated in
drafting the Basic Law and the Law Concerning Stationing Troops to
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (the Garrison Law) to
give lectures. They have also published a number of books to
increase legal awareness of the officers and men.
</P>
<P>
All the officers and men have learned the Basic Law, the
Garrison Law, and related laws of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region by heart. In five public demonstrations the
strict discipline and quality of the officers and men of the PLA
Hong Kong troops have won praise from people in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
While placing importance on basic training, the PLA Hong Kong
troops have also engaged in defence training for Hong Kong,
improving their mobility and ability to react to an
emergency. More than 97 percent of them have been rated
"excellent" in 145 training courses.
</P>
<P>
More than 800 officers and men of the ground force have been
praised for their military performance. All boats, ships, and
captains of the naval force have passed training courses. New
aircraft commanders and pilots in the air force have all acquired
all-weather flight capabilities, and new equipment has been
brought up to strength.
</P>
<P>
Logistic support of the PLA Hong Kong troops will be guaranteed
by a rear base in neighboring Shenzhen. An 87-hectare farm built
by them from a tract of overgrown wasteland can produce 290,000
kilograms of vegetables, 53,000 kilograms of eggs, and 25,000
kilograms of fish annually. A modern logistic support system is in
operation.
</P>
<P>
A senior officer of the troops said that they are a
well-trained force, and one that the Party, the motherland and the
people can fully count on.
</P>
<P>
With the return of Hong Kong to the motherland, the PLA Hong
Kong troops will stand in front of the Hong Kong compatriots as a
mighty and civilized force, the officer concluded.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Court to Try German Companies Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced today that it will
soon start the trial of German companies which offered chemical
weapons to Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war in 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The judiciary Chief Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi said at a press
conference that a Iranian court has completed investigation
into German involvement in the Iraqi chemical attacks against
Iran.
</P>
<P>
Yazdi said, it is till undecided whether it will be an open
trial. However, he declined to name the German companies, saying
that Iran has been told by German authorities that some of the
companies involved have already been put on trial in Germany.
</P>
<P>
"They have told us that they have prosecuted these
companies. Naturally the trials held in Germany cannot answer our
questions," he added.
</P>
<P>
Yazdi held top German officials responsible for the shipment of
chemical weapons to Iraq
</P>
<P>
"The export of chemical materials could not have been
without the permission of government officials," he added.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the trial would take a long time because
there were different companies that were involved.
</P>
<P>
In April, a German court found Iranian leaders responsible for
the killing of four Kurdish dissidents in a restaurant in Berlin
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Iran retaliated by preparing a lawsuit against 24 German
companies responsible for supplying Iraq with the chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
On April 7, the judicial authorities demanded 24 German firms and a
number of German government officials to appear in an Iranian court
on charges for chemical weapon supply to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian authorities did not published the names
of the 24 German companies nor names of German government officials
involved in the chemical supply deal.
</P>
<P>
Last December, Iran accused 84 German companies, including
Toysen, Zigma and Hebergerbau, of supplying chemical weapons to
Iraq during the war.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah Mazandarani, Secretary General of the Association for
Helping Victims of Iraq's Chemical Warfare, said that Iran has
collected a considerable volume of information regarding Germany
in connection with chemical weapon supplies to Iraq during the
eight-year war.
</P>
<P>
He said that some 25,000 Iranians were killed and 65,000 others
were injured in the war with Iraq as victims of chemical bombs.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to German firms there were some 18 U.S. and
British firms that were supplying (chemical weapons to) the
Iraqis," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that most of the chemicals were given to Baghdad under
the cover of providing pesticide to the Iraqis.

<HEADLINE> Johnson Waits for IAAF Call on Wildcard Invite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Double Olympic champion Michael
Johnson said here on Tuesday that he was still waiting to hear
from the IAAF about a possible wild card entry for the world
championships in Athens in August.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, unable to run in the American trials because of a
strained quadricep muscle suffered in his 150 meters duel with
Canadian 100 meters world record holder Donovan Bailey, said it
was up to the 'highly paid IAAF executives' whether he received an
invitation or not.
</P>
<P>
"I am just focussing on my race in Paris on Wednesday. If they
decided to ring me and ask me as a wildcard entry then I would
consider it," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, France's Marie-Jose Perec, who also claimed double
Olympic gold last year, said it was not a good idea to award wild
card entries.
</P>
<P>
"If you do that then you might as well forget national
championships. It's not fair that people like Michael Johnson and
Gail Devers can walk in to a championship event while others have
to go through the normal process of qualifiying," the Frenchwoman
said.
</P>
<P>
An IAAF official said they had received plenty of queries over
the situation and that it would be discussed.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Seeks Inflows of Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's four states, part
of the Indonesia-Malaysia-Singapore Growth Triangle (IMS-GT), are
actively seeking inflows of foreign investment for high-technology
operations.
</P>
<P>
The four states -- Johor, Melaka (Malacca), Negeri Sembilan and
Pahang -- would make the southern peninsular a highly attractive
region for inward investments, Johor chief minister Abdul Ghani
Othman said when opening the "International Conference on IMS-GT:
Borderless Area for Sustainable Progress" in Johor Baharu, about
370 kilometers southeast of here, today.
</P>
<P>
"We focus on the quality of investments rather than the
quantity with a shift towards more capital and
technology-intensive activities," he was quoted by the Malaysian
national news agency Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said entrepreneurs from the four states were also encouraged
to undertake reverse investment in surrounding countries,
especially in the growth triangle.
</P>
<P>
The IMS-GT has the potential to develop as a critically
important international trade center since it is strategically
located along one of the world's busiest shipping routes and at
the heart of a resource rich and dynamic region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the four states in Malaysia, the IMS-GT covers
Singapore and the provinces of Riau, West Sumatera, Jambi,
Bengkulu, South Sumatera, Lampung and West Kalimantan in
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The IMS-GT's geographical area is 565,000 square kilometers
with a market size of 34 million people.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's investments in Indonesia and Singapore exceed 2.1
billion ringgit (about 840 million U.S. dollars). In 1996,
Singapore alone was estimated to invest 4.8 billion ringgit (about
1.92 billion U.S. dollars) in manufacturing projects in Malaysia,
the bulk of it in the IMS-GT.
</P>
<P>
The IMS-GT provides a framework for bilateral and trilateral
cooperation in various sectors that include manufacturing,
agriculture, forestry, tourism, shipping and communications.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference aims to bring together key government
officials and private sector delegates to discuss the future
direction of the growth triangle and to obtain input on how
cooperation can be enhanced, Bernama said.

<HEADLINE> hkhk - British Grandmother Arrives in HK on Round-the-World Helicopter Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A 56-year-old grandmother
arrived here on Tuesday on a round-the-world helicopter flight to
raise money for a Hong Kong-based charity organization.
</P>
<P>
Since their departure from Denham of Britain on May 10 this
year, Jennifer Murray and co-pilot Quentin Smith have been
traveling for 46 out of the 97 days planned for their super-long
trip, "almost non-stop" as Murray described.
</P>
<P>
Upon arriving in Hong Kong, they have covered nearly half of
their total distance of 24,000 miles (38,400 kilometers) and are
about one third of the way around the world, after visiting 20 out
of the 30 countries and regions on their schedule.
</P>
<P>
The red G-Murray light helicopter is the first and last
civilian British helicopter to fly into Hong Kong and will be here
during the historic handover, thus making it the first civilian
British helicopter to fly out of Hong Kong after it becomes a
special administrative region of China at midnight on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Housewife, mother and grandmother, Murray has been flying since
learning it in 1994 and she has now over 600 hours of flying
experience.
</P>
<P>
Jennifer got married in 1966 to Simon Murray, who is Executive
Chairman Asia Pacific for Deutsche Bank Group. Having spent their
last 30 years in Hong Kong, they have three children and two grand
children.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old Smith, a former freestyle helicopter flying
world champion, is an instructor of his father helicopter company
HeliAir, the largest private helicopter training company in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
From the expedition, Save the Children Fund (Hong Kong) has so
far received donations of 447,985 HK dollars (57,433 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Although they have avoided such bad weather conditions as
storms, cyclones and monsoon rains, the worst to date took place
during their flight across the British Channel, Murray said at a
post-landing press conference here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We were really lucky so far on the trip," she smiled.
</P>
<P>
After a stop over here to witness Hong Kong's handover just a
week away, the pair will leave on July 2 for their next stop in
Japan. They are scheduled to return to Denham on August 15 this
year.

CANBERRA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended today
slightly higher, but the market remains tentative ahead of next
week's Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) board meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed in Sydney at 75.21 U.S. cents, up
from 75.11 at yesterday's close.
</P>
<P>
"With official rates now at parity, any sign that U.S. and
Australian rates may cross over can only intensify negative market
sentiment about the Australian dollar," Commonwealth Bank of
Australia said in its June quarter Economic Outlook publication.
</P>
<P>
But Citibank Ltd. economists Stephen Koukoulas and Annette
Beacher said in a commentary that the Australian dollar currently
looks cheap in a short- to medium-term perspective at levels
approaching 75 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
On the cross rates, the Australian dollar ended weaker.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israel to Conduct Research on Industrial Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Hebrew University of Jerusalem
has launched a new unit to research the country's worsening
industrial health, reported The Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
The new academic unit is to develop university-level curricula
in industrial health and train manpower for research and work in
the field.
</P>
<P>
It will conduct surveys and promote monitoring in workplaces.
Students will work toward a master's degree in environmental
sciences with specialization in industrial hygiene.
</P>
<P>
One of the unique devices in the lab is an infra-red
spectrophometer, which detects fumes from organic compounds in the
air. It is the only one of its kind in Israel and will enable
experts to conduct research on the dangers of such compounds in
the workplace.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the academic and laboratory
department, Bracha Ben-Zvi, head of the Labor and Social Affairs
Ministry's committee on prevention and research in occupational
health, said that work accidents cost the country's economy some
470 million dollars and 3 million work days every year.
</P>
<P>
Labor and Social Affairs Minister Eli Yishai said on the
occasion that despite the advances in technology in recent years,
protecting the health of people on the job is way behind. He
expressed the hope that the new Hebrew University facilities would
reduce this gap and contribute to occupational health of the
population.
</P>
<P>
Professor Menahem Luria, head of the university's School for
Applied Science, said that most people think that high-tech
industries are "clean" and therefore not dangerous. But this is a
misconception, as some of them deal with very dangerous
substances.
</P>
<P>
Workers must be protected and the environment has to be
controlled, Luria added.

JI'NAN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Little Duck Group in east
China's Shandong Province will invest massively in the 1996-2000
period, to build a production line with an annual capacity of 1.2
million water-boilers.
</P>
<P>
This will make the company become the largest water-boiler
producer in China, according to market analysts.
</P>
<P>
The company will complete its project this year, and the key
technology and equipment will be introduced from Italy.
</P>
<P>
Market specialists say that China will need at least six
million water boilers annually in the coming years, because of the
growing income of both rural and urban residents.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 28 percent of the urban families have bought the
machines, and the countryside is also a potential market to be
tapped, they say.
</P>
<P>
Most of the water boilers sold to Chinese families in market
use gas, and the electricity-driven boilers are still rarely seen,
they say.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops
Monday night recaptured Puliyankulam, a key town in the north of
the country and 204 kilometers from Colombo, military sources said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the troops in the Jaya Sikuru (Certain
Victory) operation Monday renewed their operation in the newly
recaptured areas of Nadunkerni and Periyamadu while the aircraft
of the Sri Lankan Air Force engaged the rebel targets, inflicting
heavy casualties on the Tamil rebels.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who put up resistance initially, retreated
northward, since they were unable to face the advancing troops.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from the military, at least 40 rebels were
 killed and more than 70 others injured while one officer and 13
soldiers of the government forces were killed and one officer and
24 soldiers were wounded in action.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of the Jaya Sikuru operation was launched by
the government troops on May 13 to open a key supply line along a
highway from Vavuniya to the Jaffna Peninsula, which runs through
the rebel-held territory.
</P>
<P>
To date the government troops have managed to recapture 24

<HEADLINE> Hunan Sees Growth of Farm Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The farm insurance business has
developed quickly in central China's Hunan Province, and the local
insurance company's Property sees profit for the first time in
years from the non-profit sector.
</P>
<P>
The premium income of the Hunan Branch of the People's
Insurance Company of China (PICC) generated from the sector
reached 16 million yuan last year, an increase of 30 percent over
that in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Farm insurance has always been a sector with high risks, and it
is a business done by the insurance company before a state farm
insurance company is set up, insurance specialists say.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Chinese insurer has developed 80 kinds of insurance
services to meet different needs, and the total insured volume
reached two billion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
The company paid 180 million yuan in compensation for property
losses of local farmers in a serious flood last year, according to
the PICC Property officials.
</P>
<P>
This raised total compensation paid by the company to 350
million yuan last year, to meet the claims by insured farmers,
they said.
</P>
<P>
The company expects a 10 percent growth of business this year.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Offer Loans to Kenya's Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has approved 6.9
billion Shillings (about 125 million U.S. Dollars) of credit to
develop Kenya's power industry which is a bottleneck in the
country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Harold Wackman, the bank's Country Director for Kenya and
Djibouti, said Monday the funding is expected to benefit several
power projects immensely across the eastern African country in
the next two years.
</P>
<P>
The Mombasa-based Kepevu and the OI Karia power project at the
Rift Valley are among the projects to benefit from the funding,
according to local industrial sources.
</P>
<P>
The credit was approved at the just concluded World Bank Board
of Directors meeting held in Washington, said Wackman.
</P>
<P>
He gave no more details but promised to issue a comprehensive
statement this week.
</P>
<P>
The power production was singled out by Kenya's official 1997
Economic Survey as a major impediment slowing down economic
growth.

KAMPALA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has scored the highest
record in Africa against polio in the recent immunisation
campaign, according to a report by a local daily today.
</P>
<P>
"The New Vision" quoted Halib-njie, World Health Organisation

<HEADLINE> Overseas Banks Increasing in Pudong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Renminbi Yuan-based business, a
booming banking service in the Pudong New Area, Shanghai, has
become an irresistible business for overseas banks that hope to
enter the China market.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 14 overseas banks have moved their China
offices into the Pudong New Area, a promising trade and financial
zone in Shanghai, since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Pudong is the only pilot area in China where overseas banks are
allowed to do Renminbi businesses.
</P>
<P>
According to the rules of the People's Bank of China, the
country's central bank, all the overseas banks have to move their
headquarters in China into Pudong if they hope to get access to do
renminbi business.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Mitsubishi Bank and the American CitiBank moved
into Pudong for the business last year.
</P>
<P>
About 20 more overseas banks are planning to move into Pudong
soon, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
However, only nine of them have been permitted by the central
bank to start yuan-based business with local foreign-funded
enterprises in Shanghai, such as handling deposits and making
loans.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Manila's Traffic Nightmare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- If you ask a visitor about his
unpleasant impression of the Philippine capital of Manila, his
most likely answer would be the city's traffic congestion.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, traffic congestion is perhaps the most magnified
problem of Manila and no resident in the city can be free from the
traffic nightmare.
</P>
<P>
Because of traffic jams, most Manila residents have to spend as
much as two hours each way to go to work on weekdays.
</P>
<P>
Because of traffic jams, any gatherings or functions in the
city, regardless of their importance, would always start one or
two hours behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
Because of traffic jams, the authorities even take the opening
day of school as an important national event and deploy several
thousand more policemen and their assistants on the road to ease
the traffic.
</P>
<P>
Manila's traffic nightmare is not as chilly as Bangkok's.
However, the problem is worsening day by day with increases of new
private cars and migrants from the countryside.
</P>
<P>
In Manila, with 1.6 million vehicles on the road, travel for a
short distance by car sometimes takes more time than by foot.
During the rush hour, the travel speed of a car is often reduced
to less than 10 kilometers a hour. At some road intersections, one
often waits for half an hour or over 40 minutes to pass.
</P>
<P>
On roadsides of Manila's major streets, crowds of commuters
often wait anxiously for hours under the scorching sun for
jeepneys, a jeep-like car which can each carry about 15
passengers.
</P>
<P>
Abina B., a security guard at Manila's Gotesco Tower, said: "I
work for 12 hours a day and spend more than five hours on travel
from here to my home, and from my home to the tower. I don't have
enough time to sleep after doing some housework for my wife."
</P>
<P>
And nobody can escape from the nightmare of heavy congestion,
including the police, who often have to be patient enough to put
up with the traffic moving at a crawl even when they escort
visiting foreign dignitaries. Sometimes, President Fidel Ramos'
convoy could also be blocked by kilometers of cars on the road.
</P>
<P>
For businessmen, time means money. Therefore, some rich
businessmen, such as Lucio Tan, chairman of the Philippine
Airlines, have bought helicopters to fly them from home to office.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Metro Manila Development Authority has
tried several schemes to ease the traffic, but with little
success. Last year, the authority first adopted an "odd-even
scheme" which bans private vehicles from certain major roads on
alternate days depending on whether license plates end in odd or
even numbers.
</P>
<P>
When no improvement was seen months later, the authority
introduced a "Unified Vehicular Reduction Program" in the whole
city. Under the program, private cars whose plate numbers end in 0
or 1 are banned from roads in the city on Monday, 2 or 3, on
Tuesday... On the weekend, bans on private cars are lifted.
Although the program still remains in force, it has achieved
little in decongesting the increasingly clogged streets.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this year, the authority opened an
"expressway" on major roads in the city for any cars carrying
fewer than four people. But the experiment lasted less than 10
days amid protests from city residents who charged that it created
more chaos on roads.
</P>
<P>
Who should be blamed for the worsening situation?
</P>
<P>
Some Manila residents blame it on the inability of the Metro
Manila Development Authority to enforce traffic rules.
</P>
<P>
Some others, including traffic authorities, point the finger at
the jeepney drivers who they said lack road discipline.
</P>
<P>
Still others said the effective marketing gimmicks of car
dealers should be responsible for the problem.
</P>
<P>
In fact all of these may have been attributed to the worsening
situation. Driving in Manila is not easy for new comers who
carefully observe traffic regulations. But jeepney drivers stop
anywhere on the road to let passengers get on or off.
</P>
<P>
"Jeepney drivers usually ignore traffic regulations. Their cars
run like snakes and could collide with others any time," said
Toitito Chaluya, a professional driver for a foreign government
organization.
</P>
<P>
"Driving in Manila is like participating in an auto race,
nobody will give you way when you give signals for overtaking or
making a turn, " complained a Japanese journalist.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the main cause of the traffic nightmare is
perhaps not the lacking of road discipline, but the unlimited
purchase of private cars, a shortage of buses and rapid
urbanization.
</P>
<P>
In Manila, the municipal authorities try to reduce the number
of cars on the road by adopting new schemes, but take no steps to
limit the purchase of private cars. As a result, 400 new cars are
added each day to the roads of the city, where there are 1.6
million cars already.
</P>
<P>
To maintain its tradition, Manila keeps jeepneys as its main
transportation means, though a jeepney can only take about 15
passengers, while a bus can carry as many as 80 people and take up
a road space no more than that for two jeepneys.
</P>
<P>
Also, as several hundred people from the countryside flock each
day to Manila, whose population has increased from less than 8
million in the 1980s to 9.5 million now, the city's roads will
become even more crowded in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Experts have proposed the development of more light rail
transit and the introduction of trams and buses as transportation
means for Manila, but these proposals would take years to be
materialized if the authorities respond favorably. Therefore,
Manila's traffic nightmare will continue, at least for some time.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Reconfirms Support for Non-Aligned Movement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen said here today that China, as an observer of
the Non-Aligned Movement, has all always supported the theme and
principle of the Movement.
</P>
<P>
Qian made this statement during a meeting with Colombian
Vice-Foreign Minister Pilar Gaitan De Pombo.
</P>
<P>
He also extended a warm welcome to Colombian President Ernesto
Samper Pizano, who is expected to attend the ceremony celebrating
the return of Hong Kong to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Since the forging of diplomatic ties between China and
Colombia in 1980, bilateral relations have grown steadily, and
their co-operation in politics, culture, science and technology
has been fruitful, Qian said, adding the people of the two countries
have deepened their understanding and friendship.
</P>
<P>
He described President Samper's visit to China last October as
a great success which marks the beginning of a new developmental
era of Sino-Colombian ties.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government attaches importance to relations between
the two countries, and is willing to push bilateral ties of
cooperation to a new high through concerted efforts with the
Colombian government on the basis of mutual respect, equality, and
mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Gaitan conveyed Colombian Foreign Minister Mejia Velez's
regards to Qian. She said that Colombia is satisfied with the two
countries' sound co-operation in bilateral and international
issues, adding Colombia hopes to increase co-operation with China
in trade, investment, judiciary, drugs control and other fields.
</P>
<P>
Gaitan reiterated Colombia's support for China's entry to the
World Trade Organization, and its pursuit of the "one China"
policy.
</P>
<P>
Extending her congratulations over Hong Kong's hand-over, she
said Hong Kong's return will be a historic event, and the
Colombian government and people believe in a brighter future of
Hong Kong and China as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Gaitan arrived in Beijing Sunday at the invitation of
Vice-Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing, and they held discussions on
bilateral relations and other issues of common concern.

<HEADLINE> Hanson's Views Has No Impact On Australia's Ties With Asia: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government
completely rejects the remarks by independent legislator Pauline
Hanson on Asian immigrants and race issues, Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer said today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Downer said, "The Australian
government obviously completely rejects what Pauline Hanson says
about Asian immigration and race issues."
</P>
<P>
Downer described Pauline Hanson's remarks as "totally offensive"
and advised her to educate herself on the enormous benefits that
Australia has gained from Asian immigration to Australia.
</P>
<P>
"We like her to educate herself about the enormous benefits
Australia gets as well as Asia gets from the economic interaction
between Australia and Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The political relationship we have with Asian partners are very
close, very productive. And Pauline Hanson will do well to learn
something about that as well", the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
During her maiden speech to Australian parliament last
September, Pauline Hanson made a controversial call for a cut in
intake of Asian immigrants and an end to foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Her remarks, which invoked strong protests from Asian
immigrants in the country and concerns from some Asian countries,
has not produced any impact on Australia's economic relationships
with countries in the region, Downer said.
</P>
<P>
He also predicted a short life for Pauline Hanson's One Nation
party, saying that the party is just like "a comet in the sky and
will soon disappear."

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Gas-Field Flames Subsiding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The gas-ignited fire at the
Magurchhara gas field in northeastern Bangladesh has lost its
intensity and is now reduced to two small flames raging below 10
feet (about three meters), said reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, experts from Singapore and America are busy pumping
out the water that has accumulated in the area due to rain and
water flowing from the nearby hillocks and construction work on
the relief well is likely to start soon.
</P>
<P>
The fire, caused by a massive explosion on June 15 during
drilling by the U.S company Occidental, has engulfed the gas field
and scorched nearby trees, houses and rail tracts.
</P>
<P>
Occidental has finalized a two-phase plan to douse the fire and
cap the mouth of the well, said concerned sources.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase, a relief well will be drilled and then a
dynamic "kill" will be employed using high density barite-laden
fluid pumped at high rates.
</P>
<P>
In the second phase, both well bores will be cemented, the land
around the well re-stabilized and the area cleaned of blown-out
subsurface formation.
</P>
<P>
Occidental plans to launch a main operation to extinguish the
fire by next month. But sources said the operation might be
delayed as the main equipment needed for sealing the well is yet
to reach Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
However, there is no sign of any initiative to restore the
road-railway links. The direct railway links in the Sylhet
district with the capital city of Dhaka and the port city of
Chittagong have remained snapped since the fire broke out.
</P>
<P>
An Occidental engineer said he did not feel it too risky for
trains to run through the lines here as the gas pocket had emptied
and there was little chance of further gas blast at the same spot.
</P>
<P>
The railway is incurring an estimated loss of 1.5 million taka
(about 35,000 U.S. dollars) a day due to the fall in passenger and
goods traffic to and from Sylhet, Dhaka and Chittagong.

<HEADLINE> Banks Finance More Production of Color Tubes in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Bank of
Communications Shanghai Branch and Japan's Tokyo-Mitsubishi Bank
Shanghai Branch today jointly issued a loan to support production
of accessories for color picture tubes in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the loan, worth 45 million yuan,
will be used to finance the installation of a new production line
for producing glass screens and cones for color picture tubes in
Shanghai Asahi Electronic Glass Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
When this project is completed, the company will be able to
generate 1.2 billion yuan of output value and 50 million yuan of
profit annually.
</P>
<P>
The two also signed agreements of cooperation in many fields.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo-Mitsubishi Bank Shanghai Branch is one of the first group
of overseas bank authorized to handle business in Chinese currency
and has so far started more than 150 Renminbi bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Communications Shanghai Branch is the Japanese
bank's first cooperation partner in the issue of loans in Chinese
currency of Renminbi yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai company is a joint venture by Shanghai Vacuum
Electron Devices Co. Ltd, Asahi Glass Co. Ltd, Marubeni
Corporation, and Shanghai Jiushi Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Production lines of glass screens and cones by joint ventures
are listed as projects capable of replacing imports, and were
treated as the most important industrial program of 1995. The
installation began the same year.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture began production of glass screens and cones
in tandem with the installation. It scored up 190 million yuan in
sales from glass screens and cones in 1996, and chalked up 330
million yuan in sales of glass screens and cones in the first five
months of this year, saving 2.6 million U.S. dollars for the state
and creating 10 million yuan of profit.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the company will earn a profit of 25
million yuan from sales of glass screens and cones by the end of
this year.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's King Invited to OIC Summit in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran's President Hashemi Rafsanjani
will send a special envoy to deliver his invitation to Jordanian
King Hussein for him to attend the summit of the Organization of
Islamic Conference to be held in Tehran in December.
</P>
<P>
According to the English daily Iran News today, Iranian
Minister of Industries Mohammad Nematzadeh will go to Jordan this
week to deliver the invitation.
</P>
<P>
The paper reported, quoting a source close to the Iranian
president, that Rafsanjani has already sent a hand-written
invitation to the king.
</P>
<P>
This doesn't appear to be a typical move of Iran, which has
regarded the Jordanian king as pro-U.S. and a close friend of
Israel, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
Iran's late spiritual leader Imam Khomeini attacked the king
for his support of Iraq during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war
(1980-88).
</P>
<P>
Iran has already invited more than 20 heads of state of Islamic
countries to attend the summit, apparently in a bid to expand its
influence in the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of 42 Muslim countries are expected to be present at
the OIC summit. The construction of a luxurious palace for the
historical event is near completion.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Business Community Optimistic about HK's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- With only a few days left before
the handover, the foreign business community here is optimistic
about the prospects of Hong Kong after July 1.
</P>
<P>
Latest surveys conducted by the American and Canadian chambers
of commerce in Hong Kong among their member companies show that 95
percent of Hong Kong-based American companies regard the city's
commercial environment over the next five years as either "very
ideal" or "ideal", and 99 percent of the Canadian respondents
expressed the intention of staying in Hong Kong beyond the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
In a recent series of exclusive interviews with the chairmen of
major foreign chambers of commerce in Hong Kong, interviewees told
Xinhua that they believe Hong Kong will maintain its existing
business-friendly environment and achieve long-term stability and
prosperity after July 1.
</P>
<P>
"I am one hundred percent optimistic about Hong Kong's
prospects. I think 98 and even 99 percent of the members of our
chamber hold the same opinion as mine," said Naoya Yokoyama,
chairman of the Hong Kong Japanese Chamber of Commerce and
Industry.
</P>
<P>
Raj Sital, chairman of the Indian Chamber of Commerce in Hong
Kong, said that during the past ten-plus years of Hong Kong's
transitional period, no member of the local Indian business
community has left, because they are firmly convinced in the 'one
country, two systems" principle.
</P>
<P>
Most of these chairmen of foreign chambers of commerce have
been staying in Hong Kong for more than a decade, and have a
fairly good understanding of the local political and economic
systems.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the success of Hong Kong should be attributed
to a variety of factors, such as the rule of law, low taxes, the
government's policy of non-interference in economic affairs, and
the free port status.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR), which stipulates that the existing social and economic
systems and lifestyle in Hong Kong shall remain unchanged after
the handover, has made sure that all these factors will stay after
July 1, they added.
</P>
<P>
"The American business community is bullish over the
post-handover business climate in Hong Kong," said Douglas Henck,
chairman of the Hong Kong American Chamber of Commerce, the
largest foreign chamber of commerce here with more than 1,100
member companies.
</P>
<P>
Paul S.K. Lam, chairman of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in
Hong Kong, said that the situation in Hong Kong would remain
stable before and after July 1, and that "the future HKSAR
government will continue to provide easy accesses for business
people from all over the world."
</P>
<P>
"For us, what happens on June 30 is going to be the same as
what happens on July 1, and our business will be done the same
way," Alfred Chown, chairman of the Australian Chamber of
Commerce in Hong Kong, commented on the upcoming handover.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Hong Kong's future development, most of the foreign
chambers' chairmen shared the view that with the economic backing
of China's interior areas, Hong Kong's current status as an
international financial, trading and shipping center will be
further strengthened, while its economic and trade relations with
various countries and regions will become even closer.
</P>
<P>
"At present, the Asian economy as a whole ranks first in the
world in terms of the economic growth rate. So far as the
geographical location is concerned, Hong Kong is the center of
Asia. So, I think that it will strengthen its status and play an
increasingly important role in the future," Yokoyama, chairman of
the Japanese chamber, noted.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign business people believe that Hong Kong will have a
better investment environment and provide more business
opportunities after July 1.
</P>
<P>
Most business for Indian merchants in Hong Kong involves the
re-export of goods from China's interior areas, Sital said, adding
that the Indian business community is looking forward to Hong
Kong's return to China, for "we believe that our business will
become more successful."
</P>
<P>
Sung Suk Joo, chairman of the Korean Chamber of Commerce in
Hong Kong, described the interior areas of China as "a huge
market."
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong will play an even more important role in promoting
and supporting the modernization drive there," he said.

<P>
A feasibility study on highway construction, which is in
progress, is scheduled to be completed next year, the director
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Leung, Hong Kong now boasts a total of 1,800
kilometers of roads to accommodate 480,000 motor vehicles, with an
average of 270 vehicles per sq km, the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Future development of road construction has not only to take
into account the long-term needs and the needs beyond Hong Kong's
administrative lines but also the internal and short-term needs of
Hong Kong itself, Leung said.
</P>
<P>
In view of the impact of expressway networks in adjacent areas
on Hong Kong, such as the already-operational Shenzhen-Guangzhou
and Shenzhen-Shantou expressways, and the expressway that links
between Guangzhou and Zhuhai and Macao, which is still to be
built, it is imperative to add more roads to Hong Kong, the
director noted.
</P>
<P>
One reason for construction of the northwestern highway network,
he said, is to comply with plans for building two new transit
routes connecting Hong Kong with Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
One is a envisaged passage linking the west of Shenzhen with
Hong Kong, and the other is the Lingdingyang Bridge to connect
Zhuhai and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are three highway transit routes linking Hong
Kong with China's interior area.

<HEADLINE> HK to Continue Participation in 34 Int'l Organizations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will continue to
participate in the activities of 34 international organizations
after July 1, announced Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui
Tiankai at a routine press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong at present has taken part in the activities
of more than 30 inter-governmental international organizations in
one capacity or another.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the relevant provisions of the Sino-British
Joint Declaration and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR), HKSAR may continue to take part in
the activities of these international organizations in an
appropriate capacity after July 1, 1997, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Ever since 1985, for the purpose of a smooth transition of Kong
Kong, the Chinese and British sides have engaged in consultations
on relations between Hong Kong and the above-mentioned
international organizations and have agreed on Hong Kong's
continued participation in the activities of 34 inter-governmental
international organizations in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
After July 1, 1997, HKSAR may, as members of delegations of the
Chinese Government, take part in the activities of 19
inter-governmental international organizations and attend the
relevant conferences thereof, including the International Civil
Aviation Organization and International Monetary Fund, according
to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
HKSAR may also, as a member or a associate member or in other
capacities, using the name of "Kong Kong, China," take part in the
activities of 15 inter-governmental international organizations,
including the Asian Development Bank and International Maritime
Organization, he added.
</P>
<P>
The above-mentioned arrangements are consistent with the
relevant provisions of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the
Basic Law of the HKSAR as well as the charters of the relevant
international organizations, he said, adding that they are
commensurate with the status of Hong Kong and serve the practical
needs of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China has made
diplomatic moves in this regard by presenting notes to the 34
international organizations in which to make clear the future
relations between HKSAR and these international organizations and
the capacity in which HKSAR may participate in their relevant
activities.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman expressed his belief that HKSAR's continued
participation in these international organizations in an
appropriate capacity is conducive to the smooth transition of Hong
Kong and will forcefully promote the development of the external
economic relations and trade of the HKSAR as well as its long-term
economic prosperity.

<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- After four people suspected of being involved in a pedophile
cassette producing network committed suicide following a
nationwide police crackdown, Minister of Justice Elisabeth Guigou
questioned the necessity to make the "spectacular arrests" and the
high degree of media exposure about it. But the justice
departments have defended the operation as justified.
</P>
<P>
-- After two days of calm, the Congolese capital Brazzaville
Monday again fell into a symphony of destruction with all heavy
and light weapons raging. Fighting resumed after the "Cobras"
militiamen of former President Denis Sassou-N'Guesso pounded the
parliament building where 125 deputies and 60 senators were
attending a swearing-in ceremony of the Constitutional Council.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The plan announced by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin to let
all people who have worked 40 years to retire with a satisfactory
pension will cost 26.4 billion to 39.5 billion francs (4.5 billion
to 6.8 billion U.S. dollars) to France, which already maintains
the record high percentage of population who stop working at the
age of 55. Moreover, the retirement plan could encourage
enterprises to abuse it to exclude aged workers.
</P>
<P>
-- President Jacques Chirac proposed Monday at the United
Nations second Earth Summit in New York that France host a
conference on saving the planet's water resources at the beginning

KAMPALA. June 24 (Xinhua) -- Some 80 Rwandans responsible for
massacre in 1994 in their native country joined the Allied
Democratic Forces (ADF) in Uganda, a report reaching here said
today.
</P>
<P>
The group of Hutu militia entered south-western district of
Rukungiri about two months ago, army intelligence sources in
western Kabarole and Bundibugyo districts told "The New Vision".
</P>
<P>
They extracted the conclusion on a close examination of bodies
of the rebels killed in battlefields. Soldiers in frontlines
reported they hearded rebels speaking Rwandese language.
</P>
<P>
A note captured from the rebels said they did not have
ammunitions. Army sources in Bundibugyo district confirmed the
rebels' reaction was "very weak" when they shot at the rebels'
positions.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Water-Efficient Irrigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- China will devote great efforts to
spreading water-efficient irrigation to ensure the supply of grain
and cotton.
</P>
<P>
Chen Lei, president of the Chinese National Commission on
Irrigation and Drainage (CNCID), reaffirmed this strategy at a
meeting commemorating the international day of irrigation and
drainage, today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by officials and experts from both
China and the international community, including the United
Nations Development Program.
</P>
<P>
Chen Lei, who also serves as the director of the Rural Water
Resources Department of the Ministry of Water Resources, claimed
that the reason that China can feed 22 percent of the world's
population with just seven percent of the world's farmland is that
China has 22 percent of the world's irrigated farmland.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that China's irrigated farmland had been expanded to
50.67 million ha by the end of 1995, from only 16 million ha
during the post-liberation days. Although less than 40 percent of
the country's farmland is currently irrigated, they turn out 75
percent of the country's grain, 80 percent of cotton, and 90
percent of vegetables.
</P>
<P>
The official said that China plans to have more than 3.33
million ha of farmland equipped with water-efficient irrigation
facilities during the remaining five years of the century.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is willing to strengthen cooperation and
exchanges with other countries in the field of irrigation and will
actively participate in and support the work of the International
Commission on Irrigation and Drainage (ICID).
</P>
<P>
The 47-year-old ICID will elect its new leadership in the
coming September in England. China's Zhang Qishun, who is vice
president of the China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower
Research and secretary general of the Chinese National Commission
on Irrigation and Drainage, will run for the vice presidency of
the international organization.

SANTIAGO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- At least 20 people have been
killed by floods caused by torrential rains in central and

The floods have also destroyed about 15,000 houses, causing

<HEADLINE> Traces of Alleged "Bigfoot" Found in Shennongjia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- China's "Bigfoot" researchers have
recently found tracks believed to be left by a legendary creature,
known as Chinese folklore the "Wild Man", in central China's
Shennonjia National Nature Reserve, sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Fangchen, head of the non-governmental Committee for
Research on Strange and Rare Creatures, said that a team found
hundreds of very big footprints at a mountainous place 2,600
meters above the sea level in northwest Shennonjia on May 24 this
year.
</P>
<P>
"We have made preliminary conclusions that they were left by
two animals walking on two legs. The biggest footprint is 37 cm
long, very similar to that of a man but is quite larger than
man's, and is different from the footprints of a bear or any other
identified animals," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that these footprints were very clear to identify, and
were believed to be left by a creature weighing some 200 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Wang's team also found similar footprints left by another two
mysterious creatures in Shennongjia last winter.
</P>
<P>
Shennongjia is a 3,253-square-kilometer mountain area covered
by primitive forests in central China's Hubei Province, north of
the Three Gorges. For 3,000 years, Chinese legends have told of a
mysterious, humanlike creature who is said to roam in its valleys.
</P>
<P>
Most of the witnesses have similar descriptions of the
creature, portraying it as a two-meter-tall animal, with apelike
facial features and a body covered by red hair. It has no tail and
usually leaves large footprints on snow and in the fields.
</P>
<P>
Some scientists believe that "distant relatives" of the "Wild
Man" may include the scary, hairy, Himalayan "Yeti" or "Abominable
Snowman", the oversized-track-leaving "Bigfoot" of northern
California, or the often "glimpsed" but seldom seen "Sasquatch"
who roam the forests of British Columbia, Canada.
</P>
<P>
Some scientists said that the creature may be an unknown
primate, while others argue that what the people have seen may
actually be bears or monkeys.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the uncovering of the myth will be of great
scientific significance. But the researchers should avoid making
quick conclusions unless hard scientific evidence is obtained, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Wang used to be the head of a failed high-profile expedition to
search for the "Wild Man" in Shennongjia in 1995.

<P>
JAKARTA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A week-long photo exhibition on
the history and development of Hong Kong opened here today to
celebrate the historic event of Hong Kong's return to China on
July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony, which was attended by more than 500
people of various circles, was presided over by Indonesia's

</P>
<P>
In their speeches at the ceremony, President of the Association

Sukamdani S. Gitosardjono and Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia Zhou
Gang spoke of the significance of Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
Sukamdani said that with the return of Hong Kong to China, the
opportunity for the Indonesian business community to promote its
economic relations with its Chinese counterparts will certainly
become bigger. Moreover, from July 1, 1997, the existing economic
system will exist under the "one country, two systems" concept, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Zhou said the resumption of China's exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong is a great event in the modern history
of China and the world and marks a major step forward made by the
Chinese people toward their lofty goal of the reunification of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
On display are some 210 large photographs depicting various
activities, events, places, scenery and historical legacies of
Hong Kong from the Qing Dynasty to the present time.

<P>
LUSAKA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The peace now prevailing in
neighboring Mozambique has benefited Zambia with increased import
and export cargo through the port of Beira of the once war-torn
country.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent Beira Corridor Group publication,
Zambia's exports over the 1995 to 1996 increased from 25,000 tons
to 43,500 tons while its imports rose from 26,100 tons to 35,500
tons during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Zambia uses the Beira route to mainly export its copper,
according to the newsletter.
</P>
<P>
The trade route is one of the cheapest used by Zambia to reach
its Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
Another trade route of similar importance to its overseas
market likely to be revamped is the Bengwela railway through
Angola.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Aims to Be World's Next Largest Trading Entity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) will possibly become one of the world's three
largest trading entities by 2020, following the North American
Free Trade Area and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency today quoted a paper on ASEAN vision
2020 as saying that ASEAN, with an area of 4.5 million square
kilometers, may develop into a most attractive area with a
combined gross domestic product of 2 trillion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Both Brunei and Singapore would be among the richest countries
in the world. Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand
would become full-blown developed countries while Cambodia, Laos
and Myanmar, to be admitted to ASEAN next month, as well as
Vietnam would achieve newly developed country status, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The worst case scenario, however, is that intra-ASEAN trade
still comprises less than 30 percent of the group's total trade,
the paper said, adding that new forms of non-tariff barriers and
anti-dumping measures would limit the free trade movement of
products and the development of services within the region.
</P>
<P>
If so, the ASEAN region would be only earning less than 1
trillion dollars by the year 2020, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
To realize the higher end, ASEAN member countries are firming
up ways including the eradication of poverty and the growth of
economic triangles in the region.
</P>
<P>
The paper said ASEAN has set 2020 as its target date for the
eradication of poverty. Its Chamber of Commerce and Industry is
also coming up with a paper on how ASEAN member countries can
concretely address the issue of poverty.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in July, ASEAN
will also outline ways for how to enhance the growth of economic
triangles in the region, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, ASEAN is also targeting closer economic
integration by 2010, closer cohesiveness with regards to economic
policy and elimination of barriers for a freer flow of capital
within the region.

<HEADLINE> Bank of China Supports Foreign Trade Enterprises in Henan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The local branch of Bank of
China in the central Henan Province raised massive funds to
bolster money-losing foreign trade enterprises, with results.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of this year, the province's foreign
trade enterprises earned a total of 640 million US dollars in
foreign exchange, backed by 1.76 billion yuan (220 million
dollars) in bank loans.
</P>
<P>
Bank experts say that many local foreign trade enterprises in
Henan have been trapped in loss-making in recent years, and most
of their loans remained overdue.
</P>
<P>
So the bank adopted measures to continue making loans to both
the profit-making enterprises, and the poor, according to bank
officials.
</P>
<P>
Most of the bank's newly-added loans this year have been used
to support the export of industrial and agricultural products with
low cost and high added-value, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
The bank issued a total of 90 million yuan in loans to aid
export of textiles, silk, grain, and oil in the first four months
of this year.

<HEADLINE> Hani Killers' Amnesty Case Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, JUNE 24 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) has postoned to August 11 the
amnesty hearing of two men convicted of the assassination of
South African Communist Party (SACP) leader Chris Hani.
</P>
<P>
TRC's amnesty committee made the decision because that
supporting documentation for the convicted Clive Derby-Lewis and
Janusz Walus's applications were incomplete, and Hani's widow,
Limpho Hani would be unable to attend the full proceedings as she
was due to leave for the United States for an official visit
today.
</P>
<P>
It took about 10 minutes to make the decision after hearing
legal arguments for and against the postponement, requested by
lawyers for the Hani family and the SACP, local daily the Citizen
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The application was opposed by lawyers for the two convicted.
</P>
<P>
Both Derby-Lewis and Walus were sentenced to death for the
April 1993 slaying of Hani outside his home, but the sentences
were later commuted to life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
In their written amnesty applications to the TRC, Derby-Lewis
and Walus claimed that they acted alone when they assassinated
Hani.
</P>
<P>
However, the ruling African National Congress and the SACP
believed that Walus and Derby-Lewis had been involved in a
broader conspiracy to kill Hani and was trying to find evidence
to support this theory.

GUANGZHOU, June 24 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province

<P>
The five-month tax collection climbed nearly 26 percent over

percent.
</P>

The increase is the result of growth of the local stamp duty,

The province strengthened anti-smuggling efforts and the

<HEADLINE> East China Farmers Growing Vegetables for Foreign Market (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIANYUNGANG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- "Eyeing foreign vegetable
markets and growing vegetables well" -- this is a motto often
repeated by vegetables growers in Fengxian County of
East China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Qi Dianhua, a local vegetable grower, said that they used to
grow vegetables only for themselves or traded them at a local
market to exchange for some edible oil and salt.
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays we grow vegetables and sell them for overseas
market," said Qi, "vegetable growing has become a major source of
income for many of us."
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the current vegetable growing area
makes up one tenth of the county's total arable land. They not
only grow traditional varieties such as Chinese cabbages, radish,
but also popular vegetables of Japan, the Republic of Korea,
France, the Netherlands, and the United States, which sell in a
dozen countries in Asia, Europe and America.
</P>
<P>
A county official in charge of agricultural affairs called it a
historic leap for farmers to change from simple self-reliance to
challenging the international market.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates that Chinese farmers have not only become
adapted to the market economy, but also started to take aim at the
international market," said the official.
</P>
<P>
Vegetables grown by Chinese farmers are brought to the overseas
market mainly by foreign trade departments and companies
authorized to handle foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Ruyi Company Group, a company specialized in vegetable exports
from Lianyungang, an open port city of east China's Jiangsu
Province, has helped local farmers sell their vegetables to
foreign countries over the past years.
</P>
<P>
The company group has so far built export vegetable growing
bases in 16 provinces, with the total area amounting to 16,667
hectares, where about one million farmers, under the guidance of
the company group, are growing quality vegetables needed by the
overseas market.
</P>
<P>
An executive told reporters that they are responsible for
providing farmers with improved varieties and growing techniques,
and are also responsible for purchase, processing, and export of
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
The company group exported 30,000 tons of vegetables and earned
20 million U.S. dollars from exports in 1996, according to the
executive.

<HEADLINE> East China Farmers Growing Vegetables for Foreign Market (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wang Yaxu, head of the Department of Agriculture and Industry
of Lianyungang City, explained that farmers now can earn 7,500
yuan to 12,000 yuan from a hectare of grain grown, but if they
grow vegetables, they can earn 15,000 yuan to 30,000 yuan per
hectare.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by Wang's department shows that grain
which used to dominate local farmers' income is being replaced by
sideline production.
</P>
<P>
Farmers of Shahe Township, Ganyu County, plant Japanese
radishes in between wheat and maize, a season during which the
land used to lie idle. Their earnings from radish growing are
equivalent to money earned from wheat and maize put together. This
has made it possible for local farmers to double their annual
income without causing a drop in their total grain output.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, many farmers have built new
multiple-storyed flats with money earned from vegetable growing,
and they proudly call these flats "vegetable root villas".
</P>
<P>
Guo Jiashan, director of the Agricultural Bureau of Lianyungang
City, said farmers have shown great zeal toward vegetable growing
because of better profits.
</P>
<P>
Many areas have also made efforts to foster major
export-oriented enterprises, especially big companies engaged in
export of farm produce and sideline products.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises like Ruyi Company Group now total 1,700 in
Lianyungang, which have provided farmers with good service in
vegetable growing, and taught them agro-techniques, creating
favorable conditions for the county to vigorously expand vegetable
growing.
</P>
<P>
Wang Luolin, deputy president of the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, said that China has been practicing socialist market
economy, and without bringing farmers into the market, the market
economy could not be counted as a real one.
</P>
<P>
"With the help of leading local enterprises, millions of
farmers have been organized to march towards the market and
eventually become market aware through vegetable growing, and much
labor has gone into the international market by way of processing
high value-added foodstuffs," said Wang.

<P>
TAIYUAN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Shanxi, an energy base in northern
China, has listed coking, metallurgy, tourism and automobile
industries as fields for cooperation with Hong Kong and other
overseas regions and countries.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between Shanxi and Hong Kong reached 210
million US dollars last year, which made Hong Kong the second
biggest trade partner of the province.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, Shanxi registered 920 Hong Kong funded
projects, 54 percent of Shanxi's overseas funded projects. The
province used 749 million dollars from Hong Kong, one third of its
total introduced from overseas.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong businessmen have extended their investment from raw
materials to infrastructure like energy and communications. The
province launched last year two Hong Kong funded highway projects
which will absorb a total of 60 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, large state-owned enterprises in Shanxi began to
issue H-shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
The province has been exporting to Hong Kong quality coal,
coking products, iron and steel products, building materials and
textile products for years. In the past two years, Shanxi's
machinery, electronic, and telecommunications equipment were
welcomed in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi has been importing equipment and raw materials from Hong
Kong in the past few years.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Has Bright Future: Australian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer expressed the belief here today that Hong Kong
will have a bright and successful future after it returns to China
on July 1 after 156 years of British colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
"I think Hong Kong has a bright future. I think it has a
successful future," the minister said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"We understand the historic importance" of Hong Kong returning
to China, said Downer, who has announced that he will attend the
inauguration ceremonies of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region.
</P>
<P>
"I'm advised that the majority of people in Hong Kong welcome
that development (Hong Kong's return to China). You can see that
from the performances of various markets in Hong Kong. The
financial market has been performing very strongly in recent
times," he noted.
</P>
<P>
That is "a vote of confidence" in the handover, the minister
declared.
</P>
<P>
He said China and Britain signed a joint declaration on the
transition of Hong Kong in 1984 and China has formulated a Basic
Law for Hong Kong, giving the firm commitment that the present
system in Hong Kong will remain in place for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
He believes that Hong Kong will remain as one of the world's
great financial centers, adding that "Hong Kong breeds on the back
of China" and "succeeds because of the vast Chinese market,
particularly in southern China."
</P>
<P>
"I suppose one should add that as long as South China continues
to grow at the present rate of growth -- Guangdong Province is
growing at 20 percent per annum -- then Hong Kong is going to do
very well out of that," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Downer said Australia has a very big interest in Hong Kong,
which he described as one of the country's biggest export markets
and a very important trading partner.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Hong Kong was Australia's sixth largest destination
for overseas investment and 10th largest trading partner,
accounting for 2.6 percent of Australia's total trade, while
Australia was Hong Kong's 14th largest trading partner, according
to a book published last month by an Australian parliament
committee.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Australia's planned participation in the handover
ceremonies, Prime Minister John Howard said earlier this month
that his country will do all it can to help ensure a smooth and
successful handover of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"I am very much looking forward to my participation (in the
handover ceremonies)," Downer said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Australia's policy toward Hong Kong and China's
inland areas after the handover, Downer said, "Certainly there
will be no changes."
</P>
<P>
"Obviously in the case of Hong Kong after the changeover we
recognize that Beijing will be responsible for foreign affairs and
defense matters. As a consequence, the consular agreement that we
have for our representation has been negotiated with Beijing.
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and I signed an agreement in New York
last year for the consular arrangements."
</P>
<P>
"That is one difference that at foreign policy and defense
level we've been dealing through Beijing. But otherwise I don't
see real changes in substance in the way we'll do with Hong Kong,"
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
"Our relationship with Hong Kong is essentially a commercial
relationship," he said. "We don't have problem with Hong Kong in
terms of trade obstacles, tariff barriers, or very few in terms of
non-tariff barriers as well."
</P>
<P>
"So I will imagine our relationship at the economic level with
Hong Kong will continue just as it has in the last few years,"
Downer said.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Cultural Relics Endangered by Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Colosseum in Rome, the Leaning
Tower in Pisa and other cultural relics across the country will
hardly escape the fate of eventual destruction unless necessary
measures are taken to stop pollution, soil and rain erosion.
</P>
<P>
A report released today by the country's Central Institute of
Restoration said that of the 57,000 cultural relics scattered in
more than 8,000 Italian cities and towns, most are endangered by
serious pollution and erosion.
</P>
<P>
The institute has spent 28 billion lira (about 16 million
U.S. dollars) to conduct a thorough survey on the conditions of
these cultural treasures, thanks to a law passed in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Findings are worrying as it is far from optimistic for the
relics to survive earthquakes, landslides, floods and erosion, the
worsening surrounding environment and poor conditions of
anti-theft systems.
</P>
<P>
Those in the capital suffer the most, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Italian government has decided to take action.
</P>
<P>
Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Culture Minister Walter
Veltroni vowed today to work out a detailed plan of restoration on
the basis of the findings of the survey.

<HEADLINE> Contract Inked for Power Generators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A contract was signed in Beijing
Monday to arrange the supply of generating equipment for the third
phase of the Jiangxi Jiujiang Power Plant project, according to
today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The Chinese signatories of the contract were Jiangxi Jiujiang
Phase III Power Generating Co Ltd (JJPPG) and China National
Technical Import and Export Corp (CNTIC). The foreign parties were
Foster Wheeler Energy Corp, Hitachi Co Ltd and Itochu Corp.
</P>
<P>
According to the contract, JJPPG will purchase two 350
million-watt sub-critical generators from Foster Wheeler Energy
Corp, Hitachi Co Ltd and Itochu Corp.
</P>
<P>
After four years of preliminary negotiations, we hope the
installation of the generating equipment will be finished on
schedule before 2000, said Zha Keming, deputy general manager of
China State Electric Power Corp at the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Most of the money to purchase the generators is from the 29.6
billion yen (258.56 million US dollars) of the third batch of
Japanese Overseas Economic and Co-operation Fund loans. The loans
should be paid back in 30 years, with an interest rate of 2.3
percent each year.
</P>
<P>
As one of the key power projects during China's Ninth Five-Year
Plan (1996-2000), the third phase of Jiangxi Jiujiang Power Plant
will be able to provide the whole province with 4.9 billion
kilowatt-hours of electricity each year when it is completed. The
project will greatly ease the electric shortage in the region and
promote the development of the local economy, Zha said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Curb Money Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government through the
Bank of Zambia (BOZ) is soon to enact three laws to out law money
laundering activities, pyramid schemes and to safe-guard small
depositors against possible bank failures, the Times of Zambia
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The government decision was disclosed by BOZ assistant
director in the regulatory policy and financial analysis
division, Austin Mwape, at an economic seminar in Kafue, south of
Lusaka, at the last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Mwape said that among the highlights of the proposed
anti-money laundering law is that financial institutions will be
required to know their customers and keep records of transaction.
</P>
<P>
He added that the institutions will not be allowed to keep
anonymous accounts or under fictitious names and the institutions
and their workers would be required to report any knowledge of
suspicion of money laundering.
</P>
<P>
Mwape said that a deposit insurance system will be introduced
to ensure that insured depositors are paid their money in
priority to other creditors in case of bank failure. Deposit
insurance will also help address potential bank failure.
</P>
<P>
On pyramid schemes, Mwape called on the public to report to
the central bank BOZ the existence of any such schemes. He noted
that only a few "early birds" benefit from pyramid schemes while
the rest of the members of such schemes loose their money.

<HEADLINE>   Fertilizer Clue in Gulf War Illnesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- An investigating office of the
United States Congress reported today that there was "substantial
evidence" that fertilizer compounds used in the Gulf could be
associated with the illness of the Gulf War veterans.
</P>
<P>
The report by the General Accounting Office (GAO) criticized
the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans'
Illnesses for virtually discounting any link between biological
agents and troop complaints.
</P>
<P>
The report said that stress among veterans could be responsible
for many of the complaints ranging from muscle aches to loss of
memory.
</P>
<P>
"The committee concluded that it was unlikely that the health
effects reported by Gulf War veterans are the results of exposure
to organophosphate or mustard chemical warfare agents, even though
there is substantial evidence that organophosphate compounds might
be associated with delayed or long-term health effects similar to
those experienced by the Gulf War veterans."
</P>
<P>
The report said that there were still major unresolved
questions over the extent to which veterans may have been exposed
to fallout from the destruction of chemical weapons dumps in
Iraq," said Defense Department spokesman Brian Whitman.
</P>
<P>
The department has notified those veterans who might have been
exposed to the fallout of the chemical weapons.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong-Related Data (8): Birth of Basic Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- On April 10, 1985, the Third
Session of the Sixth National People's Congress (NPC) decided to
establish a Drafting Committee for the Basic Law of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
On June 18 the same year, the Sixth NPC Standing Committee
approved the list of members of the Drafting Committee. The
Drafting Committee was composed of 59 noted figures from various
circles and specialists, including 23 from Hong Kong. (By the
ninth meeting of the committee, its membership had decreased to
51, including 18 from Hong Kong. Four members had passed away,
two resigned, and two others been dismissed for conduct that was
incompatible with their capacity.)
</P>
<P>
On July 1, 1985, the Drafting Committee was formally
established and started to work. In the following four years and
eight months, it held nine plenary sessions and 73 panel group
meetings.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, a Consultative Committee for the HKSAR Basic
Law, which consisted of 180 representatives from various circles
in Hong Kong, was set up to serve as a bridge of communication
between Hong Kong residents and the Drafting Committee, as well as
a channel through which the Hong Kong people could express their
opinions and make suggestions.
</P>
<P>
In early 1988, an initial version of the Basic Law (Draft) was
completed and circulated in Hong Kong and the interior area to
extensively solicit opinions for revision. At the end of 1988 and
in early 1989, upon examination by the NPC Standing Committee, the
Basic Law (Draft) was made public in an effort to solicit more
opinions and make further revisions. The Law was adopted by the
NPC and promulgated in April, 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law resulted from the collective wisdom and concerted
efforts of many people in both Hong Kong and the interior area.
Its drafting process is one of full and extensive democratic
consultation.

<HEADLINE> Polish Economy on Rapid Growth Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Polish economy has been on a
rapid growth track since the beginning of this year and the speed
thus achieved has been among the highest in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Latest official statistics showed a 7.3 percent rise in the
country's gross domestic product (GDP) in the first five months of
the year, compared to that of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate, apparently the result of a 9.2 percent
increase in industrial production over the five-month period, came
along with a slower inflation rise and a lower jobless rate.
</P>
<P>
The 4.1 percent inflation over January-May was 0.9 percentage
point down from the same period last year, and the 11.7 percent
unemployment in May was a cut of 0.4 percentage point from April.
</P>
<P>
From 1993 to 1996, the GDP was up 19.5 percent and industrial
output 33.5 percent, while inflation was down from 37 percent to
18.5 percent, and jobless rate from 16.9 percent to 13.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The inflation is expected to stay around 12 percent at the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
While labeling the economic conditions this year as "better
than expected," the Polish government now is aiming at bringing
down the inflation to within 10 percent and achieving 5-5.7
percent GDP growth next year.
</P>
<P>
Behind the current rapid economic growth in Poland are the
political stability, and the four-year-old left-wing government's
policies for economic recovery and development.
</P>
<P>
Poland took the "shock therapy" eight years ago to overhaul its
economic system, and remarkable achievements have been recorded
ever since.
</P>
<P>
However, the country still faces a number of difficulties,
including its national debt of 198 billion zloty (about 62 billion
U.S. dollars), in which internal debt accounts for 55 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States House of
Representatives voted 216-209 today for restarting the B-2
production line to add nine more of the radar-evading stealth
bombers to its force.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft were included in the 268 billion U.S. dollars
defense authorization for the 1998 fiscal year which the House was
to vote for on Tuesday. The total defense funding is 2.6 billion
dollars more than President Bill Clinton requested.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Defense William Cohen wrote to House National
Security Committee chairman Floyd Spence, objecting the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the Pentagon was unanimous in its view that "the
cost of further B-2 production cannot be justified."
</P>
<P>
The black, delta-shaped B-2 was originally developed in the
1980s in replacement of the B-1. It uses special "stealth"
radar-evasion technology to penetrate enemy airspace undetected.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon has bought 21 of the planes and the manufacturer
has offered to build another 20.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Walled City Tells of Hong Kong History (1) by Xu Xingtang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- It is a typical Chinese garden
in the style popular south of the Yangtze and, though smaller than
many of its kind, a famous park on the site of the former Kowloon
Walled City has an extraordinary tale to tell.
</P>
<P>
When a plane hovers over Kowloon to approach Kai Tak Airport,
passengers sitting by portholes can get a glimpse of the small
park right under the line.
</P>
<P>
Although it is called a "city", it does not resemble a city at
all with only an area of only 31,000 sq m. hemmed in by clusters
of grey residential buildings on the Kowloon Peninsular.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is a place to create miracles, as people often
praise, and the Walled City itself is all the more a marvelous
place that no other single locality can match when you recall the
historical burden it had endured over the past 150-plus years.
</P>
<P>
Overlooking the Kowloon Bay, the strategical importance of this
site is obvious. As early as 1668, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911)
set up a signal post here and, around 1810, a fortress was built
at the beach head for defense purpose.
</P>
<P>
After British intruders seized the Hong Kong Island in 1841,
the place became even more vital to China's maritime defenses. And
from 1843 to 1847, the Chinese garrison troops enclosed the site
with tall stone walls, hence the name "Walled City". Inside the
city, there were scores of structures for military purpose and
residential houses.
</P>
<P>
The heads of the Qing Dynasty defending troops were the
Commodore of the Dapeng Brigade and the Kowloon Assistant Military
Inspectorate, whose official residences were named "Yamen" then,
which still remain intact inside today. When the city walls were
completed, there were some 250 troopers stationed there, which
subsequently increased to some 500 in 1898.
</P>
<P>
Despite fierce resistance by local residents, the British
troops marched further northernward in 1898, and occupied by force
large tracts of land south of the Shumchun river and islands
around the Hong Kong Island, which were subsequently named "New
Territories". Even then the Walled City was still in the hands of
Chinese soldiers, even it was then a secluded area.
</P>
<P>
After their seizure of the Hong Kong Island, the "New
Territories" and the islands scattered in the surrounding waters,
the British rulers felt extremely uneasy with the Walled City --
it was as if a nail pegged in their eyes.
</P>
<P>
And in 1899, the haughty British forces broke into the city and
forced the Qing garrison troops out, turning the city into a
semi-anarchistic squatter slum.
</P>
<P>
Not many years afterwards, the Chinese soldiers and residents
living in the Walled City fell into the clutches of the "evil from
the east" -- as they put it. During the Japanese occupation of
1941-45, the Japanese troops torn down the wall and used its
bricks and rocks to extend and reinforce the runway of nearby Kai
Tak Airport.

<P>
After the Japanese surrender, the old-day disorder was resumed
in the city.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-British Joint Declaration signed in 1984 laid down the
basis for giving the city a bright face-lift and improving the
living environment inside. In early 1987, China and the British
Hong Kong government reached an agreement to clear the area and
build a park on the site.
</P>
<P>
Now the place has become one of Hong Kong's busies tourist
attractions in the name of Kowloon Walled City Park. Since its
official opening in October 1995, it has received approximately
two million visitors.
</P>
<P>
"On weekends and public holidays we receive a daily average of
more than 5,000 visitors at weekends or on public holidays," said
Luk Pui-fong, manager of the park.
</P>
<P>
She said students from many schools are organized to visit the
park and learn the history of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Among the many local and overseas visitors, there are a group
of very special elderly people who come to the park every morning
-- the former dwellers of the city, who have moved to nearby
residential areas since the place was turned into the beautiful
park.
</P>
<P>
One of them, 65-year-old Wong Chit-fat, said: "I had lived here
since my birth in the walled city, and everything here will endure
in my mind, " he said, sitting in the wooden corridor of the park.
</P>
<P>
"As Hong Kong is soon to return to the motherland, it's a good
thing to build a so beautiful park here," he said.
</P>
<P>
Entering the South Gate of the park, a rockery of Taihu Lake
stone is in sight, on which there are two large Chinese characters
reading "Gui Bi", which means "returned jasper".
</P>
<P>
"It indicates Hong Kong's return to China," said Luk Pui-fong.
</P>
<P>
As one of the major sites for holding various activities in
celebration of Hong Kong's turn to the motherland. In the days
around July 1, quite a number of celebration programs will take
place in the park, the park manager said.

<HEADLINE> Land Freeze Seen as Aiding Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Development of land for
non-farming purposes will be frozen this year to help revive
Shanghai's real estate market, today's China Daily cited
vice-mayor of the city Xia Keqiang as saying.
</P>
<P>
The vice-mayor said the city is mapping out a land-use plan for
1997 that will be submitted to the State Council for approval.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time," Xia said, "The city will take measures to
invigorate its real estate market.
</P>
<P>
"Land authorities are not entitled to accept the applications."
After booming for several years, the real estate market has
stagnated and is now saddled with empty housing units and idle
land.
</P>
<P>
Between 1991 and 1996, Shanghai authorized 84,337 hectares of
land for development. But 6,667 hectares remain undeveloped, a
significant loss to farm production.
</P>
<P>
Xia asked for fast resolution of such inefficient use of
land. "Nobody is allowed to use new land for real estate projects
this year," Xia told a real estate conference.
</P>
<P>
Key municipal woks and residential housing projects cannot
proceed without approval from the municipal government, the
vice-mayor stressed.

<HEADLINE> China Tightens Control Over Pollution From Cement Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- China's cement manufacturers will
have to comply with the dust discharge standards set by the state
in the coming three years, said an official with the State Bureau
of Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
Those that fail to live up to the requirements within the
prescribed time limit will be shut down down, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The dust pollution in cement production has come under
state-level major control projects for the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than six million tons of
dust are discharged in China every year and about 60 percent of
them are discharged by cement plants which number over 8,000.
</P>
<P>
The dust discharged by medium-sized and small cement plants
which account for 60 percent of the total has gone far beyond the
standards set by the state due mainly to their backward production
methods, the official said.
</P>
<P>
It was revealed that the State Economic and Trade Commission
has listed the backward indigenous cement production technology
in the backward technologies list for compulsory elimination. The
list is to be published soon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the State Bureau of Environmental Protection and the
State Bureau of Building Materials will produce a series of
corresponding measures to standardize pollution control for the
cement industry.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Loses One Million Hectares of Farmland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has lost almost one
million hectares of its farmland over the past five years, a
professor of agriculture said.
</P>
<P>
Bunasor Sanim, vice rector for finance and administration at
Bogor Agriculture Institute, told a seminar Monday that the
farmland had been converted to other uses such as industry,
infrastructure, human settlement and other urban development,
reports reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
"About 50 to 60 percent of the converted farmland is in Java,"
he said after the opening of the seminar on sustainable
agriculture development in the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
This caused great productivity losses in the farming sector
because the soil in Java was highly fertile, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the agricultural
sector contributed only about 16.8 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP) in 1994, but it employed 37.9 million or 46.1
percent of the workforce in the country.

SAN JOSE, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican Central Bank
President Rodrigo Bolanos said today that the gross domestic
product (GDP) in the country will grow by 2.5 percent this year
while inflation will be below 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
This situation could bring about lower interest rates that
would contribute to reactivating of the economy, Bolanos said.
</P>
<P>
The monthly index of economic activity rose from 0.9 percent to
1.3 in the past six months, while exports rose five percent and
imports 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
An increase in the sale of cement during the past few months
seemed to indicate the reactivation of an important sector of the

Bolanos also highlighted the announcement of more than 300
million U.S. dollars worth of investment by the microchip

<HEADLINE> Surplus Workers Need New Concepts in Re-employment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- One third of the workers in
China's State-owned enterprises has been rendered redundant in the
course of reform and that has become a major challenge in
transforming the nation's unprofitable old industries, today's
"China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, with the establishment of a market economy and
the deepening of reforms in State enterprises, many unnecessary
positions were eliminated.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based English newspaper says that about 30 percent
of China's labour force works in the service industry. The ratio
is too low, even lower than that of some other developing
countries. Experts suggest China needs to create wider variety of
jobs for the redundancies.
</P>
<P>
In the past, State enterprises used to be the main channel for
taking in labor. But, with the deepening of reforms, the booming
private sector has provided an alternative.
</P>
<P>
The government is encouraging the development of private and
collective businesses to take in more surplus labor. But some people
continue to seek jobs in State enterprises, which are regarded as
more secure than those in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
In line with the situation, the government is trying to
complete its social security system to guarantee the basic needs
of the unemployed, and at the same time, encourage people to give
up their wait-and-see attitude and become more self-supporting.
</P>
<P>
With the fast pace of modernization, the service trade has
absorbed some of the labor, and the labour-intensive service
trade is a good alternative.
</P>
<P>
In the long run, an adequate market mechanism should be
cultivated in resettling the surplus labour, the paper says.

<HEADLINE> Panama's Economy Reports 3.6 Percent Quarterly Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Panama's economy showed clear
signs of recovery with a 3.6 percent growth in the first quarter
of this year, Economic Planning Minister Guillermo Chapman said.
</P>
<P>
The quarterly growth relative to the same period of 1996 should
be attributed to a strong expansion in the country's construction,
electricity and port activities, Chapman told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister acknowledged, restaurants, personal
services, commerce, international bank transactions and banana
production experienced a contraction during the three-month period.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian economy benefited from favorable international
conditions such as low interest and inflation rates, he said.
</P>
<P>
The abundance of financial funds and the strong economic growth
in the United States since the end of 1996 have also played a part
in the Central American nation's economic recovery, Chapman noted.
</P>
<P>
Exports by Panama recorded a robust 3.3 percent rise during the
first quarter of 1997 compared with the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The chief economic planner forecast that Panama is likely to
register a 3.6 percent growth rate this year if the momentum
continues. Last year, the country's economy grew by 2.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Central China Starts Building Hydro-electric Power Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Work on the new Gaobazhou Hydropower
Station on the Qingjiang River that flows through an impoverished
part of central Hubei Province started recently.
</P>
<P>
It will have three generating units of 84,000 kw each and will
cost three billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
As an example of the policy of "first building power stations
and then getting management rights, developing river valleys, and
expanding hydro-electric power development in more areas," it is
expected to provide experience for hydro-electric power
development in the Three Gorges Dam on the middle reaches of the
Yangtze River and for stations on other rivers.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, experts put forward a plan for three separate
power stations on the river, which would have a combined
generating capacity of 3.05 million kw and could generate 8.5
billion kw/hours of electricity a year.
</P>
<P>
The first station, the Geheyan on the middle reaches of the
Qingjiang River, was completed in 1994 one year ahead of schedule
at a cost of five billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
It has a capacity of 1.2 million kw and has generated 9.5
billion kw/hours of electricity so far.
</P>
<P>
The Shuibuya Station's location on the upper reaches has been
decided on, and feasibility studies are being done.
</P>
<P>
When all three stations are finished they will play an
important role in balancing power with the Three Gorges Dam.

<HEADLINE> British Airways to Open New Routes to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- British Airways plans to open
four new air routes between Britain and Chinese cities before
2000, a senior manager of the company announced in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The flights will link London with metropolitan Shanghai,
as well as south China's cities of Guangzhou, Zhuhai and Shenzhen,
said Charles Phelps-Penry, head of British Airway's office in
China.
</P>
<P>
At present, the airline runs three flights bound for Beijing
every week. It will open the fourth in March next year, and
eventually increase the frequency to seven flights a week, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The manager quoted an internaional association of airlines as
saying that the in- and out-bound passenger flow in China
will increas at an annual rate of 15 to 20 percent in the next four
to five years, much higher than the world average of 9.4
percent. He said if his company did not seize the opportunity, it
would loss China market in the cut-throat international
competition.
</P>
<P>
To cater to the Chinese passengers, British Airways plans to
recruit air stewards from China, serve Chinese-style food and
provide Chinese newspapers and magazines on board, he said.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen-bound Visa Process Simplified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- There's no need to fill in the
entry-exit card, no need to pay visa fees, and even no need to
enter and exit from the same port for foreign visitors at Shenzhen
customes, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
This convenience is enjoyed every day by more than 330
foreigners, on average, as they enter Shenzhen Special Economic
Zone (SEZ) in south China from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We are greatly encouraged by the success the service has made
in attracting foreign tourists," the national English newspaper
quoted Jiang Xing, an official with Shenzhen Public Security
Bureau in South China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
After the handover of the bordering Hong Kong, she said, this
SEZ will improve the service by offering more favorable policies.
</P>
<P>
One that was just approved will grant separate visa for
foreigners who have special needs to leave Shenzhen for other
cities in China.
</P>
<P>
"Undoubtedly, the city can shorten its distance with the
outside world through these favors," Fang was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Starting in December 1994, the convenient entry-exit service
was co-organized by government departments in public security,
frontier inspection, tourism, foreign affairs and customs.
</P>
<P>
The special visa is valid for 72 hours. All foreign tourists
visiting Hong Kong can benefit from it except foreign
correspondents, senior foreign government officials and citizens
from countries that have not established diplomatic relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
But they have to enter Shenzhen from Hong Kong after having
organized into groups.
</P>
<P>
Besides exemption from filling in entry or exit cards, and
paying visa fees, foreigners holding this visa can enter and leave
freely from any of the five ports in Shenzhen - Luohu, Huanggang,
Shekou, Shatoujiao and Wenjindu.
</P>
<P>
So far, this visa had helped more than 17,000 foreign groups,
totaling 248,000 tourists, into Shenzhen by the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
During the first five months this year, more than 50,000
foreigners visited Shenzhen in 3,600 groups, accounting for
one-third of the total entry amount, according to China Daily.

ASUNCION -- During the 12th Mercosur summit, the four
presidents from the bloc member countries agreed to intensify
integration and accept Chile and Bolivia to the organization's
negotiations vis-a-vis the Free Trade Area of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
At that summit held here on June 18-19, the presidents of
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, the Mercosur partners,
urged that the mechanisms required for the compliance of the
objective be established within six months.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- The Brazilian government decided to extend the
exemption granted to its Mercosur partners on its import
restrictions for another three months.
</P>
<P>
The exemptions, which were to expire July 31, will continue
until October 31.
</P>
<P>
Treasury Minister Pedro Malan said that during the period of
credit restrictions, there was a very significant increase in
Brazilian imports from Chile and Bolivia because the restrictions
reduced the financial gains that were were being obtained by
importers through the use of commercial loans.
</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- Argentine Economy Minister Roque Fernandez
denied that there was a subsidy war between his country and Brazil
in the face of Brazil's refusal to eliminate import restrictions.

position on domestic industrial promotion.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- On June 19, the Chamber of Industries in Uruguay
(CIU) rejected again the measures implemented by Brazil on April 1
to restrict imports.
</P>

The CIU said the Brazilian resolution is, in reality, a
protectionistic measure and it provokes uncertainty and loss of
credibility in the Mercosur integration process.
</P>
<P>
ASUNCION -- The Mercosur parliamentary committee agreed to set
up a court to resolve the disputes among its members.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting which ended here on June 20, the committee also

<HEADLINE> Singaporean Housewife Jailed For Sex With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 24 (Xinhua) -- In the first case of its kind in
Singapore, a woman was sentenced to a six-month jail term on
Monday for committing an obscene act of having sex with a
13-year-old boy, the Straits Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that housewife Yu Chiew Tuan, 33, pleaded
guilty tearfully to what is believed to be the first case of its
kind under the Children and Young Persons Act. She had sex with
the boy brought home by her husband "to please her" in July last
year.
</P>
<P>
Yu Chiew Tuan's lawyer reportedly said that she had never
thought it was an offense to have sex with a boy. To her, she was
merely having sex with a consenting party.
</P>
<P>
However, District Judge S. Thyagarajan said sexual exploitation
of children must be punished severely.
</P>
<P>
The Straits Times report said that police discovered the
offense on January 7, this year.
</P>
<P>
Chua Peng Huey, Yu's 43-year-old husband, was then a night
guard in a children's home and he had molested four boys aged
between 12 and 14, for which he is serving a sentence of 42 months
and eight strokes of the cane. He had taken one of the boys home
for his wife.
</P>
<P>
At Chua's hearing in March, counsel had told the court in
mitigation that he took the victim home to "please his wife" as he
could not satisfy her sex demands. Their sex problem had created
tension in the marriage and he was worried she would leave him for
another man.

the capital markets have also encouraged BA operation officials
in China to expand their investment banking services here, said
bank chairman David Coulter.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing branch, which covers northern and northeastern
China, will seek clients interested in using capital markets as a
funding source.

<P>
Beijing branch officials said they are already discussing
fund-raising programs with some enterprises in northeast China,
one of the country's largest industrial hubs.

<HEADLINE> Maternal Mortality Down in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Maternal mortality in Mexico
was down 27.7 percent between 1994-96, said a report available
today from the Mexican Social Security Institute.
</P>
<P>
The death rate dropped from 57.6 deaths for every 100,000 live
births in 1994 to 29.9 per 100,000 in 1996, said the Reproductive
Health Program of the institute, known as IMSS in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the lower mortality rate among the
country's pregnant women to their increased participation in
reproductive health programs developed by various institutions.
</P>
<P>
These programs offer comprehensive attention to women at
child-bearing ages and their infants by covering areas such as
prenatal and infant health, family planning and adolescent care.
</P>
<P>
The IMSS assisted in 842,000 deliveries or obstetric events in
1994, but the figure was down to 663,000 in 1996 thanks to better
access to higher quality prenatal, maternal and infant care.

<HEADLINE> Six Teams Qualify for Volleyball World League Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Six teams have qualified for the
men's volleyball World League finals in Moscow as games in three
pools concluded on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100,000 spectators saw Cuba, Brazil, Italy, Bulgaria,
Netherlands and Russia qualify for Moscow finals slated from June
30th to July 5th.
</P>
<P>
In Pool A, Brazil had a difficult second match against Japan
with young Japanese players finding themselves in good fighting
spirit and even taking one set. In Rosario, Argentina gave a hard
time to Bulgaria, even leading 2-1 in the second match.
</P>
<P>
In a crowded stadium in Belgrade in Pool B, Yugoslavia was
leading Italy in the first two sets of the first match before the
injury of its captain Dejan Brdjovic allowed Bebetto's players to
rally and win the first match.
</P>
<P>
The second match went to the tie-break and Yugoslavia finally
took over 15-12. They had preserved a small chance to qualify for
Moscow and had to wait for the result of Argentina against
Bulgaria to face the final and bitter decision to be excluded from
the final six.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a reborned Chinese team imposed two straight
defeats to a disheartened Spanish team.
</P>
<P>
In Pool C, Russia at home, playing with a complete roster, did
not have much problem to dispose off a South Korean team,
physically weakened and incapable to display its usual fighting
spirit.
</P>
<P>
The real suspense was in Cuba. In front of 20,000 spectators,
the young Cubans imposed their superior attack and block against a
Dutch team fighting on every point.
</P>
<P>
The second match was a thriller, each team taking the lead by
turn, before the Dutchmen took over in the tie-break to win the
match and their tickets for the finals in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
On July 5, top two teams in the six-member round-robin
tournament will vie for the 1997 World League Champion title and a
prize money of 1,000,000 US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Play Greater Role: Senior Government Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will have closer
economic relations with China's interior areas after its return to
the motherland on July 1, according to a senior government
official.
</P>
<P>
After Hong Kong's return, the advantages of Hong Kong and the
interior areas will be combined better and that will produce
greater economic returns, said Rafael Hui Si-yan, secretary for
Financial Service of the future Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region government.
</P>
<P>
"After its return to the motherland, Hong Kong will be able to
continue to bring its special advantages into full play, help
implement the country's reform and open-up policy, and contribute
to the economic construction of the inland areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hui, 49, who joined the public service after graduation from
Hong Kong University in 1970, became the first Chinese secretary
for Financial Service in the British Hong Kong government in
September 1995.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, an economic metropolis, civil servants in charge
of making economic policy decisions must have a good knowledge of
the city's economic operation, and understand what manufacturers
and business people are thinking about, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the main function of the Financial Service Branch
is to formulate government financial and monetary policies, and
set targets for the financial policy, so that Hong Kong will
maintain a "fair, efficient and vibrant" market operational and
regulatory mechanism that meet international standards.
</P>
<P>
"This will help to ensure the competitiveness of Hong Kong in
the Asia-Pacific region and in the world as a whole, and to retain
Hong Kong's status as an international financial center," he said.
</P>
<P>
For Hong Kong industrialists and business people, it is
important to learn about the latest economic information, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Census and Statistics Department under the
charge of the Financial Services Branch is in charge of providing
economic statistics for investors and research institutes both at
home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
By collecting various kinds of economic data, staff of the
department regularly release statistics, which have become an
indispensable component of Hong Kong's economic life, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the department are in line with the
principle of factual accuracy, and are not subject to the
influence of other factors.
</P>
<P>
"The department releases both good news and bad news," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both local companies and overseas investors rely on these
statistics to make their commercial decisions, he said, noting:
"If the figures are not accurate, market operation will be
adversely affected."
</P>
<P>
Factors that have contributed to Hong Kong's economic success
have been reflected in the Basic Law, he said.
</P>
<P>
"So long as we failthfully implement the Basic Law, we shall be
able to make sure that Hong Kong will continue to maintain its
status as an international financial center," Hui said.
</P>
<P>
To enhance its competitiveness in the world market, Hong Kong
should always maintain its export-oriented economic model, the
regulation of the market operation to be fair and transparent, and
a free flow of information, as well as to ensure the quality of
professionals in all sectors, he said..
</P>
<P>
On economic prospects, he said as a special administrative
region of the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong would be in a
"very favorable" position. For example, by utilizing its
experience in financial service and its advantageous position, it
can raise funds for national construction and enterprises in the
inland areas.
</P>
<P>
The Asia-Pacific region is the region that has scored the
fastest economic growth in the world, and China is the country
that has achieved the most rapid economic growth in the
Asia-Pacific Region, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a major bridge linking China with the rest of the world,
Hong Kong will certainly be able to play an even greater role in
the future, he added.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The labor market in Mexico has
a deficit of 1.052 million jobs at present, according to figures
provided by the National Statistics, Geography and Computer
Database Institute (INEGI).
</P>
<P>
Only 430,000 new jobs in the formal sectors were created during
the first five months of this year, not enough to meet the demand
for jobs which amounted to 1.482 million.
</P>
<P>
For its part the informal economic sector has served as a
cushion for labor market adjustments, by absorbing a substantial
portion of the excess labor supply.
</P>
<P>
Experts said underemployment prevailed as a structural problem
of the economy since those who worked less than 15 hours a week
accounted for 5 percent of the total labor market, the highest
rate in the last 14 months.
</P>
<P>
Underemployment affected close to 1.826 million Mexicans who
have been rejected because of downsizing and who are looking for
work within an environment of latent unemployment, the INEGI

<HEADLINE> Ban on Development of Small Thermal Power Stations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Provincial authorities of
central China's Henan have banned construction of thermal power
stations with generating capacities below 100,000 kw.
</P>
<P>
The authorities will encourage different localities to finance
large-capacity power plants, so as to meet the demand for transfer
of economic growth mode in the power industry and to suit the
demand of environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Over past years, Henan has witnessed fast expansion in its
power industry. Small thermal power stations in some areas have
been tangled in a fight for a bigger share of the power market.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the province had owned moderate and
low pressure generating units with a combined capacity of 3.1
million kw, accounting for 28 percent of the province's total
generating capacity.
</P>
<P>
Construction of small thermal power stations across the
province with an aggregate generating capacity of 1.5 million kw,
is still being carried out swiftly, while more localities have
proposed that new small thermal stations with three million kw be
constructed.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government said in its decree that they would
tighten macro control over small thermal power stations in
different localities and be strict with the approving procedures
for these projects, stipulating that small thermal power stations
without permit will get no loans, nor land allocation.
</P>
<P>
People held responsible for getting small thermal power
stations approved and constructed without proper authorization
from the day when the decree is made known to the public, which
have also caused environmental pollution or economic losses to the
state or the collective, will be severely dealt with.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- China is now the third largest
market for household electrical appliances with sales of the
products accounting for seven percent of the world's total in 1996,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
China's sales of household electrical appliances were 110
billion yuan (13 billion US dollars) in 1996, with world total
sales amounting to 200 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Only the United States and Japan have larger market shares,
according to the industry's annual working conference, which
opened Monday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The household electrical appliance industry maintained a 32
percent growth during 1986-95, faster than in any other country.
</P>
<P>
Production of major products, such as refrigerators, washing
machines, electric irons, fans and cookers, is the largest in the
world. Production of other products including air conditioners is
also among the largest, the conference reported.
</P>
<P>
Exports of household electrical appliances have increased about
20 percent annually in the past several years, with total exports
topping 2.75 billion US dollars in 1996.

A survey of appliance sales in 100 large department stores in
35 cities showed all the top 10 brands are domestic.

<P>
Domestic-made refrigerators share 93 percent of the market,
freezers 89 percent, washing machines 83 percent and air
conditioners 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
All these achievements are significant since China's household
electrical appliance industry has developed from almost nothing,
said Yang Zhihai, vice-chairman of China National Council of
Light Industry.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, less than five percent of urban families owned
a refrigerator, but in 1996 about 70 percent of urban families had
a refrigerator. Nearly 12 percent of urban families had air
conditioners in 1996, while very few families in the early 1980s
could afford the luxury product.
</P>
<P>
Through competition among themselves as well as against strong
foreign companies, some Chinese appliance enterprises have built
up famous brand names and established an economy of scale.
</P>
<P>
Basically a processing industry, the appliance industry has to
be an economy of scale to be profitable.

<HEADLINE> Three Former US Presidents Support MFN for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Former presidents George Bush,
Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter today expressed their support for the
extension of the MFN trade status for China in their separate
letters to the incumbent President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Bush said in his letter, released by the White House,
"Withholding MFN is not a sensible approach to resolving our
differences (between the two countries). Quite on the contrary, I
am convinced that withholding MFN, of even conditioning its
application to China, would be severely counterproductive."
</P>
<P>
The three former presidents' letters followed those that fed
the same support for the renewal of the MFN status for China.
</P>
<P>
A letter from former secretaries of state said, "MFN revocation
would effectively cut off trade between our two countries and
thereby deal a devastating blow to our overall relationship. It
would undermine the progress we have made working with China on
critical issues, from stability on the Korean Peninsula to
stemming the flow of illegal aliens and narcotics."
</P>
<P>
Ten former defense secretaries made the same expression.
</P>
<P>
They said the most promising way to solve differences between
the two countries is "for the United States to continue to build a
relationship of mutual engagement with China."

<HEADLINE> Developed Countries Urged to Honor Commitments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- President of Tanzania
Benjamin W. Mkapa today urged the developed countries to honor
their commitments on official development aid (ODA) and addressing
environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the "Group of 77" and China at the Earth
Summit+5, he said that it had been agreed at Rio to reach the UN
target of developed countries contributing 0.7 percent of their
gross national product to ODA. That contribution had declined
since Rio from 0.34 percent in 1992 to 0.25 percent now.
</P>
<P>
"Each decline in ODA erodes the capacity of developing
countries to implement Rio agreements and action plan," he said.
</P>
<P>
The global Environment Facility capital also needed to be
increased substantially to enable it to provide adequate finance for
programs that were within its mandate, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Africa's external debt was unsustainable. "While
recent initiatives for debt relief are welcome, when criteria for
eligibility are too stringent or when promised relief is to be
realized in the too distant future, `the medicine may arrive when
the patient is beyond help.'"
</P>
<P>
He also urged the developed countries to transfer technologies
to developing countries on a predictable and sustainable basis.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the environmental degradation caused by unsustainable
patterns of consumption and production, particularly in developed
countries, should be addressed, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The current special session should mark the beginning of a
global partnership for sustainable development through increased
ODA and direct investment, for financing capacity building, and
for preferential and unrestricted access to the market of
developed countries, he said.

<HEADLINE> Song Jian Urges Closing of Gap Between Words, Deeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councillor
Song Jian said today that to close the gap between words and deeds
should be the key to promoting international
environment-and-development cooperation in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Song made the remarks in his address to the U.N. Special
Session on Environment. The meeting comes five years after a
summit in Rio de Janeiro where 10,000 diplomats and
environmentalists outlined an ambitious blueprint to safeguard the
planet, which is known as Agenda 21.
</P>
<P>
On the past five years' work, Song said that the international
community has made notable achievements in implementing the Rio
Declaration and Agenda 21.
</P>
<P>
"Of these the most outstanding are that the concept of
sustainable development has begun taking root in people's minds,
permeating among all sectors of economic and social life and
becoming the guiding principle of countries in formulating their
development strategy," he said.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "there is still quite a gap between what we have
done and what needs to be done to realize a global sustainable
development." Till now, most developed countries have not made
good their commitments. The percentage of their official
development aid in GNP has dropped to the lowest level in 25
years. Some developed countries are pursuing new trade
protectionism under the pretext of environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that to fully implement the concept of protecting
the environment in the course of development and to close the gap
between words and deeds should be the theme of the special session
of this Assembly and the key to promoting international
environment-and-development cooperation in the 21st century," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Our objective is to achieve a global sustainable development
in the 21st century," Song said. "To strengthen cooperation is the
only way to fulfill this historical mission."
</P>
<P>
Song put forward three proposals on how to strengthen
international cooperation in the field of environment.
</P>
<P>
First, developed countries have the capability and unshirkable
historical responsibility to share with developing countries the
achievement of a new round of scientific and technological
revolution, he said.
</P>
<P>
Second, more favorable conditions should be created, according
to the principles enshrined in the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21,
for developing countries in their economic development and
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
"The most important issue at present is to overcome trade
protectionism of various kinds and to establish an equitable,
rational and integrated multilateral trading system so as to
facilitate the positive interaction of trade and environment," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Third, strong measures should be taken to reverse the trend of
sharp decrease in development funding for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"Adequate financial resources are a necessary condition to
improve the capability of developing countries in the
implementation of Agenda 21," he said.
</P>
<P>
Song also gave advice to the developing countries on how to
pursue sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
"The developing countries, while actively seeking international
support and assistance, should fully tap their own potentials," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"They cannot and should not follow the same old development
patterns of developed countries in `pollution first and treatment
later,' but rather take the road of sustainable development right
from the initial stage of development," he said.

<HEADLINE> Song Jian on China's Implementation of Agenda 21 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councillor
Song Jian told the U.N. Special Session on Environment today that
China has achieved great progress in the field of sustainable
development since the 1992 Earth Summit.
</P>
<P>
"I am glad to report to this Assembly that while registering
rapid economic growth in recent years, China has basically avoided
drastic environmental degradation and even registered some partial
improvement in the nation's environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Special Session on Environment comes five years after
the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro where 10,000 diplomats and
environmentalists outlined an ambitious blueprint to safeguard the
planet, which is later known as Agenda 21.
</P>
<P>
In a six-page speech to the Special Session, Song Jian outlined
six areas where China has gained progress by promoting sustainable
development according to Agenda 21:
</P>
<P>
-- Since the early 1990s, China's GNP has been growing at an
average annual rate of more than 10 percent and the
poverty-stricken population has declined from 80 million to 58
million at present;
</P>
<P>
-- Rapid population growth has been brought under control and
the nation's natural population growth rate has dropped steadily;
</P>
<P>
-- Notable achievements have been made in comprehensively
utilizing resources by promoting their conservation and by relying
on scientific and technological progress;
</P>
<P>
-- Efforts have been made to promote clean production
processes. The increase in discharged pollutants has been
effectively curbed by the closing down of 62,000 seriously
polluting enterprises;
</P>
<P>
-- More attention has been given to forest cultivation and a
nation-wide voluntary afforestation drive. Man-made forests now
cover 34.25 million hectares. Forest coverage increased from 12.98
percent in 1992 to 13.92 percent in 1996;
</P>
<P>
-- Greater efforts have been devoted to preserving
bio-diversity. A network of nature reserves has basically taken
shape, covering 71.85 million hectares or 7.2 percent of China's
total territory. Most of the endangered species are being
affectively protected.
</P>
<P>
Song told the assembly that these achievements have been scored
by the Chinese people and government by mainly relying on their
own efforts, which proves the effectiveness of China's policy of
integrating environmental and economic development.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with Agenda 21, he said, China took the lead to
formulate "China's Agenda 21," -- the White Paper on China's
Population, Environment and Development in the 21st Century, which
sets forth the guiding principles of holistic planning and
coordinated development of economy, society, resources and
environment.
</P>
<P>
Noting the severe environmental challenges China is still
faced, Song expressed optimism towards the future of the country
in accomplishing the goals of basically providing adequate food
and clothing to the poverty-stricken population by the end of the
century, achieving zero population growth around the year of 2030
and doing a good job in environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
"As the biggest developing country in the world, China will
contribute significantly to global environmental protection and
economic development by running her own affairs well," he said.

WASHINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States today called

threatened to impose further sanctions on Iraq next October if
Baghdad continued obstructing the inspectors' activities in Iraq.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of the United
States today, overturning its 1985 church-state decision, ruled
that public school teachers can offer remedial help at religious
schools.
</P>
<P>
The 5-4 decision is expected to save millions of dollars a year
in administrative costs for a federal program to help children
from low-income families.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said in a statement that the
court's ruling "will raise educational standards for children
across America."
</P>
<P>
A 1965 law known as Title I requires federally funded remedial
help for underachieving students from low-income families, no
matter what school they attend. But the Supreme Court ruled in
1985 the practice unconstitutionally broke down the wall between
church and state.
</P>
<P>
Since then, religious school children who qualify have been
getting the remedial help in public schools or other venues such
as in mobile vans parked just off parochial school property or by
computer.
</P>
<P>
Department of Education officials estimate the annual cost
nationwide to be 15 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Dow Plunges 192 Points </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
suffered its worst point drop since the crash of 1987 as rising
interest rates spurred a spree of profit-taking on Wall Street's
record-setting advance.
</P>
<P>
The Dow plunged 192.25 points to 7.604.26. It was the blue-chip
barometer's biggest point-drop since it lost 508 points on the
Black Monday crash of October 19, 1987 and slightly more than a
190.58-point drop in October 1989.
</P>
<P>
Both of those drops were far more significant in percentage

<HEADLINE> Former FBI Agent Sentenced to 27 Years for Spying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. District Court in
Alexandria, Va., today sentenced a former agent of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to 27 years in prison for spying for
Moscow during and after the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
Earl Pitts, 44, had been charged with selling U.S.
intelligences secrets to the Russians for more than 224,000 U.S.
dollars from 1987 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
The 13-year FBI veteran was arrested at the FBI training
academy in Quantico, Va. last December for passing vital national
security secrets to Russian intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
He was the second FBI agent sentenced for spying for foreign
nations. The other FBI agent ever caught spying was Richard W.
Miller, a Los Angeles agent who was arrested in 1984 and later
sentenced to 20 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, CIA agent Harold Nicholson was sentenced to
23 years for selling secrets to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Pitts sought out a Soviet agent and offered his services while
stationed in Moscow in 1987 before moving to the FBI's New York
office, where he was assigned to hunt and recruit KGB officers.
From 1989 to 1992, he worked on top-secret records and personnel
security at FBI headquarters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The FBI said Pitts turned over a secret computerized FBI list
of all Soviet officials in the United States with their known or
suspected posts in Soviet spy agencies.
