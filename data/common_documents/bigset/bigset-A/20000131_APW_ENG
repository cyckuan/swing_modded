Kenya Airways Flight Crashes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- A Kenya Airways jet carrying 169 passengers and
10 crew members crashed into the sea Sunday night, shortly after takeoff from
Abidjan. At least seven people were pulled from the water alive, officials said.
The plane, an Airbus 310, took off at 9:08 p.m. and crashed into the Atlantic
Ocean just one minute later, according to George Dapre Yao, the head of air
traffic at Abidjan's Felix Houphouet-Boigny Airport. In Abidjan, witnesses said
the plane never appeared to get sufficient altitude as it crossed over the
airport's wall and headed out over the ocean, just a few hundred yards away.

Study Finds Austin, Phoenix Best Cities
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With robust finances and well-trained public work forces,
Austin, Texas, and Phoenix are the best-managed major American cities, according
to an analysis by Syracuse University. The study rated the municipal governments
of the nation's 35 largest cities in terms of revenues, assigning grades from A
to F on five management criteria: finances, human resources, capital,
information technology and results. A common factor in cities that scored well
was strong leadership, said Patricia W. Ingraham, director of the Government
Performance Project at Syracuse's Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public
Affairs.

	   HAVANA (AP) -- Thousands cheered in Havana Sunday as the Elian Gonzalez's
grandmothers returned from their trip to the United States. Since the two women
left Havana on Jan. 21, the government has given increasingly massive television
and newspaper coverage to their tour of the United States, crediting them with
helping sway U.S. public opinion toward Elian's return. The U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service has ruled Elian should be returned to his father. But
officials are awaiting the outcome of a federal court challenge filed by Miami
relatives before trying to return the boy.

Another Storm Strikes Southeast

	   ATLANTA (AP) -- A winter storm that glazed much of the Southeast in a thick
coat of ice moved up the coast Sunday, leaving warmer temperatures and drier
roads for thousands of football fans who trekked to the Georgia Dome to watch
the Super Bowl. The storm brought snow, sleet and rain from the Carolinas to
southeastern New York, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers. The
same storm had dumped more than a foot of snow in parts of the southern Plains
and the South just days earlier. It was expected to reach western Maine on
Monday.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. expands its roster of powerful allies in
its antitrust trial this week as former lawyers for Presidents Clinton and Bush
and two former U.S. attorneys general argue in legal filings that the software
giant didn't violate any federal laws. The latest round of legal filings,
expected on Tuesday, will identify which antitrust laws government lawyers
believe Microsoft violated during the Internet software "browser wars" of the

software runs most of the world's personal computers, abused its monopoly power
during its battle with the former Netscape Communications Corp.

Rams Snag First Superbowl Win
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Kurt Warner's 73-yard touchdown pass to Isaac Bruce with 1
minute, 54 seconds left gave the Rams their first Super Bowl win Sunday, 23-16.
The TD capped an improbable turnaround for St. Louis, which was 3-13 a year ago
and 13-3 this season as they scored 526 points, third best in NFL history. But
Steve McNair and Eddie George almost led Tennessee to another miracle finish,
rallying them from a 16-0 deficit. On the game's final play with six seconds
left, McNair's pass was caught by Kevin Dyson at the Rams 5. He scrambled for
the end zone only to be stopped just short by Mike Jones, as Dyson's
outstretched arm held the ball toward the goal line in vain.

<HEADLINE> Wife Held in Husband's Slaying  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- A beauty salon owner told police she dumped her estranged
husband's headless torso into a trash bin after finding him dead because she
feared she would be accused of murder, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
	   Valerie Pape, 47, was arrested Friday on suspicion of first-degree murder in
the slaying of a man believed to be Ira Pomerantz.
</P>
<P>
	   She's ``pretty shell-shocked,'' said her attorney, James Belanger. Ms. Pape,
who is French, ``doesn't even understand what goes on in the American legal
system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The mutilated torso was found Thursday afternoon in a trash bin behind a
supermarket. Police on Sunday were still trying to verify that it was the
60-year-old Scottsdale man. Ms. Pape reported him missing on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Police suspect others may have had roles in the slaying.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Pape was estranged from her husband, the former owner of two area bars.
Police had been called to their Scottsdale home a half dozen times for domestic
complaints, and Ms. Pape had sought an order of protection against Pomerantz.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the court documents, Ms. Pape told police she found her
husband's body in a pool of blood in her home Monday morning with a gun nearby.
Police said he had been fatally shot in the back with a medium- to large-caliber
gun.
</P>
<P>
	   She admitted cleaning up the blood and said she hid the weapon under the
seat of her car and tossed her husband's torso behind the store, but she did not
tell police how the body was dismembered, Mesa Det. Butch Gates wrote in court
documents.
</P>
<P>
	   A deliveryman told Mesa police that he had spotted Ms. Pape driving to the
dumpster in her Jaguar.

<HEADLINE> McNair Comes up Short in Bowl  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL NEWBERRY AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- For Steve McNair, the numbers don't mean a thing. He doesn't
listen to his critics. Winning is the only thing that matters.
</P>
<P>
	   He came up 1 yard short in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   McNair, trying to become the second black quarterback to lead his team to an
NFL championship, sparked a remarkable comeback that led the Tennessee Titans to
the brink of forcing the first overtime Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   The St. Louis Rams won 23-16 on Kurt Warner's 73-yard pass to Isaac Bruce
with 1:54 remaining, but not before McNair led his team back from a 16-0 deficit
and took the Titans 88 yards on their final drive.
</P>
<P>
	   The season ended with Kevin Dyson taking a quick pass from McNair and
sprawling toward the end zone, only to be stopped at the 1-yard line as time ran
out.
</P>
<P>
	   "We did what we wanted to do," McNair said. "We wanted to have a chance to
win in the fourth quarter. We just came up short."
</P>
<P>
	   McNair's numbers looked rather feeble when placed alongside Warner's.
</P>
<P>
	   The St. Louis quarterback was selected as MVP after setting a Super Bowl
record with 414 yards passing, while McNair threw for just 214 yards. But his
performance on four critical drives earned him praise from teammates and
opponents alike.
</P>
<P>
	   With his team trailing 16-0, McNair led the Titans to a pair of touchdowns,
then a game-tying field goal with 2:12 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   "The people who didn't know Steve McNair before will know him now," Titans
tight end Frank Wycheck said. "Did you see that desire? Did you see that heart?"
</P>
<P>
	   McNair's heart was epitomized on the heart-stopping final drive, when he
scrambled right and kept going deeper and deeper, chased by Kevin Carter -- the
league's sack leader -- and Jay Williams.
</P>
<P>
	   Just when he seemed certain to go down, McNair slipped away from both St.
Louis players and threw a 16-yard pass to Dyson to the Rams 10. The Titans used
their final timeout with six second left.
</P>
<P>
	   "At the end, when he had nothing left, Steve made a phenomenal play to get
the ball to Dyson and give us a chance to win," Wycheck said.
</P>
<P>
	   Afterward, Carter still couldn't believe that McNair got away.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's a warrior. He's a battler," Carter said. "He's got such a big heart.
He battled back and tried to win the game for his team."
</P>
<P>
	   After consecutive 8-8 seasons as the Titans starter, many people wondered if
McNair was capable of making his team a big winner. No one questioned his
toughness, but his passing numbers were mediocre. He was unable to make the deep
throws with consistency, had trouble picking up his secondary receivers and
seemed too apt to take off and run when the pressure was on.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not trying to prove anything," McNair said. "Regardless of how I
perform or what I do out on the field, I'm just trying to go out and help my
teammates get the job done."
</P>
<P>
	   He did that Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   McNair set a Super Bowl record for quarterbacks by rushing for 64 yards,
including a 23-yard scramble that set up the Titans' first touchdown. On the
final drive, he completed six passes for 48 yards and ran twice for 14 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   His final pass to Dyson was a quick slant over the middle, dubbed "Sliver
Right" in the Tennessee playbook. McNair delivered the ball perfectly. But Dyson
cut inside a little too quickly, and Rams linebacker Mike Jones made a great
one-on-one tackle to end the game.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's sad to come that close and come up short after playing such a great
game," said McNair, who had a 12-3 record this season as the Titans starter,
missing five games with a back injury. "That's the bad part of this game.
Someone has got to lose, but why couldn't it be a tie?"
</P>
<P>
	   McNair pondered the remarkable season and the one thing he will take away
from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't ever want to feel like this again," McNair said. "We were able to
get some Super Bowl experience. When we come back the next time, we'll feel more
comfortable. We're only going to get better."

<HEADLINE> George's Two Quick TDs Not Enough  </HEADLINE>
    By TERESA M. WALKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- When Eddie George woke up, so did the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1995 Heisman Trophy winner was a non-factor in the first half of Sunday
night's Super Bowl, nearly ignored, carrying the ball only seven times and
gaining just 18 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   But then came the third quarter, and he flashed the form that made him one
of only four backs to gain 1,200 yards or more in each of his first four NFL
season.
</P>
<P>
	   He helped the Titans come back from a 16-0 deficit, but he couldn't stop the
St. Louis Rams from winning the Super Bowl 23-16.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was one hell of a ride," he said. "It will always be special to me. We
just didn't make enough plays."
</P>
<P>
	   First, he capped a 12-play drive with a 1-yard TD run with 14 seconds left
in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   That was nothing compared with his fourth-quarter performance.
</P>
<P>
	   He carried seven times on the Titans' next possession, the final one a
beauty.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee had second-and-goal from the 1, and George just couldn't be
stopped.
</P>
<P>
	   He broke not one, not two, but three tackles to reach the end zone, getting
some help from officials. As he got past Jeff Zgonina, officials failed to rule
the play dead when George's left knee touched the turf short of the goal line.
Another burst put him over the plane and the knee was overlooked.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every time I touch the ball, I'm putting forth the effort to be as good as
I can be and to put this team in position to win," George said.
</P>
<P>
	   Coach Jeff Fisher said George simply did what he has always done. George
finished with 95 yards on 28 carries.
</P>
<P>
	   "Eddie wanted to carry the load, and it appeared for a while he was going to
do just that," Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   Then George, who became the Titans' head cheerleader this season, stood up
and screamed for his teammates to get going.
</P>
<P>
	   "All I cared about is that we kept on winning and kept fighting," George
said.
</P>
<P>
	   But on the final drive, which began with 1:54 remaining, there wasn't enough
time for a ground game, so the Titans turned to Steve McNair.
</P>
<P>
	   George had one last chance to help. But after catching 47 passes in the
regular season, he failed to turn around for a pass from McNair with half a
minute left, and the ball bounced off his elbow.
</P>
<P>
	   With six seconds left, McNair almost came through, finding Kevin Dyson over
the middle just inside the 5 on what would be the final play. McNair spun toward
the end zone, trying and trying to reach it as time expired.
</P>
<P>
	   But Mike Jones was there to hook his hip and bring him down. No touchdown.
No tie. No more miracles.
</P>
<P>
	   It's the first time since George was drafted in 1996 that he had carried for
at least 27 times in a loss. The Titans had been 15-0 in games where George had
that many carries until Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   George did finish the season with a piece of history. He topped Hall of Fame
running back Earl Campbell as the team's best postseason rusher. Campbell had
420 yards rushing in eight postseason appearances, while George has 449 yards in
four playoff games.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew this was it," George said. "I wanted to make the most of this
opportunity. It just wasn't enough."
</P>
<P>
	   At the end, as Dyson unsuccessfully scrambled for the end zone, George could
only watch.

<HEADLINE> Slow cleanup at Oil City is delaying expansion of Carousel Center  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - It's been more than two years since plans were
announced to dramatically increase the size of the already imposing Carousel
Center. That project is still on, but plans by The Pyramid Cos. to sell their
vast mall holdings are off.
<P>
	   The $200 million expansion of Carousel Center, which will double its size to
just over 2 million square feet, likely won't begin before 2001 because of soil
contamination problems, according to Bruce Kenan of Pyramid, which owns Carousel
Center and 23 other malls in New York, Vermont, and Massachusetts, as well as
seven others in various stages of development.
</P>
<P>
	   "The biggest issue out there right now is still the property cleanup," Kenan
said of Oil City, an 800-acre area at the southern end of Onondaga Lake that has
been home to fuel storage tanks for nearly 100 years. "The oil companies are
approaching their cleanup responsibilities with varying degrees of enthusiasm.
None of them are done as of now. One company has a long way to go."
</P>
<P>
	   Kenan said Pyramid is "frustrated" with the state Department of
Environmental Conservation, which is overseeing the cleanup of Oil City, site of
Carousel Center's planned expansion.
</P>
<P>
	   "They aren't approaching it aggressively," Kenan told the Syracuse Herald
American in Sunday's editions. "I don't want to get into a fight with them in
the newspaper, but this strikes me as peculiar. They have the regulatory weapons
at their disposal, much more so than us. I know they are getting somewhere with
the cleanup, but it's sort of like a rocking chair. There's a lot of feeling of
motion without going anywhere."
</P>
<P>
	   The sale of Pyramid's assets wasn't going anywhere, either, so Robert
Congel, founding partner of the Syracuse-based company, has taken it off the
real estate market.
</P>
<P>
	   "The sale is not something we are actively pursuing at this time," said
Kenan, also a partner in the business. "Talk about your windows of opportunity.
Things come and go. We went from a time where the sale had real potential to a
time, at least for now, where it doesn't."
</P>
<P>
	   Congel announced in April 1998 that he was trying to sell Pyramid, but the
frenzied buying and merging in the mall real estate market, which began in 1997,
already had begun to slow.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Pyramid hopes to add 1 million square feet to the 1.1
million-square-foot Carousel Center. The expansion, announced in 1997, includes
150 stores and restaurants, entertainment venues, an aquarium, a hotel and
first-class office space. It will encompass 66 acres at Oil City owned by Citgo,
Mobil and Sunoco.
</P>
<P>
	   Citgo has signed an agreement and started to clean its property. Mobil and
Sunoco are expected to sign cleanup deals by February.
</P>
<P>
	   DEC Regional Director Ken Lynch said the three companies are cooperating
with the state and the cleanup is moving forward. He said it was unfair to blame
the state for Pyramid's delays.
</P>
<P>
	   "It really involves Pyramid coming to an agreement with the oil companies on
how the mall's construction can begin at the same time remediation activities
move ahead," Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
	   State environmental officials are willing to permit the mall construction
and cleanup work to continue simultaneously, Lynch said. But he said the state
has yet to see a proposal from Pyramid or the oil companies that would allow
such work to move forward.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunoco owns the largest and most contaminated property, covering 25 acres.
Even though the company has no formal cleanup agreement with the state, it has
spent more than $4.5 million to get a head start on the job, company spokesman
Jerry Davis said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have taken this responsibility very seriously, and we want to cooperate
and do the right thing," Davis said. "But it's in the best interests of everyone
that it be done right. From our part, there is no intent to delay."
</P>
<P>
	   Kenan said it is unlikely Pyramid will begin construction this year "unless
something changes."
</P>
<P>
	   Pyramid employs 1,200 people, including 200 at its Syracuse headquarters.
The company's mall network has annual sales of about $3.6 billion.

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Ads Have Web Focus  </HEADLINE>
    By SKIP WOLLENBERG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Internet advertisers, making their most ambitious use yet
of TV's most expensive commercial showcase, ranged from poetic to prosaic in
trying to make names for themselves in Sunday's Super Bowl telecast.
</P>
<P>
	   Monster.com, the job site and Super Bowl repeater, ran a black-and-white ad
that showed a woman listening to passersby recite poetry by Robert Frost about
how taking the road less traveled had made all the difference.
</P>
<P>
	   Two others poked fun at themselves in their commercials.
</P>
<P>
	   The online broker E-Trade showed two men and a monkey in a garage, clapping
in time to cha-cha music. "Well, we've just wasted $2 million. What are you
doing with your money," one of three ads from E-Trade said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lifeminders.com, a Web site that delivers personalized e-mail to its
members, ran an ad that consisted of a typewritten message that started by
saying "This is the worst commercial on the Super Bowl." But the ad explained
that while the company wasn't good at advertising, it was good at alerting its
subscribers to items they may be interested in seeing.
</P>
<P>
	   Seventeen dot-coms, as Internet companies are known, were among about three
dozen advertisers who paid a record average of $2.2 million for a 30-second
commercial on the ABC telecast which saw the St. Louis Rams beat the Tennessee
Titans, 23-16.
</P>
<P>
	   Only three dot-com advertisers were involved in last year's Super Bowl
telecast, and this year's participation by many more of them helped pushed the
ad price up nearly 38 percent from last year's $1.6 million average.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the other dot-coms, the pet supplier Pets.com featured its sock puppet
singing Chicago's "Don't Go" in a plea for pet owners to stay home with their
pets and use the Web site to get what the animals need.
</P>
<P>
	   Healtheon/WebMD, which runs an internet health care site, showed film taken
earlier this year of revered former heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali shadow
boxing at his home. Ali, who is suffering from Parkinson's, doesn't speak in the
ad but the text indicates he hopes the Internet can help make medical advances.
</P>
<P>
	   Hotjobs.com, another repeat Super Bowl advertiser, was back with an ad that
makes a computer hand its icon, driving a hard bargain with a prospective
employer.
</P>
<P>
	   A third job site, Kforce.com, made its Super Bowl debut, offering itself as
the alternative to "Internet job sites that lead you nowhere."
</P>
<P>
	   But Internet advertisers weren't the only ones gaining attention with
unusual Super Bowl advertising.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal Express delivered the helium that gave the lollypop gang their
distinctive voices in welcoming Dorothy to the Munchkinland in an ad that used
clips from the classic "Wizard of Oz" movie.
</P>
<P>
	   Paralyzed actor Christopher Reeve appeared to rise from his chair in an ad
for the mutual fund company Nuveen Investments which advised viewers to "invest
well" and possibly bring about the day when Reeve and others could be recognized
for overcoming spinal cord injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   Anheuser-Busch was the single biggest advertiser in the game with five
minutes of commercials. In one, it creates a parody of dog-food ads by having
the dog describe it keeps its owner happy and healthy. In another ad, a dog on a
movie set produces the required yowl only by recalling its worst moment -- when
it ran into the side of a van as it chased a Budweisier truck. Former hockey
star Wayne Gretzky drives a tipsy friend home on a Zamboni in another ad for the
brewer.
</P>
<P>
	   Pepsi-Cola pitched Mountain Dew with an ad that showed a bicycle rider
outracing a cheetah, and then reaching his arm in the cat's mouth for a stolen
can of the soft drink,
</P>
<P>
	   Cats also figured in a Bud Light ad where a man was cornered by his new girl
friend's tiger when he took a Bud Light from the refrigerator. EDS showed
cowboys herding cats in another commercial, which EDS said is like the tough job
it does managing technology for its customers.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Boots Heard From Wizards  </HEADLINE>
    By JOSEPH WHITE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Michael Jordan's first choice apparently didn't work out,
so he reportedly turned to Darrell Walker to coach the Washington Wizards.
</P>
<P>
	   The Washington Post and several broadcast outlets reported Sunday that
Walker, former coach of the Toronto Raptors, will be hired as the team's interim
coach during a Monday afternoon news conference. Jordan's attempt to hire Golden
State assistant Rod Higgins apparently fell through over the issue of
compensation.
</P>
<P>
	   The reports ended a day of confusion surrounding the team. Gar Heard was
fired after Saturday night's victory over Cleveland, and the players were told
in the locker room that Higgins, a former teammate of Jordan's and one of his
golfing pals, would be the new coach.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Jordan sought and received permission from the Warriors to talk
to Higgins. Higgins did not attend the Golden State's practice Sunday, but coach
Garry St. Jean told reporters that, as far as he knew, a deal had not been
completed and that Higgins was still employed by the Warriors.
</P>
<P>
	   The Post reported that the Warriors' asking price for Higgins was too steep
for the Wizards' liking, calling for alteration of a 1994 trade between the two
teams in a complicated maneuver that could affect the Wizards' first-round draft
choice this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington then turned to Walker, who played four seasons in Washington from
1987-91.
</P>
<P>
	   "I felt we should (make the coaching change) now while we still can salvage
something of the season," Jordan told the Post in a telephone interview. "That
doesn't guarantee anything, but I feel we've got to change the attitude on this
team. We've got to kick-start the team and that starts with the coach."
</P>
<P>
	   However it turns out, Jordan's first major move as a member of NBA
management hasn't gone very smoothly -- or tactfully.
</P>
<P>
	   From the day he pledged to put his "imprints and footprints all over" the
Wizards, Jordan gave Heard the cold shoulder. Jordan spent virtually no
one-on-one time with the coach while negotiating in secret to replace him with
an old buddy.
</P>
<P>
	   Jordan was not around when he fired Heard on Saturday night. He was in
Atlanta for the Super Bowl, while Heard and his players were feeling good about
a gritty victory over the Cavaliers. General manager Wes Unseld was left to
deliver the news.
</P>
<P>
	   "The timing was kind of funny," forward Aaron Williams said. "Everybody's
spirits were up after a good win that we really needed."
</P>
<P>
	   Heard saw the writing on the wall shortly after Jordan was made part-owner
and president of basketball operations Jan. 19. Jordan met individually with
several veterans and at length with Unseld, but never with Heard.
</P>
<P>
	   "You never have a chance to show what you can do," Heard said.
"Unfortunately, that's the nature of the business. I think they had their mind
made up when he got here. I never got an opportunity to talk to him. When you
come in you want to bring your own people."
</P>
<P>
	   Other than a 9-44 stint as interim head of the Dallas Mavericks in 1993, the
Wizards were Heard's first chance to be a head coach, a reward for toiling 12
years as an assistant with Dallas, Indiana, Philadelphia and Detroit. He was
given a three-year, $3.6 million contract on June 19, 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   But his old-school style did not suit a team entrenched in its ways. Heard
clashed with Rod Strickland and Juwan Howard, and he lay some of the blame on
the players for the Wizards' 14-30 record.
</P>
<P>
	   "As a coach, I know what to do," Heard said. "The point is, are they willing
to do it? You have to work. You have to come to work every day. You can't not
come to practice and play.
</P>
<P>
	   "Most of the guys worked hard, but I'm sure you have some guys who think
they're not getting fair treatment. As coach, you're the first one to go, the
easiest one to remove."
</P>
<P>
	   Unseld also said the "onus is always on the players" and refused to
elaborate on Heard's shortcomings when the firing was announced Saturday night.
Unseld did not return calls Sunday, and Jordan was not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Walker walked out on the Raptors, who seemed headed nowhere at the time, in
February 1998. He most recently has been coach of the Rockford Lightning of the
CBA.
</P>
<P>
	   Whoever gets the job will take charge of a team that hasn't won consecutive
games in more than a month, has not won a playoff game in 12 years and has
underachieving veterans such as Strickland, Howard and Mitch Richmond whose high
salaries make them almost untradable. Barring a trade, the Wizards are years
away from having significant salary cap room to sign a star player.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's been tough around here," Strickland said. "The atmosphere hasn't been
good. It's been a lot of negativity, so put it on the players, put it on the
coaches, put it on everybody -- things weren't right, and it wasn't fun."
</P>
<P>
	   Also fired were assistants Butch Beard and Mike Bratz. Assistant Tree
Rollins will be retained.

<HEADLINE> Vermeil Cool During Victory  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM LITKE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- To know how sweet it is, remember from how far back Dick
Vermeil came. And how close he came to going back there again.
</P>
<P>
	   People who think old coaches can't learn new tricks -- one or two, anyway --
didn't see Vermeil when the game ended with the Tennessee Titans out of time and
a yard short of forcing overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil was so calm at that moment, he almost looked scary. In that same
situation, in his last go-round as a coach, that kind of cool was beyond his
reach.
</P>
<P>
	   "When the ball went in the air, I was going to get on the phone," Vermeil
recalled. He was planning to call up offensive coordinator Mike Martz and have
him script the first series of plays for the extra period.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis linebacker Mike Jones made sure that wasn't necessary. The ball
that Vermeil watched so intently went from Titans quarterback Steve McNair to
receiver Kevin Dyson at about the 3-yard line, but Jones expertly wrestled Dyson
to the ground at the 1. At that moment, Vermeil let a torrent of emotions go.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've been in the other locker room," he said after the Rams' 23-16 win was
in the books. "I've been in the Super Bowl and lost, so I know how it feels. And
believe me, this feeling is much better."
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil's word is fine, but to understand exactly how much better, remember
his actions the last time he got to the Super Bowl. That was in 1981, almost an
entire career ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil was coaching the Eagles back then, one of the NFL's ambitious young
Turks. A relentless worker, he took over in 1976 and immediately started driving
the team as hard as he drove himself. After two losing seasons, they carried him
to the playoffs as a wild-card entry in their third, the NFC divisional playoffs
the next year and the conference championship the year after that.
</P>
<P>
	   With Vermeil refusing to take his foot off their necks, the Eagles advanced
to the Super Bowl in 1981. There they met a boisterous, curfew-breaking Raiders
squad that seemed like the evil twin of the polished, disciplined outfit Vermeil
brought to New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
	   Not that it did them any good. The Raiders hammered Philadelphia 27-10. In
the locker room afterward, with a voice so flat it sent chills down the spine,
Vermeil said, "Anyone who says one loss cannot ruin a season never lost a Super
Bowl."
</P>
<P>
	   "Burnout" was not a word applied to coaches when Vermeil walked away from
his job just nine games into the next season. But there was no better way to
describe it.
</P>
<P>
	   The highs tickled him too much, the lows left him too drained. For far too
many months of the year, Vermeil rarely ventured outside his bunker to see what
was going on in the rest of the world. Yet once he did, it was just as hard to
imagine him going back.
</P>
<P>
	   He was close to the game, but with a considerably less-stressful job as a
broadcaster. After 14 years on the outside looking in, he decided broadcasting
wasn't close enough. Vermeil returned to take the Rams over in 1997, but for all
the talk and the outward appearance of a changed man, the differences were not
always apparent.
</P>
<P>
	   Vermeil still ran tough training camps, tougher practices and full-contract
drills as late as Friday of game weeks. His first two seasons ended with the
Rams going nowhere, losing 23 of 32 games, and on the edge of a revolt. Four
players boycotted the final team meeting of the 1998 season, a message that got
Vermeil's attention, he recalled, like a "shot in the back."
</P>
<P>
	   But it wasn't just the players who were getting their points across. Vermeil
did ease up on practices and off-days, and he took in assistants, notably Martz,
to open up the offense. Yet, he was also carefully weeding out the ballplayers
who didn't measure up to his work ethic.
</P>
<P>
	   And so, when the Rams celebrated Sunday night, it was worth noting that
exactly nine guys were left from the roster Vermeil inherited three seasons ago.
Everybody else was either one of his guys, or else became one.
</P>
<P>
	   "I always had faith in him," quarterback Kurt Warner said. "This is all
about winning and everybody shut up this year when we started doing that. He
stuck by his players, and went out and got some other guys with character.
That's why we've got the chemistry we do on this team."

second-oldest coach in the league, must have been asked a thousand times whether
he had changed his style to accommodate today's me-first ballplayers. He
answered them by talking about all the diversions in his life these days, from
his grandchildren to his vineyard to just taking Carolyn, his wife of 42 years,
to a movie.
</P>
<P>
	   And yet, there was no telling just how truthful he was being until
everything was on the line. Until that moment Dyson caught McNair's pass and
just before Jones wrapped both arms around the Titans' receiver and brought him
and Tennessee's last chance to the ground. That moment, when Vermeil's heart
must jumped into his throat, and he still had the presence of mind to coolly
prepare for what was next -- the overtime that never came.
</P>
<P>
	   "We made the plays when we had to make them," he said, something that
applied to him as well. "And that's why we are world champions."

<HEADLINE> Rams Nip Titans 23-16 in Super Bowl  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE GOLDBERG AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- A game of yards came down to inches for the St. Louis Rams
in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams stopped the Tennessee Titans at the 1-yard line on a final,
heart-stopping play to save their 23-16 victory in one of football's most
thrilling finishes ever.
</P>
<P>
	   Kurt Warner's 73-yard touchdown pass to Isaac Bruce with 1 minute, 54
seconds left accounted for the winning score, 16 seconds after Al Del Greco's
field goal brought Tennessee back from a 16-0 deficit.
</P>
<P>
	   But it took Mike Jones' tackle of Kevin Dyson at the 1 to finally give St.
Louis the win Sunday night and prevent the Titans from forcing the first
overtime in Super Bowl history.
</P>
<P>
	   Dyson was left sprawled on the ground in Jones' arms, stretching the ball
toward the goal line in vain as the game clock turned to zeros.
</P>
<P>
	   So, a team known for its high-powered offense won its first Super Bowl with
the most memorable of defensive plays.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner passed for a Super Bowl record 414 yards and was voted MVP, capping a
season that began with him fighting for a backup job and ended with him as the
NFL's MVP.
</P>
<P>
	   The championship for Warner, coach Dick Vermeil and the Rams seemed no more
than a dream six months ago after a 4-12 season in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "Kurt Warner is Kurt Warner and it's not a fairy tale," Vermeil said. "He is
a book. He is a movie."
</P>
<P>
	   Added Warner: "You may think of this as a Hollywood story, but it's just my
life."
</P>
<P>
	   But he almost had to rewrite the script after the Titans scored on three
straight drives to tie the score at 16.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee's comeback was engineered by Steve McNair and Eddie George. But it
was Dyson who almost pulled off his second miracle finish in four weeks, coming
up just short of the tying touchdown after taking a look-in pass from McNair at
the 5 and scrambling for the end zone.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought we could do it but we came up about 6 inches from having a chance
to do it," Titans coach Jeff Fisher said. "As much as this hurts we have an
awful lot of pride in coming so close."
</P>
<P>
	   Dyson was the man at the end of the "Music City Miracle," the 22-16 win over
Buffalo in a wild-card game, taking a lateral from Frank Wycheck and returning
it 75 yards for the winning touchdown with three seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought he was going to get in," McNair said. "But you've got great
athletes on both sides of the ball and they made the play. It was a matter of
who won the one-on-one battle and they won it."
</P>
<P>
	   Jones said: "The name of the game is to get the man on the ground. They won
the wild-card game with a big play and we knew they'd come roaring back. We just
made the big play at the end. You get tired chasing Steve McNair and making
plays."
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first NFL title for the Rams since 1951 and the first football
title ever for St. Louis, which lost the Cardinals after the 1987 season and
gained the Rams from Los Angeles in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   It not only capped an improbable season for the team but also for Warner,
who played in the Arena League and NFL Europe and was left unprotected in the
expansion draft last spring. He got the starting job when free agent Trent Green
was hurt and went on to win the NFL MVP and throw 41 touchdown passes, only the
second quarterback in NFL history to surpass 40.
</P>
<P>
	   It was also a triumph for the 63-year-old Vermeil, who was out of football
for 14 years before joining the Rams in 1997. He had lost the Super Bowl in 1981
in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
	   "You know I'm an emotional guy, but right now I feel so good and so proud of
this football team," Vermeil said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams couldn't quite break open the game while opening up a 16-0 lead.
Three straight times they had to settle for field goals by Jeff Wilkins of 29,
27 and 28 yards. Wilkins missed another field goal and another was aborted by a
fumbled snap.
</P>
<P>
	   So even though Warner threw for 277 yards in the first half and the Rams
outgained the Titans 294-89, it was only 9-0 at intermission.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had some problems in the red zone," said Marshall Faulk, who was held to
17 yards on 10 carries but had five catches for 90 yards. "They played us tough
but we came away with field goals."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams seemed to put it away when Warner hit Torry Holt with a 9-yard
touchdown pass with 3:59 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Two plays earlier, the Titans, already without free safety Marcus Robertson
and top receiver Yancey Thigpen, lost strong safety Blaine Bishop with a neck
sprain that delayed the game for about 10 minutes while was taken off.
</P>
<P>
	   But suddenly, McNair and George got energized and the Rams' defense began to
wear down.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans scored touchdowns on their next two possessions as George, who
ran for 95 yards on 28 carries, scored on runs of 1 yard and 2 yards.
Tennessee's 2-point conversion attempt failed after the first TD.
</P>
<P>
	   Al Del Greco tied the game on a 43-yard field goal with 2:12 left.
</P>
<P>
	   McNair completed nine straight passes during the final drive, and threw for
214 yards in the game and scrambled for a Super Bowl-record 64 more. That
included a 23-yard run that set up the first score and a 12-yard scramble with a
15-yard face mask penalty added in the final rally.
</P>
<P>
	   "He left everything out there on the field," Fisher said. "I told him we
will be back. Don't ever forget this moment because we will be back. We will be
back because he has the heart of a champion."
</P>
<P>
	   But it wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
	   On the first play after Del Greco's tying field goal, Warner went deep to
Bruce, who outleaped Tennessee's Denard Walker at the 38, then cut back twice to
score. The play was called by offensive coordinator Mike Martz, who will take
over as coach when Vermeil retires.
</P>
<P>
	   "He said 'Let's take a shot. Let's go to Isaac,"' Vermeil said. "If we
didn't make it, we'd try to get it on the next two downs."
</P>
<P>
	   Bruce said: "We had been getting field goals. We needed to get the ball in
the end zone."
</P>
<P>
	   That still left the Titans with 1:54 and one time out. They worked the ball
methodically down the field with two big plays -- 27 yards on McNair's scramble
and the ensuing penalty and a 16-yard pass to Dyson to put the ball on the 10
with five seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   Then the Titans called their final time out.
</P>
<P>
	   The final play was a slant. Dyson grabbed the ball and lunged for the end
zone with Jones grabbing him by the ankles. He went down less than a yard from
the goal, trying to get his hand with the ball in it over the goal line.
</P>
<P>
	   "When he got his hands on me I thought I'd break the tackle but he slid down
to my foot like you're supposed to and made a great play," Dyson said. "I
realized as soon as I stretched out and was going down that I didn't get the
point of the ball over the goal line."
</P>
<P>
	   That was a huge relief for the Rams.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I saw that ball go in the air, I said 'It's a touchdown,"' Vermeil
said. "I was ready to call coach Martz and tell him to get the script ready for
overtime.".
</P>
<P>
	   Instead they wrote a script for a celebration.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Airways Jet Crashes Into Sea  </HEADLINE>
   By TIM SULLIVAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- A Kenya Airways jet carrying 169 passengers and
10 crew members crashed into the sea Sunday night, shortly after takeoff from
Abidjan. At least nine survivors were pulled from the water, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane, an Airbus 310, took off at 9:08 p.m. and crashed into the
Atlantic Ocean just one minute later, according to George Dapre Yao, the head of
air traffic at Abidjan's Felix Houphouet-Boigny Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenya Airways Flight 431 carried 167 adults passengers and two children, Yao
said. Officials said the cause of the crash was under investigation, and
declined to speculate on why the plane went down.
</P>
<P>
	   Samuel Ogbada Adje, a Nigerian who survived the crash, said the plane
started having problems as soon as it took off.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It wasn't quite balanced, and the next thing we knew we were in the
water,'' said Adje, wrapped in a blanket at an Abidjan port after being plucked
from the water by rescuers. He managed to swim out of the wreckage, but said the
rescue effort had been a disaster.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they had come sooner, a lot of us would have been saved. We waited two
hours for people to rescue us,'' he said angrily before being pushed into an
ambulance and driven away.
</P>
<P>
	   In Nairobi, Steve Clarke, the technical director of Kenya Airways, said the
plane took off in Nairobi but could not make a scheduled landing in Lagos,
Nigeria, because of bad weather. The bad weather this time of year in West
Africa is related to a phenomenon known as the harmattan -- sand blown south
from the Sahara Desert and the Sahel.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane then landed in Abidjan to pick up passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   Clarke said most of the passengers were believed to be Nigerians. The route
is popular among Nigerians heading to Dubai for duty-free shopping.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The aircraft started its initial climb with no problem and then suddenly
descended,'' Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
	   Six or seven survivors were found early Monday floating in the wreckage off
Abidjan, said Raymond Kesse, an official with the Ivorian Red Cross. He said
they were being picked up by boats and taken to an area hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, another survivor, a Frenchman, was brought to the same hospital
with cuts and bruises.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was a good swimmer. That's how he managed to survive,'' said Dr. Tanoh
Koutoua, who treated the unidentified man.
</P>
<P>
	   At least two more survivors were seen being brought ashore at a port a few
miles from the crash scene. One woman, blood pouring out of a head wound, was
brought in by the owner of a fishing boat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were really lucky to find her,'' said Gerard Frere. ``She was clutching
onto debris.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the crash site, between three and four miles offshore, was a chaotic
scene.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We went out here and there, we had no light. We had to improvise,'' he
said. ``There are bodies floating everywhere, ripped off arms and lots of
debris.''
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said the plane never appeared to get sufficient altitude as it
crossed over the airport's wall and headed out over the ocean, just a few
hundred yards away.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I saw it take off,'' said an itinerant trader who identified himself as
Alogouleta. ``After it went over the wall, it was still very low. Then it hit
the water. I heard the sound two times,'' as the plane slammed into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   Emergency officials -- firefighters, police officers, soldiers and divers --
were combing the beach near the crash scene late Sunday night, about 1 mile east
of the airport, looking for survivors and corpses. Police boats cruised the
Atlantic and a helicopter chattered noisily overhead, scanning the dark ocean
with a bright searchlight.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of people, who live nearby or were praying in churches along the
beach road, heard the plane slam into the water.
</P>
<P>
	   A few immediately jumped into the water, hoping to get to survivors, but
were quickly driven back by the harsh surf that slams noisily into the white
sand beach.
</P>
<P>
	   An official at the airport's control tower said French military
firefighters, who are stationed at a French military base next to the airport,
had also been dispatched to the scene. The French Foreign Ministry in Paris
confirmed that a Marine infantry battalion was taking part in the rescue
operation.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather was clear in Abidjan, the Ivory Coast's commercial city, at the
time of the crash. The temperature was about 77 degrees, with a light wind.
</P>
<P>
	   The control tower official said that wreckage of the plane could not be
seen, but the area where the plane had crashed was visible from the tower.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenya Airways has a partnership with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. Together, the
two airlines operate four flights a week from London to Nairobi, via Amsterdam.
Sunday's crash was the first such disaster for Kenya Airways, which has been
operating since 1977, Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
	   The airlines has three other Airbus 310 aircraft in service and no plans to
recall them, Clarke said. The plane that crashed was manufactured in 1986 and
was due to be replaced in two years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kenyan government retains a significant interest in its national carrier
while KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is the largest individual shareholder with a 26
percent stake in the company.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the Airbus Industrie Web site, the A310 is a 220-seat,
wide-bodied plane.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Man Charged in Serial Killings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A 37-year-old man was charged Sunday in the slayings of 10
women on the city's South Side, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Andre Crawford was arrested Friday after police received a tip about him,
Chicago police Cmdr. Frank Trigg said.
</P>
<P>
	   Crawford was charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder, 11 counts of
aggravated criminal sexual assault and one count of attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Trigg said Crawford confessed to the murders of seven women that were part
of a string of murders that stretched back six years on Chicago's South Side. He
also admitted to three other murders that police hadn't linked to the case,
Trigg said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators have connected him to the murders through DNA testing, Trigg
said. Crawford also was identified in a lineup by a woman who was allegedly
assaulted by him but escaped, Trigg said.
</P>
<P>
	   Chicago Police Superintendent Terry Hillard, standing before dozens of
police and FBI agents, said, ``These men and women worked night and day tracking
leads, knocking on doors, and on stakeouts, and searching dozens of abandoned
buildings.''
</P>
<P>
	   The first of the 10 murders Crawford is charged with occurred in September
1993 and the last was in June 1999. Throughout the investigation into the
killings, police described most of the victims as women who were drug addicts
and prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
	   All of the victims were either strangled or suffered blunt trauma to the
head, Trigg said. Their bodies were left in abandoned buildings or vacant lots,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Crawford's alleged crimes took place in an impoverished community that has
long been plagued by violent crime. The neighborhood and its environs have been
targeted before by serial killers.
</P>
<P>
	   Gregory Clepper was charged with the deaths of 14 women from 1991 to 1996
and is awaiting trial. Hubert Geralds Jr. was convicted of killing six women in
Englewood and sentenced to death in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Crawford has a criminal history dating back to 1985, Trigg said, but he
wouldn't provide details. Crawford was scheduled to appear in court Monday.

<HEADLINE> Blackhawks 3, Canucks 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Dean McAmmond had a goal and an assist,
sparking a three-goal second-period, as the Chicago Blackhawks beat the
Vancouver Canucks 3-1 on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Sullivan scored the go-ahead goal, a short-handed tally, and
Jean-Pierre Dumont also had a goal for the Blackhawks. Last-place Chicago moved
within two points of the slumping Canucks, 2-7-2 in their last 11 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Markus Naslund scored the lone goal for the Canucks who, coming off Friday's
4-1 win over San Jose, haven't won back-to-back games since Nov. 5. Naslund, the
Canucks' leading scorer, extended his point streak to five games. He has three
goals and eight points during the span.
</P>
<P>
	   Blackhawks goalie Jocelyn Thibault stopped 30 shots and was bowled over by
Vancouver's Brad May midway through the third period. After gloving an errant
shot, Thibault had his mask knocked off his head while he was sent sprawling
backwards.
</P>
<P>
	   Thibault got up, after a few minutes on the ice, and completed the game. Two
minutes later, Thibault made his biggest stop of the night, gloving Greg
Hawgood's one-timer from the slot.
</P>
<P>
	   After Naslund opened the scoring 2:13 into the second, the Blackhawks
responded with three goals on three shots in a 6:20 span.
</P>
<P>
	   McAmmond tied it when he got around Canucks defenseman Murray Baron and had
his shot trickle in under Garth Snow's pad with 7:31 left in the second.
</P>
<P>
	   McAmmond then set up Sullivan to give the Blackhawks a 2-1 lead with five
minutes left in the period. With Chicago's Bob Probert off for holding, McAmmond
got to an errant puck at his own blue line and carried it up the right wing
before centering it to Sullivan, who snapped a 20-foot shot over Snow's left
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
	   Dumont completed the surge, scoring on a wide-open breakaway with 1:11 left
in the period.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the goal, someone from the stands threw a dead salmon onto the
ice, drawing cheers from the sparse GM Place crowd of 12,106.

Kenya Airways Flight Crashes; 9 Survivors Found
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- At least nine survivors have been pulled from
the ocean after a Kenya Airways jet carrying 169 passengers and 10 crew members
crashed Sunday night, shortly after takeoff from Abidjan. The plane, an Airbus
310, took off at 9:08 p.m. and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean just one minute
later, according to George Dapre Yao, the head of air traffic at Abidjan's Felix
Houphouet-Boigny Airport. Samuel Ogbada Adje, a Nigerian who survived the crash,
said the plane started having problems as soon as it took off. "It wasn't quite
balanced, and the next thing we knew we were in the water," said Adje, wrapped
in a blanket at an Abidjan port after being plucked from the water by rescuers.
He managed to swim out of the wreckage.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Author Kurt Vonnegut was hospitalized Sunday after
suffering smoke inhalation in a fire at his Manhattan home. The fire was
reported at 7 p.m. in a fourth-floor bedroom in Vonnegut's four-story brownstone

	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Kurt Warner's 73-yard touchdown pass to Isaac Bruce with 1

The TD capped an improbable turnaround for St. Louis, which was 3-13 a year ago

Steve McNair and Eddie George almost led Tennessee to another miracle finish,
rallying them from a 16-0 deficit. On the game's final play with six seconds

the end zone only to be stopped just short by Mike Jones, as Dyson's
outstretched arm held the ball toward the goal line in vain.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Airways Jet Crashes Into Sea  </HEADLINE>
   By TIM SULLIVAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- A Kenya Airways jet carrying 169 passengers and
10 crew members crashed into the sea Sunday night, shortly after takeoff from
Abidjan. At least nine survivors were pulled from the water, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane, an Airbus 310, took off at 9:08 p.m. and crashed into the
Atlantic Ocean just one minute later, according to George Dapre Yao, the head of
air traffic at Abidjan's Felix Houphouet-Boigny Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenya Airways Flight 431 carried 167 adults passengers and two children, Yao
said. Officials said the cause of the crash was under investigation, and
declined to speculate on why the plane went down.
</P>
<P>
	   Samuel Ogbada Adje, a Nigerian who survived the crash, said the plane
started having problems as soon as it took off.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It wasn't quite balanced, and the next thing we knew we were in the
water,'' said Adje, wrapped in a blanket at an Abidjan port after being plucked
from the water by rescuers. He managed to swim out of the wreckage, but said the
rescue effort had been a disaster.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they had come sooner, a lot of us would have been saved. We waited two
hours for people to rescue us,'' he said angrily before being pushed into an
ambulance and driven away.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Embassy in Nairobi said there was an American on the flight but did
not know whether he was among the survivors. He was not identified.
</P>
<P>
	   In Nairobi, Steve Clarke, the technical director of Kenya Airways, said the
plane took off in Nairobi but could not make a scheduled landing in Lagos,
Nigeria, because of bad weather. The bad weather this time of year in West
Africa is related to a phenomenon known as the harmattan -- sand blown south
from the Sahara Desert and the Sahel.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane then landed in Abidjan to pick up passengers and was headed back
to Nairobi, via Lagos, when it crashed.
</P>
<P>
	   Clarke said most of the passengers were believed to be Nigerians. The route
is popular among Nigerians heading to Dubai for duty-free shopping.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The aircraft started its initial climb with no problem and then suddenly
descended,'' Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
	   Six or seven survivors were found early Monday floating in the wreckage off
Abidjan, said Raymond Kesse, an official with the Ivorian Red Cross. He said
they were being picked up by boats and taken to an area hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, another survivor, a Frenchman, was brought to the same hospital
with cuts and bruises.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was a good swimmer. That's how he managed to survive,'' said Dr. Tanoh
Koutoua, who treated the unidentified man.
</P>
<P>
	   At least two more survivors were seen being brought ashore at a port a few
miles from the crash scene. One woman, blood pouring out of a head wound, was
brought in by the owner of a fishing boat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were really lucky to find her,'' said Gerard Frere. ``She was clutching
onto debris.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the crash site, between three and four miles offshore, was a chaotic

</P>
<P>
	   A few immediately jumped into the water, hoping to get to survivors, but
were quickly driven back by the harsh surf that slams noisily into the white
sand beach.
</P>
<P>
	   An official at the airport's control tower said French military
firefighters, who are stationed at a French military base next to the airport,
had also been dispatched to the scene. The French Foreign Ministry in Paris
confirmed that a Marine infantry battalion was taking part in the rescue
operation.
</P>
<P>

	   Kenya Airways has a partnership with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. Together, the
two airlines operate four flights a week from London to Nairobi, via Amsterdam.

<HEADLINE> Diallo case set to go to trial in Albany  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Nearly a year after New York City police killed an
unarmed West African immigrant in a hail of 41 bullets, an upstate jury must
decide if the shooting was murder.
<P>
	   Selection of 12 jurors and four alternates was to begin today for the trial
of four white officers accused of shooting Amadou Diallo, a black man. With
protests promised outside a downtown courthouse, Justice Joseph Teresi and
attorneys planned to gather inside a third-floor courtroom and begin screening
potential jurors.
</P>
<P>
	   In a surprise decision last month, an appeals court moved the racially
charged case to the state capital, agreeing with the defense that a wave of
pretrial publicity and protests in New York had made it impossible for the
officers to get a fair trial there. Last week, the judge ruled the trial could
be televised.
</P>
<P>
	   The change of venue will likely affect the racial make-up of the jury.
According to 1990 census figures, the white population of the Bronx was about 39
percent; the white population of Albany County was about 89 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 2,000 Albany residents have been summoned for duty - 20 times the
usual number called for most murder trials in the county. About 300 were
expected at the courthouse today.
</P>
<P>
	   Each side has received 20 automatic or peremptory challenges, or 20 chances
to disqualify a prospective juror without saying why. A jury could be seated by
the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
	   Plainclothes Officers Sean Carroll, 36, Edward McMellon, 27, Kenneth Boss,
28, and Richard Murphy, 27, were indicted on second-degree murder charges in
March after they fired on Diallo, a street vendor carrying only a wallet and a
pager, while searching his Bronx neighborhood for violent criminals. Diallo was
hit by 19 bullets in the vestibule of his apartment building.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege the officers showed a "depraved indifference to human
life." And civil rights activists consider the shooting symbolic of widespread
police abuse toward minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   But the officers have claimed they used deadly force only after Diallo
refused to halt and appeared to be reaching for a gun. The defendants also plan
to take the witness stand in a trial expected to last at least a month.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the change-of-venue ruling, Diallo's family, the Rev. Al Sharpton and
other activists have vowed to keep vigil at the courthouse. On Sunday, Sharpton
urged members of Albany's Mount Calvary Baptist Church to join him in demanding
justice.
</P>
<P>
	   "There will be those who will tell you in the next couple (of) weeks that we
are here because we don't like police, that we are here to divide the races,"
Sharpton said from the pulpit. "This has nothing to do with police. ... We're
fighting against evil and wickedness in high places. To shoot an unarmed man is
a wicked thing."
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton later met with city officials, assuring them any protests would be
peaceful. Albany Mayor Jerry Jennings called the session "cordial," adding, "We
don't expect any difficulties because people are communicating."

<HEADLINE> Rights of Muslim Women In Focus  </HEADLINE>
   By SELCAN HACAOGLU Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Even in death, Konca Kuris was denied her last wish
-- that women be allowed to pray alongside men. It was a desire that cost the
religious feminist her life at the hands of Islamic radicals.
</P>
<P>
	   Police dug up Kuris' naked body from the basement of a hideout used by
Islamic militants who videotaped weeks of abuse they inflicted before
suffocating her. The bodies of dozens of male victims also have been found and a
second female victim was discovered Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The killings have horrified the country, but Kuris' slaying also has focused
attention on the role of women in Islam, a flashpoint that was underscored when
male relatives at her funeral last week refused to allow her eldest daughter to
pray beside her coffin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Who are the real Muslims, those who have killed Konca or those who go to
mosque together, women and men?'' asked Necati Dogru, a columnist for the
newspaper Sabah.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One more person paid with her life for being different and searching for
her own voice,'' Sibel Eraslan, a female commentator, wrote in the Islamic
newspaper Akit.
</P>
<P>
	   But at Ankara's main Kocatepe mosque, worshipper Nese Ince spoke out against
Kuris' feminist brand of Islam. ``I don't want the Islam that I have believed in
for years to be changed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kuris at first was a member of the militant group Hezbollah, which seeks to
establish an Islamic state in southeastern Turkey and which is not related to
the Lebanese militia of the same name.
</P>
<P>
	   She traveled to Iran with a delegation from the organization but gradually
became disillusioned with the group's attitude toward women.
</P>
<P>
	   She demanded the right to pray alongside men and that prayers be said in
Turkish and not the traditional Arabic, which few Turks understand. Although
Kuris wore a traditional Islamic head scarf, she said head scarves or the full
black robes worn by some religious women were optional and not required in
Islam.
</P>
<P>
	   Kuris' feminist views infuriated Hezbollah, which is dominated by
traditional, rural Kurds.
</P>
<P>
	   In early 1998, she began to receive anonymous telephone calls. ``Are you
inventing a new religion?'' the voices asked, according to the newspaper
Milliyet.
</P>
<P>
	   In July of that year, three militants kidnapped Kuris from in front of her
home in the southern port of Mersin, and she was never seen again.
</P>
<P>
	   Tapes of Kuris' interrogation were discovered about two weeks ago during a
police raid on a Hezbollah safe house in Istanbul, Sabah reported. It said they
showed militants stuffing a picture of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of
secular Turkey, into her mouth.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper also said the militants accused Kuris of seeking to become a
Salman Rushdie or Taslima Nasrin, secular Muslim writers considered heretics by
Muslim radicals.
</P>
<P>
	   Kuris was apparently suffocated with a pillow or clothing in the basement of
a house in the central Anatolian city of Konya. In death, she also was kept from
her goal of equality. Her body was buried in a different corner of the basement
than those of the murdered men.
</P>
<P>
	   At her funeral, the dispute over her views erupted in full force.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I will carry out my mother's last will,'' shouted Kuris' eldest daughter,
Sirma. But men blocked her from the male section of the mosque.

<HEADLINE> Pig-Farming Village Dogged by Virus  </HEADLINE>
   By SEAN YOONG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SUNGAI NIPAH, Malaysia (AP) -- A year after burying two sons and bidding
mournful farewell to the remaining two, Tong Ke Chu looks a decade older than
her 65 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Last February and March, a mysterious virus swept through Tong's dusty
village, then spread across this Southeast Asian nation, killing more than 100
people. Only now are villagers in the heart of Malaysia's pig-farming region
beginning to pull their lives back together.
</P>
<P>
	   Sungai Nipah is a listless shell of what it was. Children no longer play in
the streets, and most remaining residents do little more than tend their
vegetable gardens. Except for the occasional roar of a passing motorcycle, the
bustling village -- once home to 1,500 ethnic Chinese -- is almost silent.
</P>
<P>
	   Tong lives in a ramshackle wooden house she says she is too old to leave.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All my hopes died with my first two sons. And my joy went away with the
other two,'' Tong says in a whisper.
</P>
<P>
	   Like most other young people who lived in Sungai Nipah, Tong's surviving
sons found jobs in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, 50 miles north, and other
prosperous cities.
</P>
<P>
	   Tong says she doesn't fault the sons who left. ``There's nothing for them
here, only bad memories.''
</P>
<P>
	   Until last year, almost everyone here seemed to live for the pigs. Pens
dotted the village and new pork recipes were created constantly.
</P>
<P>
	   But at the start of 1999, some villagers fell ill with raging fever,
convulsions and vomiting. Several lapsed into comas and died. The pigs were
immediately suspect because a disease common in Malaysia, Japanese encephalitis,
has similar symptoms and passes from pigs to humans through mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
	   By May, the illness had been identified in seven of Malaysia's 13 states.
Fears of an epidemic whipped the population into a near-frenzy. Although no one
was sure what was making people sick, eating pork became taboo.
</P>
<P>
	   The fever was eventually identified as a new virus and named Nipah because
it was first isolated here. Hundreds fled the village.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Imagine what we went through,'' says former pig farmer Teong Hoe Kong.
``We didn't know whether we would survive the end of each week.''
</P>
<P>
	   The government ordered soldiers and police to evacuate Sungai Nipah and
destroy its herds. Across Malaysia, almost 1 million pigs were shot, clubbed to
death or buried alive.
</P>
<P>
	   By then, some people had waited too long to leave.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My husband made our five children and me leave the village quickly,'' says
Yee Ming Hong. ``But he insisted on staying behind to do what he could for our
pigs.''
</P>
<P>
	   His sacrifice proved futile. Their 400 pigs were destroyed, and Yee's
39-year-old husband, Lay Wah Long, contracted the virus and suffered brain
damage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I stay home all day to take care of him,'' Yee says. ``I have to bathe
him. I have to make sure he doesn't fall down when he tries to walk.''
</P>
<P>
	   Her voice is strong and steady. Her eyes well with tears only when she
mentions that Lay is starting to forget people and events once dear to him. Half
a dozen high school basketball trophies line a living room cabinet, but Lay
cannot remember winning them.
</P>
<P>
	   Newspapers and political groups raised millions of ringgit in public
donations for affected families. The government compensated farmers 50 ringgit,
about $13, for each destroyed pig.
</P>
<P>
	   To help farmers survive, the government organized courses on handcrafts and
cooking, encouraging families to open more of the little restaurants that serve
fried rice, soups and pastries around Malaysia. Several men in Sungai Nipah now
make furniture, but they say they earn only one-tenth of what they used to.
</P>
<P>
	   Many villagers are still angry that the government didn't react to the
outbreak sooner. They note other Asian leaders took speedy precautions to
prevent the virus from entering their countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Singapore banned all pig imports from Malaysia, although one butcher died of
the virus there. Hong Kong suspended the import of mammals and birds from
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
	   The last known case of Nipah virus was reported in July. Government health
officials declared the epidemic over in October, a verdict echoed by
veterinarians meeting in Taiwan the next month.
</P>
<P>
	   Research indicated the virus was transmitted from a fruit-eating bat that
bit some pigs and was then picked up by humans who lived or worked close to
pigs.
</P>
<P>
	   The veterinarians also announced they had found no evidence the virus could
be transmitted by eating pork. Sales of pork are back to normal, and shopkeepers
expect a surge in demand for the Chinese New Year on Feb. 5.
</P>
<P>
	   That pork will come from pig farms that escaped the virus. In Sungai Nipah,
the farms are in ruins.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People have started to forget what happened to us,'' says Yee, stroking
her youngest child's hair. ``But we'll have our whole lifetime to remember.''

<HEADLINE> Cuba Welcomes Elian's Grandmothers  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers returned home to a hero's
welcome, honored with a motorcade past hundreds of thousands of cheering Cubans
and vowing to continue the struggle to wrest the 6-year-old shipwreck survivor
from relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Maternal grandmother Raquel Rodriguez broke down in tears as she spoke to
1,700 schoolchildren who had serenaded her and chanted for her grandson's return
during the welcome on Sunday. ``It's very sad. You are here, and Elian is not
because we could not bring him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are suffering so,'' said paternal grandmother Mariela Quintana, who
also wept.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuba's government called on Havana residents to turn out to greet the
grandmothers as they ended a nine-day visit to the United States, where they
campaigned against efforts by a great-uncle backed by Cuban-American exile
groups to keep the child in Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   On less than 24 hours notice -- and aided by government buses -- vast crowds
turned out to line a 16-mile motorcade route while waving Cuban flags in a scene
similar to the one that greeted Pope John Paul II here in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube off the Florida coast on Nov. 25
after a shipwreck that killed his mother and 10 other people. Since then, the
argument over the boy's fate has become a major propaganda battle between Fidel
Castro's government and anti-Castro groups in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has ruled Elian should be
returned to his father in Cuba. But officials are awaiting the outcome of a
federal court challenge filed by Miami relatives before trying to return the
boy.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler will hear arguments Feb. 22 on whether
the Miami relatives' lawsuit should be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
	   Following their hourlong ``caravan of dignity'' through Havana, the women
were serenaded by schoolchildren at Havana's Convention Palace, with Castro
watching from the audience.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We promised Elian that we were workingto bring him to Cuba,'' said
Rodriguez, referring to a 90-minute meeting with the boy on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Quintana said: ``I am very moved at this moment to see children who seem so
happy, and when I saw my boy he seemed so sad.''
</P>
<P>
	   Both women thanked the people of Cuba and the United States for support they
have received.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is a tiny group, no more, that does not agree with the return of that
boy,'' Quintana said.
</P>
<P>
	   The government considered the event so important that it postponed the
national soccer championship game that had been scheduled for Sunday in Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   A statement published on the front pages of all newspapers Sunday said the
grandmothers were returning after ``brave and extraordinary work in the United
States, overcoming great obstacles and transmitting a persuasive message to the
U.S. people.''
</P>
<P>
	   It praised ``the heroic behavior of these humble and good-natured
grandmothers.''
</P>
<P>
	   The struggle over Elian has become one of the largest government campaigns
in recent Cuban history, with daily events, some drawing massive crowds, to
demand the child's return to his father.
</P>
<P>
	   The women -- until recently obscure housewives from the provincial city of
Cardenas -- have found themselves interviewed by U.S. television networks and
lobbying congressmen, senators and U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno for the
boy's return to his family here.

<HEADLINE> Iran Hard-liners Reinvent Themselves  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- With only a few weeks until Iran's
legislative elections, Islamic hard-liners are trying to portray a more moderate
image to attract voters they've alienated by attacking reformers.
</P>
<P>
	   Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, announced last week that he had
pardoned the popular former mayor of Tehran, Gholamhossein Karbaschi, after
seven months of a two-year jail term for embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
	   But few Iranians will forget it was the hard-liners themselves who put
Karbaschi in jail in the first place.
</P>
<P>
	   His sensational 1998 trial was seen by most Iranians as part of a witch hunt
aimed at undermining the overwhelmingly popular President Mohammad Khatami.
Karbaschi was instrumental in Khatami's election victory in 1997, when the
hard-liners thought their own candidate was a shoo-in.
</P>
<P>
	   Khatami, a reformist cleric who opposes the strict Islamic rule advocated by
hard-line clergy, says freedom is the most important aspiration of mankind.
</P>
<P>
	   His efforts to relax rules have been strongly welcomed by Iranians chafing
under the strict Islamic law enforced since the 1979 revolution that overthrew
the Westernized, U.S.-supported Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
</P>
<P>
	   The rules aren't changing, but the hard-liners have indicated several times
they want a new image.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, Intelligence Minister Ali Yunesi, who was appointed by
Khatami but has leaned toward the hard-liners on key issues, said members of an
outlawed opposition group should be allowed to compete in elections and hold
official posts.
</P>
<P>
	   Former President Hashemi Rafsanjani, who was regarded as a moderate until he
swung toward the hard-liners recently, has spoken about the need to allow
greater use of the Internet and legalize dish antennas that would allow Iranians
to tune in to foreign television programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We cannot prevent computer and satellite networks on the pretext of
safeguarding morality,'' Rafsanjani said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Iranians are openly skeptical of the hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
	   Just days before Karbaschi was pardoned, the newspaper Aftab-e-Emrooz ran a
cartoon showing a guard unlocking the former mayor's shackles. Karbaschi wonders
why, and then remembers that the Majlis, or parliament, elections are coming up
Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
	   Another cartoon showed a hard-line thug chasing a reformist supporter. He
hides his club behind his back just before the elections, but starts chasing his
victim after the elections end.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the strong support the reformers have been getting at the polls, the
hard-liners are not without resources. They control key institutions like the
judiciary, the Intelligence Ministry, the armed forces and the broadcast
network. Khamenei also has more powers than the president, and the hard-liners
hold sway over the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
	   The hard-liners attempted, but failed, to change election rules in a way
that voting would not have been completely anonymous, perhaps in an effort to
scare the public into voting for them.
</P>
<P>
	   The Interior Ministry said earlier this month that 402 would-be candidates
-- most of them pro-reform -- had been disqualified by a hard-line electoral
supervisory council.
</P>
<P>
	   Among them were some of the top names in the reformist camp, including
newspaper editor and former Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri, who was sentenced
late last year to five years in prison on charges that included religious
dissent. His trial was blatantly political.
</P>
<P>
	   But, anticipating such disqualifications, the reformers entered swarms of
candidates in the nominating process. Enough were approved for the ballots that
election day could bring another setback for the hard-liners.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Children's Army Under Siege  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDITOR'S NOTE -- In December, The Associated Press visited the jungle camp of
God's Army at Ka Mar Pa Law, Myanmar. The AP team was the last of the very few
foreign journalists ever to see the twin 12-year-old boys who lead this strange
rebel group.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
By GRANT PECK Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- To outsiders, they look like nothing so much as
urchins with guns.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet their followers among Myanmar's ethnic Karen minority believe
12-year-old twins Johnny and Luther Htoo, commanders of the rebel group God's
Army, have mystical powers and can save their downtrodden people.
</P>
<P>
	   At an age when their peers are going to school or helping out with farming
chores, the twins have been leading a children's crusade against the
battle-hardened troops of Myanmar's military dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebellion is now facing a severe test, after a bid to secure retreat
into Thailand from attacks by the Myanmar army led 10 gunmen from the group and
its student allies to seize a Thai hospital and take hundreds of hostages.
</P>
<P>
	   Thai commandos stormed the hospital and killed all the gunmen last Tuesday.
Two days later, Myanmar soldiers overran the God's Army jungle camp at Ka Mar Pa
Law, although the rebels are reported to be fighting on near the Thai border.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, two journalists from The Associated Press visited Ka Mar Pa
Law, a ramshackle village reached by an 11-hour trek over hill after hill from
the nearest Thai town. A minefield marked the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
	   The rainy season, which was keeping Myanmar troops from attacking, hadn't
ended yet, and it was cold and damp. The visitors were shown to a commander's
house that would be their sleeping quarters. A meal of frog and rice was served.
</P>
<P>
	   Soon Lin Dam, a sort of junior partner to the twins, made his way to the
house, carried on the back of one of his coterie of bodyguards, most of them
youngsters like him with runny noses and rolled up military pants.
</P>
<P>
	   Lin Dam means black tongue, and indeed his tongue -- and lips and hands --
were badly discolored.
</P>
<P>
	   To a Westerner, it might suggest disease. For the Karens, it is like a holy
mystery.
</P>
<P>
	   None of the boys was very forthcoming with their stories, and Lin Dam's tale
was especially impenetrable. At one point a translator gave up, claiming he was
babbling in baby talk.
</P>
<P>
	   Lin Dam, who looked to be 9 or 10, claimed to be more than 100. He said he
had come to the twins' stronghold from a refugee camp in Thailand. While he
didn't have the same clout as Luther and Johnny, he was similarly revered for
having special powers.
</P>
<P>
	   People said he can't walk more than 10 yards without getting tired. A
visitor couldn't help but wonder if the problem might be linked to his
chain-smoking, which gave him a serious cough.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet Lin Dam came across as a pleasant kid, unlike Luther, who also paid a
visit.
</P>
<P>
	   With eyebrows and hair in front shaved, Luther presented an odd appearance,
although nothing that might not be seen in a California mall. He never wore a
shirt, instead wrapping himself in a blanket to ward off the damp.
</P>
<P>
	   There was something alarming about his eyes, deep-set and slightly
off-focus, like someone living on the street too long, a distant stare
reminiscent of traumatized soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   What was unpleasant about Luther, however, was the undercurrent of
aggression in his dealings with his visitors, a willingness to take advantage of
his position. He wanted to play with a video camera, and he knew his armed
followers were too intimidating for him to be refused.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't surprising to learn he was in charge of the military side of the
group.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the few times he opened up was to boast of his marksmanship: ``This
is the way I became a leader. I'm very good in this.'' He proved it by shooting
a papaya out of a tree with an M-16 almost as tall as he was.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnny's appearance was a sharp contrast. His facial features were soft,
almost girlish, an impression heightened by his long flowing black hair.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike Luther, he enjoyed horseplay with the other child soldiers, though it
was just as likely to involve tossing around a clip of bullets as bouncing a
volleyball off his delicate fists.
</P>
<P>
	   But behind the ready smile was a look of perpetual worry, or wariness, given
away by the slightest furrow of his brow.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither brother, however, voiced anything but confidence about their mission
to fight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have never cried. Why would a man have to cry?'' Luther said.
</P>
<P>
	   With an angelic smile, Johnny claimed to have killed ``countless''
government soldiers in his three-year fighting career.
</P>
<P>
	   Their army, about 200 strong at the time, included adults as well as
children as young as 8 -- a commentary on the plight of the Karens, who have
been fighting unsuccessfully for autonomy for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
	   All obeyed the twins without question or hesitation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those who do not listen to the leaders will not be protected when they go
out into the front lines,'' remarked Su Bia, a veteran of the mainstream Karen
resistance force, the Karen National Union.
</P>
<P>
	   He decided to join the twins after losing six of his siblings during a big
government offensive against the Karen National Union in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   It was during that offensive that the legend of the twins was born. Karen
fighters had abandoned their village. The twins rallied some men in a successful
counterattack against Myanmar troops and were deemed to have magical powers.
</P>
<P>
	   Victory after victory followed, their followers say.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was no other hope left for me,'' said Su Bia, in his late 40s. ``It
was almost like all the Karens had given up, but then God sent these two leaders
to rescue all the Karens.''
</P>
<P>
	   People in Myanmar are among the most superstitious in Southeast Asia, and
much of the appeal of the twins is rooted in the belief they have mystical
powers.
</P>
<P>
	   Fused with that are fundamentalist Christian beliefs held by many Karens, an
oppressed minority in a Buddhist country awaiting a savior. Ka Mar Pa Law had a
small church, a bamboo structure with a white cross that held daily services.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe God has given them a special gift. God has sent his messengers
to come and help us in our rebellion,'' said the twins' father, Pu Kaw. Johnny
lived with his father and mother, but Luther had his own house.
</P>
<P>
	   Min, who has only one name, recently joined the movement. The other
guerrillas told him that when 50 of them went to attack government troops, the
defenders would instead see 500 attackers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People said guns can't hurt them as well,'' said Min, 28. ``No one can aim
their guns right when trying to shoot them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Other guerrillas told him they had stepped on land mines without injuries
because the twins were with them.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the twins' movement is unusual, it has historical precedents. In
Southeast Asia early this century, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand all
experienced serious uprisings led by mystic figures.
</P>
<P>
	   The twins' reputation as holy warriors was enhanced by the tight discipline
they imposed. They didn't allow fighting, swearing or consumption of drugs and
alcohol. They also forbid the eating of pork or eggs, which they claimed brings
bad luck.
</P>
<P>
	   God's Army might have lingered in obscurity had it not been for the takeover
of the Myanmar embassy in Thailand last October by a different group of
militants, radical exiled Myanmar students.
</P>
<P>
	   The so-called Vigorous Burmese Student Warriors demanded democracy in
Myanmar and held dozens of people hostage, freeing them unharmed in exchange for
safe passage to the border.
</P>
<P>
	   They were taken in by the twins, who were suddenly harboring the most-wanted
men on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I first heard about the twins, I doubted that it was true,'' said the
student leader, known only as Johnny. ``But when I met them, I realized that
they are really special. They definitely have something.''

<HEADLINE> Many Nigerians Wary on Islamic Law  </HEADLINE>
   By GILBERT DA COSTA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- In a dusty town in northern Nigeria, the Muslim
faithful parade in joyous marches, welcoming the coming of Islamic law to their
sliver of this sprawling country.
</P>
<P>
	   But elsewhere in a nation sharply divided along ethnic, religious and
geographic lines -- and where such divisions regularly explode into violence --
the arrival of Sharia law has created a feeling of unease, and a nagging fear
that Nigeria's religious chasm is growing even wider.
</P>
<P>
	   Christian leaders denounce the arrival of Islamic law, and the country's
newspapers, many based in the largely Christian south, fill pages with headlines
warning that non-Muslims will face fierce discrimination.
</P>
<P>
	   The country's political leaders, in the central capital city of Abuja,
remain largely quiet on the subject, afraid of inflaming emotions already
running high. Still growing accustomed to democracy, which returned to Nigeria
last year after 15 years of brutal and corrupt military rule, the new
politicians instead simply hope that the support for Sharia sweeping through the
country's heavily Muslim north will quietly fade away.
</P>
<P>
	   In Gusau, the capital of Zamfara state, thousands of Muslims paraded through
the streets Thursday, welcoming the official enactment of Sharia. But Christians
there are keeping a watchful eye on how the new laws will touch them.
</P>
<P>
	   They've been promised that it will not affect non-Muslims, that Christians
will be allowed to worship as they please and will be able to seek redress in
secular courts. They've been told that Christian-Muslim relations, which have
nearly always been peaceful and friendly, do not have to change.
</P>
<P>
	   But months ago, long before Sharia was officially enacted, a number of laws
had already reached into the Christian community. Most schools, even public
ones, are now segregated by gender, and the state government says public
transportation will soon follow suit. Buying alcohol is impossible nearly
everywhere in the state -- except at a couple bars near a military base, where
the soldiers have refused to bow to state authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   The defenders of Sharia in Zamfara argue that Muslims make up more than 90
percent of the state's population, and that the changes are wildly popular with
them.
</P>
<P>
	   To non-Muslims, though, the new laws are unsettling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This place is not the same place I moved into 20 years ago,'' Emeko Odo, a
pharmacy owner in Gusau, said in a telephone interview. Before ``I could worship
freely, now I do not think that is going to be possible despite the promises.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nigeria, a nation of 120 million people, with Muslims, Christians and
animists each making up about a third of the population, has a long, bloody
history of sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday Mbang, the president of the Christian Association of Nigeria, worries
that President Olusegun Obasanjo, a Christian, has yet to take a firm stand on
the issue, especially with a number of other northern states already working on
legislation to bring sharia into affect.
</P>
<P>
	   When Sharia ``hits a few more people, and there is real danger, maybe the
president will intervene,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Borno, another northern state where Sharia is being considered, Christian
leaders are more fearful, and speak of dividing Borno into Muslim and Christian
sections.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to be very blunt and frank that the Christians cannot condone the
establishment of Sharia in Borno state. We shall firmly create and recognize
southern Borno as an entity that shall not in any way be affected by Sharia
laws,'' said the Rev. Filibus Gwama, the Borno state head of the Christian
Association of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
	   Such arguments, though, are lost on the many Muslim supporters of Sharia,
which is based on the Koran and the body of Islamic traditions.
</P>

	   ``The adoption of the Islamic justice system by Zamfara state and plans
toward that direction by other states in the north are indications that Sharia
has come to stay in this country,'' said Sheik Mansur Al-Mansur, an Islamic
scholar in Gusau. ``The Sharia is to every Muslim what a compass is to a sailor.
The raging controversy is because of ignorance on the part of the Christian
community.''

<HEADLINE> For Andrew Cuomo, a tough congressional session awaits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Andrew Cuomo has been in the crosshairs before.
<P>
	   With his New York liberal roots, his combative style and his penchant for
publicity, the federal housing secretary has long been a lightning rod for the
GOP. He's even managed to rub some of his fellow Democrats the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
	   Now Cuomo's in the fray again, this time in the middle of a fierce partisan
battle that almost everyone agrees has as much to do with New York's high-stakes
U.S. Senate race between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rudolph Giuliani as it does
with housing policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Republicans will grill Cuomo's Department of Housing and Urban
Development at a hearing next month. House hearings could follow.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican onslaught also comes as Cuomo, the eldest son of former Gov.
Mario Cuomo, makes his loudest rumblings yet that he's interested in running for
his father's old job.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a partisan witch hunt," Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-Manhattan, said. "The
Republicans are after Cuomo because of Hillary, they're after him because he's a
Democrat, they're after him because his last name is Cuomo."
</P>
<P>
	   At the heart of the flap is the decision of Cuomo, an ally of the first
lady, to yank some $60 million in U.S. homeless funds from Giuliani. Cuomo said
he had to take control of the money because of a court decision saying the New
York City mayor withheld it improperly from Housing Works, a nonprofit group
that has tussled with Giuliani over his policies on the homeless and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans cried politics and rallied around Giuliani. Sen. Christopher
Bond, R-Mo., announced he would hold a hearing on the matter in February. Bond
denies politics is involved and says he simply wants a detailed explanation of
why Cuomo took control of the money.
</P>
<P>
	   He says his repeated written requests for information from HUD have been met
with reams of paper outlining every law Congress has written dealing with HUD, a
response he described as "woefully inadequate."
</P>
<P>
	   There is even talk in some Republican circles of calling Mrs. Clinton's
campaign manager, Bill de Blasio, to testify at the Senate hearing. De Blasio
had been Cuomo's head of HUD operations in New York before leaving to head Mrs.
Clinton's campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   "The New York Senate race has moved to Washington," lamented Rep. Charles
Rangel, the Harlem Democrat who is dean of New York's 31-member congressional
delegation.
</P>
<P>
	   Bond's spokesman, Dan Hubbard, would say only that no decision had been made
yet on who would be asked to participate in the hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   On a recent trip to upstate New York, where Cuomo shed his urban image and
donned camouflage gear to hunt pheasants with a 12-gauge shotgun, the housing
secretary brushed aside the storm brewing in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is all Hillary Clinton politics. ... It's about Democrats and
Republicans, about Clinton and Cuomo," he said. "It's the political silly
season."
</P>
<P>
	   On that trip upstate, Cuomo made it clear that he is interested in running
for governor. Cuomo is most often mentioned as front-runner for White House
chief of staff if his friend Al Gore wins the presidency, and conventional
wisdom has held that he would only seek the governor's post if Gore lost. But
Cuomo said on that trip that he might run for governor in 2002 no matter what
the outcome of the presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
	   That could pit him against state Comptroller H. Carl McCall in a Democratic
primary. McCall, the first black elected to statewide office in New York, is
already lining up support, prompting some Cuomo supporters to urge Democrats to
hold off making commitments in the race, still some two years away.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls show Cuomo making a respectable showing against Republican Gov. George
Pataki. One recent poll had him trailing Pataki 53 percent to 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Some grumble that Cuomo's tenure as HUD secretary has all been in
preparation for a run for governor. Even Cuomo supporters say he has used the
everyday distribution of HUD money as a way to get himself in the news. In New
York, he has made frequent appearances doling out federal funds along the
economically depressed Erie Canal corridor.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, Republicans became so upset by Cuomo's using HUD events for public
relations that last year they led a successful push in Congress to hand control
of $60 million in federal small-cities money from Cuomo to Pataki.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats will almost certainly rally around Cuomo in Bond's hearings. Many
view HUD as the only federal agency devoted to serving the needs of the poor and
say that is the reason it has been subjected to GOP attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   "It doesn't fit into the Republican agenda," Rangel said.
</P>
<P>
	   But numerous congressional staffers said privately that Cuomo's relations
with New York's Democratic delegation can be frosty.
</P>
<P>
	   One example of the seeming ambivalence about Cuomo comes from Sen. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y. While Schumer has said he is opposed to partisan hearings, he
also says that a closer look should be taken at federal decisions to seize
control from local governments.
</P>
<P>
	   But for Cuomo having the GOP klieg lights trained on him may not be all bad.
Nadler predicted the tactic would backfire against the Republicans and Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   "It just gives him a platform to say why he doesn't trust Giuliani," Nadler
said. "I don't understand what the Republicans think they'll accomplish. I think
they end up looking foolish."

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Medical Hearing Reconvenes  </HEADLINE>
   By SUE LEEMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Belgium and six human rights groups contend the medical
report that could help free Gen. Augusto Pinochet is too important to the
outcome of the 15-month-old extradition case to remain private.
</P>
<P>
	   High Court Justice Maurice Kay planned to rule today on whether they would
be allowed to make that argument at a formal hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   The parties brought their challenge to the High Court after Britain's top
law enforcement official announced he was inclined to let the 84-year-old former
Chilean dictator return home. Home Secretary Jack Straw said an independent
medical team found Pinochet mentally unfit to stand trial on torture charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Belgium and the human rights groups, however, say they want a chance to
review the medical report before Straw makes a final ruling. Straw has refused,
citing Pinochet's right to patient confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet was arrested during a visit to Britain on October 16, 1998, while
he was recuperating from back surgery in a London hospital. He has spent 15
months fighting extradition to Spain on charges of human rights abuses. He is
also being sought by Belgium, France and Switzerland -- although only Belgium is
involved in this last minute legal challenge to see Pinochet's medical records.
</P>
<P>
	   Belgium and the human rights groups say Straw is acting unfairly and against
``natural justice'' by refusing to share the report. Both say they are entitled
to see it -- Belgium as a nation seeking Pinochet's extradition, and the human
rights groups as advocates for some of the general's alleged victims.
</P>
<P>
	   If Kay agrees to hear the arguments, a formal hearing would probably be
scheduled for later this week. If he declines, the parties have the option of
appealing to a three-judge panel, but lawyers for Belgium and the human rights
groups said last week that appeal was unlikely.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet's case would immediately revert back to Straw, who must issue his
final ruling on whether to extradite the general to Spain for trial. Straw has
promised to give all parties 24 hours notice before announcing his decision,
which is also subject to appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain's Defense Ministry confirmed Sunday that a Chilean air force plane
sent to fetch Pinochet had landed at an air force base northwest of London.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boeing 707 arrived Saturday at Brize Norton, 20 miles outside London.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet -- who has diabetes, wears a pacemaker and suffered two small
strokes last fall -- remains under police guard at a rented mansion at
Wentworth, west of London.
</P>
<P>
	   A Chilean government report says 3,197 people died or disappeared at the
hands of Pinochet's secret police during his 1973-90 dictatorship.

<HEADLINE> D.A. Pennebaker looks back at 'Don't Look Back'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - D.A. Pennebaker still remembers the look on young Bob
Dylan's face. The 26-year-old singer was watching himself in Pennebaker's
soon-to-be released documentary "Don't Look Back."
<P>
	   Dylan appeared ... well, "stunned" is a good word.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the first time he saw it, he went into shock," Pennebaker recalls,
laughing slightly. "He had no idea that one camera sitting on one guy's shoulder
could make him feel so naked."
</P>
<P>
	   The chastened Dylan returned a night later, watched it again, then gave his
OK to Pennebaker's film. Now, three decades later, the director's chronicle of
Dylan's three-week 1965 British tour returns this month in an enhanced DVD
version released by New Video.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've always admired Dylan for letting (the film) go the way it was,"
Pennebaker says. "That was something a lot of lesser talents - and a lot of
greater talents - would have had trouble doing."
</P>
<P>
	   Pennebaker's critically acclaimed documentary, released in 1967, stands the
test of time - although its creator once felt the 96-minute film would never see
a theatrical release.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the kindness of several West Coast pornographic theaters that changed
that, he says - in particular, The Presidio in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   "This group of Western theaters was showing porno, and they wanted to
upgrade their act," the self-deprecating Pennebaker recalls. "It was perfect for
me, because my movie looked like porno, but it's not."
</P>
<P>
	   Pennebaker, who earned an Academy Award nomination for his look at the
Clinton presidential campaign in "The War Room," is quick to poke fun at
himself. Talking about his acclaimed black and white Dylan piece, he describes
it as "a very ratty-looking film."
</P>
<P>
	   Critics disagreed.
</P>
<P>
	   "A portrait of the young Dylan tearing the pop world apart," a San Francisco
Examiner reviewer enthused in a typical rave.
</P>
<P>
	   Pennebaker, an Illinois native, earned a degree in mechanical engineering at
Yale before going into filmmaking. Using his college skills, Pennebaker
developed a portable camera that allowed filmmakers full access - one of the
keys to the cinema verite style that he helped define.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Pennebaker, the movie wasn't his idea, and it wasn't Dylan's
either. The credit belongs to Dylan's late manager, Albert Grossman.
</P>
<P>
	   "I probably couldn't have convinced Dylan myself," Pennebaker says. "He was
mercurial. It would be hard to convince him of anything for three hours in a
row. But Albert Grossman asked me if I wanted to do a film with one of his
clients."
</P>
<P>
	   Pennebaker knew little about his subject, who wore his hair long, his
sunglasses dark and his attitude on his sleeve: "I didn't have much of a take on
him. I knew who he was, probably heard a couple of his songs. To hear him sing
the first time, he wasn't Rudy Vallee. I was less than swept away."
</P>
<P>
	   That soon changed.
</P>
<P>
	   Pennebaker, watching through his lens, saw "an amazing prodigy. Very smart
in an untutored way. He created his own persona right before your eyes. ... He
was a compendium of things it takes professors years to figure out - startlingly
naive, but smart."
</P>
<P>
	   The 74-year-old Pennebaker acknowledges that he had 40 to 50 extra hours of
footage from the Dylan sessions, and that the idea of recutting his movie
flashed through his brain.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought about it," he says. "I thought, 'This is a chance to make a new
film.' Then I thought, 'Why a new film? What would that get us?' ... It would be
interesting to people who'll take any Dylan you can give them, but not to a
major audience."
</P>
<P>
	   The extra footage, along with outtakes and originals of all Pennebaker's
work such as "Monterey Pop" and "The War Room," now sits in the archives of the
Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
	   The film's title appears in a line from Dylan's song "She Belongs to Me":
"She's an artist, she don't look back."
</P>
<P>
	   Yet Pennebaker says the credit for his title actually goes to Negro Leagues
star and Hall of Famer Satchel Paige, who once advised, "Don't look back. It
might be gaining on you."
</P>
<P>
	   Pennebaker offers his own tip on staying a step or two ahead of the
audience: "The one barometer I believe in is boredom. The minute people start to
lose interest, that's it."
</P>
<P>
	   That explains the tight running time of "Don't Look Back," barely an hour
and a half.
</P>
<P>
	   The DVD comes with a bonus - five never before released Dylan audio
performances and a previously unreleased version of the landmark cue-card
flipping bit for "Subterranean Homesick Blues."
</P>
<P>
	   Pennebaker's grainy video for the Dylan tune turned out to be about 20 years
ahead of its time, presaging MTV and VH1. So when he flips past the video music
channels today ...
</P>
<P>
	   "I think, 'Without me, they'd be bankrupt,"' he says, laughing loudly. "I'm
sure the check is in the mail."

<HEADLINE> Kenya Airways Jet Crashes Into Sea  </HEADLINE>
   By TIM SULLIVAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- A Kenya Airways jet carrying 169 passengers and
10 crew members crashed into the sea Sunday night, shortly after takeoff from
Abidjan. At least nine survivors were pulled from the water, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane, an Airbus 310, took off at 9:08 p.m. and crashed into the
Atlantic Ocean just one minute later, according to George Dapre Yao, the head of
air traffic at Abidjan's Felix Houphouet-Boigny Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenya Airways Flight 431 carried 167 adults passengers and two children, Yao
said. Officials said the cause of the crash was under investigation, and
declined to speculate on why the plane went down.
</P>
<P>
	   By dawn, though, it was not clear if anyone was still alive in the cold
water of the Atlantic. At least 14 bodies had been found.
</P>
<P>
	   Samuel Ogbada Adje, a Nigerian who survived the crash, said the plane
started having problems as soon as it took off.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It wasn't quite balanced, and the next thing we knew we were in the
water,'' said Adje, wrapped in a blanket at an Abidjan port after being plucked
from the water by rescuers. He managed to swim out of the wreckage, but said the
rescue effort had been a disaster.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they had come sooner, a lot of us would have been saved. We waited two
hours for people to rescue us,'' he said angrily before being pushed into an
ambulance and driven away.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Embassy in Nairobi said there was an American on the flight but did
not know whether he was among the survivors. He was not identified.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Col. Blaise Grah, an Ivorian firefighting official, said at least six
men and three women had survived the crash. He said they included three
Nigerians, one Rwandan and one Gambian. The nationalities of the other survivors
were not available.
</P>
<P>
	   In Nairobi, Steve Clarke, the technical director of Kenya Airways, said the
plane took off in Nairobi but could not make a scheduled landing in Lagos,
Nigeria, because of bad weather. The bad weather this time of year in West
Africa is related to a phenomenon known as the harmattan -- sand blown south
from the Sahara Desert and the Sahel.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane then landed in Abidjan to pick up passengers and was headed back
to Nairobi, via Lagos, when it crashed.
</P>
<P>
	   Clarke said most of the passengers were believed to be Nigerians. The route
is popular among Nigerians heading to Dubai for duty-free shopping.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The aircraft started its initial climb with no problem and then suddenly
descended,'' Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
	   Six or seven survivors were found early Monday floating in the wreckage off
Abidjan, said Raymond Kesse, an official with the Ivorian Red Cross. He said
they were being picked up by boats and taken to an area hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, another survivor, a Frenchman, was brought to the same hospital
with cuts and bruises.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was a good swimmer. That's how he managed to survive,'' said Dr. Tanoh
Koutoua, who treated the unidentified man.
</P>
<P>
	   At least two more survivors were seen being brought ashore at a port a few
miles from the crash scene. One woman, blood pouring out of a head wound, was
brought in by the owner of a fishing boat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were really lucky to find her,'' said Gerard Frere. ``She was clutching
onto debris.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the crash site, between three and four miles offshore, was a chaotic
scene.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We went out here and there, we had no light. We had to improvise,'' he
said. ``There are bodies floating everywhere, ripped off arms and lots of
debris.''
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said the plane never appeared to get sufficient altitude as it
crossed over the airport's wall and headed out over the ocean, just a few
hundred yards away.
</P>
<P>
	   Emergency officials -- firefighters, police officers, soldiers and divers --
were combing the beach near the crash scene late Sunday night, about 1 mile east
of the airport, looking for survivors and corpses. Police boats cruised the
Atlantic and a helicopter chattered noisily overhead, scanning the dark ocean
with a bright searchlight.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of people, who live nearby or were praying in churches along the
beach road, heard the plane slam into the water.
</P>
<P>
	   A few immediately jumped into the water, hoping to get to survivors, but
were quickly driven back by the harsh surf that slams noisily into the white
sand beach.
</P>
<P>
	   An official at the airport's control tower said French military
firefighters, who are stationed at a French military base next to the airport,
had also been dispatched to the scene. The French Foreign Ministry in Paris
confirmed that a Marine infantry battalion was taking part in the rescue
operation.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather was clear in Abidjan, the Ivory Coast's commercial city, at the
time of the crash. The temperature was about 77 degrees, with a light wind.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenya Airways has a partnership with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. Together, the
two airlines operate four flights a week from London to Nairobi, via Amsterdam.
Sunday's crash was the first such disaster for Kenya Airways, which has been
operating since 1977, Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
	   The airlines has three other Airbus 310 aircraft in service and no plans to
recall them, Clarke said. The plane that crashed was manufactured in 1986 and
was due to be replaced in two years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kenyan government retains a significant interest in its national carrier
while KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is the largest individual shareholder with a 26
percent stake in the company.

<HEADLINE> Elk, Deer Attract New Producers  </HEADLINE>
    By BECKY BOHRER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CRESTON, Iowa (AP) -- Poor prices drove Jeff and Peni Tussey out of the hog
market a few years ago. Possible profits attracted them to the elk market soon
afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   "I used to raise a lot of hogs," Jeff Tussey said. "I didn't want to be in a
hog confinement operation 10 hours a day."
</P>
<P>
	   Six years later, the Tusseys have expanded their more traditional farming
operation -- 100 beef cattle and 1,000 acres of corn and soybeans -- to include
about 60 elk.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tusseys aren't alone. Across Iowa, people are looking to alternative
forms of agriculture to diversify their existing operations and add
profitability. In some cases, they simply are seeking a change -- and finding it
in nontraditional livestock such as deer and elk.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're more the adventurous, risk-taker types," said Steve Pedersen of the
state Department of Agriculture. "We still are largely a state of pork and beef,
corn and soybean producers. But as we continue on in this new millennium, I
think we will see continued diversification."
</P>
<P>
	   About 4 percent of Iowa farms -- 2,800 operations -- now deal in
nontraditional livestock, Pedersen said. There are roughly 67,000 traditional
operations, which produce such animals as cattle, hogs, sheep, turkeys and
chicken.
</P>
<P>
	   There are incentives for farmers producing alternative crops and livestock.
For example, a program run through the state treasurer's office known as Linked
Investments For Tomorrow, or LIFT, buys a certificate of deposit below the
current market rate from an Iowa bank. Money then is lent to eligible borrowers
at low interest. Some $15.8 million has been disbursed to 455 borrowers.
</P>
<P>
	   Peni Tussey works for the nearly 200-member Iowa Elk Association, considered
one of the better-organized nontraditional livestock groups in the state. It
receives numerous inquiries weekly, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   David Schmitt, assistant state veterinarian, acknowledged the growing
interest, but said he does not see the more traditional operations being
affected significantly. "The traditional farmers I see ... stay with the
livestock they've been involved with or get out of farming altogether," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rick Grooms, a deer and elk producer from Bloomfield, Iowa, said he knows of
several farmers who left the cattle industry in hopes of seeing greater profits.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think most people that have been (raising elk and deer) for nine or 10
years probably got into it for the enjoyment," he said, but recent investors,
hurt by a poor cattle market, want to make money.
</P>
<P>
	   Grooms began raising elk and deer about 10 years ago as a hobby. His herd
has grown to about 400 head of elk and deer, such as whitetail and fallow.
</P>
<P>
	   Grooms said 2 1/2 elk eat as much as one steer and three deer consume as
much as one elk. He feeds grain a few times weekly and hay once a week.
</P>
<P>
	   Markets were affected with financial problems in Asia, a large importer of
elk and deer velvet from antlers. Velvet is used in medications to treat
arthritis and rheumatism and can be replenished quickly by more mature elk
bulls. It gets about $30 to $40 a pound, Jeff Tussey said.
</P>
<P>
	   Elk also are raised for meat and breeding stock -- bred cows can sell for
$4,000 to $6,000 -- and their antlers and teeth can be used to make such things
as furniture and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitetail deer tend to fetch more than fallow because they're prone to
multiple births, Grooms said. Prices for deer can range from $250 to $900, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Right now it pencils out real good," Jeff Tussey said. "If ever the price
was right, it's now. If somebody's been thinking about raising elk for a couple
of years, I'd start it today."

<HEADLINE> Candidates Trade Barbs Before Vote  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Bill Bradley warned that rival Al Gore's ties to
fund-raising scandals could cost Democrats the White House if he's nominated,
while the vice president accused Bradley of ``personal vilification.''
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain each argued Sunday that they
are best able to return the presidency to the Republicans, with McCain boasting
he'd beat the Democrats ``like a drum.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think Tuesday night we're going to leave New Hampshire with a big smile
on our face,'' Bush countered as the presidential hopefuls headed into final
campaign appearances before Tuesday's leadoff primary.
</P>
<P>
	   There were signs of increasingly competitive races in both parties.
</P>
<P>
	   With his once-impressive lead threatened, Gore faced a newly aggressive
Bradley attacking fund-raising scandals in the last election.
</P>
<P>
	   Waving a magazine article describing Gore's ties to a 1996 fund-raising
event at a Buddhist temple, the former New Jersey senator demanded that the vice
president clear the air.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Quite frankly, I think there's more explanation that's needed,'' he said.
``Unless we clean up our own house, the Republicans are going to clean our house
up in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``What happened in 1996 was a disgrace on both the Republican and Democratic
side, but it was particularly embarrassing for Democrats because we are the
party of reform,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore released a letter from friendly congressional leaders asking Bradley to
ease his criticism. Known for his own tough attacks, Gore accused his rival of
``stepping down ... to the level of personal vilification.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley was in the uncomfortable position of discussing a medical condition
that causes him to occasionally have an irregular heartbeat. He dismissed the
condition as ``a nuisance.''
</P>
<P>
	   On the GOP side, Bush and McCain were the major rivals. McCain dismissed
Bush as simply another establishment figure, with the Arizona senator saying his
commitment to campaign finance reform resonates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can beat Al Gore like a drum,'' McCain declared.
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, Bush sought to cast himself as a Washington outsider, a
governor with a proven record and a message with the best chance of winning in
November.
</P>
<P>
	   He said voters ``want somebody who can lead our country in a direction
that's positive and hopeful and optimistic, and I am going to be that
president.''
</P>
<P>
	   Polls have found McCain with a slight lead or tied with Bush in New
Hampshire, and while Gore has a slight edge over Bradley that race could be
competitive on Tuesday as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Publisher Steve Forbes is running in third place among Republicans in most
polls and he assaulted Bush for being ``wishy-washy'' on tax cut plans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He puts a weak proposal on the table, then he says he'll maybe get it done
in the first term -- maybe, maybe not,'' said Forbes. ``I think this is part of
the waffling and equivocating that people are tired of.''
</P>
<P>
	   The final weekend before the primary wrapped up with a furious burst, as the
seven major-party candidates dashed from rallies to news conferences to TV talk
shows, all making their case in a state where voters are notorious for deciding
late.
</P>
<P>
	   In a nod to Sunday's Super Bowl, most ended the day in front of a television
in a tacit admission that voter attention was elsewhere at game time.
</P>
<P>
	   Fiery conservative Alan Keyes got a surprisingly strong third-place showing
in Iowa's leadoff caucuses but has registered low in the polls in New Hampshire.
He picked up backing Sunday of David Schippers, head GOP investigator for
President Clinton's impeachment trial. Keyes was attacking McCain, accusing him
of being a soft in opposing abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservative activist Gary Bauer has fared poorly in early tests and was
struggling to keeping his GOP campaign alive with a low-key schedule Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   He vowed to soldier on regardless of New Hampshire's outcome, but ``I would
only add the caveat that no one can run if their supporters don't stay with
them.''
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side, Bradley was again discussing his health. He has been
slow to provide details of the non-life-threatening condition that causes his
heart to lose rhythm, but has acknowledged that on three occasions since 1996 he
has had to undergo anesthesia for treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   If elected, Bradley said he would consider invoking the 25th Amendment to
briefly relinquish power to his vice president if forced to undergo the
treatment. ``It's certainly one of the options and it's one way to deal with
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore won Iowa's caucuses by a 2-1 margin after an aggressive campaign
stretch where he hammered Bradley's centerpiece health care proposal. That
stretch saw Bradley's earlier lead in New Hampshire wiped out, with Gore
building an edge.
</P>
<P>
	   There has been a big internal debate in Bradley's campaign about how to
respond, with some advisers arguing that attacking Gore would dent their
candidate's effort to cast himself apart from ``politics as usual.'' Others warn
that Gore's tactics are working and Bradley must respond.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why would Senator Bradley break his promise to run a different kind of
campaign and launch divisive, manipulative attacks?'' Gore asked backers.

<HEADLINE> 'Eye of Beholder' Takes No. 1 Spot  </HEADLINE>
    By TOM VERDIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ashley Judd's latest thriller, "Eye of The Beholder,"
was in the eyes of many moviegoers this weekend, debuting at No. 1 at the box
office.
</P>
<P>
	   Judd, star of previous thrillers "Double Jeopardy" and "Kiss the Girls,"
helped attract moviegoers to the film about a private eye's decade-long pursuit
of a serial killer.
</P>
<P>
	   About 60 percent of the "Eye of the Beholder" audience went to the film
specifically to see Judd, Robert Bucksbaum of Reel Source Inc. said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The film had $6.2 million in ticket sales. The only other wide-release
opening, Bette Midler in "Isn't She Great," made just $1.3 million. "Isn't She
Great" is the biopic of "Valley of the Dolls" author Jacqueline Susann.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second biography in recent months to perform below expectations
at the box office, behind "Man on the Moon," Jim Carrey's take on late comic
Andy Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
	   "I guess biographies do well on the bookshelf but not too well on the big
screen," Bucksbaum said.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the box office didn't do well, with competition from the Super
Bowl, icy winter weather and a dearth of attention-grabbing premieres, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "People are going to be spending more time shoveling snow than they are
going to the theater," Bucksbaum said.
</P>
<P>
	   For the second weekend in a row, none of the top 10 made at least $10
million during the three-day period. That last time that happened was in October
1998, said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's been a tough couple of weekends," Dergarabedian said. "For a top film
to do $6.2 million shows you what kind of state the box office is in at this
moment."
</P>
<P>
	   The top films for the same weekend a year ago, including "Patch Adams" and
"Varsity Blues," grossed $62 million. The dozen highest-grossing films this
weekend brought in only $44.9 million, a drop of nearly 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Larger audiences were expected to return next weekend with the opening of
"Scream 3." Bucksbaum said that film could open with $30 million in ticket
sales.
</P>
<P>
	   It also confirms the rising star power of Judd.
</P>
<P>
	   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North American theaters,
according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Final figures were to be released today:
</P>
<P>
	   1. "Eye of the Beholder," $6.2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   2. (tie) "Next Friday," $6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   2. (tie) "The Hurricane," $6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   4. "Stuart Little," $4.8 million.
</P>
<P>
	   5. "The Green Mile," $4.1 million.
</P>
<P>
	   6. "Down to You," $4 million.
</P>
<P>
	   7. "Galaxy Quest," $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   8. "Girl, Interrupted," $3.3 million.
</P>
<P>
	   9. "The Talented Mr. Ripley," $2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
	   10. "Toy Story 2," $2.4 million.

<HEADLINE> GOP Rivals Have a Hero in Common  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- He's in John McCain's campaign commercial, Gary Bauer's
campaign literature and George W. Bush's campaign rhetoric. There he is, too, in
Steve Forbes' campaign book and Alan Keyes' campaign Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   Twelve years after Ronald Reagan left office, and 24 years after his name
first appeared on a New Hampshire primary ballot, the former president's name,
image and values are invoked ceaselessly by the Republicans who would succeed
him in the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ronald Reagan is the most popular president certainly in our lifetime and
everybody wants to campaign as the heir to the Reagan legacy. It's smart,'' says
Steve Duprey, the New Hampshire GOP chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   Reagan is ill with Alzheimer's disease, and, as Bauer noted recently,
``can't speak for himself.''
</P>
<P>
	   But that doesn't stop everyone else from jockeying for recognition as his
true political heir.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was with him in '76, when all my competitors were somewhere else,''
Bauer said. That would be as a campaign supporter in Kentucky nearly a
quarter-century ago, when Reagan mounted a conservative challenge to President
Ford and nearly took the party's nomination away from him.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer routinely notes that he served in Reagan's Education Department, and
then in his White House as domestic policy adviser. One campaign brochure refers
to Republicans as ``the party of Lincoln and Reagan,'' and echoes Reagan's
campaign rhetoric of long ago: ``Together, we can make this nation a shining
city on a hill.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes isn't about to surrender that quickly in the Reagan race. He is seen
whispering in the former president's ear in a photograph in one campaign
brochure.
</P>
<P>
	   And his book, ``A New Birth of Freedom,'' includes more than a dozen
references to Reagan. Among them is a reminder that Forbes served in his
administration as chairman of the board that oversees Radio Free Europe and
Radio Liberty.
</P>
<P>
	   Reagan appears in a McCain campaign brochure and television commercial in
which the two men are seen walking together.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was very close to President Reagan,'' the Arizona senator said recently
as his campaign bus motored around New Hampshire. ``I met him after I came home
from Vietnam. I've had a good relationship with him and Nancy.''
</P>
<P>
	   The former president turns up in the New Hampshire literature of George W.
Bush, whose father served as Reagan's vice president. The glossy brochure
includes a letter from Sen. Judd Gregg that vows the Texas governor's ``greatest
strength is he will bring back the optimism of Ronald Reagan and the energy of
Theodore Roosevelt to the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush himself invoked the days of Reagan when Elizabeth Dole dropped out of
the race and endorsed him. He was pleased, he said, to have someone who had been
a foot soldier in Reagan's army become a general in his own.
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes tells audiences of his service in Reagan's administration, and
his Web site notes he is a ``former Reagan administration official.'' In
addition, it says he serves as president of the Ronald Reagan Alumni
Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Republicans stress their ties, too. The Web site of Pat Buchanan, now
a Reform Party contender, includes a photograph of him and Reagan conferring in
the Oval Office. ``From 1985 to 1987, Mr. Buchanan was the White House director
of communications for Ronald Reagan,'' it notes.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, there are limits, as Vice President Al Gore demonstrated last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Midway through a campaign debate with Bill Bradley, he criticized his
Democratic rival for a 1981 vote in favor of Reagan's spending cuts while a
senator from New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> NH Poll: Half Say Issues Important  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush and John McCain are very close in most
polls of likely voters in New Hampshire's Republican presidential primary, with
high stakes emphasized by a new survey that shows McCain gaining ground in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the Texas governor and national GOP front-runner, has been drawing
close in New Hampshire, site of the first nominating primary Tuesday, by winning
the support of undecided Republicans, veteran pollsters say. The stakes of the
New Hampshire primary were highlighted by a CNN-Time South Carolina poll that
shows Bush at 52 percent and McCain at 32 percent, a large but shrinking lead
for Bush. In November, he led McCain 62 percent to 15 percent in the state
McCain has said is crucial for his campaign, with an early primary Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
	   About half of the likely New Hampshire primary voters in one new poll cited
a candidate's position on issues as the most important factor in deciding who
should be president, although no one issue dominated.
</P>
<P>
	   And at least one-third of all likely voters in New Hampshire said they had
yet to make a firm decision, polls suggested.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side in New Hampshire, Vice President Al Gore has built a
lead by pulling even with Bill Bradley among two groups of voters --
independents and men -- where Bradley had been the strongest. That lead has
narrowed in the last couple of days, however.
</P>
<P>
	   REPUBLICANS
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and McCain, the Arizona senator, are tied in several of the latest
pre-primary polls, while McCain holds a slim lead in a couple of others.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked in a Boston Herald-WCVB poll which issue is the most important in
their decision, 15 percent chose the economy, 13 percent picked taxes and 12
percent said education. Social Security-Medicare and moral issues each were
chosen by 11 percent of respondents, followed by 9 percent who said abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   The quality selected most often by likely Republican voters is a candidate
who stands up for what he believes, followed by a strong and decisive leader, in
a University of New Hampshire-WMUR-Fox News tracking poll. Only 4 percent said
having the best chance of winning in November is most important, something Bush
supporters have used as an argument to support their candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
	   Gore built a lead in most polls from the days leading up to the Iowa
caucuses Jan. 24 to the days just after. His lead was in double digits in
several polls until a recent Bradley surge brought it back under 10 points. Gore
led 48-41 in the Boston Globe-WBZ-TV poll, 48-39 in the Boston Herald-WCVB poll
and 53-42 in the UNH-WMUR-Fox News poll. The CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll showed
Gore with a 51-45 edge and Gore led Bradley 49-37 in an MSNBC poll.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Each candidate's base of support has shifted somewhat,'' said R. Kelly
Myers, the pollster for the Herald-WCVB poll. He said Gore has closed the gap
among independents and men, while Bradley was getting stronger support from more
liberal Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore led Bradley by 18 points among those who viewed health care as the top
issue, by 25 points among those who picked education and 28 points among those
who chose Social Security-Medicare, according to the Herald-WCVB poll. That
survey was taken Wednesday and Thursday and involved 403 likely Democratic
primary voters and 402 likely Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boston Globe-WBZ poll was taken Friday and Saturday with 400 likely
voters in each primary. Both polls taken for the Boston newspapers had error
margins of plus or minus 5 percentage points. The UNH-WMUR-Fox News poll was
taken Wednesday through Saturday of 487 likely voters in the Republican primary,
with an error margin of 4 percentage points; and 340 likely voters in the
Democratic primary, with an error margin of 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   The CNN-USA Today poll of 911 likely Republican primary voters and 716
likely Democratic voters was taken Saturday and Sunday and had an error margin
of plus or minus 3 percentage points for Republicans and 4 percentage points for
Democrats. The MSNBC poll was taken of 502 likely Republican primary voters and
501 likely Democratic voters on Saturday and Sunday and has an error margin of
plus or minus 4.5 percentage points for each group.

<HEADLINE> Bush: Family Legacy Cuts Both Ways  </HEADLINE>
   By WALTER R. MEARS AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILFORD, N.H. (AP) -- Call it ``the John Adams and John Q. factor.'' George
W. Bush does, musing on the impact of a father who was president on a son who
wants to be elected the next one.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor said his family name is a political asset, but that he
stands where he does, as national front-runner for the Republican nomination, on
the basis of his record, his programs and his proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   He is trying to defend that status in the nation's first presidential
primary on Tuesday against Sen. John McCain, rated the leader in polls on a
contest both sides agree is close between them, with three other Republicans
trailing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I understand the George Bush name and the Barbara Bush name is a plus for
some, because it gives me a chance to make my case,'' Bush said at a campaign
news conference. ``And it's a negative for some.''
</P>
<P>
	   The only son ever elected president after his father had held the office was
John Quincy Adams, in 1824. John Adams was elected in 1796. Each served one
term.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Bush said their issues and problems were different, and his would
differ from his father's, too.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most people are realistic to know that we'll be playing different hands as
the president, there'll be different issues, there'll be different moments when
the decision-making capacity of the president will be tested,'' he said. ``It'll
have a different character to it.''
</P>
<P>
	   That was said before George and Barbara Bush came to New Hampshire to join
the candidate onstage Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a cameo campaign role.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even from far away in Texas you get the feeling that things are moving up
here and moving well,'' the former president said. ``This boy, this son of ours,
is not going to let you down. He's going to go all the way.''
</P>
<P>
	   He might have claimed a record for brevity in campaign oratory, 19 seconds,
except that his son the candidate was even briefer.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Bush, also joined by his sister and two of his brothers, said that when
his family came to campaign for him, ``it gave me that extra impetus to keep
charging in New Hampshire.'' Elizabeth Dole, who quit the race and endorsed Bush
earlier, was there, too.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no speeches, rather a country and western concert at an indoor
tennis center. The elder Bush had appeared in his son's behalf in Iowa and South
Carolina. Mrs. Bush sought support for him earlier in New Hampshire. This was
the first time they had campaigned together.
</P>
<P>
	   The former president had a mixed record in his three New Hampshire
primaries, losing in 1980, winning in 1988 and fending off a conservative
challenge in 1992, in a contest too close for the political comfort of the White
House. President Clinton defeated him that November.
</P>
<P>
	   The father-son question came up again Sunday. Gov. Bush was asked in a
television interview about one of President Bush's appointees to the Supreme
Court, David Souter, a New Hampshire judge, whose decisions have drawn
conservative criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   He declined, as he has before, to say whether Souter's record on the court
would meet his campaign-expressed commitment to nominate only justices who would
strictly interpret the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said on CBS that he understands what the questioners are trying to get
out of him: ``They're trying to get me to draw a contrast between my dad and me
on a variety of issues ...
</P>
<P>
	   ``But I'm not going to get into a debate with my father or voices who would
represent my father. And so I have said, I'm going to pick strict
constructionists.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's standard answer when asked about his political inheritance is that he
has gained ``about half my dad's friends and all his enemies.''
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the friends: Sen. Judd Gregg, campaign manager for President Bush in
1992 when he was governor of New Hampshire, chairman of the George W. campaign
now; And John Sununu, the former governor whose hard-nosed tactics helped boost
the elder Bush to his primary victory in 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   Sununu became White House chief of staff, served for three years, then was
pushed out because of controversy over his abrasive style and his use of
government travel privileges for personal trips.
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush delivered the time-to-go message to Sununu for his father in
1991. Endorsing him Friday, Sununu said he'd never had a problem with the
younger Bush, that they'd always been friends.

<HEADLINE> Tiny Towns Will Vote First in N.H.  </HEADLINE>
   By RACHEL M. COLLINS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HART'S LOCATION, N.H. (AP) -- The voting booths are made of shower curtains
and plywood. ``Town Hall'' comprises a few filing cabinets, countertops and
chairs surrounded by a washer, dryer and furnace in the basement of the town
clerk's home.
</P>
<P>
	   But if things go as planned, residents of this tiny town and remote Dixville
Notch even farther to the north will cast the first votes in the nation's
earliest presidential primary Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Continuing a sporadic half-century-old tradition, all 27 registered voters
in this village framed by the snow-covered White Mountains plan to vote at
midnight, hours before the rest of the state awakens.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The thing that struck me the last time I did it is that it's such a great
way for kids to see democracy in action,'' said resident Kath Harris, who works
at the Notchland Inn. ``These are not some crazy numbers coming off a TV screen.
These are parents and neighbors getting excited about something people ought to
be excited about.''
</P>
<P>
	   State law requires the polls to stay open until 7 p.m. -- unless everyone
eligible to vote in a town has done so. The tradition of voting early began in
Hart's Location in 1948, when nearly everyone worked for the railroad and had to
be at work before the polls normally would have opened.
</P>
<P>
	   But voting in 2000 could be considered two parts democracy, one part sport.
Residents not only will meet at the inn about an hour before midnight to share
their favorite recipes for coffee cake and the like, but they will do a practice
run to voting booths customized with their names written in colored markers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's like a civics course made real,'' said Les Schoof, one of the inn's
owners. ``The feeling is if we can all show up to vote for Ed to be selectman,
we can all show up to vote for a president.''
</P>
<P>
	   Admittedly, the pace picks up a notch during the presidential primary. A
sleepy town of a few dozen year-round and vacation homes nestled into a state
park and a national forest suddenly is bathed in the spotlight of international
attention.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Being so small you don't expect interest,'' said Doris Clemons, 89, a
longtime resident of Hart's Location who now lives in nearby Bartlett. ``But I
suppose it's an unusual situation, so that's why they started coming.''
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, the hoopla that accompanies the village's 15 minutes of fame
prompted townsfolk to cancel midnight voting in 1964.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A couple of old-timers got tired,'' Schoof said. ``They couldn't go to the
outhouse without someone sitting next to them asking questions.''
</P>
<P>
	   The tradition wasn't revived until the last primary, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Dixville Notch, a tiny hamlet about 50 miles north, was more than willing to
take over the first-to-vote honors and incorporated itself for voting purposes
only. The balloting is at The Balsams, among the last of the stately grand
hotels that once dotted the White Mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   For many of Dixville's 30 registered voters, voting at midnight in the
hotel's Ballot Room is a tradition of more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a ribbon-cutting ceremony that begins here in Dixville and continues
across the country,'' said Michael Pearson, a selectman.
</P>
<P>
	   Though residents of both communities say it's not a race between the two
locales -- or inns -- both have orchestrated plans to get the word out fast,
including installing special telephone lines to broadcast their votes to the
world.
</P>
<P>
	   The bottom line, Pearson says, is that ``the more towns that have 100
percent voter participation, the better off this country will be.''
</P>
<P>
	   But as Bill King, a 65-year-old Hart's Location native, points out, 100
percent is never guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anyone can vote at midnight, but you can't close the polls until everyone
has,'' he said. ``All it takes is one person not to vote, and that's the end of
midnight voting.''

<HEADLINE> Albright in Moscow To Size Up Putin  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Set to size up Vladimir Putin and to push for an easing of
restrictions on antimissile defenses, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
hopes to convince the acting Russian president that his government faces greater
isolation if it keeps pounding Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no question the war in Chechnya is popular,'' Albright told
reporters on her flight here Sunday night from Switzerland. ``But he is riding a
tiger'' by pushing the military offensive against rebels in the republic.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright said casualties were mounting and that Russia faces more isolation
in the international arena as the war drags on. ``They have to hear over and
over again that this is not working for them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   She predicted her meeting Wednesday with Putin would be ``meaty,'' but
declined to predict the outcome.
</P>
<P>
	   Persistent U.S. appeals to Russian leaders to end the conflict and negotiate
with the Chechnya separatists have failed. Albright did not predict success this
time, either, and she ruled out U.S. economic sanctions if persuasion does not
work.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, she said, ``It is very clear to me that Russia is hurting itself
because of Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 150 Russian nationalists and religious activists gathered outside the
U.S. Embassy to protest Albright's visit and accuse her of backing Chechen
rebels and war crimes in Yugoslavia. One sign said she was coming to Russia to
``save the Chechen bandits.''
</P>
<P>
	   Albright also was primed to discuss with Putin sharp cuts in U.S. and
Russian long-range nuclear arsenals while urging the Kremlin leader to approve
``modest adjustments'' in a ban on missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
	   And yet, the secretary said any idea of a tradeoff was ``hypothetical'' and
that the United States would not negotiate a new treaty to reduce nuclear
weapons stockpiles until the Russian parliament approved the 1993 START II
accord.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton is due to decide this spring whether to go ahead with a
$6.6 billion program to launch a defense against missiles from such ``rogue
states'' as Iran and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   He will make the decision based on U.S. national interest, Albright said.
But she said she also would like Russia to modify a 1972 treat that banned such
defenses against missiles.

<HEADLINE> Historic Nev. Casino Demolished  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT SONNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RENO, Nev. (AP) -- In the end, nothing -- not petitions, protests, lawsuits
nor even Lady Luck herself -- could save the historic Mapes Hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday morning, 75 pounds of explosives tucked into the hotel-casino's
support columns were ignited, and the art deco walls came tumbling down.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was like slow motion,'' said Bob Meyer, a courthouse security officer
with a close-up view.
</P>
<P>
	   After more than a dozen dynamite blasts, the brick building slowly collapsed
in a wave, sending a giant dust cloud for blocks. An estimated 10,000 people
watched from the street and a local television station broadcast the event live.
</P>
<P>
	   The implosion, challenged in lawsuits that went all the way to the Nevada
Supreme Court, represented a major defeat for the National Trust for Historic
Preservation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know of a single city that regrets having held onto an important
landmark,'' National Trust president Richard Moe said. ``I know of many -- and
Reno joined them today -- that regret having lost one. It is sad, tragic and so
unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
	   Others said it was overdue. The city wanted to clear the land to expand its
riverside district of art galleries, restaurants and shops.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is time to move on because downtown Reno is dying,'' said Pam McDowell
of Reno.
</P>
<P>
	   About 150 people who disagreed gathered at a park minutes after the
implosion for a wake, where bag pipes wailed ``Amazing Grace'' and souvenir
bricks sold for $1 each.
</P>
<P>
	   Built in 1947, the 12-story Mapes ushered in the modern era of gambling. It
was the first building in the nation constructed to house a casino, hotel and
live entertainment under one roof.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the place to be seen during its glory years in the '50s and '60s,
when entertainers such as Mae West, the Marx Brothers and Sammy Davis Jr.
performed in its top-floor, window-walled Sky Room with a spectacular view of
the Sierra Nevada.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mapes closed on Dec. 17, 1982 and remained boarded up while various
restoration proposals fizzled.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Trust for Historic Preservation listed the Mapes in 1998 as one
of North America's most endangered historic buildings. The trust had not lost a
battle to protect a site on that list since the list's inception in 1989.
</P>
<P>
	   After exhausting more traditional attempts to save the Mapes, local
preservationists plugged more than 400 silver dollars into a slot machine
earlier this month, hoping to win a $33 million jackpot and buy the old hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   They won their $400 back, but failed to hit the progressive Megabucks
jackpot connected to slot machines throughout Nevada.
</P>
<P>
	   And so the years-long battle ended with a three-story-high pile of rubble on
Super Bowl Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sherrie Clark watched the demolition with a cousin she used to accompany to
shows at the Mapes. ``I hated to see the old lady go down,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Lance Glodowski and Mark Rhodes carried signs to the implosion that read
``Blow It Up Real Good,'' and ``It's About Time.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a great explosion,'' said Rhodes. ``Now we're going to go have some
Bloody Marys.''

<HEADLINE> Medicare Reform Seen As a Long Shot  </HEADLINE>
   By ALICE ANN LOVE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With President Clinton and majority Republicans in
Congress offering competing plans to improve prescription drug coverage for
senior citizens, a compromise bill has a shot this year, albeit a long one.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There will be a very active debate this year on the issue and whether or
not something actually gets enacted depends on how engaged the public gets,''
said John Rother, director of public policy for AARP, the nation's largest
organization of older adults.
</P>
<P>
	   Political conditions are not ideal for compromise as the political parties
try to emphasize their differences before this fall's elections. Yet
larger-than-expected budget surpluses have given Republicans some maneuvering
room to consider new spending as lawmakers look for accomplishments to tout on
the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic pollster Mark Mellman said even younger voters sympathize with
older adults' worries about high drug costs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The concern is certainly greater among senior citizens, but it's a concern
that really does permeate the electorate,'' Mellman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton wants to add drug coverage to Medicare as option for all Americans
age 65 and older, who would pay about $24 a month for a limited benefit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In good conscience, we cannot let another year pass without extending to
all seniors the lifeline of affordable prescription drugs,'' Clinton said
Thursday in his State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
	   Under his plan, the government would contract with the pharmaceutical
benefit managers many private health plans use. They negotiate bulk discounts
with drug companies and allow consumers to use prescription cards at pharmacies
or order by mail.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans say Clinton's approach would waste government dollars replacing
the private drug coverage that about two-thirds of senior citizens already have
-- from former employers, HMOs or supplemental insurance know as Medigap.
</P>
<P>
	   GOP leaders have promised alternative legislation soon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're working on a responsible plan to make sure senior citizens have
access to affordable prescription drugs,'' House Speaker Dennis Hastert
announced last week. ``We don't want to jeopardize the good coverage that
already exists.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert said the GOP would focus on helping those who now lack access to or
cannot afford private options.
</P>
<P>
	   One possibility is a tax credit. A second is a federal block grant to
support state programs -- already existing in some places -- that help
low-income senior citizens pay for drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, in the Republican rebuttal to Clinton's speech, Sen. Bill Frist,
R-Tenn., said Senate GOP leaders want quick action on legislation that would add
prescription drug coverage to Medicare as part of a major overhaul of the
program.
</P>
<P>
	   Under that plan, the government would give Medicare beneficiaries a limited
contribution toward the purchase of approved private health plans -- a setup
similar to federal employees' health benefits. The plans would be required to
offer prescription coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   Although a few moderate Democrats support this approach, party leaders have
attacked it as voucher system and the administration has raised concerns it
could result in the shift of rising Medicare costs to the elderly.
</P>
<P>
	   As lawmakers try to find some common ground, lobbying is expected to be
intense.
</P>
<P>
	   AARP has not endorsed any proposal so far. But the group would prefer drug
coverage made available to all senior citizens through Medicare and considers
ideas such as tax credits an incomplete solution.
</P>
<P>
	   Allied with Republicans are drug and insurance companies that fear
government controls and say senior citizens should be empowered to use private
options.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America recently pledged to
ease off attacks on Clinton's plan. The group still opposes it and is financing
an ambitious campaign, including new television ads in which the now famous
gray-haired bowler ``Flo'' promotes ``bipartisan solutions,'' like the one
Senate GOP leaders favor.
</P>
<P>
	   The Health Insurance Association of America last week said the tax credits
and state block grants were ``the best approach in the near-term.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Clinton's side are prominent consumer groups, including Ralph Nader's
Public Citizen and the Consumer's Union, which publishes Consumers Report
magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   They say private drug coverage options available to the elderly are
expensive and inadequate and do not give them the advantage of bulk purchasing
discounts Medicare would have.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With prescription prices rising at as much as 15 percent (annually), it's
very important to pay attention to what kind of prices people are paying,'' said
Consumer's Union health policy director Gail Shearer.

<HEADLINE> Austin, Phoenix Judged Best Cities  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Austin, Texas, and Phoenix lead the list of America's
best-run cities, propelled to the top by strong finances and well-trained
municipal employees, a Syracuse University survey found.
</P>
<P>
	   The study, released Sunday, rated the governments of the nation's 35 largest
cities in terms of revenues, assigning grades from A to F on five management
criteria: finances, human resources, capital, information technology and
results.
</P>
<P>
	   Phoenix was alone in winning an A or A- in all five categories. Austin
finished with an A- average because of a B grade on its use of information
technology.
</P>
<P>
	   Indianapolis, Minneapolis and Virginia Beach, Va., averaged B+. New York,
Philadelphia, Honolulu, Milwaukee, San Diego, San Antonio, Seattle and Long
Beach, Calif., all had Bs.
</P>
<P>
	   A common factor in cities that scored well was strong leadership, said
Patricia W. Ingraham, director of the Government Performance Project at
Syracuse's Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs. The project was
financed by the Pew Charitable Trusts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Where there is a strong mayor, there is a well-run city, which attracts
residents and visitors,'' Ingraham said. ``Contrary to what many of us think,
the days of mediocre city management are coming to an end.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said the most improved cities are those that were in the worst shape
five to eight years ago -- Detroit, Philadelphia, New York and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Detroit, for example, has earned nine upgrades from bond rating agencies.
Washington has eliminated its debt, and Philadelphia is tracking its revenues
and expenditures better after both cities flirted with bankruptcy, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
	   New York, the first major city to use technology for organizing
crime-fighting efforts, was praised for establishing a Web site that allows it
citizens to apply for licenses and permits through the Internet.

Kenya Airways Crash Search Continues
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- A Kenya Airways jet carrying 169 passengers and
10 crew members crashed into the sea Sunday night, shortly after takeoff from
Abidjan. At least nine survivors were pulled from the water, officials said. The
plane, an Airbus 310, took off at 9:08 p.m. and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean
just one minute later, according to George Dapre Yao, the head of air traffic at
Abidjan's Felix Houphouet-Boigny Airport. By dawn, it was not clear if anyone
was still alive in the cold water of the Atlantic. At least 14 bodies had been
found. Samuel Ogbada Adje, a Nigerian who survived the crash, said the plane
started having problems as soon as it took off. "It wasn't quite balanced, and
the next thing we knew we were in the water."

	   PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- The $560 million factory that General Motors Corp.
will build in Lansing isn't just another assembly plant, but a dissertation on
six years of lessons learned the hard way.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lansing Grand River Assembly Plant, plans for which were to be unveiled
Monday, is the first all-new factory built by GM in the United States since the
Saturn complex near Spring Hill, Tenn., in 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   It's also GM's attempt to shed its reputation for bloated, old-school
manufacturing and prove it can build vehicles as efficiently as any other
automaker in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   "The concepts you have to have to compete are embedded in this plant," said
Donald Hackworth, director of GM's North American manufacturing. "Our vision is
to be a leader."
</P>
<P>
	   Here are three of those lessons, and how the world's largest automaker plans
to put them to use.
</P>
<P>
	   LESSON NO. 1: Work with workers, not against them.
</P>
<P>
	   GM has long been known for having the worst relationship with the United
Auto Workers union. The UAW's 1998 strike of GM parts plants in Flint cost the
company $1.5 billion; GM had suffered more strikes than Ford or Chrysler in the
1990s, as the company tried to shed unneeded plants and workers.
</P>
<P>
	   GM further antagonized the UAW early last year by announcing plans for
Project Yellowstone, a factory of the future where large sections of the vehicle
-- the entire front suspension, for example -- would be built by outside
suppliers, who tend to pay less and use fewer union workers.
</P>
<P>
	   GM hoped to use the plant to build the small cars it currently loses money
on, but suspended the plans after union officials said Yellowstone was simply a
fancy term for outsourcing jobs. When Hackworth briefed reporters about the new
plant last week, his first statement was: "Yellowstone's dead."
</P>
<P>
	   Since the strike, GM has been working to rebuild its relationship with the
UAW. Hackworth said the UAW locals have been involved from the start in planning
the new plant, and that one of the guiding principles for its design was taking
care of the worker.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of the usual foreman-line worker arrangement, the workers at Lansing
Grand River will be cast into teams, with team leaders and group supervisors.
Workers will be trained on a variety of tasks, and teams will be in charge of
their areas.
</P>
<P>
	   While the plant will be brand new, GM plans to hire no new workers, filling
the 1,500 jobs with workers from other plants near Lansing.
</P>
<P>
	   LESSON NO. 2: There's no shame in taking ideas from the best.
</P>
<P>
	   For many years, Japanese automakers have been the leaders in efficiency. The
Harbour Report, an annual survey of automakers' factories, found last year that
Nissan was spending an average of 19.2 hours to assemble a vehicle in its
American factories. GM took 31.6 hours.
</P>
<P>
	   So when GM decided to improve its manufacturing process in 1994, one of its
first moves was to import talent from Toyota, and to study the production lines
at the California factory the two automakers run together.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are not embarrassed, at all, to steal any great idea from anyone,
including the competition, when we see it," said Tom LaSorda, GM's vice
president of quality, competitiveness and competitive operations implementation
and a former Toyota employee.
</P>
<P>
	   One of those ideas is the Japanese practice called "andon." When a problem
crops up on the assembly line, a team member can set off an alarm that lights up
a scoreboard-like display above the line, instead of leaving his post to track
down a foreman.
</P>
<P>
	   LESSON NO. 3: The future's never certain.
</P>
<P>
	   When the plant starts up in late 2001, it will have a capacity of 150,000
vehicles. Its first product will be a new version of the Cadillac Catera luxury
sedan. But it is capable of handling two more luxury vehicles on the same lines,
and can build cars, traditional trucks or a crossover sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
	   GM officials said making the plant as variable as possible was one of the
keys to helping GM compete.
</P>
<P>
	   "About three years out, we're wrong 100 percent of the time on predictions,"
Hackworth said. "It's very important to be flexible ... when you can't predict
what the consumer wants."
</P>
<P>
	   The plant was also designed to be friendly to the idea of build-to-order
systems. Automakers currently estimate how many vehicles they need to build,
then push dealers to sell the stock, often resorting to incentives to clear out
inventory. Many are studying ways to do what Dell did for computers -- building
only to customer orders, cutting the expenses of large inventories.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem has been the complexity of building vehicles with hundreds of
options and thousands of possible combinations. Hackworth said GM can deliver a
custom-ordered Cadillac in 18 days, but that automakers were working on cutting
the time down to as little as three days.
</P>
<P>
	   "We know how to do it. We know who the people are who don't know how to do
it," Hackworth said. "We don't know how to do it everyplace. But it's coming."

<HEADLINE> US-NKorea High Level Talks Planned  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Steps to formally end the Korean War and U.S. concerns about
nuclear missiles will be on the agenda when North Korea dispatches a senior
official to Washington for top-level talks with the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The two sides are to work out the details next month in New York, State
Department spokesman James P. Rubin said. The meeting was announced Sunday as
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright flew from Switzerland to Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   The visit, set for March, is to match talks former Defense Secretary William
Perry held in Pyongyang last year as a special Clinton administration emissary.
</P>
<P>
	   North Korea's deputy foreign minister, Kim Gye Gwan, and U.S. Envoy Charles
Kartman reached agreement for the North Korean visit during talks in Berlin that
ended Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Administration officials said there was no decision yet on who the North
Korean government would send. They see the agreement as another step in U.S.
efforts to coax North Korea out of its isolation and to neutralize its nuclear
weapons program.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1994, North Korea agreed to shelve its nuclear weapons program in
exchange for energy supplies from the United States, Japan and South Korea, and
has agreed to stop missile tests so long as discussions on a better relationship
continue.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States reciprocated by suspending some economic sanctions, but
North Korea is still listed by the State Department as a sponsor of terrorism.
This has the effect of prohibiting virtually all but humanitarian aid to
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
	   Likely topics of discussion at the March talks are ongoing diplomatic
efforts to officially end the Korean war, missile arsenals and terrorism.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Airways Jet Crashes Into Sea  </HEADLINE>
   By TIM SULLIVAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- A Kenya Airways jet carrying 169 passengers and
10 crew members crashed into the sea Sunday night, shortly after takeoff from
Abidjan. At least nine survivors were pulled from the water, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane, an Airbus 310, took off at 9:08 p.m. and crashed into the
Atlantic Ocean just one minute later, according to George Dapre Yao, the head of
air traffic at Abidjan's Felix Houphouet-Boigny Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenya Airways Flight 431 carried 167 adults passengers and two children, Yao
said. Officials said the cause of the crash was under investigation, and
declined to speculate on why the plane went down.
</P>
<P>
	   By dawn, it was not clear if anyone was still alive in the cold water of the
Atlantic. At least 14 bodies had been found and more were expected to be brought
in later in the morning, said Lt. Col. Blaise Grah, an Ivorian firefighting
official.
</P>
<P>
	   Samuel Ogbada Adje, a Nigerian who survived the crash, said the plane
started having problems as soon as it took off.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It wasn't quite balanced, and the next thing we knew we were in the
water,'' said Adje, wrapped in a blanket at an Abidjan port after being plucked
from the water by rescuers. He managed to swim out of the wreckage, but said the
rescue effort had been a disaster.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they had come sooner, a lot of us would have been saved. We waited two
hours for people to rescue us,'' he said angrily before being pushed into an
ambulance and driven away.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Embassy in Nairobi said there was an American on the flight but did
not know whether he was among the survivors. He was not identified.
</P>
<P>
	   Grah, the firefighting official, said at least six men and three women
survived the crash. He said they included three Nigerians, one Rwandan and one
Gambian. The nationalities of the other survivors were not available.
</P>
<P>
	   In Nairobi, Steve Clarke, the technical director of Kenya Airways, said the
plane took off in Nairobi but could not make a scheduled landing in Lagos,
Nigeria, because of bad weather. The bad weather this time of year in West
Africa is related to a phenomenon known as the harmattan -- sand blown south
from the Sahara Desert and the Sahel.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane then landed in Abidjan to pick up passengers and was headed back
to Nairobi, via Lagos, when it crashed.
</P>
<P>
	   Clarke said most of the passengers were believed to be Nigerians. The route
is popular among Nigerians heading to Dubai for duty-free shopping.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The aircraft started its initial climb with no problem and then suddenly
descended,'' Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
	   Six or seven survivors were found early Monday floating in the wreckage,
said Raymond Kesse, an official with the Ivorian Red Cross. He said they were
being picked up by boats and taken to an area hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, another survivor, a Frenchman, was brought to the same hospital
with cuts and bruises.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was a good swimmer. That's how he managed to survive,'' said Dr. Tanoh
Koutoua, who treated the unidentified man.
</P>
<P>
	   At least two more survivors were brought ashore at a port a few miles from
the crash scene. One woman, blood pouring out of a head wound, was brought in by
the owner of a fishing boat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were really lucky to find her,'' said Gerard Frere. ``She was clutching
onto debris.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the crash site, between three and four miles offshore, was a chaotic
scene.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We went out here and there, we had no light. We had to improvise,'' he
said. ``There are bodies floating everywhere, ripped off arms and lots of
debris.''
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said the plane never appeared to get sufficient altitude as it
crossed over the airport's wall and headed out over the ocean, just a few
hundred yards away.
</P>
<P>
	   Emergency officials -- firefighters, police officers, soldiers and divers --
combed the beach near the crash scene late Sunday night, about 1 mile east of
the airport. Police boats cruised the Atlantic and a helicopter chattered
noisily overhead, scanning the dark ocean with a bright searchlight.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of people, who live nearby or were praying in churches along the
beach road, heard the plane slam into the water.
</P>
<P>
	   A few immediately jumped into the water, hoping to get to survivors, but
were quickly driven back by the harsh surf that slams noisily into the white
sand beach.
</P>
<P>
	   An official at the airport's control tower said French military
firefighters, who are stationed at a French military base next to the airport,
had also been dispatched to the scene. The French Foreign Ministry in Paris
confirmed that a Marine infantry battalion was taking part in the rescue
operation.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather was clear in Abidjan, Ivory Coast's commercial capital, at the
time of the crash. The temperature was about 77 degrees, with a light wind.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenya Airways has a partnership with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. Sunday's
crash was the first such disaster for Kenya Airways, which has been operating
since 1977, Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
	   The airlines has three other Airbus 310 aircraft in service and no plans to
recall them, Clarke said. The plane that crashed was manufactured in 1986 and
was due to be replaced in two years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kenyan government retains a significant interest in its national carrier
while KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is the largest individual shareholder with a 26
percent stake in the company.

<HEADLINE> Grad Students Eye Union Recognition  </HEADLINE>
    By NICOLE ZIEGLER DIZON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Kristina Dziedzic is not your father's union organizer.
</P>
<P>
	   She doesn't wave picket signs. Her collar is far from blue. And when the
University of Illinois at Chicago graduate student talks about her work, she
sprinkles in words like "pedagogy."
</P>
<P>
	   Yet Dziedzic is typical of graduate students across the country stirring up
union sentiment in a push for better benefits and higher salaries for students
who teach or do research.
</P>
<P>
	   From Yale to the University of California system, graduate student workers
are fighting for -- and sometimes winning -- collective bargaining rights. As of
December, 27 campuses had recognized graduate student unions, with organizing
efforts under way at many other schools, according to the Chronicle of Higher
Education.
</P>
<P>
	   Students say it's only fair that they get the same benefits as faculty
members at a time when tenure-track jobs are more scarce and freshman classes
are growing, along with the need for graduate students to teach them.
</P>
<P>
	   "Undergraduate classes that could and probably should be taught by faculty
are being given to graduate students," said Dziedzic, an art history student who
has taught composition classes at UIC for the past four years.
</P>
<P>
	   "You often end up doing work that has absolutely nothing to do with what
you're studying. Then it's obvious that you're a worker."
</P>
<P>
	   University administrators argue that even if students are working for the
school, they are students first -- and their teaching assistantships simply
provide financial aid while training them for an academic career.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Murphy, associate chancellor for public affairs at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, said graduate student unions create a students vs.
administration mentality. But the students actually work for professors, who see
themselves as anything but management, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The problem with unions as they have been described by organizers on campus
is that they really follow a factory model," Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some graduate students agree.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not the coal mines at the turn of the century," said David Legg, a
doctoral student in sociology at Yale University. "The principle of unionization
here is much more ideological and idealistic."
</P>
<P>
	   Legg started an anti-union group at Yale in 1995, the year graduate student
union organizers launched a "grade strike," refusing to issue grades for fall
semester classes.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that while a strike
was not protected by federal law, administrators may have illegally threatened
students who participated. The NLRB sent the case back to an administrative law
judge to decide if teaching assistants are indeed employees -- a key argument
for student labor organizers.
</P>
<P>
	   But Legg said graduate students at Yale are doing fine without union
representation. They receive full tuition waivers and stipends of $10,000 or
more and generally do not teach until their third year.
</P>
<P>
	   Legg believes a union would squelch any dissent among graduate students with
very different interests. And this grandson of a union sheet metal worker scoffs
at the idea that Yale students are "oppressed."
</P>
<P>
	   "You've got to visit some of these people's homes on Long Island to believe
it," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   As at Yale, University of Illinois administrators have refused to recognize
the student union movement -- in this case, the Graduate Employees'
Organization, affiliated with the Illinois Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
	   University of Illinois graduate assistants receive tuition waivers, stipends
and other benefits. On the Urbana campus, for example, the university recently
added health benefits for graduate students' spouses. The school also offers
vision and dental benefits and boasts that the average teaching assistant's
stipend rose 44 percent from 1990 through 1999, to $11,069 a year.
</P>
<P>
	   David Kamper, an Urbana GEO member working toward a doctorate in history,
said the benefits aren't on par with what faculty members receive.
</P>
<P>
	   He and Dziedzic, a Chicago GEO organizer, argue that the university's idea
of students assistants learning how to teach from seasoned mentors may have been
true 30 years ago, but not now.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm completely and totally responsible for my class," Dziedzic said. "I'm
not an apprentice to anyone."
</P>
<P>
	   She said graduate students have little opportunity to turn assistantships
into full-time jobs when universities hire more part-time faculty and fewer
full-time professors
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Education Department recently found that graduate assistants at the
University of Illinois taught 31.5 percent of the credit hours taken by
undergraduates in 1997-1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Murphy said universities must offer competitive benefits for graduate
students if they want to attract the top students -- union or no union. He noted
that Illinois spends more paying graduate students than fellow Big Ten schools
Wisconsin and Michigan, which both have recognized graduate unions.
</P>
<P>
	   "We value our graduate students," Murphy said. "The question is whether
having a graduate assistants union is a plus or a minus. We think it's a minus."

<HEADLINE> Dominica Election Tinged With Anger  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE FAUL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SINEKU, Dominica (AP) -- Rocking to a blaring calypso tune promising ``We'll
bring prosperity,'' government supporters in Dominica rallied on the eve of
elections fraught with charges that the government is corrupting the island's
image by selling passports to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
	   The charges have angered Prime Minister Edison James, whose United Workers
Party is seeking a second term. James said there was no evidence that ``economic
citizens'' -- people sold passports for $50,000 -- were criminals. Many of those
sold passports have been Russian, Chinese, or Americans seeking tax shelters.
</P>
<P>
	   Like several Caribbean countries, Dominica started selling passports under
programs linked to offshore banking centers in the early 1990s, as aid from
traditional donors dried up and the banana industry collapsed under a U.S.
challenge to preferential trade rules.
</P>
<P>
	   Concern has grown among citizens of Dominica -- a former British colony in
the southeast Caribbean not to be confused with the Spanish-speaking Dominican
Republic -- since Canada detained several Chinese carrying Dominica passports on
suspicion they were involved in an immigration smuggling ring.
</P>
<P>
	   The prime minister's party has tried to focus attention on its record of
building new homes, schools and roads, as well as economic growth of 3.5 percent
last year.
</P>
<P>
	   About 60,000 people were registered to choose 21 legislators in what was
expected to be a close contest today. Results were expected late tonight or
early Tuesday, and the leader of the party with the most seats becomes prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What the government is doing with the rampant selling of passports to
criminals and criminal gangs all over the world is to eventually establish
Dominica as a center for international crime,'' said Bernard Wiltshire, a leader
of the opposition Dominica Labor Party. ``International gangs would control our
government from behind the scenes to subvert the independence and freedoms of
our people.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Labor Party dominated politics here from 1961 until 1979. Fearing a
comeback by the opposition party, James repeated charges Sunday that Labor
leader Rosie Douglas had met with leaders of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's
Unification Church and would allow them to return to Dominica.

<HEADLINE> A Struggle To Survive in Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
   By LYOMA TURPALOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ARGISHTY, Russia (AP) -- With 13 children to feed, bare cupboards, and no
bus, taxi or even a donkey to take her to the nearest market, Zargan Sadulayeva
had to trudge 25 miles to bring two sacks of food home.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the war, Sadulayeva could have caught a ride along the road leading
to the market in Shali, the largest town in the region. Or she might have sent a
husband, a brother or a couple of sons who could hike through the snowy, wooded
hills. Now, it is too dangerous for men to even move about most of the time.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, in an attempt to stem rebels' movement, the Russian
government ordered military and border officials not to allow Chechen men
between the ages of 10 and 60 to enter or leave Chechnya. International human
rights groups and foreign governments lodged strong protests -- and the order
was quietly rescinded.
</P>
<P>
	   But Chechen civilians say the restrictions on men's movement are still very
much in effect inside Chechnya, and that Russian air raids and shelling make
travel hazardous for men, women and children alike. Civilians say Russian
airplanes fire at cars traveling Chechnya's roads, and shells target people
venturing into forests.
</P>
<P>
	   That makes it even harder than usual for families to obtain enough food and
other supplies to survive the winter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The road to Shali has been closed already for almost two months,'' said
Sadulayeva, who donned rubber boots, a padded denim jacket and a skirt for the
expedition from her home in Argishty village to Shali, 16 miles southeast of the
Chechen capital, Grozny. ``Men can't go there, they're simply not let in, and
they're detained at'' Russian checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
	   For many in Chechnya, heating fuel is as scarce as food. Oil and gas
supplies have been restored only in a few large towns, and the fighting has kept
villagers from going into the woods to gather their normal fuel and firewood.
Some have cut down everything in their yards: fruit trees, bushes, fences.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At one point, the authorities gave me the Hero-Mother medal for having so
many children,'' Sadulayeva said bitterly, easing her sacks of macaroni, rice,
flour and sunflower oil off her shoulders and resting them on the side of the
road. She was referring to an award given in Soviet times to encourage women to
have lots of children to help make the state stronger. ``Now they are demanding
that I kill them with hunger.''
</P>
<P>
	   Others can't find shelter. Residents of the southern Shali and Vedeno
regions report frequent bombing of villages, resulting in new waves of homeless
and civilian deaths.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The worst thing is that the fighters aren't suffering from these bombing
strikes,'' said Baudin Khalidov, a local administrator. ``But already 150
civilians have died. And those are only the cases I know about.''
</P>
<P>
	   A delegation of townspeople from the Vedeno region approached Russian
commanders several times to request a safe-passage corridor so civilians can
escape, said Makhketi village administration official Agubakar Mamuyev.
</P>
<P>
	   They've had no success.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're met politely, they promise to help and then don't do anything,'' he
said. ``They promise not to bomb populated settlements and let refugees go, but
they don't.''
</P>
<P>
	   Even if the authorities were to open such corridors, argued Adam Usmanov, an
elder in Elyirstanzhy village in the Vedeno region, Chechen villagers would
still be ``condemned to death.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Men in general aren't let out. Wives don't want to leave without them,''
he said. ``So the old men and the children also stay.''

<HEADLINE> Olympic Dreams Realized -- at 9 mph  </HEADLINE>
By C.G. WALLACE-
Associated Press Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVO, Utah (AP) -- A week after giving birth to her daughter, Sonya Hansen
found herself standing in the middle of an ice rink with a video camera trained
on her husband as he fulfilled his Olympic dream: to drive a Zamboni!
</P>
<P>
	Forget about the speed and raw excitement of bobsledding, speed skating or ski
jumping. For some, thrill means driving around an ice rink at 9 mph.
</P>
<P>
	For the uninitiated, the Zamboni ice resurfacing machine is that large, blocky
thing that cleans up the ice between periods of hockey games or during breaks at
figure-skating competitions. And it seems to have just as many fans as the
sports it cleans up after.
</P>
<P>
	So when Olympic organizers in Salt Lake City created ``wannabe camps'' for
adults with gold medal aspirations but 9-to-5 lives and talents, they included
the popular Zamboni Camp along with bobsledding and the skeleton, a type of
head-first luge.
</P>
<P>
	For Blake Hansen, here was his chance of a lifetime. Wrapped in a Colorado
Avalanche jersey, Hansen and an instructor drove around the Seven Peaks Ice
Arena. Not far away was his wife -- a video camera plastered to her face, tape
rolling.
</P>
<P>
	``He's like a little boy at Christmas,'' Mrs. Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
	``I've finally fulfilled a dream,'' Hansen exclaimed as he jumped down from the
machine that revolutionized the maintenance of hockey rinks, turning a
labor-intensive 90-minute job into a mechanized 15-minute task.
</P>
<P>
	Frank Zamboni's 1947 creation is often the target of much good-natured ribbing.
Charlie Brown himself once remarked in a Peanuts comic strip: ``There are three
things in life that are fun to watch: a rippling stream, a fire in the
fireplace, and a Zamboni going around and around.''
</P>
<P>
	Hansen's love of hockey is closely tied with the Zamboni. When asked about his
fascination with it, he answered: ``Well, it clears the ice.''
</P>
<P>
	Yes, but why the fascination with a 10-foot tall, 9,000-pound ice-melting
machine?
</P>
<P>
	``It clears the ice, for hockey,'' he said, as if he, too, couldn't quite
comprehend the allure.
</P>
<P>
	Some people think the Zamboni -- no one really bothers to call it by its other
trademark names -- is merely the machine that scrapes ice off the rink and
applies a coat of hot water in its place. But the true devotee knows, just like
you know the taste of a good hot dog, it's much, much more.
</P>
<P>
	Dan Corsbie, for instance, flew to Utah from Urbandale, Iowa, to attend the
camp. His son paid for his spot at camp as a Christmas present. Corsbie, a
retired officer for the juvenile courts, became a Zamboni fan when his
12-year-old grandson started playing in a pee-wee hockey league in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	``I walk down to the glass to get a closer look at the Zamboni,'' Corsbie said.
``It's the size of the machine. It's the gears. It just fascinated me.''
</P>
<P>
	And on his day of heaven on Earth, he wasn't at all disappointed.
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, it's more than I thought it would be. You must try it. You absolutely
must try it,'' he said after guiding the machine past where his son watched and
waved.
</P>
<P>
	Each participant at the Salt Lake Organizing Committee's Zamboni Camps paid $75
to learn the details of getting the ice just right for Olympic events. Camp
director Bob Bills said he got the idea from his days as a manager of a speed
skating rink.
</P>
<P>
	``People were constantly wanting to drive the Zamboni,'' he said. ``I don't
know. It's mesmerizing.''
</P>
<P>
	Retired Indiana school teacher Martha Hoffa, the only woman to sign up, said
she wanted bragging rights to impress her nieces.
</P>
<P>
	``Skydiving? No way,'' she said. ``Bobsledding? I don't think so. But this I
thought I could do.''

<HEADLINE> China Moves Against Exercise Group  </HEADLINE>
   By CHARLES HUTZLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- China has declared a meditation-exercise sect to be an
``evil cult'' and ordered its suppression, expanding a crackdown that began with
the Falun Gong spiritual movement, an official and a rights group reported
today.
</P>
<P>
	   Zhong Gong would be the second offshoot of a traditional health practice
known as qigong to be banned since a protest by 10,000 Falun Gong followers in
April provoked worry among China's communist leaders about the popularity of the
groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Falun Gong, Zhong Gong has attracted huge numbers of followers,
including senior government officials. The unfolding crackdown against Zhong
Gong, as described by a Hong Kong-based human rights group, appears to apply
many of the tactics used in the early stages of the campaign against Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
	   Police have quietly moved against the group while trying to round up its
leaders. Already more than 100 Zhong Gong propagation centers in 20 provinces
and major cities have been closed since November, the Information Center of
Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Zhong Gong founder, Zhang Hongbao, has gone into hiding to avoid arrest, but
police have started confiscating the assets of his Qilin Group, a conglomerate
based in the port city of Tianjin, the center said.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesmen for the police and the State Council, China's cabinet, refused
initial comment on the report. A government official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, confirmed that Zhong Gong was branded an ``evil cult'' and that the
crackdown had been ordered, but not publicized.
</P>
<P>
	   His comments supported the Information Center's claims that internal
Communist Party documents have labeled Zhong Gong an ``evil cult.'' Such a tag
would effectively ban the group because cults are illegal under Chinese law.
</P>
<P>
	   After Falun Gong's April 25 demonstration, Chinese leaders worried that the
group's fervor and organization challenged their political authority. They
banned Falun Gong in July and ordered police checks on other popular qigong
sects and their often charismatic leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   A court in central Zhejiang province last month sentenced a leading member
of Zhong Gong, Chen Jinlong, to two years in jail for illegally practicing
medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   Falun Gong and Zhong Gong are both loosely tied to qigong, a traditional
practice in which exercises are used to channel unseen forces into the body. All
are said to promote health and can bring practitioners supernatural powers.
Falun Gong adds a spiritual dimension, claiming its practice also improves
morality.
</P>
<P>
	   Zhong Gong was founded in 1988 by Zhang Hongbao and has since attracted 20
million followers, the center said.
</P>
<P>
	   The center said Chinese President Jiang Zemin on the advice of Hubei
province's Communist Party secretary consulted senior Zhong Gong master Zhang
Chongping in 1992 to try to cure arthritis and back problems. Government
officials would not comment on the claim.
</P>
<P>
	   But as with Falun Gong, Jiang and other members of the collective leadership
grew worried over Zhong Gong's organizational flair. The group has more than
1,000 propagation centers in China and more than 180,000 practice coaches, the
center said.
</P>
<P>
	   Qilin Group, which is used to fund and promote Zhong Gong, employs over
400,000 people, mostly in the tourism industry or making health products, the
center said.
</P>
<P>
	   Leading members of Zhong Gong have called on followers to resist the
government clampdown and defend the practice, the center said, although it did
not specify how.
</P>
<P>
	   The government has been unable to suppress Falun Gong despite the more than
six-month ban. Members continue to meet and occasionally stage protests in
Tiananmen Square, the last one an attempt to cover the portrait of Mao Tse-tung
with a picture of Falun Gong guru Li Hongzhi on Jan. 24.

Kenya Airways Crash Search Continues
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- By dawn on Monday, it was not clear if anyone
was still alive in the cold water of the Atlantic after a Kenya Airways jet
carrying 169 passengers and 10 crew members crashed into the sea. At least 14
bodies had been found and more were expected to be brought in later in the
morning, said Lt. Col. Blaise Grah, an Ivorian firefighting official. At least
nine survivors were pulled from the water, officials said. The plane, an Airbus
310, took off at 9:08 p.m. Sunday from Abidjan and crashed into the Atlantic
Ocean just one minute later, according to the head of air traffic at Abidjan's

bargaining rights. As of December, 27 campuses had recognized graduate student
unions, with organizing efforts under way at many other schools, according to

NASA Clears Endeavour for Launch

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Endeavour's next mission is to
help map a still-unknown planet: Our own. After an eleventh-hour engine review,
NASA cleared Endeavour for launch Monday on its quest to create the most
accurate and complete topographic map of Earth ever produced. Endeavour was
scheduled to blast off at 12:47 p.m., although thick clouds could force a delay.
NASA's top shuttle manager, Ron Dittemore, announced Sunday that Endeavour's
three main engines were safe to fly and that the launch would proceed as
planned. The decision came despite lingering uncertainty over two fuel pump
seals. Because of lost paperwork, engineers cannot prove the two metal seals are
certified for flight.

Frank Trigg said. Crawford was charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder, 11
counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault and one count of attempted murder.
Trigg said Crawford confessed to the murders of seven women that were part of a
string of murders that stretched back six years on Chicago's South Side. He also

NASA Clears Endeavour for Launch
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Endeavour's next mission is to
help map a still-unknown planet: Our own. After an eleventh-hour engine review,
NASA cleared Endeavour for launch Monday on its quest to create the most
accurate and complete topographic map of Earth ever produced. Endeavour was
scheduled to blast off at 12:47 p.m., although thick clouds could force a delay.
NASA's top shuttle manager, Ron Dittemore, announced Sunday that Endeavour's
three main engines were safe to fly and that the launch would proceed as
planned. The decision came despite lingering uncertainty over two fuel pump
seals. Because of lost paperwork, engineers cannot prove the two metal seals are
certified for flight.

<HEADLINE> China Warns U.S. on Censure Attempt  </HEADLINE>
   By RENEE SCHOOF Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- China-U.S. relations will suffer if Washington goes ahead
with an attempt to censure Beijing at the U.N. Human Rights Commission, state
media today quoted a senior Chinese diplomat as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice Foreign Minister Wang Guangya said the U.S. plan to criticize China at
the U.N. commission makes it impossible for the two countries to have private
talks on human rights, the China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before Wang's comments, China-U.S. human rights talks were suspended.
Beijing cut them off in anger in May over NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy
in Yugoslavia during the war over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has announced it will bring a resolution calling for
censure of China for human rights abuses when the U.N. Human Rights Commission
holds its annual meeting in March in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A dialogue on human rights between China and the U.S. will not be possible
if no concrete steps are taken by the U.S. to eliminate the adverse effects of
the anti-China resolution,'' said Wang, who was China's chief representative in
rights talks with Washington before Beijing suspended them.
</P>
<P>
	   Wang argued that no country has a right to ``venture to be the teacher of
others'' and said the Chinese government has made great efforts to protect human
rights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The development of democracy and the legal system has seen active
progress, and the Chinese people have enjoyed ever better social, economic and
cultural rights,'' he asserted. ``China now has the best human rights situation
in its history.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wang's comments were carried in a front-page story in the country's only
English language daily newspaper, the China Daily, and by the English service of
the state-run Xinhua News Agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight previous U.S. efforts to censure China at the U.N. commission since
1989 have failed. Last year, American officials were unable to muster enough
support to include the question on the commission's agenda. Many European
nations opposed the U.S. initiative. Washington did not submit a China
resolution in 1998 because it perceived that the rights situation had been
improving.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States said it would support a resolution denouncing China
because Beijing has cracked down on political dissent, vigorously suppressed the
Falun Gong spiritual movement, tightened its grip on the media and the Internet,
and strengthened controls on unregistered churches and on the political and
religious expressions of ethnic minorities, especially Tibetans.

<HEADLINE> Encouraging Study About AIDS Virus  </HEADLINE>
    By DANIEL Q. HANEY AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The medicines that transformed the treatment of AIDS
also may be slowing its spread, but health experts worry this victory will be
wiped out by a new complacency among those at risk.
</P>
<P>
	   Protease inhibitors and other drugs have changed AIDS from a death sentence
to a treatable chronic disease over the past four years. In the process, they
lower people's virus levels dramatically, often to the point where the virus
cannot be detected on the most sensitive tests.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors have speculated that since many people have vastly lower virus
levels in their bodies, they are also probably less likely to pass the virus on
to others through sex.
</P>
<P>
	   Indirect evidence of this was made public Sunday at the 7th Conference on
Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Thomas C. Quinn and others from Johns Hopkins University conducted a
study in Uganda of 415 heterosexual couples in which one partner was infected
and the other was not. The goal was to see if the risk varies depending the AIDS
carrier's virus levels.
</P>
<P>
	   As it turned out, Quinn said, "the higher the viral load, the greater the
risk of transmission. If you had sex with a person with very low virus, your
probability of getting infected was low."
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, when virus levels fell low enough, there was no transmission of the
virus at all in these heterosexual couples during 30 months of follow up.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the study does not mean that AIDS transmission cannot occur in such
couples. Experts warn that even though the risk is low, there is probably always
some risk of unprotected sex with someone infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's wonderful news, and there is a lot we can learn from it," said Dr.
Helene Gayle, AIDS chief at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
"Should the prevention message be different? No."
</P>
<P>
	   Experts point out differences between Africa, where AIDS is spread chiefly
by heterosexual encounters, and the United States, where the disease is often
transmitted between homosexual couples.
</P>
<P>
	   Furthermore, AIDS is rarely treated in Africa, so those with low virus
levels have strong immune systems that hold the virus down. Doctors say it is
theoretically possible that Americans with drug-suppressed HIV carry more of the
virus, so their risk of transmission could be greater.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Michelle Roland of the University of California at San Francisco said it
is reasonable to think lowering the amount of AIDS virus in infected people will
slow the disease's spread. But even if the overall risk is lower, "it is
impossible to predict what will happen in a given couple at a given time."
</P>
<P>
	   CDC researchers presented new evidence that people most at risk of infection
are becoming more likely to let down their guard. In a survey of 1,976 such
people in seven states, 17 percent said they have grown less careful about sex
or drug use because of the new treatments. Needle drug users had become the most
complacent, while gay men were the least so.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey confirms several smaller reports suggesting that good news about
AIDS treatment has made people less worried about catching the disease.
</P>
<P>
	   A separate analysis recently by Dr. Robert Grant of UCSF suggests that even
a small drop-off in safe sex practices could offset any slowing of the epidemic
resulting from lower virus levels.
</P>
<P>
	   Grant estimated that if sex habits remain unchanged, there will be 30
percent fewer AIDS deaths over the next 10 years in San Francisco than otherwise
would be expected. However, this reduction will be wiped out if there is a 10
percent to 20 percent increase in risky sexual behavior.

    SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Hundreds of dentists showed their pearly whites when
Garth Brooks made a surprise appearance to announce his support of a children's
charity.
</P>
<P>
	   Brooks told a meeting of about 750 members of the Crown Council, an alliance
of North American dentists, that his Touch 'em All Foundation would join in

Saturday. "The money is for children, and the areas we will use it for is
medical, education and inner-city projects since those needs are so great."
</P>

	   For the next three months, dentists participating in the fund raising will
provide discounted teeth whitening procedures to their patients, and payments
for that work will be channeled directly to the Smiles For Life Foundation.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- The star of the offbeat Fox comedy "Malcolm in the Middle"

<HEADLINE> First Woman in Congress Made a Mark  </HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In two widely separated but electric moments in a long
life, the first woman elected to Congress faced an issue that so affronted her
principles that a simple ``no'' was not enough.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to stand by my country, but I cannot vote for war; I vote no,''
Republican Rep. Jeannette Rankin of Montana said on April 6, 1917, as her new
colleagues overwhelmingly approved a declaration of war against Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   After an absence from Congress of more than two decades, Miss Rankin was
elected a second time and once again voted against the current of history.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As a woman I can't go to war, and I refuse to send anyone else,'' she said
on Dec. 8, 1941, the day after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. This time
her ``no'' vote stood alone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If that were all there was to distinguish her from others, she would rate
no more than a footnote in history as an impractical idealist cast in the wrong
role,'' writes Hannah Josephson, Miss Rankin's biographer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She was more than that; she was a dynamic figure in the true American
tradition and in the course of a long and fruitful life she became a symbol to
great numbers of people, as a suffragist and feminist, as a pacifist, as a
political reformer and as an example of how life could be maintained to a great
age with meaning and purpose.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   The Bitterroot Range provided the backdrop on John Rankin's ranch about six
miles from Missoula in the Montana Territory when Jeannette, his oldest child,
was born in 1880.
</P>
<P>
	   She had childhood memories of Indians moving past the ranch house, the men
on horseback dragging travois poles attached to a framework that held
provisions.
</P>
<P>
	   There was a story from her father's time on the rapidly shrinking frontier
she would long repeat. As she told it, federal troops, angered over an incident
involving an intoxicated Indian, surrounded an Indian camp and opened fire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As the Indians came out of their tents, the American soldiers shot them
... anyone who came out,'' she told an interviewer in the 1970s. That story, she
was to say, helped shape her thinking ``about the stupidity and cruelty of
force.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   She was 36 in April 1917, the month she took her oath of office as a
representative from Montana and voted against a war.
</P>
<P>
	   She had graduated from the University of Montana, studied social work in New
York City and worked with the poor.
</P>
<P>
	   Returning to Montana in 1910, she became the first woman to address the
state Legislature, appealing for women's suffrage. She campaigned town by town
until the state granted women the right to vote in 1914, then ran successfully
for a House seat two years later.
</P>
<P>
	   Women could not vote in most states in 1916. But nothing in the Constitution
prevented them from serving in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Although 50 members of the House and six members of the Senate voted against
President Woodrow Wilson's appeal for a declaration of war in 1917, Miss Rankin
had a price to pay. The Helena (Mont.) Independent called her ``a dupe of the
Kaiser.'' Many in the suffragist movement, which had hailed her trailblazing
election, now portrayed her as a millstone to their cause. She tried and failed
to win election to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   In 1940, Miss Rankin again won a House seat from Montana. War once again
seemed imminent, but her views had not budged.
</P>
<P>
	   As the House debated on Dec. 8, 1941 she tried to speak against the war
resolution but was ignored. ``Sit down, sister,'' someone shouted. As she had in
1917, she gave her reasons during the roll call itself, boiling down her speech
to a single sentence and violating a House rule that ban speeches while a vote
is on.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When they started the roll call different men came around and sat by me
and said, `They really did bomb Pearl Harbor.' I said, `I know that,'' she told
an interviewer years later. ``But that didn't make any difference. Killing some
more wouldn't help matters.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   As the years advanced, Miss Rankin spoke out against U.S. military action in
Korea and in Vietnam. On Jan. 15, 1968, a group of 5,000 anti-war women calling
themselves the Jeannette Rankin Brigade marched in Washington with her in the
lead. She said she approved of every part of the protest except the word
``brigade.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sounds too militaristic, the 88-year-old pacifist said.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Miss Rankin died in 1973 at age 92, her views still clear.
</P>
<P>
	   I never ran for Congress,'' she once said. ``I ran for women's suffrage and
against war.''
</P>
<P>
	   A portrait statue of her, the gift of Montana, was dedicated in 1985 as part
of the Capitol's Statuary Hall collection.
</P>
<P>
	   Tourists who pass by often pause to read the five words on its base:
</P>
<P>
	   ``I cannot vote for war.''
</P>

A flurry of economic reports are being released this week, and a policy meeting

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed at Open of Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed at the start of trading today after the
latest economic report from Washington left little question in investors' minds
that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this week.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 35.68 at 10,774.55.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up
5.51 at 1,365.67, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 50.46 at 3,836.61.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading was fairly volatile as the Fed's Open Market Committee prepared to
meet in Washington on Tuesday and Wednesday. Most economists expect the Fed to
raise interest rates a quarter percentage point, but in recent sessions, some
analysts have begun forecasting a steeper increase.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest sign that sharply higher interest rates may be needed to slow the
nation's runaway economic growth came today from the Commerce Department. The
department said personal income, which includes wages, interest and government
benefits, increased by 0.3 percent last month. That was weaker than many
analysts were expecting.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Commerce Department also said that spending rose a brisk 0.8
percent, helping push the personal savings rate to an all-time low. Feverish
consumer spending has been a major driver of the economic boom.
</P>
<P>
	   After slumping at the opening bell, the Dow moved higher on the strength of
Coca-Cola, up 1 3/16 to 58 1/8, and J.P. Morgan, up 1 13/16 to 119 7/8. Most
analysts had expected the Dow to fare better today after Friday's 289-point
drop, which capped a week of heavy losses for the blue-chip index.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 120.04 million shares, behind Friday's
early pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.12 at 501.50.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.5 percent. European indexes
were sharply lower in afternoon trading, with Germany's DAX index down 2.5
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 down 1.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 down 1.0
percent.

<HEADLINE> GOP Offers Bigger Marriage Tax Cut  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans today were putting the final touches on
legislation to ease the income tax ``marriage penalty'' paid by millions of
two-income couples that would be broader and cost much more than a similar
proposal from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 25 million families pay higher income taxes because of
marriage, according to the Treasury Department. The tax hits most often when the
higher-earning spouse makes between $20,000 and $75,000 a year, congressional
estimates show -- and remedying this disparity is a goal of Republicans and
Democrats alike.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Fixing the marriage penalty has the overwhelming support of the American
people and enjoys bipartisan support in Congress, so there is absolutely no
excuse why we can't get this done for millions of married couples right now,''
said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, who
planned to announce details of the measure later today.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP bill, estimated at roughly $180 billion over 10 years using
projected surplus dollars, would adjust the lowest 15 percent income tax bracket
upward for married couples, according to Ways and Means Committee sources
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   If that change were to be fully phased in this year, married couples would
pay the lowest income tax on their first $52,500 of income, compared to $43,850
under current law. The bracket adjustment, aimed at helping couples whether they
itemize deductions or claim the standard deduction, would be phased in over
several years, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two other provisions are similar to those proposed by Clinton, who last week
outlined a 10-year, $45 billion plan to fix the marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   Like the president, House Republicans would increase the standard income tax
deduction for married couples to twice that for single tax filers, although the
GOP's change would begin in 2001. Using this year's numbers, that would
translate into a standard deduction of $8,800, compared to $7,351 now.
</P>
<P>

who claim the earned income tax credit by $2,000, an item proposed by Clinton
but also previously included by Republicans in their failed 10-year, $792
billion tax cut last year.
</P>
<P>
	   House leaders intend to set the marriage penalty bill for a floor vote to
coincide with Valentine's Day, but its fate in the Senate is less certain.
Partly because of Senate rules and partly because of philosophical differences,
Senate Republicans have not agreed on the House approach of passing a series of
smaller, popular tax cuts rather than one large tax relief package.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Up 5.59  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today after the latest economic report
from Washington left little question in investors' minds that the Federal
Reserve will raise interest rates this week.
</P>
<P>
	   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
5.59 at 10,744.46.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 6.76 at 1,353.40, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 78.41 at
3,808.66, adding to its 152-point drop on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading was fairly volatile as the Fed's Open Market Committee prepared to
meet in Washington on Tuesday and Wednesday. Most economists expect the Fed to
raise interest rates a quarter percentage point, but in recent sessions, some
analysts have begun forecasting a steeper increase.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest sign that sharply higher interest rates may be needed to slow the
nation's runaway economic growth came today from the Commerce Department. The
department said personal income, which includes wages, interest and government
benefits, increased by 0.3 percent last month. That was weaker than many
analysts were expecting.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Commerce Department also said spending rose a brisk 0.8 percent,
helping push the personal savings rate to an all-time low. Feverish consumer
spending has been a major driver of the economic boom.
</P>
<P>
	   "Over the past few weeks, investors have become progressively more nervous
about the strong economy," said John H. Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist
at Advest Inc., who expects the Fed to raise rates this week, and again in March
and in May.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaughnessy said interest rate worries are likely to dominate trading until
the economy shows some sign of slowing down.
</P>
<P>
	   "Looking ahead, we are going to have to deal with a very volatile stock
market," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   After slumping at the opening bell, the Dow moved higher on the strength of
General Motors, up 1 5/16 to 80 5/16, and J.P. Morgan, up 4 1/16 to 122 1/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Most analysts had expected the Dow to fare better today after Friday's
289-point drop, which capped a week of heavy losses for the blue-chip index.
Hewlett-Packard, down 3 15/16 at 104 13/16, weighed down the average.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 327.29 million shares, behind Friday's
early pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 9.14 to 495.48.

<HEADLINE> GOP Offers Bigger Marriage Tax Cut  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans today were putting the final touches on
legislation to ease the income tax ``marriage penalty'' paid by millions of
two-income couples that would be broader and cost much more than a similar
proposal from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 25 million families pay higher income taxes because of
marriage, according to the Treasury Department. The tax hits most often when the
higher-earning spouse makes between $20,000 and $75,000 a year, congressional
estimates show -- and remedying this disparity is a goal of Republicans and
Democrats alike.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Fixing the marriage penalty has the overwhelming support of the American
people and enjoys bipartisan support in Congress, so there is absolutely no
excuse why we can't get this done for millions of married couples right now,''
said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, who
planned to announce details of the measure later today.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP bill, estimated at roughly $180 billion over 10 years using
projected surplus dollars, would adjust the lowest 15 percent income tax bracket
upward for married couples, according to Ways and Means Committee sources
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   If that change were to be fully phased in this year, married couples would
pay the lowest income tax on their first $52,500 of income, compared to $43,850
under current law. The bracket adjustment, aimed at helping couples whether they
itemize deductions or claim the standard deduction, would be phased in over
several years, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two other provisions are similar to those proposed by Clinton, who last week
outlined a 10-year, $45 billion plan to fix the marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   Like the president, House Republicans would increase the standard income tax
deduction for married couples to twice that for single tax filers, although the
GOP's change would begin in 2001. Using this year's numbers, that would
translate into a standard deduction of $8,800, compared to $7,351 now.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP bill also would increase the income cutoff for lower-income couples
who claim the earned income tax credit by $2,000, an item proposed by Clinton
but also previously included by Republicans in their failed 10-year, $792
billion tax cut last year.
</P>
<P>
	   House leaders intend to set the marriage penalty bill for a floor vote to
coincide with Valentine's Day, but its fate in the Senate is less certain.
Partly because of Senate rules and partly because of philosophical differences,
Senate Republicans have not agreed on the House approach of passing a series of
smaller, popular tax cuts rather than one large tax relief package.
</P>
<P>
	   Ways and Means Committee Democrats will closely examine whether the cost of
the House GOP plan might jeopardize surplus dollars needed to keep Social
Security and Medicare solvent, said spokesman Dan Maffei. He also questioned why
the GOP did not include Democrats in drafting a bill with such bipartisan
support.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As far as I know, no Democrats have been included in the process,'' Maffei
said. ``We have to assume the Republicans want to force something through and
say, 'Take it or leave it.'''

<HEADLINE> Personal Income Rises in December  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' personal income rose in December and they
spent all of it and more, giving the nation's retailers one of their best
holiday seasons in years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Commerce Department reported today that personal income, which includes
wages, interest and government benefits, increased by 0.3 percent last month,
following a 0.4 percent rise in November. December's gain -- the smallest
increase since September -- was weaker than the 0.5 increase many analysts were
anticipating.
</P>
<P>
	   Spending, meanwhile, rose a brisk 0.8 percent -- the biggest increase since
August -- following a solid 0.7 percent gain in November. The increase in
spending, right on target with analysts' expectations, gave merchants their best
holiday sales since 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   With Americans spending more than they earned in December, the personal
savings rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income -- was pulled to a
record monthly low of 1.5 percent. In November, the savings rate was 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   All that spending also pushed the savings rate to an all-time annual low of
2.4 percent in 1999 compared with a 3.7 percent rate the year before.
</P>
<P>
	   The savings rate had dipped to record monthly lows in negative territory
several times in 1999. But a comprehensive overhaul late last year in how the
government calculates the gross domestic product -- the total output of the
country's goods and services -- has pushed the savings rate into positive
territory. The revisions showed that Americans are saving more than previously
thought.
</P>
<P>
	   The record low savings numbers posted for December and for the year,
however, aren't as dire as they seem. That's because the rate doesn't reflect
gains households have realized on their savings from such things as rising stock
market values and higher real estate values for their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Many analysts expect the Federal Reserve to boost interest rates by a
quarter of a percentage point at the end of a two-day meeting Wednesday. They
believe the Fed will do this to slow the red-hot economy, which has been
supported by robust consumer spending, and to keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
	   The central bank bumped up interest rates three times last year, making
borrowing more expensive for millions of American consumers and businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Even with those rate increases, economists believe the economy continues to
power ahead at a rapid pace that probably can't be sustained without triggering
inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   In financial markets, bond prices fell as yields on the bellwether 30-year
Treasury bonds rose to 6.49 percent in early trading from 6.45 percent late
Friday in part reflecting profit taking from last week's gains. The stock market
was subdued with the Dow Jones industrial average up 10 points in late-morning
trading but the broader Nasdaq market was off 110 points.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, Americans' income rose 5.9 percent, matching the increase
posted in 1998, and led by a 6.8 percent boost in wages. In 1998, wages rose 7.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Spending in 1999 rose 7 percent, following a 6 percent increase the year
before, marking the biggest jump in spending since a 7.4 percent rise in 1989.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, wages rose by a solid 0.7 percent, following a 0.3 percent rise
the month before.
</P>
<P>
	   Spending in December was led by a big 1.3 percent increase in purchases of
nondurable goods, such as food and fuel. In November, spending on nondurable
goods rose 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   For durable goods -- big-ticket manufactured items expected to last at least
three years, such as washing machines and cars -- spending rose 0.8 percent in
December, following a 2.2 percent increase the month before.

<HEADLINE> Royal Bank Hikes Offer for NatWest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC raised its hostile takeover
bid for National Westminster Bank PLC in a last-minute attempt to beat rival
Bank of Scotland for control of the English bank.
</P>
<P>
	   The Royal Bank valued its new offer of cash and stock announced Monday at
$40.47 billion, up from its earlier bid of about $35.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The Royal Bank's move followed an improved offer Thursday by the Bank of
Scotland, which said then that its offer valued NatWest at $39.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Both banks have until the end of Monday to post final offers to shareholders
under terms set by regulatory authorities in the battle for NatWest.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately clear whether the Bank of Scotland would make a new
bid Monday. The Royal Bank described its offer as final, but said it reserved
the right to change it 'if a new competitive situation arises."
</P>
<P>
	   The Royal Bank's new basic offer to shareholders is 0.920 shares in the new
merged company and $6.48 in cash per NatWest share -- a 17 percent premium on
Natwest's closing share price Friday of $20.67.
</P>
<P>
	   The new bid included a commitment of an extra $810 million from a Spanish
bank, Banco Santander Central Hispano, which is the Royal Bank's largest
shareholder with 9.64 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The extra funds from the Spanish bank -- in exchange for Royal Bank shares
-- would be used to pay shareholders who opt for a cash alternative in the new
offer.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have injected more cash into this offer in a way which does not involve
dismembering the NatWest business and does not disadvantage any of the
shareholders involved," said Royal Bank Chief Executive Sir George Mathewson.
</P>
<P>
	   NatWest derided the new offer.
</P>
<P>
	   "After all the anticipation, this is a damp squib and a risky one," the bank
said in a statement. "When Bank of Scotland comes forward with their final
offer, the board will consider both offers."
</P>
<P>
	   Shares in all three banks fell Monday on the London Stock Exchange. But some
analysts blamed general weakness in banking shares because of fears of interest
rate rises, rather than the takeover battle.

    CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures prices plunged in early dealings today on
the Chicago Board of Trade after weekend rains in South America doused some
concerns about drought damage to crops there. Grains also fell sharply.
</P>
<P>
	   Rainfall in soybean-growing areas of Argentina was heavier than expected,
and meteorologists said the wet weather will spill over into Brazil today and
Tuesday. That has improved crop prospects but left soybean prices too high for
investors' comfort.
</P>
<P>
	   Showers are expected to continue in the region throughout the week, adding
more pressure on soybean futures.
</P>
<P>
	   The increased showers in South America also contributed to a decline in corn
prices today, although not as steep as in soybeans.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat prices slid under pressure from the sell-off in soybeans and from
significant precipitation over the weekend in most winter-wheat growing areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat for March delivery fell 4 3/4 cents to $2.55 a bushel; March corn fell
5 cents to $2.18 1/2 a bushel; March oats fell 2 cents to $1.11 1/2 a bushel;
March soybeans fell 12 1/2 cents to $5.11 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> $25 Disease Test Urged for Newborns  </HEADLINE>
    By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The mother's story mixes heartache with anger: Her
seemingly healthy 8-month-old baby died suddenly one morning. No warning, just a
panicked phone call from the baby sitter that Jim had quit breathing.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors called it SIDS. But Jamie Lazzaro later discovered her baby instead
had suffered from a genetic metabolic disease -- a treatable one, if only the
hospital had run a simple $25 test to detect it when Jim was born.
</P>
<P>
	   Few hospitals test newborns for a group of 30 rare but devastating metabolic
diseases, although experts say diagnosis at birth might prevent several hundred
deaths and life-threatening illnesses a year.
</P>
<P>
	   For many, staying healthy can be as simple as a special diet.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a bitter pill to swallow," Lazzaro says. "If there was a test, then
why didn't we get it?"
</P>
<P>
	   That's a question more people may be asking soon. As scientists complete
mapping of the human genome later this year, they'll be poised to develop
countless new tests to detect rare diseases before symptoms appear.
</P>
<P>
	   But just because a test is determined valuable doesn't mean doctors quickly
embrace it.
</P>
<P>
	   Consider the inherited metabolic diseases, which have such tongue-twisting
names that many go by acronyms like VLCAD and MCAD.
</P>
<P>
	   Most are "fatty acid oxidation disorders," in which patients lack enzymes
that change stored fat into energy. If patients go longer than about eight hours
without eating, or catch an illness that causes vomiting, they can suddenly die.
Undigested fats also clog their hearts and livers. Other disorders cause a toxic
buildup of amino acids.
</P>
<P>
	   Affected babies appear healthy at birth. But the first attack sometimes is
lethal, and early childhood is the riskiest period.
</P>
<P>
	   Every state now tests every newborn for two rare diseases that cause
retardation if untreated: hypothyroidism and the metabolic disease
phenylketonuria.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, using technology called tandem mass spectrometry, doctors also can test
for these 30 other devastating metabolic diseases. It requires just a drop of
blood, costs less than $25, takes mere minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   But it does require special training and a $400,000 machine.
</P>
<P>
	   Plus, many doctors know little about metabolic diseases, or that they're
treatable. They are fairly rare, altogether thought to strike one in 5,600
births.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's been a hard road" to persuade states to add the tests to standard
newborn disease screening, said Dr. Charles Roe of Baylor University Medical
Center in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
	   "I find this very difficult to deal with. ... These are unnecessary deaths."
</P>
<P>
	   Adds David Millington, who, along with Roe, developed the test at Duke
University: "It's the most useful test ever done on most people at birth, by
far."
</P>
<P>
	   North Carolina, Massachusetts and Wisconsin have begun offering supplemental
testing for metabolic diseases. South Dakota hospitals just started mailing
blood samples to Baylor for testing, and some in Texas do, too. About two-thirds
of Pennsylvania hospitals and some in other states hire Pittsburgh-based Neo Gen
Screening for testing.
</P>
<P>
	   Parents also can seek testing on their own from Neo Gen or Baylor.
</P>
<P>
	   That's how Jamie Lazzaro learned VLCAD killed her baby.
</P>
<P>
	   When Jim was 8 months old, he vomited one night but seemed OK by morning.
Hours later, he died while napping. The pathologist noted a puzzling enlarged
heart, but termed the death SIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   A year later, pregnant again, the Louisville, Ky., woman learned about
metabolic diseases, and wondered. She sent Jim's medical records to Roe, who
says about 3 percent of SIDS cases turn out, like Jim, to be a metabolic disease
gone undiagnosed.
</P>
<P>
	   Post-mortem diagnosis is important -- it alerts that other children in an
affected family need testing.
</P>
<P>
	   What's an expectant parent to do?
</P>
<P>
	   Ask if your hospital offers supplemental metabolic testing, Roe says. If the
hospital doesn't, parents can get more information about the diseases or how to
seek a test by calling 1-800-4BAYLOR or checking www.neogenscreening.com on the
Internet. Check www.fodsupport.org for information for affected families.
</P>
<P>
	   And stay tuned, because tandem mass spectrometry is powerful enough that as
treatments become available -- a requirement for routine testing -- more tests
can be easily added.
</P>
<P>
	   It "is going to really revolutionize newborn screening," said Neo Gen
Screening president Edwin Naylor.

<HEADLINE> EU Says Growth Will Spark Euro  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL AMES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European finance ministers on Monday insisted the
euro's tumble to record lows against the dollar is only temporary, but the chief
European central banker warned of inflation risks if the currency's weakness
lingers.
</P>
<P>
	   Ministers of the 11 countries that adopted the euro as their single currency
predicted a robust economic recovery in Europe will soon be pushing the euro
upwards.
</P>
<P>
	   "The euro has potential for appreciation, firmly based on growth and
internal price stability," the ministers said in a joint statement with the
European Central Bank. "A strong economy goes along with a strong currency."
</P>
<P>
	   However the ministers disappointed currency traders who had been hoping for
more than jawboning to buoy-up the 13-month-old currency, which hit a new low of
97.38 U.S. cents on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Ministers at the European Union meeting took care not to encourage
speculation about an imminent interest-rate rise or market intervention by the
European Central Bank to prop up the euro.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the euro rose above 98 cents in Asian trading before the EU
meeting, it slipped again to a late rate Monday of 97.84 cents in European
trading.
</P>
<P>
	   European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg warned that persistent euro
weakness might increase the risk of higher inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   If the euro buys fewer dollars and Japanese yen, then European consumers
would have to pay more for imports and to travel overseas. But a weak euro also
means European goods are less costly, and therefore more competitive, on global
markets.
</P>
<P>
	   "A continuous weakness of the external value of the euro would pose a risk
to our objective to maintain internal price stability," Duisenberg told
reporters as he left the ministers' meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   EU data released last week revealed inflation in the so-called euro-zone
rose to 1.7 percent in December, creeping close to the ECB's maximum target
level of 2 percent. Most ministers dismissed the higher-than-expected increase
as a glitch triggered by rapidly rising oil prices. They stressed wages and
consumer prices remained under control.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are faced with the prospect of noninflationary economic growth," said
Portuguese Finance Minister Joaquim Pina Moura, who chaired the euro-zone talks
and a meeting later of finance ministers from all 15-EU nations.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro's latest battering came mainly in anticipation that the U.S.
Federal Reserve will raise its short-term interest rates this week and perhaps
again later this year. Longer-term doubts about the commitment of European
governments to pro-market reforms, and contradictory statements from
policy-makers have also been blamed for driving down the euro.
</P>
<P>
	   Euro-zone ministers Monday were united in underscoring their faith in
Europe's economy.
</P>
<P>
	   "The strength of European growth, the dynamism of the European economy,
sooner or later will be reflected by the euro," French Finance Minister
Christian Sautter told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   "Growth in the euro-zone is strong and getting stronger all the time," Pina
Moura added.

<HEADLINE> Japan Turns to Banks for Loans  </HEADLINE>
    By J.L. HAZELTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- The Japanese government has issued tons of bonds in an
unprecedented spending campaign to prod the economy out of its deepest downturn
since World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, faced with a projected shortfall in what it owes municipalities, the
government is looking in a different place to borrow money: banks
</P>
<P>
	   Governments tend to shy away from banks, at least in part because they can
be expensive. While the benchmark government bond yield in Japan is around 1.7
percent, Tokyo can expect to pay a reported 2.1 percent on a loan.
</P>
<P>
	   But Japan's recent massive economic stimulus packages have already relied
heavily on bond issues, there is mounting concern in Japan that the market may
have absorbed all it can take.
</P>
<P>
	   "The bond market is already jittery about the supply," Commerz Bank
economist Ron Bevacqua said Monday. "The government is trying to avoid the
market consequences of its decision making."
</P>
<P>
	   A Finance Ministry official, who requested anonymity, said that the
government turned to the banks because it felt bonds were not a good idea and
had to find other ways to raise money.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nihon Keizai financial daily reported that the government planned to pay
2.1 percent interest, but the official declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   It's not the first time Japan has turned to bankers for funds. The
government resorted to direct borrowing to cover shortfalls in a national
forestry account in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Whether the government raises funds through bonds or bank borrowing, the
policy is leading to the same result: debt -- and lots of it.
</P>
<P>
	   With its debt at 128 percent of its gross domestic product -- a measure of
all goods and services produced in a country -- Japan has achieved the
questionable distinction of joining Italy as the only two countries with debt
greater than GDP. In contrast, the U.S. national debt is half its GDP.
</P>
<P>
	   Tokyo doesn't seem worried enough about the debt to stop spending, however.
Last Friday, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi told Parliament that he was focusing on
economic recovery rather than the ballooning deficit. He's predicting 1 percent
economic growth in fiscal 2000, which begins April 1.
</P>
<P>
	   The government's spending ways have yet to influence Japanese consumers and
companies, who are holding tight to their money in fear of further hard times
ahead. Spending by wage earners fell 1.7 percent in real terms in 1999,
officials announced last week.
</P>
<P>
	   A blip involving the huge postal savings system is at the root of the $74.8
billion shortfall in the $196.5 billion budgeted for unrestricted local
government funding in fiscal 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Ten years ago, when interest rates were around 7 percent, lots of Japanese
locked their money into high-yielding 10-year post office accounts. With those
accounts maturing, and interest rates below 1 percent, many are likely to take
their money elsewhere, Bevacqua said.
</P>
<P>
	   The postal office is the largest bank in the world, holding money for
millions of Japanese, but the maturing accounts total about $935.5 billion, or a
third of its holdings, Bevacqua said. That leaves the government with
significantly less upon which to draw.
</P>
<P>
	   Turning to the banks is not so radical, Bevacqua said, since the government
nationalized several of the biggest and spent $72.0 billion bailing out the
system after the 1980s economic bubble burst.
</P>
<P>
	   But it's also not in the spirit of promised structural reforms of the
Japanese economy and the political system, he said. "It's not market economics."
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Morgan, senior economist at HSBC Securities in Japan, said the
government's latest strategy isn't that significant, adding that the difference
between issuing short-term bonds to cover the potential postal savings problem
and taking out bank loans will not be that great.
</P>
<P>
	   The move, while directed at the specific problem of the postal-savings
withdrawals, could nevertheless provide a more flattering view of the overall
deficit, Morgan added.
</P>
<P>
	   If the market looks at bond totals rather than bond and loan totals, things
aren't quite so grim, he said.

<HEADLINE> Test Helps Doctors Pick AIDS Drugs  </HEADLINE>
    By DANIEL Q. HANEY AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Doctors say they can improve the chance of
successfully treating AIDS by measuring how each patient's virus stands up to
the drugs intended to kill HIV.
</P>
<P>
	   Through evolution, HIV can grow resistant to any of the standard AIDS drugs,
and often it is invulnerable to several at once. The specific combination of
viral resistance varies from patient to patient. In theory, doctors can brew up
the most potent AIDS drug cocktails for their patients if they know the
strengths and vulnerabilities of the viruses they carry.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past, doctors have attempted to do this by checking the virus for the
genetic mutations that make it impervious to various drugs. However, complex
mixes of mutations are sometimes hard to translate into drug treatment plans.
</P>
<P>
	   In a new approach called phenotypic resistance testing, doctors can check
the virus against all of the standard drugs to see which ones can kill it, then
use the results to tailor their strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   "With this information, you can make better decisions," said Dr. Calvin
Cohen.
</P>
<P>
	   Understanding virus resistance is especially important when putting together
new drug combinations after the initial drug cocktail fails to wipe out all
visible signs of the virus. Doctors have 15 AIDS drugs to pick from, and the
choice often amounts to an educated guess.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen and colleagues studied phenotypic testing at the Community Research
Initiative of New England, an independent AIDS research organization in
Brookline, Mass. He described the results Monday in San Francisco at the 7th
Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections.
</P>
<P>
	   The test was developed by Virco N.M., a European biotechnology company that
financed the study with Glaxo Wellcome Inc., the pharmaceutical company.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors say an advantage of genotypic testing is the simplicity of the
results.
</P>
<P>
	   "The person's virus is grown in a culture and then put into a test tube with
each antiviral drug," Cohen said. "We monitor to see how well it grows. If it
stops growing, that drug works. It's that simple."
</P>
<P>
	   The new test costs $800 per patient. Screening the genetic mutations in HIV
to figure out drug resistance has been around longer and costs about $400 to
$500 per patient.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors say that trying to understand how well drugs will work by analyzing
viral genes can be daunting when the virus is resistant to several drugs.
Sometimes resistance to one pill can help the virus withstand another, even
though it does not specifically have resistance to that medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   "Phenotypic resistance testing will be attractive because it is so much
easier to interpret," said Dr. Douglas D. Richman of the University of
California at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
	   To check the test's value, Cohen's team studied 274 patients who had failed
to respond to an initial round of AIDS drugs. Half were randomly assigned to
receive phenotypic testing, while the rest got standard care without testing.
</P>
<P>
	   After 16 weeks, 58 percent of the patients getting phenotypic testing had
responded so well to their new combination of drugs that the virus had fallen
too low to measure. By comparison, 37 percent of those without testing did this
well.
</P>
<P>
	   "Until this study, all of this was reasonable but unproven," Cohen said.
"Now we can prove it."

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks fell steeply today after the latest
economic report from Washington left little question in investors' minds that
the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this week.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index, the best
performing major index in 1999, was down 67.16 at 3,819.91, adding to its

	   The latest sign that sharply higher interest rates may be needed to slow the
nation's runaway economic growth came today from the Commerce Department. The
department said personal income, which includes wages, interest and government
benefits, increased by 0.3 percent last month. That was weaker than many
analysts were expecting.
</P>
<P>
	   But the department also said spending rose a brisk 0.8 percent, helping to
push the personal savings rate to an all-time low. Feverish consumer spending
has been a major driver of the economic boom.
</P>
<P>
	   "Over the past few weeks, investors have become progressively more nervous
about the strong economy," said John H. Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist
at Advest Inc., who expects the Fed to raise rates this week, and again in March
and in May.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaughnessy said interest rate worries are likely to dominate trading until
the economy shows some sign of slowing down.
</P>
<P>
	   "Looking ahead, we are going to have to deal with a very volatile stock
market," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   After slumping at the opening bell, the Dow moved higher on the strength of
General Motors, up 3 to 82, and J.P. Morgan, up 3 11/16 to 121 3/4.
</P>
<P>
	   Most analysts had expected the Dow to fare better today after Friday's
289-point drop, which capped a week of heavy losses for the blue-chip index.
Hewlett-Packard, down 2 9/16 at 106 3/16, and Microsoft, which fell 2 5/8 to 95
5/8, contained the Dow's advance.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, Broadvision, a maker of software for electronic commerce,
fell 14 15/16 to 118 1/2. Biogen, which ran up sharply last week, fell 10 3/8 to
81 5/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-8 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 586.51 million shares, well behind Friday's
pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies tumbled 12.11 to 492.51.

<HEADLINE> Spending Up More Than Income  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans went on a buying binge in December, capping a
year where spending outpaced income and took its biggest leap since 1989. That
pushed the nation's savings rate to an annual low.
</P>
<P>
	   Spending rose 0.8 percent last month, the fastest pace since August, the
Commerce Department said Monday. Consumers' burst of buying, in line with many
analysts' expectations, helped give retailers their best year since 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Spending rose a bigger-than-expected 0.8 percent last month, the fastest
pace since August, the Commerce Department said today.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, Americans' personal income, which includes wages, interest
and government benefits, increased by a smaller-than-expected 0.3 percent,
dragged down by much smaller federal subsidy payments to farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, spending rose 6.9 percent, the fastest pace in 10 years
while income rose 5.9 percent to match the increase posted in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   With plentiful jobs, rising incomes, low inflation and stock market gains,
Americans are feeling wealthy and in the mood to buy, economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   Because Americans are spending more than they earned, the personal savings
rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income -- was pulled to an all-time
annual low of 2.4 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   For December, the savings rate hit a monthly low of 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The savings rate had dipped to record monthly lows, in negative territory,
several times in 1999. But a comprehensive overhaul late last year in how the
government calculates the gross domestic product -- the total output of the
country's goods and services -- has pushed the savings rate into positive
territory. The revisions showed that Americans are saving more than previously
thought.
</P>
<P>
	   The record low savings numbers posted for December and for the year,
however, aren't as dire as they seem, economists said. That's because the rate
doesn't represent Americans' personal wealth, which would involve calculating
the gains households have realized on their savings in previous months from such
things as rising stock market values and higher real estate values for their
homes.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're a nation of spendthrifts. We always have been, and that's probably
not going to change. But the situation is not as bad as it seems because of the
way the savings rate is calculated," said Richard Yamarone, economist with Argus
Research Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Hardy consumer spending has been the engine behind the economy's rapid
growth. The economy grew at a sizzling 5.8 percent annual rate in the last three
months of 1999 and 4 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Most economists believe the Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates
three times last year, will bump them up again on Wednesday in an effort to slow
the economy and keep inflation low. Economists fear that the economy's rapid
pace of growth can't be sustained without producing a sharp run-up in consumer
prices.
</P>
<P>
	   The sharp advance in December's spending reflected a 1.3 percent increase in
purchases of nondurable goods, such as food and fuel. Spending on durable goods
-- big-ticket manufactured items expected to last at least three years, such as
washing machines and cars -- rose 0.8 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
	   Wages, meanwhile, rose by a solid 0.7 percent in December and 6.8 percent
for the year.
</P>
<P>
	   "This report confirms the fact that households have the money to spend, and
they are doing just that," said economist Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic
Advisors.

<HEADLINE> 'Millionaire' Revives Family TV  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Much to their surprise, the McKinneys of Tulsa, Okla., have
found a new family gathering place -- in front of the TV set.
</P>
<P>
	   Three times a week, the family of four watches the same show -- ABC's quiz
craze, "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire." Everyone plays along. Four-year-old
Walker was especially delighted when he correctly completed the name of the
children's game "Duck-Duck-Goose."
</P>
<P>
	   It may be the most profound change wrought by the success of "Millionaire":
Experts say it has revived the concept of families watching TV together after a
decade's worth of forces pulling them apart.
</P>
<P>
	   Usually, TV time at the McKinneys means Walker and his 7-year-old sister,
Katie, watch Nickelodeon in the game room. Mom and Dad are elsewhere, watching
news or business on one of the home's three other sets.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's been really nice," said Melinda McKinney. "We probably watch more TV
than we should and we don't tend to watch it together. It's fun to be able to
actually enjoy something together."
</P>
<P>
	   Statistics bear out the broad-based popularity of "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire." During the week of Jan. 17, it was among the four favorite shows
of children ages 2 to 11, adults over 55 and everyone in between, according to
Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's very, very rare that you have a program like 'Millionaire' that
reaches every demographic group, where everybody watches together," said Larry
Hyams, ABC's chief researcher.
</P>
<P>
	   Family hour was once sacrosanct among broadcasters, a commitment to minimize
sex and violence between 8 and 9 p.m. Yet as adult-oriented fare gained a
foothold on cable in that hour, the promise crumbled. Shows like "Friends" and
"Beverly Hills 90210" stretched the bounds of family hour beyond recognition.
</P>
<P>
	   Broadcasters have succeeded in recent years in tailoring material to certain
groups to attract advertisers. NBC often targets wealthy, young adults without
kids. CBS doesn't want to offend its older audience. The WB seeks teen-age
girls, while UPN goes after teen-age boys.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, Americans have steadily stuffed their homes with more TVs.
Nielsen says four in 10 households now have three or more televisions. Only 15
percent had that many in 1980.
</P>
<P>
	   The result? Families scattered in different rooms watching different shows.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fialkovs, a family of four from Plantation, Fla., have five TV sets.
With two teen-agers, 13-year-old Jason and 11-year-old Sarah, it avoids
arguments.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet as often as they can, Harvey, Maria, Jason and Sarah watch "Millionaire"
to have some time together.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's what I give my life toward," Maria Fialkov said. "It's why I had
kids. 'Millionaire' is fun because we start talking about other things. It
stimulates other conversations."
</P>
<P>
	   The most people the Goederses of Lawrenceville, Ga., have crammed into a
room to watch the show is 14. Usually it's just Lisa and Shawn, with 8-year-old
Will and 5-year-old Perry.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every time it's on we're bathed and down in front of the TV set to watch
it," Lisa Goeders said.
</P>
<P>
	   The families all play along. Walker McKinney was able to answer a question
about Pokemon characters, something that would baffle many adults.
</P>
<P>
	   "Millionaire" is ridiculed for its simple early-round questions by some who
see it as the dumbing down of America. But that's one secret of its success.
</P>
<P>
	   "The questions are deliberately easy in the beginning, because you want to
get everybody into the show," said Michael Davies, executive producer.
</P>
<P>
	   The Goederses, Fialkovs and McKinneys all say that they must monitor what
their children watch, that there are too many programs inappropriate for
children. They say they wish there were more shows like "Millionaire" that
everyone can enjoy together.
</P>
<P>
	   There are signs television executives may be listening. This season's only
other breakout hit, Fox's "Malcolm in the Middle," is a fresh comedy about the
high jinks of a family of four boys.
</P>
<P>
	   Television being an imitative industry, it is likely there will be more
family comedies soon, much like "Millionaire" has unleashed a flood of game
shows. NBC's top entertainment executives have already said that establishing
new family shows is their top development priority.
</P>
<P>
	   Lisa Goeders welcomes that. She finds herself seeking out the board games
she once played, and wants to wrest her children away from Nintendo to play
ping-pong. Anything to promote group, instead of solitary, activity.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's the whole feeling you're getting back from 'Millionaire,"' she said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Announce Gun Safety Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's final budget proposal will include
$30 million to help local communities track gun violence and promote gun safety,
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuomo said the HUD-administered program, which needs congressional approval,
would fund local efforts to computerize the mapping of gun violence and chart
gun-related incidents in a community.
</P>
<P>
	   Funding would also go toward education and outreach programs to promote gun
safety, he said. The president is to announce his year 2001 budget proposal on
Feb. 7
</P>
<P>
	   Cuomo said the spending initiative was part of a three-track administration
campaign against gun violence, joining legislative efforts and possible
litigation against gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
	   On the legislative front, Clinton has proposed issuing photo ID licenses for
handgun purchases and has urged Congress to pass gun control legislation,
stalled in last year's session, that included background checks for gun show
purchases and child safety locks. He has also proposed $280 million in funds to
hire 500 new Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents and 1,000 new
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the administration has threatened a new national class-action
lawsuit to be filed through HUD's public housing projects against gunmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuomo said that lawsuit would go forward if the manufacturers do not settle
suits filed by 28 cities charging the makers with negligently allowing firearms
to fall into the hands of criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   He said a meeting with the manufacturers scheduled for Jan. 28 in Las Vegas
fell through when some companies voiced objections, and the parties are now
dealing individually with the gunmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuomo said public housing projects, often in urban areas with higher crime
rates, are particularly vulnerable to gun violence, which kills some 30,000
people a year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The problem has become so widespread and it is such a concern of the
American people and it was such a disappointment when nothing was done last year
that this Congress cannot afford not to address it,'' Cuomo said.

<HEADLINE> Mannesmann Considers Next Moves  </HEADLINE>
    By HANS GREIMEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Embattled German telecom Mannesmann AG is playing
down a surprise alliance between British rival Vodafone AirTouch PLC and French
telecom group Vivendi.
</P>
<P>
	   While the weekend deal came as an unexpected blow to Mannesmann, it was just
the latest in a series of outflanking maneuvers marshaled by both companies
since Vodafone launched its $152 billion hostile takeover bid for the German
company in November.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Vivendi deal assumed an extra edge of duplicity since Mannesmann had
been courting the French telecom for an alliance of its own as recently as
Saturday. What's more, the deal also outlined plans for carving up Mannesmann if
Vodafone's takeover attempt is successful.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann's supervisory board held what it described as informational
meeting on Vodafone's bid Monday, a week before Mannesmann shareholders must
decide whether to sell.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the meeting, Mannesmann reiterated it was still in negotiations
with AOL Europe, a move which might counterbalance Vodafone's Internet deal with
Vivendi. The weekend deal would create a 50-50 multi-access European Internet
portal and cooperation in mobile and fixed line telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
	   The company also emphasized that the Vodafone-Vivendi agreement only takes
effect if Vodafone's hostile takeover is successful, and that Mannesmann has not
ruled out continued talks with Vivendi.
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone acknowledged both sides have been engaged in a flurry of activity
lately trying to branch out with various telecom and Internet partnerships and
deals, but said that Mannesmann was trying to muddy the waters with too many
rumors.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ours was a real deal. That's the difference," said Vodafone spokesman Mike
Caldwell.
</P>
<P>
	   He declined to comment on a report in The Wall Street Journal that Vodafone
chief executive Chris Gent and Mannesmann chief Klaus Esser spoke over the
weekend about reaching a compromise.
</P>
<P>
	   One sticking point has been how much control Mannesmann shareholders will
have in the resulting company if they sell their shares. Vodafone's current
offer would give Mannesmann 47.2 percent of the outstanding shares. But Esser
has consistently held out for more, insisting at one point on a 58.5 percent
stake.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our door is still open to raising their stake to 49 percent, but certainly
not over 50 percent, which is what they're talking about," Caldwell said.
"There's a limited scope for negotiations."
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann spokesman Frank Zimmermann said reports of a compromise were pure
speculation and said the German firm was still looking for a stake
"significantly above 50 percent."
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann shares closed up 4.5 percent, or 12.05 euros, at 280.25 euros
($275.37) in Frankfurt trading, while Vodafone closed down 1.5 percent in
London, down 5.25 pence at 338.50 pence ($5.49), reflecting an overall drop in
London stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann has until Feb. 7 to line up its shareholders against Vodafone's
outstanding offer.

	   Japan Turns to Banks for Loans

<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan, already deeper in debt than any other
industrialized nation, is turning to banks rather than bonds to
cover a projected shortfall in what it owes municipalities. It's
unusual for a government to turn to bankers, as though for a
home-improvement loan, at least in part because the cost of the
money is likely to be higher. But Japan is already awash in bonds,
with politicians committed to spending their way out of the worst
economic downturn in 50 years, and there is concern that the market
might be saturated.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves Digital Mammograms  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's first digital mammograms -- computerized
breast X-rays to hunt breast cancer -- were approved by the government Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Digital mammograms appear as good as -- but not better than -- regular
mammograms in detecting breast cancer, the Food and Drug Administration
cautioned.
</P>
<P>
	   But the new digital mammography machine, GE Medical Inc.'s Senographe 2000D,
does offer potential advantages to regular film X-rays: Digital mammograms can
be stored electronically so films aren't lost, adjusted for under- or
overexposure without needing another X-ray, and sent electronically to
specialists worldwide for consultation.
</P>
<P>
	   Better, it is a long-awaited first step in using computers in even more
sophisticated ways to better detect breast cancer, said Dr. Daniel Kopans,
director of breast imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, who has helped
study the system.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This will open a new era in mammographic detection of breast cancer,'' he
said, describing a list of research that digital equipment will enable to move
forward. ``This is the first step and I've got my fingers crossed all these
things are going to pan out. This gives us the opportunity'' to try.
</P>
<P>
	   American women undergo some 30 million mammograms every year. The breast
X-ray is the gold standard in detecting breast cancer, particularly early
tumors.
</P>
<P>
	   But mammograms are not foolproof. Scientists have long hoped that
computerizing the images could improve them.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA approved essentially a first step in digital mammography, cautioned
radiologic devices chief Dr. Dan Schultz.
</P>
<P>
	   In studies of 625 women, a printout of the mammogram from the digital
machine was as effective in detecting breast cancer as standard film mammograms,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Radiologists read those printouts just as they read standard mammograms.
</P>
<P>
	   To utilize the machine's full digital capabilities, doctors wouldn't need a
printout -- ideally, they could check a computerized image on a video monitor.
But the FDA did not approve this ideal ``soft copy'' digital mammogram -- just
the printout version -- because GE Medical has not yet studied whether reading
from the video screen is as accurate, Schultz explained.
</P>
<P>
	   If that full digital capability is realized, doctors one day could have a
greater range to manipulate and improve the breast scans, he said. For example,
if one part of a woman's breast were particularly dense, the computer might
compensate to better check that spot.
</P>
<P>
	   Using digital equipment also will enable studies of whether injecting dyes
into the breast or devising computer-generated images of breast tissue from
different angles could better detect tumors, Kopans said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Just about everything we do is digital, and it's about time mammography
was also,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wisconsin-based GE Medical did not immediately return phone calls seeking
the machine's price and when sales would begin.

<HEADLINE> Congress Aids Electronic Food Stamps  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- People using electronic food stamp accounts could obtain
groceries in every state under legislation that passed the House on Monday and
goes to President Clinton for his signature.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill, which passed by voice vote, requires the Agriculture Department to
set national standards for electronic benefit transfer systems to allow food
stamp participants to redeem their benefits in neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly half of food stamp benefits are issued through electronic accounts,
but each state sets up its EBT system, which prevents out-of-state transactions.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the systems, a participant is issued a plastic card similar to a bank
debit card, along with a personal identification number to access the account.
Food stamp benefits are deposited electronically in the account each month.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill, authored by Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill., passed the Senate in
November. Fitzgerald said he acted because many families who live in East St.
Louis, Ill., and work in Missouri cannot buy groceries on their way home from
work because the two states have different EBT programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Across the country we find that people live in one state and shop in
another,'' said Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., sponsor of a companion bill in the
House.
</P>
<P>
	   Fitzgerald said making all food stamp benefits payable by electronic
accounts could save the government some $20 million a year.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE -- The bill number is S. 1733.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 143.96; Nasdaq Down 19.23  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks fell today after the latest economic
report from Washington left little question in investors' minds that the Federal
Reserve will raise interest rates this week. The Dow Jones industrials rose,
however, amid surprising strength from financial services shares.
</P>
<P>
	   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow was up
143.96 at 10,882.83, at its high for the day.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index, the best performing major index in 1999, was
down 19.23 at 3,867.84, adding to its 152-point drop on Friday. Earlier in the
session, the Nasdaq had dropped more than 120 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders said investors, concerned that higher interest rates will cut into
profit growth, were locking in gains from the Nasdaq's extraordinary gains in
1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 14.94 at 1,375.10.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading was fairly volatile as the Fed's Open Market Committee prepared to
meet in Washington Tuesday and Wednesday. Most economists expect the Fed to
raise interest rates a quarter percentage point, but some analysts are
forecasting a steeper increase.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest sign that sharply higher interest rates may be needed to slow the
nation's runaway economic growth came today from the Commerce Department. The
department said personal income, which includes wages, interest and government
benefits, increased by 0.3 percent last month. That was weaker than many
analysts were expecting.
</P>
<P>
	   But the department also said spending rose a brisk 0.8 percent, helping to
push the personal savings rate to an all-time low. Feverish consumer spending
has been a major driver of the economic boom.
</P>
<P>
	   "Over the past few weeks, investors have become progressively more nervous
about the strong economy," said John H. Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist
at Advest Inc., who expects the Fed to raise rates this week, and again in March
and in May.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaughnessy said interest rate worries are likely to dominate trading until
the economy shows some sign of slowing down.
</P>
<P>
	   "Looking ahead, we are going to have to deal with a very volatile stock
market," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   After slumping at the opening bell, the Dow moved higher on the strength of
General Motors, up 2 3/8 to 81 3/8, and J.P. Morgan, up 4 1/4 to 122 5/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, American Express rose 4 3/4 to 163. Traders said investors who were
moving their money out of highly priced technology stocks were seeking relative
bargains in sectors that were hammered last week, when the Dow tumbled 512.84
points to its lowest level since Nov. 11.
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft, which fell 2 5/8 to 95 5/8, was the weakest Dow component.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, Broadvision, a maker of software for electronic commerce,
fell 10 5/16 to 123 1/8. Biogen, which ran up sharply last week, fell 7 1/2 to
84 1/2.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-7 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 699.20 million shares, well behind Friday's
pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies tumbled 10.85 to 493.77.

<HEADLINE> Gov't. Plans Billions in Debt Cuts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government anticipates paying off $17 billion of the
national debt this quarter and expects to pay a record $152 billion in the
April-June quarter, the Treasury Department said today.
</P>
<P>
	   Retirement of a portion of the $5.7 trillion in national debt is occurring
because of record budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of fiscal year 1999, which ended Sept. 30, the government reported a
record surplus of $124.4 billion. That followed a $69.2 billion surplus in 1998,
the first time the government finished in the black since 1969.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration is predicting a $142.5 billion surplus for fiscal
2000. If a surplus materializes as expected, it would be the first time the
government reported three consecutive years of surpluses since 1947, 1948 and
1949.
</P>
<P>
	   For the current January-March quarter, the $17 billion of the national debt
that Treasury said the government expects to pay is bigger than an earlier
estimate of $12 billion.

<HEADLINE> Union Carbide Profits Up 40 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DANBURY, Conn. (AP) -- Union Carbide Corp. said today that its profits rose
40 percent in the fourth quarter because of strong sales and improved pricing in
chemicals and polymers.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income in the October-December period was $94 million, or 68 cents a
share, compared with $67 million, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier. Earnings
from the fourth quarter of 1998 included a gain from the settlement of a
licensing lawsuit of 31 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   The results soundly beat the 46 cents a share expected by analysts who were
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth-quarter sales were $1.55 billion, up 20 percent from $1.29 billion in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   William H. Joyce, Carbide's chairman and chief executive, said in a
statement accompanying the report that earnings for the year 2000 should be
higher than in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that "recent volatility in raw material prices, however, makes
first quarter forecasting difficult" and said income in the January-March
quarter likely will be lower than in the October-December period.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares were trading at $54.06 1/4, down 25 cents, in late afternoon on the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Union Carbide of Danbury, Conn., is merging with Dow Chemical, which is
based in Midland, Mich., to form the world's second-largest chemical company.
The merger has received stockholder approval but remains under review by
regulators.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, the company reported net income of $291 million, or $2.13 a
share, compared with $403 million, or $2.91 a share in 1998. The 1999 figure
includes a gain of $50 million from the settlement of litigation involving the
company's licensing business, and the 1998 figure includes a $189 million gain
from the settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales rose 4 percent to $5.87 billion from $5.66 billion in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Turk Leaders Target Militants  </HEADLINE>
   By SELCAN HACAOGLU Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey's military and civilian leaders pledged Monday
to wipe out a militant Islamic organization blamed for the torture killings of
dozens of people.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities have arrested 938 suspects in their 2-week-old campaign against
Hezbollah, a group committed to establishing an Islamic state in Turkey's
Kurdish-dominated southeast.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Security Council promised to ``carry on the operations until
the end,'' a statement issued after a seven-hour meeting said.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey's Hezbollah is not related to the Lebanese-based group of the same
name.
</P>
<P>
	   Police on Monday found the bodies of two more presumed victims of Hezbollah
in the southern sea resort of Antalya and the southeastern city of Diyarbakir.
</P>
<P>
	   Police have found 48 corpses so far across Turkey, along with what appears
to be the bones of two more victims.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the bodies have been dug up in basements and gardens of Hezbollah
hideouts around the country. Newspapers have reported that many of the victims
were savagely tortured; authorities reportedly have confiscated Hezbollah videos
of some torture sessions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No doubt that those like (Hezbollah), who dream of achieving their dirty
aims by exploiting the pure religious beliefs of our people, will receive the
necessary punishment they deserve before Turkish justice,'' the council said.
</P>
<P>
	   The military and civilian leaders warned state officials and ordinary
citizens to be vigilant against the group and the many other radical Islamic
organizations active in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities expect to uncover more bodies in the continuing crackdown. Those
detained so far include Muslim clergy, state officials and at least one mayor of
the Islamic Virtue Party.
</P>
<P>
	   The military has accused Virtue -- currently defending itself against
prosecutors' attempts to shut it down for alleged anti-secular activities -- of
supporting radical Islam. The party has denied any links with radical groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities have seized scores of automatic weapons, rocket launchers, hand
grenades and a mortar from Hezbollah hideouts.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Monday's Hurriyet daily, the group was smuggling guns, hidden
in frozen carcasses of cows and sheep, from Iran and Lebanon. Authorities have
accused Iran of backing the group -- an accusation rejected by Tehran.
</P>
<P>
	   The council condemned allegations aired in Turkey's media that the state
helped train Hezbollah to fight Kurdish rebels, who have been battling the
Turkish army for autonomy in the southeast.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Efforts to link the state with this murderous organization are considered
(an attempt) to protect and hide the real culprits,'' it said.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Sink on S. American News  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Heavy rains in South America sent soybean futures plummeting
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade in a heavy selloff that also dragged grain
prices lower.
</P>
<P>
	   After soaking neighboring Argentina over the weekend, substantial rain fell
Monday on much of Brazil -- the world's No. 2 soybean producer. An estimated 70
percent of Brazil received 1 to 2 inches of rain, according to reports, and new
forecasts called for more showers in both countries through the week.
</P>
<P>
	   The wet weather touched off a wave of selling by commodity funds, which had
pushed up soybean prices ever since a dry stretch began several months ago. It
lessened the prospects of significant drought damage to South American crops
that are shaping up as extremely large.
</P>
<P>
	   South American corn crops also were doused by the rains, contributing to a
selling mood for that commodity.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat prices dipped lower after substantial precipitation struck most of the
U.S. winter wheat belt over the weekend, and soybeans' slide prevented any
comeback later in the session.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat for March delivery fell 3 1/2 cents to $2.56 1/4 a bushel; March corn
fell 3 1/2 cents to $2.20 a bushel; March oats fell 1 1/2 cents to $1.12 a
bushel; March soybeans fell 15 1/2 cents to $5.08 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   Beef and pork futures were higher on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   April live cattle rose .48 cent to 72.05 cents a pound; March feeder cattle
rose .58 cent to 85.35 cents a pound; April lean hogs rose .48 cent to 60.25
cents a pound; February pork bellies rose 1.65 cents to 88.95 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves Digital Mammograms  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's first digital mammograms -- computerized
breast X-rays to hunt breast cancer -- were approved by the government Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Digital mammograms appear as good as -- but not better than -- regular
mammograms in detecting breast cancer, the Food and Drug Administration
cautioned.
</P>
<P>
	   But the new digital mammography machine, GE Medical Inc.'s Senographe 2000D,
does offer potential advantages to regular film X-rays: Digital mammograms can
be stored electronically so films aren't lost, adjusted for under- or
overexposure without needing another X-ray, and sent electronically to
specialists worldwide for consultation.
</P>
<P>
	   Better, it is a long-awaited first step in using computers in even more
sophisticated ways to better detect breast cancer, said Dr. Daniel Kopans,
director of breast imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, who has helped
study the system.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This will open a new era in mammographic detection of breast cancer,'' he
said, describing a list of research that digital equipment will enable to move
forward. ``This is the first step and I've got my fingers crossed all these
things are going to pan out. This gives us the opportunity'' to try.
</P>
<P>
	   American women undergo some 30 million mammograms every year. The breast
X-ray is the gold standard in detecting breast cancer, particularly early
tumors.

<HEADLINE> 3 Israeli Soldiers Killed in Ambush  </HEADLINE>
   By BUTROS WANNA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) -- Dealing Israel a second blow in as many days in
south Lebanon, Hezbollah guerrillas on Monday ambushed an Israeli patrol,
killing three soldiers and wounding four.
</P>
<P>
	   The attack came a day after the guerrillas killed a senior commander in an
Israeli-allied militia in south Lebanon, where Israel has maintained a
self-declared security zone since 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak announced Monday evening that peace talks
with Syria - the main power in Lebanon -- would not resume until Damascus reined
in the guerrillas. The Israel-Syria talks, which resumed in December after a
nearly four-year freeze, had been indefinitely postponed earlier after two
inconclusive rounds.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the Lebanese security officials, the guerrillas fired
rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns at Israeli soldiers who were
patrolling a road just north of the Israeli border and about seven miles
southwest of Marjayoun, the main town in the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
	   An Israeli military spokesman confirmed that three soldiers were killed,
including one officer. Four others were wounded, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the attack, Hezbollah released a statement saying its fighters
staged a ``daring attack deep in the occupied zone,'' targeting Israeli
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel retatliated with four airstrikes on guerrilla positions Monday, the
Lebanese officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. They gave no
immediate reports of Lebanese casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Monday, thousands of people turned out to mourn Col. Akl Hashem, a
senior commander of the South Lebanon Army militia who was killed in a Hezbollah
bombing Sunday. Israel's Deputy Defense Minister, Ephraim Sneh, and senior
Israeli generals were among those who paid their respects to the slain
commander.
</P>
<P>
	   Hashem, considered the No. 2 man in the Israeli-allied militia, was buried
Monday with full military honors in his hometown of Dibel, where he was killed.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Said Risk With Weak Euro  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL AMES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European finance ministers today insisted the
euro's tumble to record lows against the dollar is only temporary, but the chief
European central banker warned of inflation risks if the currency's weakness
lingers.
</P>
<P>
	   Ministers of the 11 countries that adopted the euro as their single currency
predicted a robust economic recovery in Europe will soon be pushing the euro
upwards.
</P>
<P>
	   "The euro has potential for appreciation, firmly based on growth and
internal price stability," the ministers said in a joint statement with the
European Central Bank. "A strong economy goes along with a strong currency."
</P>
<P>
	   However the ministers disappointed currency traders who had been hoping for
more than jawboning to buoy-up the 13-month-old currency, which hit a new low of
97.38 U.S. cents on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Ministers at the European Union meeting took care not to encourage
speculation about an imminent interest-rate rise or market intervention by the
European Central Bank to prop up the euro.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the euro rose above 98 cents in Asian trading before the EU
meeting, it slipped again to a late rate Monday of 97.84 cents in European
trading.
</P>
<P>
	   European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg warned that persistent euro
weakness might increase the risk of higher inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   If the euro buys fewer dollars and Japanese yen, then European consumers
would have to pay more for imports and to travel overseas. But a weak euro also
means European goods are less costly, and therefore more competitive, on global
markets.
</P>
<P>
	   "A continuous weakness of the external value of the euro would pose a risk
to our objective to maintain internal price stability," Duisenberg told
reporters as he left the ministers' meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   EU data released last week revealed inflation in the so-called euro-zone
rose to 1.7 percent in December, creeping close to the ECB's maximum target
level of 2 percent. Most ministers dismissed the higher-than-expected increase
as a glitch triggered by rapidly rising oil prices. They stressed wages and
consumer prices remained under control.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are faced with the prospect of noninflationary economic growth," said
Portuguese Finance Minister Joaquim Pina Moura, who chaired the euro-zone talks
and a meeting later of finance ministers from all 15-EU nations.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro's latest battering came mainly in anticipation that the U.S.
Federal Reserve will raise its short-term interest rates this week and perhaps
again later this year. Longer-term doubts about the commitment of European
governments to pro-market reforms, and contradictory statements from
policy-makers have also been blamed for driving down the euro.
</P>
<P>
	   Euro-zone ministers Monday were united in underscoring their faith in
Europe's economy.
</P>
<P>
	   "The strength of European growth, the dynamism of the European economy,
sooner or later will be reflected by the euro," French Finance Minister
Christian Sautter told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   "Growth in the euro-zone is strong and getting stronger all the time," Pina
Moura added.

<P>
	   The Treasury Department sold $7.5 billion in three-month bills at a discount
rate of 5.560 percent, up from 5.385 percent last week. An additional $6.5
billion was sold in six-month bills at a rate of 5.705 percent, up from 5.520
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-month rate was the highest since June 12, 1995, when the bills
sold for 5.57 percent. The six-month rate also was the highest since that date
when the rate was 5.72.
</P>
<P>
	   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 5.731
percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,859.50 and
5.972 percent for a six-month bill selling for $9,711.60.
</P>
<P>
	   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making changes in
adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 6.17 percent last week from 6.13 percent the
previous week.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Groups Urge Phone Fee Cuts  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Leading consumer groups said Monday they have devised a
way to slash $4 billion a year from home and business telephone bills -- even
for people who make few long-distance calls.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal, submitted to the Federal Communications Commission, would
reduce one line-item charge that consumers now see on their monthly bills and
eliminate another.
</P>
<P>
	   The coalition of groups backing the plan, including Consumers Union, the
Consumer Federation of America, the National Retail Federation and AARP, say the
innovation would take several dollars off the bottom of every home and business
phone bill.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This would guarantee that every consumer, regardless of how much calling
they do, would get the benefit of declining industry costs,'' said Gene
Kimmelman, co-director of Consumers Union's Washington office.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal responds to a plan offered by the phone industry this summer to
reduce by $5.6 billion a year ``access'' fees that local phone companies charge
long-distance carriers to connect calls.
</P>
<P>
	   If long-distance companies pass on the savings, the companies contended,
their customers would see lower rates. In turn, certain flat-rate fees on local
phone bills would go up. Backers of the industry proposal, which has been
submitted to the FCC for consideration, include Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, GTE,
SBC, AT&AMP;T and Sprint.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer advocates have argued against the industry plan on the ground that
it contains no guarantee that long-distance companies will pass on the savings
to consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if the rates do fall slightly, that wouldn't offset the increases in
monthly fees, said Kimmelman. He said most people don't make enough
long-distance calls to benefit from rates going down if the fixed charges go up
significantly at the same time.
</P>
<P>
	   The consumer plan would take $1 off the cost of the phone line from the
local phone company into the home. That charge, identified on monthly bills as
the Subscriber Line Charge, is now capped at $3.50 a month.
</P>
<P>
	   The consumer proposal also would get rid of another charge, which pays for
long-distance companies' use of the local phone network. That item varies by
company but averages about $1.50 per month.
</P>
<P>
	   The phone companies can afford the cut if they recover costs from customers
more in line with their actual expenses, said Mark Cooper, research director of
Consumer Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
	   Cooper said consumers will save even more over the course of the next four
years as regulators continue to cut access charges to reflect local phone
companies' connection costs better. This should lead to lower per-minute
long-distance rates for customers, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The industry coalition immediately rebuked the consumer plan as
shortsighted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They want to issue price controls to drive savings for consumers, when the
clear trend is to use the marketplace to drive savings for consumers,'' said
John Nakahata, a lawyer with the Washington firm Harris, Wiltshire &AMP; Grannis,
who represents the companies.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that the industry proposal contains a provision to keep local phone
service affordable to poor people and customers living in rural areas, while the
consumer plan does not.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're just abandoning rural America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC put out the industry plan for comment last year, but has said it is
interested in hearing from consumer groups.

<HEADLINE> Belo Earnings Up 5 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DALLAS (AP) -- A.H. Belo Corp., publisher of The Dallas Morning News,
reported a 5 percent increase in fourth-quarter earnings today, slightly beating
Wall Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   Belo earned $26.9 million, or 23 cents a share, in the last three months of
1999, not including one-time gains and charges. That compared to $25.6 million,
or 21 cents a share, in the same quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had forecast earnings of
22 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Including one-time items such as gains from a stake in Falcon cable and two
television stations, Belo's net earnings were $69.4 million, or 58 cents a
share, compared to $11.7 million, or 10 cents a share, in the year-ago period,
when the company took a major charge for an early-retirement program.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues rose 5.4 percent, to $395.2 million from $374.8 million in the
year-ago period. Newspaper revenues rose 7.7 percent and broadcasting revenues
gained 2.4 percent. Internet earnings more than doubled to $1.9 million.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, Belo reported operating earnings of 73 cents a share, which
beat analysts scaled-back expectations by a penny. In 1998, the company earned
63 cents a share. Revenues for the year edged up to $1.17 billion from $1.16
billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert W. Decherd, Belo's chairman and chief executive, said the company
expects a good year in 2000 because of political advertising, the summer
Olympics on its NBC stations and the Super Bowl on its ABC stations. He
predicted that the downturn in classified employment advertising in The Dallas
Morning News would end this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Belo publishes eight daily newspapers and owns 16 television stations and
five local cable systems.

<HEADLINE> U.K. Doctor Guilty of 15 Murders  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRESTON, England (AP) -- Jurors convicted a family doctor on Monday of
murdering 15 female patients, injecting the middle-aged and elderly women with
lethal doses of heroin.
</P>
<P>
	   Harold Shipman, who now ranks among Britain's most prolific modern-day
serial killers, was sentenced to 15 life sentences -- the maximum punishment in
Britain, which has no death penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators said he may have killed dozens more patients.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You are a wicked, wicked man,'' Preston Crown Court Judge Thayne Forbes
told Shipman, who remained impassive.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have little doubt that each of your victims smiled and thanked you as
she submitted to your fearful administrations,'' Forbes added.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctor, who altered medical records at his one-man practice in northern
England to cover up his crimes, also was found guilty of forging the $620,000
will of his last victim, 81-year-old Kathleen Grundy. He was sentenced to four
years for that offense.
</P>
<P>
	   Shipman, 54, enters British crime history alongside other notorious killers
such as the Yorkshire Ripper, convicted in 1981 of murdering 13 women and
attempting to kill seven others.
</P>
<P>
	   South Manchester Coroner John Pollard said police investigated up to 136
deaths of other Shipman patients, and news reports said 23 more murder charges
may be filed. State prosecutor Robert Davies said he was considering other
murder charges but did not say how many.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said Shipman killed because he enjoyed ``exercising the ultimate
power of controlling life and death.''
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators said his multiple murders came to an end only because Grundy's
daughter, a lawyer, became suspicious about the will. It arrived the day Grundy
was found dead in her house and left her entire estate to Shipman, in supposed
recognition of his work for the community.
</P>
<P>
	   During his testimony, Shipman claimed that some of the women had hidden
health problems. He also said Grundy may have been a drug addict, accounting for
the high level of heroin in her blood.
</P>
<P>
	   Five months before his arrest, police had abandoned an investigation
prompted by another doctor who became worried about how often Shipman asked his
practice to provide a second signature on cremation certificates. Only one
doctor's signature is required on other death certificates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The records looked all right, but we now know that was because Dr. Shipman
had altered them with a view to covering his tracks,'' Detective Supt. Bernard
Postles said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shipman went on to kill three more patients.
</P>
<P>
	   After the verdict, police reported that Shipman became addicted to
pethidine, a drug used to ease labor pains, as a young doctor 25 years ago and
was convicted of forging prescriptions. He was allowed to return to practice 18
months later.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctor's wife, Primrose, who was also his receptionist, hurried from the
court after the sentencing. She was accompanied by the couple's daughter and two
of their three sons.
</P>
<P>
	   Shipman prided himself on making home visits, and his 3,000-patient practice
had a waiting list.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is very sad ... because he was so well-liked,'' said Margaret Walker,
who knew several of the victims. ``There are still some who are very fond of him
as a doctor.''

<HEADLINE> No Confidence Vote Debated in Israel  </HEADLINE>
   By MARK LAVIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Embattled Prime Minister Ehud Barak faced a no
confidence vote in parliament Monday over his party's campaign finances, sparked
by a report accusing his closest associates of running a backroom
money-laundering system to win Israel's election last May.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak's government was in no danger of falling, but the blow to his
credibility could limit his room to maneuver in peace negotiations with Syria
and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
	   After the debate was well underway, the vote was put off until next week
following an announcement that three Israeli soldiers were killed Monday by
Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   Opposition Likud leader Ariel Sharon told the parliament the scandal has
undermined Barak's credibility in the peace process, including his pledge not to
divide Jerusalem with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Barak is dividing Jerusalem. Either he knows or he doesn't know,'' Sharon
said, a mocking allusion to Barak's claim that he was not aware of the millions
of dollars poured into his campaign by extra fund-raising groups.
</P>
<P>
	   The scandal could undercut Barak's ability to deal with Syria and the
Palestinians, and may make it harder for him to muster a referendum majority on
an eventual peace treaty, which would likely involve painful compromises for
Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   Police set up teams to investigate the findings of the report by State
Comptroller Eliezer Goldberg, which found election financing irregularities in
five party operations, but focused on One Israel, Barak's party, pointing to
systematic, large-scale violations.
</P>
<P>
	   The report heaped criticism on Cabinet Secretary Yitzhak Herzog, finding
that he used a trust fund of a dead Swiss millionaire, Octav Botnar, to funnel
illicit funds into Barak's campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Charging that Barak's party ``trampled the law,'' Goldberg wrote that
through Botnar's estate and other funds he administered, Herzog became a
backroom off-the-books financier for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to One Israel parliament members Monday, Barak said the party acted
according to a proper interpretation of the law. ``Even if there were mistakes
here and there, they were made without criminal intent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet Goldberg said it was not enough for Barak to give instructions to his
henchmen to follow the law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He should have shown interest in what was going on in the field,'' said
the report.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Students, Opponents Clash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Striking university students clashed with opponents
Monday, throwing rocks and fists as the anti-strike group broke through a
barricade at a campus in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
	   Law students and faculty tore past the barricade of wire, poles, tires and
debris to confront strikers who have occupied Mexico's 280,000-student National
Autonomous University since April.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let's go. Together, the community and the law faculty, we will lift the
strike,'' law professor Othon Perez Fernandez shouted to dozens of
anti-strikers, who responded ``Yes,'' then rushed the blockade.
</P>
<P>
	   The two sides scuffled in an open plaza before Perez Fernandez fainted and
had to be withdrawn by his supporters. He was taken for medical care but his
condition was not known, the Radio Red network reported.
</P>
<P>
	   One person was detained, the report added.
</P>
<P>
	   Confrontations between the two sides have escalated in recent days as the
anti-strike side has rallied students to challenge strikers.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Juan Ramon de la Fuente, rector of the university, delivered
results of a referendum showing nearly 90 percent of teachers and students
support his proposal to end the walkout.
</P>
<P>
	   Strike leaders have rejected the results as irrelevant and fraudulent. They
have called for negotiations to resume, but de la Fuente has demanded campuses
reopen first.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike began in April to protest plans to raise annual tuition from a
few cents to $140. Administrators withdrew the fee increase, but students later
demanded sweeping policy changes.

<HEADLINE> EU Threatens To Cut Austria Ties  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE JAHN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- The European Union warned Monday it would take the
unprecedented step of severing most political contacts with any Austrian
government that includes a far-right party whose leader has praised aspects of
Adolph Hitler's regime.
</P>
<P>
	   The warning followed a series of verbal attacks by Joerge Haider on the
leaders of France and Belgium for opposing any role for his party in the
Austrian government. The center-right Austrian People's Party has been holding
talks with Haider's populist anti-immigration Freedom Party, which finished
second in inconclusive elections in October.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider shrugged off the EU's warning, saying it was his critics -- and not
himself -- who were antidemocratic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am somewhat horrified how lightly one takes democracy in a country such
as Austria,'' Haider said Monday, describing the warnings as ``an attempt to
take influence from the outside'' on Austria's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   If the Freedom Party becomes part of a governing coalition, the 14 other
European Union members would curtail bilateral contacts with Vienna, oppose
Austrian appointments to international organizations and keep contacts with
Austrian ambassadors to a minimum, said an EU statement issued in Lisbon,
Portugal.
</P>
<P>
	   The threat signaled EU determination not only to combat what it feels are
undemocratic developments in a member country but also to send a message to
other right-wing groups that they would not be tolerated in a politically
leading role.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider won international notoriety a decade ago after praising Hitler's
``orderly employment policy,'' and later for lauding veterans of the Waffen SS
as ``decent people of good character.'' Since then, he has apologized for those
statements.
</P>
<P>
	   After the EU's warning, Austria's top diplomat to the European Union, Gregor
Woschnagg, left Brussels, Belgium, the EU capital, for Vienna. His
representatives denied the move was in response to the threat, saying the trip
had been planned in advance.
</P>
<P>
	   Just hours earlier, Haider expressed regret over his sharp criticism of
French and Belgian leaders but said they must respect the outcome of elections
that propelled his party to national prominence.
</P>
<P>
	   Prior to a meeting with Austrian President Thomas Klestil, Haider said he
wanted ``no conflict with Belgium and France,'' although he had called the
Belgian government ``corrupt'' and said French President Jacques Chirac was
ignorant of Austrian politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Klestil, in a statement after meeting Haider, said he had urged him to
temper his language.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Monday, Haider told reporters he expected negotiations with the
Austrian People's Party of Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel to be wrapped up
perhaps Tuesday so the new center-right coalition could assume power.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed coalition between the Freedom Party and the People's Party
would control 104 seats in the 183-member parliament, and would likely have
Schuessel as its chancellor.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Defies U.S. on bin Laden  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) -- The president of Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
militia vowed Monday not to be pressured by the United States to turn over
accused terrorist Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
	   Addressing hundreds of students at an Islamic religious school in Pakistan's
northern border town of Akora Khattak, some 30 miles from Peshawar, Mullah
Mohammed Rabbani accused the West, led by the United States, of uniting against
the Muslim world to dictate terms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But we will not surrender or be intimidated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rabbani, who is president of the Taliban's leadership council, was in
Pakistan on an official visit, which will include a meeting Tuesday with
Pakistan's army ruler Gen. Pervez Musharraf and President Rafiq Tarar.
</P>
<P>
	   The backbone of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan is made up of graduates
of religious schools in Pakistan, many of them in the country's deeply
conservative Northwest Frontier Province, which borders Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
	   Rabbani referred specifically to the U.N. and U.S. sanctions against the
Taliban, who rule 90 percent of Afghanistan. They are fighting a northern-based
opposition on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations imposed limited sanctions against the Taliban last Nov.
14 to press the orthodox militia to hand over bin Laden for trial in the United
States or a third country on charges of terrorism. Washington banned all trade
and investment.
</P>
<P>
	   Rabbani said the sanctions have had little effect in Afghanistan, a country
battered by 20 years of war.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are not dying of hunger. The sanctions have made no difference to our
lives,'' Rabbani said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan is one of only three countries to recognize the Taliban government
in Afghanistan and is considered one of its strongest supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has pressed Pakistan to use its influence to have the
Taliban hand over bin Laden, who has been living in Afghanistan since 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no official word from either Pakistan or Afghanistan whether the
issue of bin Laden will be raised in meetings between Rabbani and Pakistani
leaders.

<HEADLINE> Russians Claim Advance in Grozny  </HEADLINE>
   By LYOMA TURPALOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALKHAN-YURT, Russia (AP) -- Russian forces pushed into a key square in the
capital of rebel Chechnya on Monday after more than a week of intense battles
with snipers firing from high-rise buildings, Russian officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sergei Yastrzembsky, acting President Vladimir Putin's spokesman for the
Chechnya war, said federal forces were in control of a third of Grozny's Minutka
Square in the afternoon, but Russian television reports later said the square
was completely under their control.
</P>
<P>
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed. Defense Ministry officials
could not be reached for comment Monday evening, and Russia previously has made
premature claims of controlling sections of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   But any Russian advance into the square could be a significant boost to the
campaign to take the capital.
</P>
<P>
	   ``After taking this square, I can say that we can totally control the
city,'' a Russian commander, Yevgeny Kurkarin, said on the NTV channel. The
square is adjacent to several of Grozny's main thoroughfares and could be a
staging point for a drive into the center.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian advance came under withering sniper fire from rebels in battered
high-rise buildings along the streets that approach the square -- attacks that
sometimes brought the Russian drive to a standstill. Rebels elsewhere in the
city have put up fierce resistance, and the rebel command shows no sign of
backing down.
</P>
<P>
	   Yastrzhembsky said Monday that about 140 guerrillas had surrendered in
Grozny in recent days, but the figure was questioned by a leader of the
Kremlin-backed Chechen State Council, Malik Saidullayev.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As far as I know there were 57 of them,'' Saidullayev said, according to
the news agency Interfax, adding ``it will take rather a long time'' to overrun
Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a senior Taliban commander told The Associated Press in the
Afghan capital of Kabul that a group of reinforcements went to Chechnya about 20
days ago. The Taliban militia, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan, had
previously denied Russian allegations that the regime was sending fighters to
Chechnya. The commander spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   In the face of Western criticism, Russia has justified its nearly
5-month-long ground assault in Chechnya as necessary to wipe out Islamic
militants it identifies as terrorists. Russian officials have often cited a
Taliban connection.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in Moscow on Monday, called
Russia's military campaign ``an incredible act of misery'' that would not
extinguish terrorism. But Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov responded that
Moscow had to move firmly against terrorism and that no one has come up with an
effective recipe other than force.
</P>
<P>
	   The offensive clearly is wearing on Russian forces and stretching their
resources. A Russian officer told The Associated Press on Monday that troops
have begun blowing up roads in Chechnya because there aren't enough soldiers to
man sufficient checkpoints to control rebel movements.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia also is fighting rebels in the southern mountains of Chechnya, where
fighters can take shelter in steep, trackless gorges and mount hit-and-run
attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite inclement weather, Russian warplanes and helicopters flew more than
110 combat missions over the past 24 hours, the military command said Monday.
Targets included the Argun and Vedeno gorges in the southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   No overall casualty report was issued Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Military officials reported, however, that a highly decorated commander of a
Russian helicopter regiment was killed Saturday as he was flying to pick up
paratroopers near the southern village of Shatoi. Col. Nikolai Maydanov, 43,
died after rebels fired on his helicopter and hit him in the neck.
</P>
<P>
	   Moscow sent troops into Chechnya in September after an invasion by
Chechen-based militants into the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan in
August, and a series of deadly apartment bombings elsewhere in Russia that were
blamed on Chechens.

</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 34.30 to 1,394.46, and the Nasdaq composite

	   Stocks rose today on a surprising wave of strength from bank and brokerage
stocks. American Express and J.P. Morgan led the Dow's advance.
</P>
<P>
	   Those stocks typically falter when investors are worried about rising
interest rates. But after sending most financial stocks lower last week,
investors today opted to punish highly priced technology stocks. And with market
enthusiasm still running fairly high, many investors turned back to financial
shares as relative bargains, traders said.

the technology sector. The Nasdaq composite fell as much as 120 points and
appeared likely to extend its 152-point plunge on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   But the technology-dominated index turned around due partially to a steep
gain by Qualcomm, its best performing stock in 1999. Qualcomm has slumped in
recent sessions, and at its lowered price, may now be more appealing to buyers,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>

	   Trading was volatile as the Fed's Open Market Committee prepared to meet in
Washington Tuesday and Wednesday. Most economists expect the Fed to raise
interest rates a quarter percentage point, but some analysts are forecasting a
steeper increase.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest sign that sharply higher interest rates may be needed to slow the
nation's runaway economic growth came today from the Commerce Department. The
department said personal income, which includes wages, interest and government
benefits, increased by 0.3 percent last month. That was weaker than many
analysts were expecting.
</P>
<P>
	   But the department also said spending rose a brisk 0.8 percent, helping to
push the personal savings rate to an all-time low. Feverish consumer spending
has been a major driver of the economic boom.
</P>
<P>
	   "Over the past few weeks, investors have become progressively more nervous
about the strong economy," said John H. Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist
at Advest Inc., who expects the Fed to raise rates this week, and again in March
and in May.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaughnessy said interest rate worries are likely to dominate trading until
the economy shows some sign of slowing down.
</P>
<P>
	   "Looking ahead, we are going to have to deal with a very volatile stock
market," he said.

<HEADLINE> 179 Aboard Kenya Airways Crash  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEXANDRA ZAVIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OFF THE IVORY COAST (AP) -- As dawn broke Monday across the inky waters of
the Atlantic, the men of the Artaban launched their ship into a nightmare.
Bodies surrounded them: men, women, children, limbs that had been torn away.
</P>
<P>
	   The remains floated amid the baggage, books and clothes of dozens of
passengers killed when Kenya Airways Flight 431 slammed into the sea. When the
corpse of a baby dressed in a purple dress bobbed past, face down, the ship's
commander Jean Pierre Athalys turned away in horror.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's too much,'' he muttered, as the tiny body was fished out and zipped
into a billowing, adult-sized body bag.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 10 people survived the disaster. By Monday evening, 86 bodies had
been brought to shore, rescue workers said, and most searchers had given up for
the night.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane, an Airbus 310, took off at 9:08 p.m. Sunday into overcast skies.
Destined for Lagos, Nigeria, it crashed into the ocean after only one minute in
the air, according to George Dapre Yao, the head of air traffic at Abidjan's
Felix Houphouet-Boigny Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Flight 431 carried 10 crew members and 169 passengers, officials said. It
originated Sunday in Nairobi, Kenya, and was to have landed in Lagos that
afternoon. But because of bad weather, it went on to Abidjan, Ivory Coast's main
commercial city.
</P>
<P>
	   The hulking Dutch-owned Artaban, which services oil rigs, was one of more
than a dozen vessels -- from military speed boats to fishing ships -- that set
out into the choppy waters around 11 p.m. in a spontaneous rescue effort.
</P>
<P>
	   With only the light beamed down by two helicopters to guide them, the ships
cut through the wreckage -- long streams of twisted metal, broken hunks of
plastic, battered suitcases and thin oil slicks carried along by the Atlantic
currents -- in an overwhelming, and an often terrifying darkness.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We had no visibility last night, but we could hear the screams of people
-- that was painful,'' fire department rescuer Tanoh Price told an Associated
Press reporter who spent much of Monday aboard the Artaban along with the crew,
French soldiers and members of other Ivorian rescue services.
</P>
<P>
	   The men on the Artaban were tough and stoic, unaccustomed to being
emotionally affected by their work. Many, despite the shell-shocked looks that
would wash over their faces when they'd see another horror, could only talk
about it in the most clinical terms.
</P>
<P>
	   But sometimes, it was just too much.
</P>
<P>
	   Three bodies were hauled onto the ship along with several severed limbs.
Finally, in the hours before dawn, a man was brought from the ocean alive, only
to roll over a few minutes later and die.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Enough to bring tears to my eyes,'' said Keith Francklin, a South African
diver among the predominantly French and Ivorian crew, shaking his head in
frustration.
</P>
<P>
	   Two survivors, a man and a woman, were later found clinging frantically to
wreckage three or four miles offshore, giving the crew its first surge of hope.
The woman, however, had blood pouring from a head wound, and the boat headed
back to port.
</P>
<P>
	   The next time out, a hazy sun shed light on the search, but the bodies and
wreckage had been spread by the current across three or four miles of ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   Crew members scanned the waters with binoculars, pointing excitedly when
they spotted anything that looked like a person.
</P>
<P>
	   This time, though, there were no survivors. They retrieved six bodies, some
only partially clad, using a long hook to grab the corpses' clothing. Two more
were collected from French soldiers who moved about in small speed boats.
</P>
<P>
	   The bodies were dropped off at the dock, where they were lined up in a long
row, their arms frozen in twisted gestures.
</P>
<P>
	   A Nigerian passenger rescued by another ship blamed some of the deaths on
the two hours it took rescuers to arrive.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they had come sooner, a lot of us would have been saved,'' Samuel
Ogbada Adje, wrapped in a blanket at Abidjan's port, said bitterly before being
pushed into an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
	   But Lt. Col. Blaise Grah, an Ivorian firefighting official, defended the
rescue effort.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Two hours, we believe, is a reasonable time, given the materials that had
to be gathered, the vastness of the ocean and the imprecise information we were
given'' about the wreckage's location.
</P>
<P>
	   What went wrong with the flight remained unclear Monday. Adje said the plane
had problems immediately after takeoff.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It wasn't quite balanced, and the next thing we knew we were in the
water,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Airline officials declined to speculate on a cause, but Kenya Airways
Technical Director Steve Clarke, speaking in Nairobi, said ``there were no
technical problems of any significance.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kenya Airways engineers and investigators were headed for the Ivory Coast
and Nigeria, Clark said, along with a team of Airbus engineers and three French
investigators.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the passengers were believed to have been Nigerians, Clarke said.
The route is popular among Nigerians heading to Dubai for duty-free shopping.

<HEADLINE> IRA Stalling Could Kill Government  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Northern Ireland's fledgling
Protestant-Catholic administration faces imminent suspension if the Irish
Republican Army doesn't agree to disarm, the senior Cabinet minister warned
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   David Trimble, Protestant leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, said Britain
might shut down the 8-week-old administration if -- as expected -- a report by
Northern Ireland's disarmament commission shows the Irish Republican Army has
failed to begin turning in its weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   London could suspend the four-party Cabinet, which includes the IRA-linked
Sinn Fein, and resume ``direct rule,'' the quasi-colonial system of governance
in force here from 1972 to last year, Trimble said.
</P>
<P>
	   The report is due to be presented by midnight to the British and Irish
governments and made public Tuesday, although there were rumors that it could be
delayed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It looks as though our risk-taking in accepting Sinn Fein has met no
response from the IRA,'' Trimble said. ``If so, it will become impossible to
sustain the administration and a return to direct rule will be inevitable. I
hope this will be temporary.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Ulster Unionists predicted that fallout from the disarmament report
could blow apart a careful compromise deal struck in November by American
mediator George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoping to achieve two long-elusive goals of 1998's Good Friday peace accord,
Mitchell persuaded the Ulster Unionists to form a Cabinet that included Sinn
Fein.
</P>
<P>
	   In response, the IRA was supposed to help the commission pinpoint and
eliminate the outlawed group's hidden weapons caches. Mitchell's plan specified
that the disarmament commission should report its progress in January as part of
the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Trimble has spent the past three years struggling against critics --
representatives of about half the Protestant electorate -- who have condemned
his past flexibility on the arms issue.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, Trimble won only narrow approval from his party's grassroots
council to form the Cabinet. As part of his sales pitch then to skeptical
supporters, he promised to reconvene the group Feb. 12 to debate the Ulster
Unionists' possible withdrawal from Cabinet and his own future as party leader.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreseeing this likelihood, the British government could suspend the
Cabinet's powers but keep the administration intact until the weapons wrangling
can be resolved.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview Sunday, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams suggested that the IRA
might break off contacts with the disarmament commission if the administration
is suspended.
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein's larger rival for Catholic votes, the pacifist Social Democratic
and Labor Party, argued Monday that suspending the Cabinet would play into the
hands of extremists who never wanted a power-sharing government in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Don't make a bad situation worse,'' warned the party's deputy leader,
Seamus Mallon, who jointly leads the Cabinet alongside Trimble.

<HEADLINE> Study: Drinking, Fainting Connected  </HEADLINE>
    By JUAN A. LOZANO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- Scientists say they have learned part of the reason why some
people become lightheaded and pass out when they stand up after drinking
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
	   Two or three beers on average is enough to impair the body's ability to
maintain a steady blood pressure, according to a study believed to be the first
to explain the cardiovascular effects of drinking.
</P>
<P>
	   The study published Tuesday in the journal Circulation found that people
have wider blood vessels and lower blood pressure after drinking alcohol.
</P>
<P>
	   Those changes impair the body's ability to pump fresh blood to the brain,
said Dr. Virend K. Somers, a co-author of the study. As a result, drinkers who
suddenly stood up often felt lightheaded and sometimes fainted.
</P>
<P>
	   How alcohol causes those changes is unknown, said Somers, a cardiologist at
the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. He suggested the alcohol could be blunting the
nerve signal sent from the brain to the vessel, or the alcohol was preventing
the blood vessel from constricting.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Richard Lange, a professor of internal medicine at the University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center who was not affiliated with the study, said
the research was the first to define why fainting may occur after drinking.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's more than just being inebriated. This explains in a very mechanical
fashion on how alcohol can cause someone's blood pressure to fall," said Lange.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1999 study, 18 healthy men and one woman averaging age 26 were given
the equivalent of two to three beers.
</P>
<P>
	   Each participants' blood pressure dropped after the drinks. Somers said none
of the subjects passed out during the study, but several became lightheaded.

<HEADLINE> 3 Israeli Soldiers Killed in Ambush  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA KING Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Stung by the deaths of three Israeli soldiers in south
Lebanon, Prime Minister Ehud Barak said there would be no new peace talks with
Syria until the Damascus government reins in the Islamic militant Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Israel will not be able to negotiate peace as long as the Syrians do not
restrain Hezbollah from acting against the Israeli army,'' said a Defense
Ministry statement issued hours after the bloody attack, which also wounded four
Israeli soldiers, one critically. One of the dead was an Israeli major.
</P>
<P>
	   Before and after Hezbollah's strike in Israel's self-declared security zone
in south Lebanon, Israeli warplanes staged nine air raids against suspected
guerrilla positions, the army said. The extent of casualties from the airstrikes
was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
	   The violence, the worst in southern Lebanon in six months, comes as the
United States has been seeking to bring Israel and Syria back to the bargaining
table. Negotiations resumed in December after a four-year hiatus, but broke down
in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria said it pulled out of the talks due to Israel's refusal to commit in
advance to a total withdrawal from the disputed Golan Heights, and over what
kind of a demilitarized area would exist there.
</P>
<P>
	   Following Monday's attack -- which came only a day after Hezbollah
assassinated the man considered No. 2 in Israel's allied militia, the South
Lebanon Army -- Barak used his bluntest language yet to implicate Syria in
Hezbollah's actions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is ... the Syrians, not just Hezbollah, who are behind supply lines and
freedom of movement'' for the guerrillas, Barak, a former military chief of
staff, told lawmakers from his One Israel faction.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Defense Ministry statement, Barak used language that in the past has
foreshadowed a major Israeli counterattack. ``We have known in the past, and we
still know, (how) to strike at the place and time of our choosing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak described the recent violence, including the death of another Israeli
soldier last week, as a ``grave intensification ... that Israel would not allow
to continue.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, U.S. officials said they didn't read Barak's statement as
setting preconditions for continuing talks, but rather as an assessment that
Hezbollah's attacks were a threat to peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We condemn the violence and urge restraint on all parties that have
influence in the region,'' said David Leavy, spokesman for the National Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
	   With Israeli combat deaths in one month in Lebanon now at four -- already
one-third of last year's total -- Barak repeated his campaign pledge to pull his
troops out of Lebanon ``as soon as possible, in an orderly fashion.''
</P>
<P>
	   He and his Cabinet have argued that Israel's northern border could be more
adequately defended from the Israeli side, with less loss of life.
</P>
<P>
	   The prime minister's move marked a dramatic turnabout. In the weeks since
the talks with Syria broke down, Barak has tried to woo Damascus with flattering
statements about Syria's President Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
	   Top political associates of Barak quickly joined in calls to stop dealings
with the Syrians while the Lebanon violence continues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our boys are killed with (the Syrians') permission. This pattern is
unacceptable,'' Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel's army radio, without citing sources, said the United States had sent
messages to Syria urging it to restrain Hezbollah. A senior U.S. administration
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the Clinton
administration had been in touch this week with all sides.
</P>
<P>
	   As is its custom, Israel kept details of the midday attack under wraps for
hours, announcing the casualties Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
	   The South Lebanon Army, which is armed, trained and funded by Israel, was
deeply shaken by Sunday's killing of Col. Akl Hashem, considered the militia's
No. 2 man, in a bombing outside his south Lebanon home. SLA militiamen are
already fearful about their fate once Israel leaves the swath of south Lebanon
it has occupied since 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   In Beirut, Hezbollah said the attack on the Israeli patrol had come despite
``all the threats of Israeli leaders'' -- a reference to Barak's statement on
Sunday that Hashem's killing would not go unpunished.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's ambush of the Israeli patrol -- which Hezbollah hailed as a
``daring attack deep in the occupied zone'' -- appeared staged to carry maximum
symbolic impact.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Lebanese security officials speaking on condition of anonymity,
it took place almost in the shadow of the Israeli-held Crusader mountaintop
fortress of Beaufort, a brooding stronghold with commanding views of south
Lebanon and northern Israel.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Expansion Reaches Record  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Break out the champagne, cut the cake and strike up the
band -- it's time to celebrate the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, the current expansion that began in March 1991 becomes the
longest in American history at 107 months, beating the old mark of 106 months
set during the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   The eight years and 11 months since the last recession is quite a feat
considering the average expansion before 1982 did not last long enough to see
its third birthday, let alone its ninth.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you are not cheering for this accomplishment, then you have awfully high
standards," said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI. "This is
an unprecedented economy."
</P>
<P>
	   And it is not just length that makes the current period remarkable.
</P>
<P>
	   By almost any measure, these are good economic times. Unemployment is at its
lowest level in 30 years -- 4.1 percent -- consumer confidence is at record
highs and Wall Street has just wrapped up an unprecedented five straight years
of returns of 20 percent or more in the S&AMP;P 500 stock list.
</P>
<P>
	   Long past the time that most expansions are showing their age, this one
seems to be getting stronger, with 1999 marking the third straight year with
growth at 4 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
	   Normally, economic growth at those levels, combined with a dwindling supply
of workers, would translate into rapidly rising wages, leading to higher
inflation. But not this time. Last year, the so-called core rate of inflation,
which takes out volatile energy and food products, was up just 1.9 percent, the
best performance in 34 years.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton takes every opportunity to cite the soundness of the
Clinton-Gore deficit reduction program as a key building block for the good
economy, hoping voters will reward Democrats this fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans are quick to note that the current recovery actually started
nearly two years before Clinton took office, when Republican George Bush was
president.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's misfortune was that while the last recession only lasted eight
months, from July 1990 until March 1991, the recovery in the early days was
dubbed the "jobless recovery" because it was exceptionally sluggish, allowing
Clinton to make the weak economy a key campaign issue in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked to apportion credit among government policy-makers for the good times,
private economists generally give the lion's share of praise to Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan and his central bank colleagues.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan has already engineered one soft landing -- raising interest rates
seven times in 1994 and early 1995 to slow things down and keep inflation under
control. And he is now attempting a second soft landing.
</P>
<P>
	   Since last June, the Fed has raised rates three times and it is expected to
do so again during its meetings Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "The economy is growing so fast that even the Federal Reserve hasn't been
able to slow it down and that's why they will be raising rates again," said
Richard Yamarone of Argus Research Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists, in fact, are looking for as many as three more rate increases
before summer, bringing the total number of credit tightening moves to seven in
one year.
</P>
<P>
	   The absence of inflation pressures so far has allowed the Fed to let
unemployment fall far below the 6 percent level that economists used to believe
signaled dangers of rising wage pressures.
</P>
<P>
	   The remarkable combination of low unemployment and low inflation is often
cited by proponents of a "New Economy" theory for why the current expansion has
lasted so long.
</P>
<P>
	   They believe the billions of dollars invested in computers and other
high-tech products has boosted America's productivity, the amount of output per
hour of work. That, combined with new competition from the global economy, has
kept the lid on prices, many analysts argue.
</P>
<P>
	   But even staunch supporters of the New Economy idea caution that the
business cycle has not been repealed and there will be another recession; they
just don't have one in the forecast now.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a possibility that the expansion could run into trouble in the
next two or three years, but right now the types of forces that start us toward
a recession are still not in play," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Primark
Global Economics in New York.

<HEADLINE> French Truckers Block Traffic  </HEADLINE>
   By JEAN-MARIE GODARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARIS (AP) -- Truck drivers set up roadblocks across France Monday,
disrupting traffic in a protest aimed at ensuring they reap the benefits of a
shorter workweek.
</P>
<P>
	   The protest, the first of several planned this week by disgruntled transport
workers, was similar to one three weeks ago by the truckers' bosses who, angered
at the prospect of implementing a 35-hour workweek, won government exemptions
for their companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The concessions, in response to employers who said the shorter workweek
would hinder their ability to compete with other European firms, only served to
infuriate truck drivers and trigger the latest labor unrest.
</P>
<P>
	   In most areas, truckers allowed private cars to move slowly past the
barricades. But elsewhere, traffic was completely stalled by lines of
stationary, heavy trucks.
</P>
<P>
	   The disruption affected border crossings and some of the country's main
cities.
</P>
<P>
	   Most truckers currently work between 50 and 70 hours a week. The government
said the truckers could work longer than the new limit -- as long as they
receive overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   But the truckers want a better hourly rate, a 50 percent increase in salary
for night work, as well as a bonus month's salary at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's time to get this profession out of the Middle Ages,'' Milorad Sugic,
a union activist, told Associated Press Television News at a barricade in
Senlis, outside Paris. ``The government must review its decision.''
</P>
<P>
	   Roger Poletti, leader of the transport division of the Workers' Force union,
said he expected the barricades to remain in place until Tuesday evening. But
truckers' employers also threatened action if the government cedes to the
demands.
</P>
<P>
	   Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's government decided to cut the
workweek to 35 hours from 39 in a bid to cut France's stubborn unemployment
rate.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Parent's Training Aids Unruly Kids  </HEADLINE>
   By ANJETTA McQUEEN AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- They were once extremely unruly toddlers, classified as
severely emotionally disturbed, and seemed headed for school failure, juvenile
delinquency and adult crime.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, 25 years after their parents completed a training program that
emphasized positive discipline, they have finished school and become
well-adjusted adults.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers who tracked the 40 children to adulthood say the results prove
parents can learn to stop a troubled child's destructive behavior before it has
lifelong consequences.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we are talking about is 'way beyond the terrible twos,'' said Phillip
Strain, a professor of educational psychology at the University of Colorado,
Denver. ``They hit parents, attack infant siblings and have tantrums in public
that might last an hour, and have them multiple times a day.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rosemary Regan of Antioch, Tenn., was a divorced homemaker when she enrolled
in the program with her violent, angry 2-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I had to teach her how to make good choices,'' Regan said of Elizabeth,
31, one of the study's success stories.
</P>
<P>
	   The study results are to be released Wednesday at an Education Department
conference highlighting programs that reduce school violence. Since last year's
deadly shooting spree at a Littleton, Colo., high school, the department has
been seeking ways beyond ``zero tolerance'' punishments and metal detectors to
create safer schools. The conference, officials said, will emphasize the
importance of correcting disruptive behavior before the child begins school.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's impossible to prevent the rare event,'' Strain said. ``But that's not
to suggest that these kind of programs shouldn't be a part of the (prevention)
equation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Behavior disorder can be linked to a variety of factors, genetic or
environmental. Few children suffer from the most-severe cases, Strain said, but
those children, if their aggressive, antisocial behavior goes unchecked, could
end up costing the public billions to punish them in the criminal justice
system. Their extreme behavior also makes them targets for frustrated parents
who physically abuse them, educators who expel them from school and peers who
shun them, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These are individuals who disproportionately end up lonely, clinically
depressed ... at high risk of suicide or accidental death,'' said Strain, who
led the study of 40 preschoolers with severe emotional disturbance randomly
selected in 1978 from among 1,000 families who completed the parent training
program. ``The long term effects of them not being treated or poorly treated are
pretty devastating.''
</P>
<P>
	   It's difficult to predict how an emotional disorder will affect someone's
future, but a variety of studies overwhelmingly agree that severe disorders have
long-term consequences, said Lawrence Hartmann, a Harvard professor of
psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
	   The premise of the Regional Intervention Program is to change the way
parents interact with troubled children, said Matt Timm, the program's executive
director. Families learn to calm down before punishing misbehavior, give
children reasonable choices instead of commands, set and keep clear rules and
remember to praise their children when they are good. The approach is based on
child behavior research, Strain said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lack of money limited the long-term study to 40 participants, Strain said.
Observed in second through eighth grades, the children obeyed their teachers 89
percent of the time in class, did their work 85 percent of the time and seemed
little different from children who never had behavioral problems.
</P>
<P>
	   The younger the child at enrollment, Strain said, the better behaved the
child was in later years. Better behavior was not influenced by a child's sex,
race, family income or parents' education level, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The study group's success was almost universal. All but one finished high
school, and all but one are employed. Just one participant took illegal drugs,
and just one was ever arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   Originally financed by the Education Department to help parents address
children's behavioral disorders, the training program is available in cities
including Nashville, Tenn.; Cleveland; Bloomfield, Conn.; Manistee, Mich.; Chula
Vista, Calif.; and Brantford, Ontario, Canada. The program generally is funded
by local school districts and mental health agencies.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves Digital Mammograms  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's first digital mammograms -- computerized
breast X-rays to hunt breast cancer -- were approved by the government Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Digital mammograms appear as good as -- but not better than -- regular
mammograms in detecting breast cancer, the Food and Drug Administration
cautioned.
</P>
<P>
	   But the new digital mammography machine, GE Medical Inc.'s Senographe 2000D,
does offer potential advantages to regular film X-rays: Digital mammograms can
be stored electronically so films aren't lost, adjusted for under- or
overexposure without needing another X-ray, and sent electronically to
specialists worldwide for consultation.
</P>
<P>
	   Better, it is a long-awaited first step in using computers in even more
sophisticated ways to better detect breast cancer, said Dr. Daniel Kopans,
director of breast imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, who has helped
study the system.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This will open a new era in mammographic detection of breast cancer,'' he
said, describing a list of research that digital equipment will enable to move
forward. ``This is the first step and I've got my fingers crossed all these
things are going to pan out. This gives us the opportunity'' to try.
</P>
<P>
	   American women undergo some 30 million mammograms every year. The breast
X-ray is the gold standard in detecting breast cancer, particularly early
tumors.
</P>
<P>
	   But mammograms are not foolproof. Scientists have long hoped that
computerizing mammograms could improve the images.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA approved essentially a first step in digital mammography, cautioned
radiologic devices chief Dr. Dan Schultz.
</P>
<P>
	   In studies of 625 women, a printout of the mammogram from the digital
machine was as effective in detecting breast cancer as standard film mammograms,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   From a woman's point of view, digital mammograms are performed like
traditional mammograms -- the image just isn't recorded on film. And
radiologists read those printouts just as they read standard mammograms.
</P>
<P>
	   To utilize the machine's full digital capabilities, doctors wouldn't need a
printout -- ideally, they could check a computerized image on a video monitor.
But the FDA did not approve this ideal ``soft copy'' digital mammogram -- just
the printout version -- because GE Medical has not yet studied whether reading
from the video screen is as accurate, Schultz explained.
</P>
<P>
	   If that full digital capability is realized, doctors one day could have a
greater range to manipulate and improve the breast scans, he said. For example,
if one part of a woman's breast were particularly dense, the computer might
compensate to better check that spot.
</P>
<P>
	   Using digital equipment also will enable studies of whether injecting dyes
into the breast or devising computer-generated images of breast tissue from
different angles could better detect tumors, Kopans said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Just about everything we do is digital, and it's about time mammography
was also,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wisconsin-based GE Medical said the machines would cost hospitals $500,000,
and sales begin immediately.

<HEADLINE> Recording Group Sues Sony  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- A music retailing group sued Sony Corp. of America
Monday, alleging it forces music stores to sell compact discs containing
promotional materials for competing, Sony-owned stores.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit, filed by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers in
the District of Columbia's federal court, accuses Sony Corp. and its subsidiary,
Sony Music Entertainment, of copyright misuse, illegal price discrimination,
unfair competition and false advertising.
</P>
<P>
	   Sony forces retailers to carry compact discs that contain software and
printed inserts that direct consumers to competing stores owned or operated by
Sony, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
	   David Lang, president of Compact Disc World, said the stores don't have the
option of buying CDs without the software and promotional material for other
stores embedded as part of the disks.
</P>
<P>
	   Sony spokeswoman Laurie Jakobsen said the company hadn't seen the complaint
and couldn't immediately comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Association of Recording Merchandisers, based in Marlton, N.J.,
represents over 1,000 companies in music retailing, wholesaling and
distribution.

<HEADLINE> UPS Says Earnings Up 37 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ATLANTA (AP) -- United Parcel Service reported a 37 percent increase in net
income for the final three months of 1999, its first quarter as a publicly
traded company.
</P>
<P>
	   The Atlanta-based package delivery giant said Monday that fourth-quarter
earnings were $661 million, or 56 cents a share, compared with $482 million, or
43 cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The fourth-quarter results were a penny above estimates from analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues totaled $7.45 billion, up nearly 12 percent from $6.66 billion in
the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   UPS went public in November with the biggest public stock offering in
history -- $5.47 billion at an opening price of $50 per share.
</P>
<P>
	   In late Monday afternoon trading, shares in UPS were changing hands at
$59.75, down $5.18 3/4 or nearly 8 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said that investors could be worried that rapidly rising fuel costs
could squeeze future profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert J. Clanin, UPS chief financial officer, credited the increase in
earnings to strong volume growth in the quarter, when UPS benefited from an
increase in online Christmas shopping.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had a robust peak season, culminating in a record peak day on which we
delivered 18.7 million packages," Clanin said.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that during the holidays, "the UPS Web site also hit a new record,
responding to 3.3 million tracking requests on a single day."
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, UPS earnings totaled $883 million, or 77 cents a share,
compared with $1.74 billion, or $1.57 a share, in 1998. Excluding a one-time
$1.44 billion tax assessment, 1999 earnings were $2.33 billion, or $2.04 a
share.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues rose 9 percent to $27.05 billion from $24.79 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Figures in the earnings report were adjusted so comparisons could be made
between the period before the stock offering and the period afterward, said
company spokesman Norman Black.

<HEADLINE> Royal Bank Hikes Offer for NatWest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- The battle for control for National Westminster Bank PLC
continued Monday as first Royal Bank of Scotland PLC, then Bank of Scotland,
produced new bids for the English bank.
</P>
<P>
	   The Royal Bank valued its new offer of cash and stock announced Monday at
$40.5 billion, up from its earlier bid of about $35.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Bank of Scotland responded later Monday with its own bid of $41.9 billion,
up from $39.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Both banks have until the end of Monday to post final offers to shareholders
under terms set by regulatory authorities in the battle for NatWest.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately clear whether there would be any further bids
forthcoming. Earlier Monday, the Royal Bank described its offer as final, but
said it reserved the right to change it 'if a new competitive situation arises."
</P>
<P>
	   The Royal Bank's new basic offer to shareholders is 0.920 shares in the new
merged company and $6.48 in cash per NatWest share.
</P>
<P>
	   The new bid included a commitment of an extra $810 million from a Spanish
bank, Banco Santander Central Hispano, which is the Royal Bank's largest
shareholder with 9.64 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The extra funds from the Spanish bank -- in exchange for Royal Bank shares
-- would be used to pay shareholders who opt for a cash alternative in the new
offer.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have injected more cash into this offer in a way which does not involve
dismembering the NatWest business and does not disadvantage any of the
shareholders involved," said Royal Bank Chief Executive Sir George Mathewson.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bank of Scotland is offering 1.75 of its shares, or alternatively 50
pence in cash and 1.66 shares. The offer also includes 246 pence in cash or loan
notes. In addition, the Bank of Scotland is also offering a special stock unit
or 110 pence in cash per share.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement before the Bank of Scotland bid, NatWest said it was waiting
to hear about offers from both sides before making a decision about which one it
favored.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares in all three banks fell Monday on the London Stock Exchange. But some
analysts blamed general weakness in banking shares because of fears of interest
rate rises, rather than the takeover battle.

<HEADLINE> Albright: Russia Inflicting Misery  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Clashing openly with Russia over Chechnya, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Monday the conflict in the rebellious republic had
inflicted ``an incredible amount of misery'' on civilians by targeting them
indiscriminately and forcing them from their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   She appealed to Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov to open a dialogue with Chechen
political figures. ``We believe there is no military solution to the Chechen
problem,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Ivanov responded at a joint news conference that Russia had to move
firmly against terrorism, a view in which he said other governments concurred,
and that no one had come up with an effective recipe to deal with the extremist
threat.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Russia understood fully the concern its offensive had stirred
abroad, but insisted ``all our counterparts share the necessity to fight most
firmly against terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
	   The offensive, championed by acting President Vladimir Putin and widely
approved by Russian nationalists, will not extinguish terrorism and is causing
diplomatic isolation for Russia around the world, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
	   Their open debate after more than three hours of talks underscored the skid
in U.S.-Russian relations, marked also by disagreement over a potential U.S.
program for space-based weapons that Russia insists would fuel a race in
offensive nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
	   Philosophically, Albright said of discord over arms control measures,
``these are unlikely subjects for one-day miracles.''
</P>
<P>
	   But hinting at a potential for compromise, she said Russia's demand for
deeper cutbacks in arsenals and the U.S. pitch for an antimissile defense were
being considered in ``one package.''
</P>
<P>
	   Albright said President Clinton was prepared to make a visit to Moscow to
continue the dialogue with Putin.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, however, a senior U.S. official said Clinton had no plan to
visit at least until after Russia's national elections in March. Boris Yeltsin
had extended an open invitation to the president before resigning New Year's Eve
and choosing Putin as his successor.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright's visit is designed to size up Putin, to push for an easing of
restrictions on antimissile defenses and to persuade the new leader to change
course in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   In a gesture of cooperation despite their differences, Albright and Ivanov
took a break while tackling their heavy agenda to sign an agreement designed to
tighten controls on technology used in launching U.S. satellites from Russian
space stations.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, they are working together toward a solution to a territorial dispute
between two former Soviet republics, Armenia and Azerbaijan. Albright also noted
that both Russian and American troops were on peacekeeping patrol in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   While Albright and Ivanov conferred at Osobnyak, the foreign ministry's
guest house, delegates from the Palestinian Authority, Israel and several Arab
countries began a series of meetings aimed at promoting regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Russia will keep working consistently to attain durable and fair peace in
the Middle East region, which can be secured through the restoration of the
legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people,'' Putin said in a letter
to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The presidential press service made the
letter public.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin said he would accept Arafat's invitation to visit Palestinian-held
territory ``as soon as circumstances permit.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also has endorsed Palestinian aspirations and declined to endorse
congressional legislation affirming Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
</P>
<P>
	   A Putin mission was welcomed Monday night by a senior U.S. official, who
said ``the Russian position is clearly one that is very supportive of moving
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, added: ``To the extent
they can be helpful we welcome that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Albright, Ivanov and about a dozen other foreign ministers held a festive
informal dinner, meanwhile, in a palace built by St. Catherine. They were
serenaded by folk singers and drank some vodka.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright and Ivanov boarded a sleigh pulled by horses and rode amid
snowbanks in a torch-lit pathway. Midway, they swapped hats, Albright exchanging
her Stetson for Ivanov's Russian fur hat.
</P>
<P>
	   The Moscow talks are being sponsored by Russia and the United States. In
addition to Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, the Palestinian Authority and
Israel, they are to include representatives of Canada, the European Union,
Japan, China, Switzerland and Norway.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria and Lebanon are boycotting the meetings.
</P>
<P>
	   On Chechnya, the divergence of American and Russian views was clear.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think there has been an incredible amount of misery injected upon the
civilian population of Chechnya, both militarily and also because of the
creation of its many refugees,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, though, Albright reaffirmed U.S. support for Russia to
retain control of Chechnya and said Russia was confronted by ``what is clearly a
problem of terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
	   She did not elaborate on her proposal that Russia should pursue a political
solution through dialogue. State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, said ``we
don't have a prescription for it.''

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rico Reaches Navy Range Pact  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Puerto Rico agreed Monday to permit the U.S. Navy to
resume limited training on the island of Vieques and said it would help clear
the bombing range of protesters who want the Navy to leave.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement, following months of negotiations, also calls for a Puerto

the Navy previously indicated it was willing to give up what it calls the
``crown jewel'' of its Atlantic training sites.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to President Clinton from Puerto Rican Gov. Pedro Rossello, the
governor called Clinton's plan for Vieques ``a fair and positive basis'' for
resolving the conflict that began after a civilian security guard was killed by
an errant bomb in April.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The government of Puerto Rico shall conduct a referendum for the citizens
of Vieques to decide the future of training operations on the island of
Vieques,'' Rossello wrote in the letter dated Monday. The Pentagon released
copies.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton issued directives Monday to Defense Secretary William Cohen ordering
that the Vieques referendum be held at a date set by the Navy, but in any case
no earlier than May 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   If the people of Vieques vote to let the Navy resume full-scale training,
the administration will ask Congress to provide an extra $50 million in aid to
Vieques for housing and infrastructure improvements.
</P>
<P>
	   If the referendum vote goes against the Navy, then Navy land on the eastern
side of Vieques -- including the area where live ordnance has been dropped
during years of practice bombing -- will be transferred within one year of the
referendum to the General Services Administration.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- The European Union warned Monday it would take the
unprecedented step of severing most political contacts with any Austrian
government that includes a far-right party whose leader has praised aspects of
Adolph Hitler's regime.
</P>
<P>
	   The warning followed a series of verbal attacks by Joerg Haider on the
leaders of France and Belgium for opposing any role for his party in the
Austrian government. The center-right Austrian People's Party has been holding
talks with Haider's populist anti-immigration Freedom Party, which finished
second in inconclusive elections in October.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider shrugged off the EU's warning, saying it was his critics -- and not
himself -- who were antidemocratic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am somewhat horrified how lightly one takes democracy in a country such
as Austria,'' Haider said Monday, describing the warnings as ``an attempt to
take influence from the outside'' on Austria's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   If the Freedom Party becomes part of a governing coalition, the 14 other
European Union members would curtail bilateral contacts with Vienna, oppose
Austrian appointments to international organizations and keep contacts with
Austrian ambassadors to a minimum, said an EU statement issued in Lisbon,
Portugal.
</P>
<P>
	   The threat signaled EU determination not only to combat what it feels are
undemocratic developments in a member country but also to send a message to
other right-wing groups that they would not be tolerated in a politically
leading role.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider won international notoriety a decade ago after praising Hitler's
``orderly employment policy,'' and later for lauding veterans of the Waffen SS
as ``decent people of good character.'' Since then, he has apologized for those
statements.
</P>
<P>
	   After the EU's warning, Austria's top diplomat to the European Union, Gregor
Woschnagg, left Brussels, Belgium, the EU capital, for Vienna. His
representatives denied the move was in response to the threat, saying the trip
had been planned in advance.
</P>
<P>
	   Just hours earlier, Haider expressed regret over his sharp criticism of
French and Belgian leaders but said they must respect the outcome of elections
that propelled his party to national prominence.
</P>
<P>
	   Prior to a meeting with Austrian President Thomas Klestil, Haider said he
wanted ``no conflict with Belgium and France,'' although he had called the
Belgian government ``corrupt'' and said French President Jacques Chirac was
ignorant of Austrian politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Klestil, in a statement after meeting Haider, said he had urged him to
temper his language.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Monday, Haider told reporters he expected negotiations with the
Austrian People's Party of Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel to be wrapped up
perhaps Tuesday so the new center-right coalition could assume power.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed coalition between the Freedom Party and the People's Party
would control 104 seats in the 183-member parliament, and would likely have
Schuessel as its chancellor.

<HEADLINE> GOP Offers Bigger Marriage Tax Cut  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Aiming for a House vote prior to Valentine's Day,
Republicans proposed a 10-year, $182 billion remedy Monday to the ``marriage
penalty'' that makes 25 million two-income couples pay higher taxes than if they
were single.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation is four times as costly as a plan offered by President
Clinton, mainly because it would enlarge the bottom 15 percent income tax rate
to ensure a tax cut for couples with higher incomes and those who itemize
deductions. Clinton's measure focuses on couples who take the standard tax
deduction.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the two sides differ in approach, addressing the marriage penalty
is popular among Democrats and Republicans alike and stands a better-than-even
chance of becoming law despite the jockeying for political advantage that
frequently overshadows election-year legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The American people support this, representatives and senators of both
parties support this, so there's no excuse why this shouldn't be done this
year,'' House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   House Republican leaders have decided not to pursue a repeat of last year's
giant $792 billion tax cut that was vetoed by Clinton, preferring to break it
into a series of popular, smaller tax-relief bills more difficult for Democrats
to oppose.
</P>
<P>
	   White House officials say the president's support will depend on how the GOP
balances projected budget surpluses among the overall priorities of Social
Security, Medicare, government spending, debt repayment and tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's going to depend on the entire picture,'' said Clinton spokesman Jake
Siewert. ``It's difficult to address these items in isolation.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Treasury Department estimates that 25 million married couples pay higher
income taxes than if they were single, mainly when both spouses have jobs. The
tax strikes most often when the higher-earning spouse makes between $20,000 and
$75,000 in adjusted gross income a year, according to the Congressional Budget
Office, but some single-earner households actually receive a marriage bonus.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP bill would reduce government revenue by $182.3 billion over 10
years, or 10 percent of the projected $1.9 trillion surplus not earmarked for
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   It would gradually raise the lowest 15 percent income tax bracket so that it
applies to more income for married couples.
</P>
<P>
	   Had that change been in place this year, married couples would have paid the
lowest income tax rate on their first $52,500 of income, compared to $43,850
under current law. It would be of no benefit, however, to the millions of
middle- and lower-income couples who already pay taxes at only the 15 percent
rate.
</P>
<P>
	   Two other GOP provisions are similar to those proposed by Clinton, who last
week outlined a 10-year, $45 billion plan to fix the marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   House Republicans would increase the standard income tax deduction for
married couples to twice that for single tax filers beginning in 2001. If it
were the law now, that would translate into a standard deduction of $8,800
instead of $7,351 for couples who don't itemize.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP bill also would increase by $2,000 the income cutoff for
lower-income couples who claim the earned income tax credit, an item proposed by
Clinton and also included by Republicans in their larger tax cut last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ways and Means Committee is scheduled to consider the bill Wednesday,
with a House floor vote planned prior to Valentine's Day, Feb. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   The measure's fate in the Senate is uncertain. Partly because of Senate
rules and partly because of philosophical differences, Senate Republicans are
divided on the House approach of passing a series of smaller tax cuts rather
than one large tax relief package.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., praised
Archer for a ``speedy start'' on the issue and said he intends to move similar
legislation in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This year should be the year we finally say good riddance to the marriage
penalty anachronism,'' Roth said.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rico Reaches Navy Range Pact  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Puerto Rico agreed Monday to permit the U.S. Navy to
resume limited training on the island of Vieques and said it would help clear
the bombing range of protesters who want the Navy to leave.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement, following months of negotiations, also calls for a Puerto
Rican referendum that would give islanders two choices: let the Navy resume use
of the range on its own terms -- including the use of live bombs -- or require
the Navy to cease all training by May 1, 2003. That is two years earlier than
the Navy previously indicated it was willing to give up what it calls the
``crown jewel'' of its Atlantic training sites.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to President Clinton from Puerto Rican Gov. Pedro Rossello, the
governor called Clinton's plan for Vieques ``a fair and positive basis'' for
resolving the conflict that began after a civilian security guard was killed by
an errant bomb in April.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The government of Puerto Rico shall conduct a referendum for the citizens
of Vieques to decide the future of training operations on the island of
Vieques,'' Rossello wrote in the letter dated Monday. The Pentagon released
copies.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton issued directives Monday to Defense Secretary William Cohen ordering
that the Vieques referendum be held at a date set by the Navy, but in any case
no earlier than May 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   If the people of Vieques vote to let the Navy resume full-scale training,
the administration will ask Congress to provide an extra $50 million in aid to
Vieques for housing and infrastructure improvements.
</P>
<P>
	   If the referendum vote goes against the Navy, then Navy land on the eastern
side of Vieques -- including the area where live ordnance has been dropped
during years of practice bombing -- will be transferred within one year of the
referendum to the General Services Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   Between now and the time of the referendum, the Navy will be permitted to
resume training on Vieques, but using only dummy bombs instead of live ordnance.
And training would be limited to 90 days a year, instead of the 180 days a year
that was standard before a training moratorium was declared last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Puerto Ricans have long objected to the Navy's practice bombing on Vieques,
but the controversy boiled over after the guard was killed by a bomb dropped by
a Marine Corps jet. The Navy then suspended training on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, the Navy announced what it thought was an agreement with
Rossello to resume training on Vieques this spring using dummy bombs. That deal
fell through, however, with Puerto Rico insisting that no training of any kind
be allowed.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal announced Monday was similar except that it offered an extra $50
million in economic assistance, should the referendum vote turn out in the
Navy's favor.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement released at the Pentagon, Cohen welcomed what he called
progress in ``establishing a framework'' to resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This clears a path for a fair, objective referendum through which the
people of Vieques can chart the future and how the Navy fits within that
vision,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the $50 million, Clinton repeated his previous offer to ask
Congress to provide $40 million in economic assistance once the Navy has resumed
its limited training on Vieques. This money would finance such projects as the
construction of a new commercial ferry pier and terminal, and projects to help
commercial fishing areas.
</P>
<P>
	   The Navy has been pushing for an agreement that would let the USS George
Washington carrier battle group use Vieques for training prior to its scheduled
deployment in March. The last carrier battle group scheduled to train on Vieques
in December was forced to skip it because of the dispute.

<HEADLINE> Reports of Gene Therapy Effects Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Institutes of Health has been swamped with
reports of serious side effects from experimental gene therapy since an Arizona
teen-ager died during one such experiment last fall, it was reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The NIH has received reports of 691 serious adverse events suffered by
participants in gene-therapy studies -- all but 39 reported to the agency in the
months since 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger died, The Washington Post reported in
its Monday editions.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the side effects are similar to those Gelsinger suffered before his
death.
</P>
<P>
	   Also among the reports are a handful of deaths. The researchers involved
largely blame deaths on the patients' underlying diseases, not the experimental
gene therapy, but some are unexplained, the Post said.
</P>
<P>
	   The sudden influx suggests researchers frequently violate federal law that
requires immediate reporting of serious problems during experimental gene
therapy to the NIH committee that oversees this budding new science.
</P>
<P>
	   The NIH committee is supposed to help decide what caused any deaths or
illnesses. Lack of that accounting raises questions of whether Gelsinger was
indeed the first person to die as a result of gene therapy or merely the first
one the federal government knew about.
</P>
<P>
	   NIH officials did not return phone calls on the issue Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   But the report comes as Congress prepares to open hearings Wednesday on how
gene therapy experiments are performed.
</P>
<P>
	   And it comes 10 days after the Food and Drug Administration shut down all
gene therapy experiments at the University of Pennsylvania, where Gelsinger was
treated and died, because of numerous violations of federal research rules.
</P>
<P>
	   Complicating the question of what gene therapy problems have gone undetected
is that adverse events are supposed to be reported to both the NIH and FDA. The
FDA has authority to stop unsafe research but by law keeps most reports of
problems secret, so it is unclear if the influx of adverse events surprises that
agency as well.

<HEADLINE> Senator: Biosafety Deal Hurts U.S.  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new agreement to regulate trade in genetically
engineered crops is likely to hurt exports of U.S. commodities, the chairman of
the Senate Agriculture Committee said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The UN-sponsored deal that was reached early Saturday after a week of
negotiations involving 130 countries will require exporters to label all
shipments of biotech commodities.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Richard Lugar, an outspoken proponent of biotechnology, said the
labeling requirement is ``a substantial problem'' for U.S. farmers and could
lead shippers to require that conventional crops be handled and stored
separately from biotech varieties.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To say the least this is a damper on exports and trade,'' the Indiana
Republican said.
</P>
<P>
	   Major commodity groups have been less concerned about the agreement,
however, partly because the labels wouldn't be required on shipments of food
products, such as cooking oil or meal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nothing in this agreement should dissuade U.S. farmers from using
biotechnology,'' said Susan Keith, senior director of public policy for the
National Corn Growers Association.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't see this as requiring segregation. That will be a market-driven
decision. Contrary to what some others may be saying the biotech sky is not
falling.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Lugar's concerns were echoed by the smaller American Corn Growers
Association, which has been critical of biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement ``will severely burden farmers and grain elevators, resulting
in higher premiums paid for'' conventional varieties, said Gary Goldberg, chief
executive officer of the group.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everywhere we turn, additional obstacles are being placed in the way for
farmers to continue planting'' genetically engineered crops, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has fought any labeling requirements or import bans on
biotech crops.
</P>
<P>
	   Genetically engineered corn, soybeans and cotton have been become widely
popular in the United States over the past couple of years because of the
increased yields, but they have met increased consumer resistance in Europe and
Asia. Critics of the crops, which are resistant to herbicides or insects, say
that there isn't enough known about their impact on health and the environment.
</P>
<P>
	   Lugar, speaking at a news conference where he outlined his agenda for the
year, also said Monday that he expected Congress to put together an aid package
for farmers this year along the lines of measures it has approved over the past
two years totaling $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration's proposed 2001 budget will include about $5
billion in special assistance for farmers, including a new subsidy program
expected to cost $3.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Lugar said farmers are likely to reject the administration's subsidy program
as inadequate once they see the details. The subsidies would be targeted to
small and medium-size producers and would be tied to fluctuations in crop
income.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the farm assistance the administration's budget also will
include a 20 percent increase in funding for food-safety programs. The extra $68
million will go toward research, education and other programs in three agencies.

<HEADLINE> 'January Indicator' Ominous  </HEADLINE>
    By DUNSTAN PRIAL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- For the first time in eight years, all of the broad stock
market indexes fell in January, an ominous sign for those market watchers who
use the so-called "January indicator" to predict the future.
</P>
<P>
	   Market lore has it that when the major indexes rise in January, stocks will
gain over the full year, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, since 1950 the January indicator has only been wrong three times,
according to Yale Hirsch, author of the "Stock Trader's Almanac."
</P>
<P>
	   But the stock market is rife with such indicators, and most professional
stock-pickers take them with a grain of salt.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's too early and there's too much mixed data out there to throw in the
towel for the year," said Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at George K.
Baum, a Kansas City, Mo.-based brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, the most closely watched index, ended
January at 10,940.53, down almost 5 percent from its close on Dec. 31, 1999. The
average of 30 blue-chip stocks also was off almost 7 percent from the record
11,722.98 reached Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   It also was the first January retreat since 1992 for the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock list.
</P>
<P>
	   The broad S&AMP;P 500 index, favored by most Wall Street professionals, fell
about 5 percent in the first month of the year, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq
composite index slipped slightly more than 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   A number of factors contributed to those declines, not the least of which
was investors simply taking profits after record-setting stock market gains
during the fourth quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the roaring U.S. economy has put Federal Reserve Board
policy-makers on guard for signs of creeping inflation, a threat that has led to
three interest rate hikes last year.
</P>
<P>
	   A fourth rate hike is widely expected on Wednesday, and investors traded
cautiously throughout January bearing that in mind.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher interest rates hurt stocks because they make it more costly for
companies to borrow money to expand their businesses, cutting into earnings.
</P>
<P>
	   Notwithstanding the track record of the January indicator, few worry that
one down month will derail the longest running bull market in history.
</P>
<P>
	   Belski said the wild mood swings exhibited by the stock market in recent
months are typical of a full-blown bull market. Investors are edgy, he said, and
prone to making quick decisions based on emotions. So the January selloff was
hardly surprising, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   When taken in their proper context, some indicators can be helpful, analysts
believe. But none should be considered some sort of crystal ball that can be
used to shine a light into the future.
</P>
<P>
	   The Presidential election indicator, for example, is based on a historical
precedent that presidents tend to be more conservative in their last two years
of office so as not to disturb the economy. Consequently, the status quo remains
intact and stock markets tend to go up.
</P>
<P>
	   During the 20th Century, the Dow Jones average fell just seven times during
25 Presidential election years, according to Hirsch's "Stock Traders Alamanac."
</P>
<P>
	   Hirsch said these types of gauges can be thrown off by extraordinary
circumstances. "There's no such thing as a perfect indicator," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The current interest rate environment, for example, held stocks down in
January but probably won't affect the rest of the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks will likely climb higher in 2000 regardless of the January indicator
because the U.S. economy is booming, company earnings are strong, overseas
markets are healthy and the Internet is changing how the world does business,
Hirsch said.
</P>
<P>
	   One indicator that has no one worried is the so-called Super Bowl indicator,
which suggests -- somewhat arcanely -- that when an original member of the old
American Football League wins the Super Bowl in January the stock markets will
tumble that year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Denver Broncos were original members of the AFL, however, and the team
won consecutive Super Bowls in 1998 and 1999 in the midst of the current bull
market.
</P>
<P>
	   Conversely, when the Super Bowl is won by an original member of the National
Football League, which merged with the upstart AFL in the early 1960s, the
markets are supposed to go up. But that indicator clashes this year with the
pall cast by the January indicator since the St. Louis Rams, winner of Sunday's
Super Bowl, were an original NFL member.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Robbins, chief investment strategist at Robinson-Humprey, an
Atlanta-based brokerage firm, dismissed football indicators outright.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no reason to believe that football has anything to do with the
stock markets," he said. "That's just something that's fun to talk about."

</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average surged today as
investors snapped up shares of the companies that were battered in
last week's selloff. The Dow's strength lifted other market
measures out of a slump caused by lingering worries that interest
rates are headed higher. The Dow rose 201.66 to 10,940.53, its
steepest point gain since Jan. 7. Broader market indicators also
finished higher in a volatile session. The Nasdaq composite index
rose 53.37 to 3,940.44. Stocks rose today on a surprising wave of
strength from bank and brokerage stocks. American Express and J.P.
Morgan led the Dow's advance. Dow components 3M and Exxon Mobil
also posted substantial gains.

	   U.S. Expansion Reaches Record
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Break out the champagne, cut the cake and
strike up the band -- it's time to celebrate the U.S. economy.
Toomorrow the the current expansion that began in March 1991
becomes the longest in American history at 107 months, beating the
old mark of 106 months set during the 1960s. The eight years and 11
months since the last recession is quite a feat considering the
average expansion before 1982 did not last long enough to see its
third birthday, let alone its ninth.
</P>
<P>
	   Spending Up More Than Income
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans went on a buying binge in December,
capping a year in which spending outpaced income and took its
biggest leap since 1989. That pushed the nation's savings rate to
an annual low. Spending rose 0.8 percent last month, the fastest
pace since August, the Commerce Department said today. At the same
time, Americans' personal income, which includes wages, interest
and government benefits, increased by 0.3 percent, dragged down by
much smaller federal subsidy payments to farmers. For all of 1999,
spending rose 6.9 percent, the fastest pace in 10 years while
income rose 5.9 percent to match the increase posted in 1998. That
left the personal savings rate -- savings as a percentage of
after-tax income -- at an all-time annual low of 2.4 percent in
1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Inflation Said Risk With Weak Euro
</P>
<P>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European finance ministers today
insisted the euro's tumble to record lows against the dollar is
only temporary, but the chief European central banker warned of
inflation risks if the currency's weakness lingers. Ministers of
the 11 countries that adopted the euro as their single currency
predicted a robust economic recovery in Europe will soon be pushing
the euro upwards. The ministers disappointed currency traders who
had been hoping for more than jawboning to buoy-up the 13-month-old

	   GM's $560M Factory an Image Boost
</P>
<P>
	   PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- General Motors Corp. today unveiled plans
for a $560 million factory in Lansing designed to reflect lessons
learned the hard way over recent years. The Lansing Grand River
Assembly Plant is the first all-new factory built by GM in the
United States since the Saturn complex near Spring Hill, Tenn., in
1986. It's also GM's attempt to shed its reputation for bloated,
old-school manufacturing and prove it can build vehicles as
efficiently as any other automaker in the world. GM also is hoping
to getting along better with the union that represents its
workforce, the United Auto Workers.

	   Union Carbide Profits Up 40 Percent
</P>
<P>
	   DANBURY, Conn. (AP) -- Union Carbide Corp. said today that its
profits rose 40 percent in the fourth quarter because of strong
sales and improved pricing in chemicals and polymers. Net income in
the October-December period was $94 million, or 68 cents a share,
compared with $67 million, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier.
Earnings from the fourth quarter of 1998 included a gain from the
settlement of a licensing lawsuit of 31 cents per share. The
results soundly beat the 46 cents a share expected by analysts who
were surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. Fourth-quarter sales
were $1.55 billion, up 20 percent from $1.29 billion in 1998.

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Embattled German telecom Mannesmann AG
is playing down a surprise alliance between British rival Vodafone
AirTouch PLC and French telecom group Vivendi. While the weekend
deal came as an unexpected blow to Mannesmann, it was just the
latest in a series of outflanking maneuvers marshaled by both
companies since Vodafone launched its $152 billion hostile takeover
bid for the German company in November. Mannesmann had been
courting Vivendi for an alliance of its own as recently as
Saturday. The deal also outlined plans for carving up Mannesmann if

<HEADLINE> Frito-Lay Angers Farm Groups  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID KOENIG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PLANO, Texas (AP) -- In a move that has angered farm groups but pleased some
environmentalists, giant snack maker Frito-Lay Inc. is telling its suppliers not
to use genetically altered corn.
</P>
<P>
	   The American Farm Bureau Federation, which says biotechnology can produce
larger and more nutritious crops, accused Frito-Lay of caving in to anti-biotech
activists.
</P>
<P>
	   "People like Frito-Lay are responding to small splinter groups out of fear
they're going to be boycotted," said Joseph Fields, a spokesman for the farm
group. "We feel the companies are overreacting."
</P>
<P>
	   Greenpeace and the Union of Concerned Scientists applauded the decision,
disclosed last week by Plano-based Frito-Lay, the leading U.S. maker of salty
snacks. Greenpeace had lobbied Frito-Lay's parent company, PepsiCo., to stop
using biotech crops in its products.
</P>
<P>
	   "Frito-Lay is about two-thirds of PepsiCo's sales. They realize the
handwriting is on the wall and that people don't want to eat GMOs (genetically
modified organisms)," said Charles Margulis of Greenpeace.
</P>
<P>
	   Last weekend in Montreal, U.N. talks finally produced complex rules
governing trade in genetically engineered products, including language letting a
country ban imports of a genetically modified product if it feels there is not
enough scientific evidence showing the product is safe.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman for Frito-Lay said the company was acting in response to
consumers' worries, and not to protests by Greenpeace and other groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Frito-Lay spokeswoman Lynn Markley noted that the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration has ruled that biotech foods are safe to eat, "but we're a
consumer products company. There is some consumer concern out there. We felt at
this time it's appropriate to ask our growers not to sell us genetically altered
corn."
</P>
<P>
	   She added the Montreal agreement would have no impact on its policy.
</P>
<P>
	   The anti-biotech edict is contained in contracts Frito-Lay is currently
sending to hundreds of its farmers. Last year, the company bought 1.2 billion
pounds of corn, a tiny fraction of the U.S. crop, for products such as Doritos,
Fritos and Tostitos chips.
</P>
<P>
	   Scientists create biotech crops by splicing the genes of plants and
inserting genetic material from other organisms to make the original bigger,
hardier or tastier.
</P>
<P>
	   Monsanto Co. makes seeds that survive the company's Roundup herbicide,
meaning farmers can freely spray their fields knowing they'll kill weeds but not
the crop. Biotech corn, called Bt corn, is designed to produce a natural
pesticide that kills the European corn borer.
</P>
<P>
	   Farm groups argue that genetically altered crops use less pesticide. Critics
say any such benefit would be short-lived -- that weeds and pests would adapt,
in the same way that they develop resistance to herbicides and pesticides, and
would require stronger and more environmentally dangerous weapons to kill them.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, more than half the soybeans
and cotton and about one-third of the corn grown in the United States last year
used gene-spliced seeds. Potatoes and tomatoes are also grown the same way.
</P>
<P>
	   Frito-Lay's action follows last summer's announcement by Gerber and Heinz
that they would stop using genetically modified ingredients in baby food even
though they believe the ingredients are safe.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Plunge; Energy Futures Up  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Soybean futures took their biggest one-day dive in five months Monday on the
Chicago Board of Trade after heavy rains pelted growing regions of Brazil,
increasing chances for a bumper crop by the world's No. 2 producer.
</P>
<P>
	   In other markets, natural gas prices surged 5 percent on cold weather in the
Northeast, other energy commodities also rose and cocoa tumbled.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybeans fell 3 percent as South American rains doused much of the concern
investors had about drought damage to crops there.
</P>
<P>
	   After soaking neighboring Argentina over the weekend, as much as two inches
of rain fell on soybean-rich southern Brazil. New forecasts called for more
showers in both countries through the week.
</P>
<P>
	   Large trading funds that had helped push soybean prices steadily higher for
months since arid conditions enveloped key crop-growing areas sold heavily as
the likelihood of drought losses dropped substantially.
</P>
<P>
	   Some investors said the market was due for a correction after a January
rally had nudged soybeans to four-month highs last week.
</P>
<P>
	   The near-term contract, for March delivery, fell 15 1/2 cents to $5.08 a
bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   Tim Hannagan, head grains analyst for Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago, said
another rainless weekend likely would have driven prices another six to eight
cents a bushel higher. The precipitation, he said, came at a time when moisture
can make or break the soybean crop, now in the potting stage.
</P>
<P>
	   "Boy, was that timely," he said of the rains. "This is when yields are made
and lost, between now and the middle of February."
</P>
<P>
	   The wetness has minimized the potential loss to dryness, Hannagan said, and
made it more likely that Brazil and Argentina will produce big crops to heap
onto an already glutted market.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a lot of rain in the forecast and funds are taking profits and
taking a lot of the weather premium out of the market," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybeans' slump also helped send grains lower. Wheat for March delivery fell
3 1/2 cents to $2.56 1/4 a bushel, March corn fell 3 1/2 cents to $2.20 a
bushel, and March oats fell 1 1/2 cents to $1.12 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   Natural gas rose on the latest dose of harsh weather along the U.S. East
Coast, including forecasts for below-average temperatures in the eastern half of
the country for the next few days. That will spike demand at a time when
supplies are declining.
</P>
<P>
	   March natural gas rose 13 cents to $2.662 per 1,000 cubic feet on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Crude prices also advanced, pushed higher by heating oil. March crude rose
42 cents to $27.64 a barrel; expiring February heating oil rose 2.69 cents to
95.20 cents a gallon; February gasoline rose 1.22 cents to 75.53 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
	   In London, March Brent crude rose 29 cents to $25.97 on the International
Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Cocoa prices fell below $800 a ton for the first time in several years as
the year-long slump continued with West Africa's harvests hitting the market in
big numbers.
</P>
<P>
	   March cocoa settled down $16 at $795 a ton on New York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP;
Cocoa Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Gannett Earnings Climb 14 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Gannett Co.'s earnings rose 14 percent in the fourth
quarter on greater advertising revenues from newspapers, including the company's
main paper USA Today.
</P>
<P>
	   Gannett earned $284 million, or $1.01 per share, in the quarter ended Dec.
26, up from $248.9 million, or 89 cents per share, during the same period a year
earlier. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had projected
earnings of $1 per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues rose 13 percent to $1.5 billion from $1.33 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Gannett's newspapers had strong demand for classified and national
advertising and an 8 percent decline in newsprint costs.
</P>
<P>
	   At USA Today, paid advertising pages increased to 2,203, compared to 1,955
in the same period of 1998. Advertising revenues grew 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The acquisition last year of Newsquest, the largest regional newspaper
publisher in England with 11 dailies, also boosted earnings. Newsquest includes
the oldest continuously published newspaper in the world, Berrow's Worcester
Journal.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, the company earned $886.6 million, or $3.15 per share, up from
$782.8 million, or $2.74 per share. Revenues rose 8 percent to $5.26 billion
from $4.88 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Gannett also announced that it completed the sale of Multimedia Cablevision
to Cox Communications of Atlanta for $2.7 billion. Operating results for the
quarter and the year excluded contributions from the sale.

<HEADLINE> More Fallout in German Party Scandal  </HEADLINE>
   By BURT HERMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- The head of the Christian Democratic party admitted Monday to
meeting a second time with a key figure who gave off-the-books cash to the
party, further undermining his credibility to lead Germany's conservatives out
of their spiraling funds scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfgang Schaeuble has repeated at news conferences, on television
appearances and in statements to parliament that he met only once with
German-Canadian businessman Karlheinz Schreiber, accepting $50,000 in cash in
1994 after a party function. Schaeuble has said he turned the money over to the
party treasurer.
</P>
<P>
	   After German ZDF and ARD public television reported another Schreiber
encounter, party spokesman Thomas Raabe confirmed that Schaeuble had found
another meeting with the businessman in his 1995 appointment calendar.
</P>
<P>
	   ``However, I don't have any memory of such a meeting, as opposed to the
meeting when Schreiber handed over a cash donation,'' Schaeuble told Bayerischer
Rundfunk television.
</P>
<P>
	   Schreiber has refuted Schaeuble's account of how the cash traded hands,
saying he actually gave the money to then-party treasurer Brigitte Baumeister.
</P>
<P>
	   Baumeister has corroborated Schreiber's account, according to a report in
the Berlin tabloid BZ that said she will testify to parliament investigators
that she received the $50,000 and then handed the money over to Schaeuble.
</P>
<P>
	   Schaeuble said he was ready to swear to the parliament committee about his
version of the events, saying the contradictions could lead to a criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When Baumeister also tells another version under oath to the investigating
committee, then one of us must be lying,'' he told the mass-circulation Bild
newspaper in a story to be published Tuesday. ``That will then be a matter for
prosecutors.''
</P>
<P>
	   As former Chancellor Helmut Kohl's hand-picked successor as chairman of the
Christian Democratic Union, Schaeuble has been trying to help the party recover
from allegations that government decisions were up for sale under Kohl's 16-year
administration.
</P>
<P>
	   Parliament is currently investigating the allegations of influence peddling,
and Kohl himself is under criminal investigation by Bonn prosecutors for
illegally accepting anonymous campaign donations.
</P>
<P>
	   The cash handover had led to calls for Schaeuble to step down, but the party
leadership has encouraged him to stay on to see the party through the crisis.
Schaeuble insisted he will still stand for re-election as party chairman at an
April convention.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the new admission drew attacks from the governing Social Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I absolutely don't believe him any more. His credibility for me is
completely destroyed,'' Peter Struck, the head of the Social Democrats faction
in parliament, said on Germany's ARD television.

<HEADLINE> Mannesmann Considers Next Moves  </HEADLINE>
    By HANS GREIMEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Embattled German telecommunications company
Mannesmann AG is playing down a surprise alliance between British rival Vodafone
AirTouch PLC and French telecom group Vivendi.
</P>
<P>
	   While the weekend deal came as an unexpected blow to Mannesmann, it was just
the latest in a series of outflanking maneuvers marshaled by both companies
since Vodafone launched its $152 billion hostile takeover bid for the German
company in November.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Vivendi deal assumed an extra edge of duplicity since Mannesmann had
been courting the French telecom for an alliance of its own as recently as
Saturday. What's more, the deal also outlined plans for carving up Mannesmann if
Vodafone's takeover attempt is successful.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann's supervisory board held what it described as informational
meeting on Vodafone's bid Monday, a week before Mannesmann shareholders must
decide whether to sell.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the meeting, Mannesmann reiterated it was still in negotiations
with AOL Europe, a move which might counterbalance Vodafone's Internet deal with
Vivendi. The weekend deal would create a 50-50 multi-access European Internet
portal and cooperation in mobile and fixed line telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
	   The company also emphasized that the Vodafone-Vivendi agreement only takes
effect if Vodafone's hostile takeover is successful, and that Mannesmann has not
ruled out continued talks with Vivendi.
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone acknowledged both sides have been engaged in a flurry of activity
lately trying to branch out with various telecom and Internet partnerships and
deals, but said that Mannesmann was trying to muddy the waters with too many
rumors.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ours was a real deal. That's the difference," said Vodafone spokesman Mike
Caldwell.
</P>
<P>
	   He declined to comment on a report in The Wall Street Journal that Vodafone
chief executive Chris Gent and Mannesmann chief Klaus Esser spoke over the
weekend about reaching a compromise.
</P>
<P>
	   One sticking point has been how much control Mannesmann shareholders will
have in the resulting company if they sell their shares. Vodafone's current
offer would give Mannesmann 47.2 percent of the outstanding shares. But Esser
has consistently held out for more, insisting at one point on a 58.5 percent
stake.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our door is still open to raising their stake to 49 percent, but certainly
not over 50 percent, which is what they're talking about," Caldwell said.
"There's a limited scope for negotiations."
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann spokesman Frank Zimmermann said reports of a compromise were pure
speculation and said the German firm was still looking for a stake
"significantly above 50 percent."
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann shares closed up 4.5 percent, or 12.05 euros, at 280.25 euros
($275.37) in Frankfurt trading, while Vodafone closed down 1.5 percent in
London, down 5.25 pence at 338.50 pence ($5.49), reflecting an overall drop in
London stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann has until Feb. 7 to line up its shareholders against Vodafone's
outstanding offer.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rico Reaches Navy Range Pact  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Puerto Rico agreed Monday to permit the U.S. Navy to
resume limited training on the island of Vieques and said it would help clear
the bombing range of protesters who want the Navy to leave.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement, following months of negotiations, also calls for a referendum
that would give islanders two choices: let the Navy resume use of the range on
its own terms -- including the use of live bombs -- or require the Navy to cease
all training by May 1, 2003. That is two years earlier than the Navy previously
indicated it was willing to give up what it calls the ``crown jewel'' of its
Atlantic training sites.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal apparently clears the way for the USS George Washington carrier
battle group to use Vieques for training in March prior to heading to sea for a
six-month deployment. The last carrier battle group scheduled to use Vieques,
last December, was forced to forego the training prior to deploying -- a
situation the Navy's leaders said could not be repeated.
</P>
<P>
	   The Puerto Rican Independence Party, which has led dozens of protesters
camping inside the Vieques bombing range, announced it would oppose any renewed
military exercises.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will continue with our civil disobedience,'' said party Vice President
Fernando Martin. ``For us, any proposal that supposes the renewal of bombing is
unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to President Clinton, Puerto Rican Gov. Pedro Rossello called
Clinton's plan for Vieques ``a fair and positive basis'' for resolving the
conflict that began after a civilian security guard was killed by an errant bomb
in April.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The government of Puerto Rico shall conduct a referendum for the citizens
of Vieques to decide the future of training operations on the island of
Vieques,'' Rossello wrote in the letter dated Monday. The Pentagon released
copies.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton issued directives Monday to Defense Secretary William Cohen ordering
that the Vieques referendum be held at a date set by the Navy, probably on May
1, 2001, but possibly nine months later or nine months earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   If the people of Vieques vote to let the Navy resume full-scale training,
the administration will ask Congress to provide an extra $50 million in aid to
Vieques for housing and infrastructure improvements.
</P>
<P>
	   If the referendum vote goes against the Navy, then Navy land on the eastern
side of Vieques -- including the area where live ordnance has been dropped
during years of practice bombing -- will be transferred within one year of the
referendum to the General Services Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   Between now and the time of the referendum, the Navy will be permitted to
resume training on Vieques, but using only dummy bombs instead of live ordnance.
And training would be limited to 90 days a year, instead of the 180 days a year
that was once standard.
</P>
<P>
	   Puerto Ricans have long objected to the Navy's practice bombing on Vieques,
but the controversy boiled over -- and the Navy suspended training -- after the
guard was killed by a bomb dropped by a Marine Corps jet.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, the Navy announced what it thought was an agreement with
Rossello to resume training on Vieques this spring using dummy bombs. That deal
fell through, however, with Puerto Rico insisting that no training of any kind
be allowed.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal announced Monday was similar except that it offered an extra $50
million in economic assistance, should the referendum vote turn out in the
Navy's favor.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement released at the Pentagon, Cohen welcomed what he called
progress in ``establishing a framework'' to resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This clears a path for a fair, objective referendum through which the
people of Vieques can chart the future and how the Navy fits within that
vision,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the $50 million, Clinton repeated his previous offer to ask
Congress to provide $40 million in economic assistance once the Navy has resumed
its limited training on Vieques. This money would finance such projects as the
construction of a new commercial ferry pier and terminal, and projects to help
commercial fishing areas.

<HEADLINE> Union Carbide Profits Up 40 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DANBURY, Conn. (AP) -- Union Carbide Corp. said Monday that its profits rose
40 percent in the fourth quarter because of strong sales and improved pricing in
chemicals and polymers.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income in the October-December period was $94 million, or 68 cents a

from the fourth quarter of 1998 included a gain from the settlement of a
licensing lawsuit of 31 cents per share.

<HEADLINE> UAW Leader: GM Relations Reach High  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- The president of the United Auto Workers says the union's
relationship with General Motors Corp. has reached a new high after years of
fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   UAW President Stephen P. Yokich said GM had made great strides in improving
relations with the union since the 1998 strike at two parts plants in Flint,
Mich., which virtually shut down GM's North American operations, costing the
world's largest automaker $1.5 billion
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the relationship is better than at any time I can remember," Yokich
said at a wide-ranging news conference that also covered politics and a union
investment in a startup airline.
</P>
<P>
	   Yokich said he believes GM management was determined to improve relations
and that its chairman, Jack Smith "did a wonderful job."
</P>
<P>
	   The two sides have fought for years as GM tried to lower costs by shedding
workers and factories. But after the strike, GM brought in a new chief labor
negotiator, Gary Cowger, and worked to appease the union.
</P>
<P>
	   Last fall, the UAW and GM reached an agreement on a four-year contract for
nearly 200,000 workers in amicable negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're pleased with how it went and they are too," Yokich said.
</P>
<P>
	   Yokich also told reporters that the UAW has yet to decide on endorsing a
presidential candidate. The AFL-CIO endorsed Al Gore in October, a move Yokich
said came "way too early."
</P>
<P>
	   The UAW has been critical of President Clinton's trade policies, opposing
the North American Free Trade Agreement and Clinton's push for "fast-track"
trade negotiations. Since the passage of NAFTA, automakers have turned to
Mexican plants for more goods, especially new products.
</P>
<P>
	   "We thought we could have more effect on the dialogue" by not endorsing
early, Yokich said. "There's a lot that needs to be said."
</P>
<P>
	   Yokich promised the union would be active in this year's campaigns, and had
a larger budget for pushing its 780,000 members.
</P>
<P>
	   Yokich also said the UAW was buying a stake in Pro Air Inc., a Detroit-based
discount airline. The UAW will use an undisclosed amount of money from a credit
card licensing deal to fund its stake in Pro Air. In return, the airline will
give discounts to union members, and the UAW will get a seat on Pro Air's board
of directors.
</P>
<P>
	   The small airline already has agreements with GM and the Chrysler division
of DaimlerChrysler AG for flights out of Detroit.

<HEADLINE> Jury selection begins in Diallo case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - With protesters outside the courthouse and the dead
man's parents sitting with the Rev. Al Sharpton inside, the first five jurors
were chosen Monday for the trial of four police officers charged with murdering
Amadou Diallo.
<P>
	   The first juror selected, a black woman who once lived in the Bronx,will
serve as foreperson of the panel of 16 - 12 regulars and four alternates. A
second black woman, two white women and a white man also were chosen before
court recessed for the day.
</P>
<P>
	   The proceedings opened almost exactly a year after police fired 41 shots at
Diallo in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building on Feb. 4, 1999. The
unarmed African immigrant was hit 19 times.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial is taking place in Albany, 150 miles from the scene of the
shooting. A state appeals court decided that the accused cops - all white -
wouldn't get a fair trial in the Bronx because of pretrial publicity and
racially charged protests.
</P>
<P>
	   "The fact that this case is being tried in Albany County is irrelevant,"
Justice Joseph Teresi told prospective jurors after reading the second-degree
murder indictment.
</P>
<P>
	   "This case is not going to be decided on anything you might have read or
heard in the media," Teresi added. "This case is not going to be decided on
anything that happens outside this courtroom. You must decide this case on the
evidence."
</P>
<P>
	   Kadiatou Diallo, the dead man's mother, told reporters outside the
courtroom: "We are praying for Amadou and to achieve justice in a peaceful way."
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo's father, Saikou, said simply: "Shooting him is murder. Shooting him
41 times is discrimination."
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton said Diallo's family and supporters had "come to Albany in peace.
Those who come in hate, need not come here. We will never be the hateful ones or
the violent ones. We will not become like those we fight."
</P>
<P>
	   One of the accused officers, Sean Carroll, told reporters he wanted to
express "my condolences to the Diallo family in this time of tragedy. I hope one
day I'll be able to sit with the Diallo family and tell them I'm sorry about the
loss of their son."
</P>
<P>
	   The 12 jurors and four alternates will be chosen from a pool of nearly 2,000
people - 20 times the number normally summoned for a murder trial in Albany. On
Monday, 242 people were sworn in and began undergoing questioning in small
groups by the judge and attorneys.
</P>
<P>
	   While the screening took place, demonstrators staged a prayer vigil outside.
A hundred protesters who had traveled from Harlem to Albany by bus chanted
"Amadou, we love you" and "No justice, no peace." Sharpton and other civil
rights activists have portrayed the case as a symbol of racism and police
brutality.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton and the Diallos sat in the back of the courtroom, as did relatives
of the accused officers. The defendants sat in front, each at a separate table.
</P>
<P>
	   The change of venue will likely affect the racial makeup of the jury.
According to 1990 census figures, the white population of the Bronx was about 39
percent; the white population of Albany County was about 89 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   About 35 of the 242 prospective jurors sworn in Monday - 15 percent -
appeared to be black or from other minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   Each side has received 20 chances to disqualify a prospective juror without
saying why. A jury could be seated by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll, 36, and fellow plainclothes officers Edward McMellon, 27, Kenneth
Boss, 28, and Richard Murphy, 27, were indicted in March. They aimed their
barrage at Diallo, a street vendor carrying only a wallet and a pager, while
searching his Bronx neighborhood for violent criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers, who plan to testify, have claimed they used deadly force only
after Diallo refused to halt and appeared to be reaching for a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial, which will be televised, is expected to last a month.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians, Israelis Ready To Talk  </HEADLINE>
   By SAMAR ASSAD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Faced with key issues still unresolved and a looming
deadline for the completion of negotiations, Palestinian and Israeli officials
said Monday the ``moment of truth'' in peacemaking had arrived.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian and Israeli negotiators on Monday headed into a second day of
intensive talks to try to hammer out the framework of a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides have said the Israeli-imposed Feb. 13 deadline for the framework
agreement was likely to pass without a deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Although progress on four vital issues -- borders, the status of Jerusalem,
Jewish settlements and Palestinian refugees -- has been slow, Israeli Justice
Minister Yossi Beilin suggested that Israel could show flexibility on what is
viewed as the largest obstacle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Jerusalem issue is perhaps one of the most difficult issues on our
agenda ... but also perhaps one of the easiest,'' Beilin said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Beilin said the Palestinians could establish ``the main city in their
entity'' in an area they could call Jerusalem, but which was currently outside
Jerusalem's municipal boundaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Such an arrangement could be a face-saving device, allowing the Palestinians
to say they have won control over parts of Jerusalem. However, Palestinian
officials have persistently rejected the plan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians have demanded that the Jerusalem suburbs in the West Bank
be handed to full Palestinian control as part of the next Israeli troop
pullback, a move that would kill the expand-and-share proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   Beilin said he believed both sides will now have to make painful
concessions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The most difficult issue is to get to the moment of truth and say to our
respective constituencies, here is what we could achieve,'' Beilin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat were
to meet Thursday to try to push the talks forward.
</P>
<P>
	   Lead Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, said success was up to Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is only one key, Mr. Barak has to make the decision,'' Erekat said.
``It is the moment of truth.''
</P>
<P>
	   Erakat was hosting the latest negotiations at his office in the West Bank
town of Jericho, according to a source close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinians, believing that President Clinton wants a deal before the end
of his term, are hoping U.S. intervention can goad Israel into concessions.
</P>
<P>
	   Returning from a meeting with Clinton at the World Economic Forum in Davos,
Switzerland, Arafat said the U.S. president is ``vigilant about pushing the
peace process forward.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinian leader also said that in addition to this week's planned
visit by peace envoy Dennis Ross, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright might
also come to the region.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians want Israel to withdraw from all of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, as well as east Jerusalem -- land captured in the 1967 Mideast war.
Israel said it will never relinquish control over Jerusalem or withdraw to the
1967 lines.

<HEADLINE> UPS Says Earnings Up 37 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ATLANTA (AP) -- United Parcel Service reported a 37 percent increase in net
income for the final three months of 1999, its first quarter as a publicly
traded company.
</P>
<P>
	   The Atlanta-based package delivery giant said Monday that fourth-quarter
earnings were $661 million, or 56 cents a share, compared with $482 million, or
43 cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The fourth-quarter results were a penny above estimates from analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues totaled $7.45 billion, up nearly 12 percent from $6.66 billion in
the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   UPS went public in November with the biggest public stock offering in
history -- $5.47 billion at an opening price of $50 per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of UPS fell $4.81 1/4 to $60.12 1/2, more than 7 percent, in trading
at 5:15 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said that investors could be worried that rapidly rising fuel costs
could squeeze future profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert J. Clanin, UPS chief financial officer, credited the increase in
earnings to strong volume growth in the quarter, when UPS benefited from an
increase in online Christmas shopping.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had a robust peak season, culminating in a record peak day on which we
delivered 18.7 million packages," Clanin said.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that during the holidays, "the UPS Web site also hit a new record,
responding to 3.3 million tracking requests on a single day."
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, UPS earnings totaled $883 million, or 77 cents a share,
compared with $1.74 billion, or $1.57 a share, in 1998. Excluding a one-time
$1.44 billion tax assessment, 1999 earnings were $2.33 billion, or $2.04 a
share.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues rose 9 percent to $27.05 billion from $24.79 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Figures in the earnings report were adjusted so comparisons could be made
between the period before the stock offering and the period afterward, said
company spokesman Norman Black.

<HEADLINE> Baker Hughes' CEO Resigns, Stock Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    HOUSTON (AP) -- Shares of oilfield services giant Baker Hughes Inc. surged
19 percent Monday after chairman, chief executive officer and president Max L.
Lukens resigned.
</P>
<P>
	   Joe B. Foster, chairman of Newfield Exploration Co. and a Baker Hughes
director since 1990, took over as interim chairman, chief executive officer and
president.
</P>
<P>
	   Newfield, an independent oil and gas exploration company based in Houston,
promoted chief operating officer David Trice to fill Foster's post. He already
was set to replace Foster on Feb. 15, but the timetable was accelerated Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Houston-based Baker Hughes named a committee to find a permanent
chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a strong company, and it will attract strong candidates to lead
it," said Foster, 65. "We will search both inside and outside the company and
inside and outside of the oilfield service industry."
</P>
<P>
	   Investors applauded the developments, pushing shares up $3.87 1/2 to $24.68
3/4 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Foster stressed that Lukens' departure was not related to accounting
problems announced in December at the company's Inteq division, which makes
drilling equipment and systems.
</P>
<P>
	   Baker Hughes' shares fell to a 52-week low of $15 after an internal audit
revealed accounting problems that could cost Baker Hughes $40 million to $50
million before taxes.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak rolls out high-speed train - late  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ABOARD THE AMTRAK ACELA (AP) - The inaugural trip on the region's new
high-speed train to New York and Washington got off to an inauspicious start
Monday: a 20-minute delay due to engine trouble.
<P>
	   Still, officials on a ceremonial train trip a few hours later claimed
Amtrak's all-electric Acela Regional train service will reinvigorate rail travel
and cut more than an hour off the five-hour trip to New York. They said the
problem with the earlier train was minor.
</P>
<P>
	   "After 50 years of pouring billions into an ever-expanding Interstate
highway system, there's a new love affair across America for passenger rail,"
said Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, chairman of Amtrak's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
	   A ceremonial train departed - on time - to New York with Thompson, former
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., Amtrak
president George Warrington and federal railroad administrator Jolene Molitoris
on board.
</P>
<P>
	   The train made some of its regular stops in Dedham, Providence, R.I., New
London, Conn., and New Haven, Conn., and New York, where other officials joined
the ceremonial trip. The regular service goes on to Washington, but the
ceremonial trip - which carried no paying passengers - stopped in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're been working at this thing at least since 1975," said Dukakis, vice
chairman of the Amtrak board.
</P>
<P>
	   The trip has been delayed for years while diesel locomotives were swapped in
New Haven with electric engines to complete the ride south.
</P>
<P>
	   The Acela Regional service, which began Monday, is the predecessor to a
planned Express service that will run trains at speeds up to 150 mph on a
three-hour trip to New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Acela trains travel as far south as Washington, but officials say the new
service could have its biggest impact on drivers and airline passengers
traveling in the congested Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a great day for regional transportation in New England," said
Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
	   Cellucci said the faster service fits with the state's efforts to ease the
overburdened Logan International Airport by encouraging other travel options.
</P>
<P>
	   Initially there will be two regional trains a day between Boston and
Washington with stops in Rhode Island, Connecticut and New York, leaving at 6:15
a.m. and 5 p.m. weekdays, with just the later one on weekends.
</P>
<P>
	   Amtrak ultimately hopes to have as many as seven regional trains and 10
Express trains, Warrington said.
</P>
<P>
	   The regional trains will travel at about 110 mph on their four-hour trip
between New York and Boston. Once new signaling equipment is installed, Amtrak
officials said the trains will speed up to 125 mph in some areas.
</P>
<P>
	   The regional trains will shave about 15 minutes off the New
York-to-Washington trip, knocking it down to about three hours and 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The cost of a one-way Acela ticket between New York and Boston will rise
from $50 to $56. The New York-to-Washington fare will remain $84.
</P>
<P>
	   At $112 roundtrip to New York, the train from Boston is cheaper than the
daily shuttle to New York on US Airways. Airline tickets can cost $178 to $394
round-trip to New York on weekdays, depending on how far in advance the ticket
is booked. But the flight time is less than an hour.
</P>
<P>
	   Dukakis said Amtrak hopes to have the faster Express trains running, in
addition to the regional trains, in the next few months after safety testing is
completed.
</P>
<P>
	   But he says it could be years before service stretches farther north than
Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   Donna Rollins, who rode Monday's whistlestop train trip as far as
Providence, R.I., said she thought a route to Portland, Maine, would prove
popular.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Neighbor credited with saving Vonnegut  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Fire marshals were investigating the cause of a fire
that left author Kurt Vonnegut Jr. in critical condition, including reports that
it may have been started by a cigarette.
<P>
	   A small but smoky blaze broke out in the fourth-floor study at Vonnegut's
East Side brownstone Sunday night. A fire department source, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, said marshals believe the blaze may have caused by a
cigarette left burning in the room.
</P>
<P>
	   Fire Department spokesman Michael Regan said marshals have determined the
fire was not suspicious but said the cause was still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The 77-year-old writer - known for satirical and darkly humorous novels
including "Cat's Cradle" and "Slaughterhouse-Five" - suffered smoke inhalation
trying to extinguish the blaze, Regan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Vonnegut was in critical but stable condition in the intensive care unit,
said New York Presbyterian hospital spokeswoman Peggy Sung. They released no
further information.
</P>
<P>
	   Fire officials credited Vonnegut's neighbor, Hans von Stackelberg, with
saving the author, as well as his wife, celebrity photographer Jill Krementz;
and their daughter, Lily, 17, from serious harm. The fire, which caused minor
damage one room, was reported shortly after it began and firefighters had it
under control in 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't consider myself a hero," said von Stackelberg, who is acting head
of the German consulate in New York. "In fact, if the fire brigade hadn't
arrived when it did I would have left the scene because I was scared."
</P>
<P>
	   Though not willing to accept the title of hero, von Stackelberg went into
the burning room with Vonnegut. Using small, plastic salad bowls and water from
a nearby bathroom faucet, the pair tried to douse the flames.
</P>
<P>
	   As the room continued to fill with thick, acrid smoke, von Stackelberg
warned Vonnegut to leave and helped guide him to safety.
</P>
<P>
	   "When he didn't come out of the room, I shouted to him, 'Mr. Vonnegut, you
have to get out of there,"' von Stackelberg said. "I know he was working in the
study. Maybe he was trying to collect some material. When he finally came out, I
grabbed him by the hand and led him to the staircase."
</P>
<P>
	   Von Stackelberg said the real hero of the night was his 17-year-old daughter
Filippa, who called 911. "All I did was rush out of the house like an idiot," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   None of Vonnegut's family knew of the fire at first. Von Stackelberg said
Krementz was walking out the door when he rushed over, Vonnegut was on the
ground floor and Lily Vonnegut was in her bedroom.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was sheer coincidence I even saw the fire," the diplomat said. "We
normally close the shutters in that room but this night we didn't. I don't know
why." He said he was gazing out on the falling snow when he spotted the flames.
</P>
<P>
	   Fire officials said Vonnegut had been watching the Super Bowl in his study
and went downstairs when the fire erupted.
</P>
<P>
	   Von Stackelberg is friendly with Vonnegut's wife, but had never met the
author, who is known for his novels, short stories, essays and plays filled with
black humor, fantastic plots and often apocalyptic destruction.
</P>
<P>
	   Vonnegut has written 19 novels, including "Breakfast of Champions" and
"Hocus Pocus." His last major work, "Timequake," was published in 1997.

<HEADLINE> U.N.: Iraq Can Have Pencils  </HEADLINE>
   By LEON BARKHO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- The United Nations said Monday that pencils are coming
into Iraq under a U.N.-authorized program, contradicting reports that the world
body is banning imports of the writing tools.
</P>
<P>
	   The world body made the assertion just hours after a group in Jordan ferried
3.5 million pencils to Iraq in the belief that the United Nations had banned
pencils for fear the graphite lead could be put to military use.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To my knowledge there is no ban on pencils and they have been coming in
plentiful quantities,'' said George Somerwill, the U.N. spokesman in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that experts said it was ``extremely unlikely'' that pencil
graphite could be used for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   The pencil shipment, sent by a group called the National Mobilization
Committee for the Defense of Iraq, was being handed over to the Iraqi Students
Union on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sonia Twal, a spokesperson for the Jordanians, said Monday in Amman that her
group's information about a pencil ban was obtained from U.N. lists of banned
imports to Iraq and confirmed by the Iraqi Embassy in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe that our donation is ... a gesture to highlight the plight of
Iraqis under the sanctions,'' Twal said.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq is under trade sanctions for invading Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions
have crippled the economy, leading to international criticism that the standoff
with the United Nations is hurting ordinary Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1996, the United Nations has allowed Iraq oil sales of $5.2 billion
every six months under an oil-for-food deal. The proceeds are used to buy food,
medicines and educational materials.
</P>
<P>
	   Somerwill said confusion may have arisen after the United Nations stalled a
pencil shipment several years ago. The question then was whether food and
medicine should be given priority, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Book shops in Baghdad brim with pencils and each Iraqi pupil is given about
12 pencils a year by the government.

<HEADLINE> New Talks on Cyprus Reunification  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX EFTY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GENEVA (AP) -- A demand by Turkish Cypriots for recognition of their
breakaway state was on the table at the opening of a new round of talks to
reunite the divided island, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Cyprus' Greek and Turkish leaders, who have been unable to agree on
face-to-face talks, held separate meetings with Annan on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkish Cypriots' demand that their state be recognized -- even within a
unified island -- has been a main obstacle to ending a conflict that began with
Turkey's 1974 invasion and occupation of the island's northern third.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All issues are on the table and we will discuss them all without any
preconditions,'' Annan said. In the past, U.N. Security Council resolutions have
condemned Turkey's invasion and ruled out recognition of a Turkish state.
</P>
<P>
	   After Annan's meetings with President Glafcos Clerides, the Greek Cypriot
leader and later with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, the
secretary-general said ``the process is likely to be complex and difficult.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clerides said he and Annan had discussed the same ``core issues'' as during
the first round of talks in New York last month, but ``in greater detail.''
</P>
<P>
	   The New York talks came after a break of more than two years prompted by the
seemingly insurmountable Turkish demand for recognition.
</P>
<P>
	   Following his meeting with Annan, Denktash repeated the demand, urging
acceptance of the ``reality'' of the Turkish Cypriot state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you don't accept that, how can you unite?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Denktash has refused to meet directly with Clerides unless his state is
recognized internationally as a prelude to reunification under a two-state
confederation. At the moment, it is recognized only by Turkey, which maintains
35,000 troops there.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, Clerides said: ``Denktash may
raise the issue of recognition but this is ruled out by the Security Council
resolutions and by repeated statements by President Clinton and the European
Union.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we are discussing is the reunification of Cyprus as a federal state
with a single sovereignty and nationality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. Security Council resolutions call for the reunification of Cyprus in a
bizonal federation with a single sovereignty, the return of refugees created by
the 1974 invasion and the withdrawal of the Turkish troops and 50,000 mainland
settlers from the north.
</P>
<P>
	   The Turkish side rejects the resolutions, and insists instead that the
breakaway state be recognized within a two-state confederation where Greek and
Turkish Cypriots live apart.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan said the recent improvement in the relations between Greece and Turkey
following last month's European Union summit in Helsinki, which accepted Turkey
as a candidate for membership ``is a very positive factor'' in the search for a
Cyprus settlement.

<HEADLINE> When 'Superman' walks, does it raise false hopes?  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The computer-faked image of America's best-known
quadriplegic rising to his feet and walking onstage has disabled groups and
researchers cheering - but also warning about false hope.
<P>
	   In an ad for Nuveen Investments that aired during Sunday's Super Bowl,
"Superman" actor Christopher Reeve, who was paralyzed in a fall from a horse in
1995, appears to be among those gathering in an auditorium of the future to
present an award for research that cured spinal cord injury.
</P>
<P>
	   He gets up from a chair, then walks somewhat haltingly to the stage and
stands with other beneficiaries of the research.
</P>
<P>
	   "The ad has a wonderful emotional appeal to it," said Dalton Dietrich,
scientific director of the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis. "And if it focuses
more attention on the need for research, that would be wonderful too."
</P>
<P>
	   Though no precise date is given for the gathering, it is sometime after
2006. An announcer says breakthroughs have been made by then against cancer and
AIDS. The New York skyline has some new skyscrapers but Reeve looks barely older
than he does today.
</P>
<P>
	   That might raise expectations unreasonably, said Mercedes Rauen, executive
director of the Illinois chapter of the National Spinal Cord Injury Association.
</P>
<P>
	   "It would be dreadful to live without hope but hope has to be tempered with
reality," she said. "I know people who have been injured fairly recently who
believe they're going to be cured based on reports they've seen in the news
media and that's pretty alarming. It becomes an additional devastation when it
doesn't come true."
</P>
<P>
	   Dietrich said, "I'm very enthusiastic about what we're doing in the field of
regeneration. But when it will occur, that's the problem. I'm a very
conservative scientist and I cannot put a time period on it."
</P>
<P>
	   He said that whenever there's news about an advance in spinal cord research,
"everyone thinks paralysis is going to be cured relatively soon. We don't think
that's really the case. It's going to be just like cancer research and diabetes,
a multiple small-step kind of approach."
</P>
<P>
	   "I would be happy if in five years we will have some type of clinical
protocol where we'll target a subpopulation of spinal cord injury individuals,
we'll try to get them to move their arm, for example. That would be wonderful,
and then once we learn that, we can move on to the broader questions of curing
all types of paralysis and getting someone to walk."
</P>
<P>
	   Reeves, who is 47, acknowledged Monday that he has been criticized for his
unceasing optimism that he will be able to walk again.
</P>
<P>
	   "The biggest problem actually is people who have been in a chair for a very
long time, because in order to survive psychologically they have had to accept,
'OK, I'm going to have to spend my life in a chair,"' Reeve said on ABC's "Good
Morning America."
</P>
<P>
	   "So I get shots from some of them, you know, that I don't know what I am
talking about."
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement issued through Nuveen, he insisted that the scene in the
commercial is "something that can actually happen. Most scientists agree that
with enough money and talent focused on spinal cord repair, the goal of walking
within the foreseeable future is a very real possibility."
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Allen of Nuveen said the point of the ad is "to inspire a dialogue on
money, to have a new dialogue and get away from buying bigger boats and bigger
cars and think about the impact that money can have on the future. ...
Christopher Reeve is a symbol of the opportunity we have to invest in lots of
things that could lead to very good and positive results."
</P>
<P>
	   James Peters, executive director of the Eastern Paralyzed Veterans
Association and a paralyzed veteran himself, said, "The idea that Reeves is
bringing home, that there is hope for a cure to spinal paralysis and reason to
be enthusiastic, is certainly a welcome attitude. ... But the date positive when
the cure will come, and how it will affect those who are already afflicted,
those are kind of big questions in our minds still."

<HEADLINE> Dollar Is Higher on Stock Rally  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar, pushed ahead by a stock rally, rumbled higher
against other currencies Monday and set another high mark against the euro.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro went as low as 96.75 cents Monday, another in a series of low
points against the dollar, before recovering somewhat to 96.99 cents in late
trading. The euro also had a tough day on Friday, settling at 97.78 cents in New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders have been pushing down the fledgling European currency, which turned
1 year old this month, to see how far policy-makers will let it go. Prospects
for strong U.S. growth and another rate increase also have been making the
dollar more attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
	   But the euro scraped a bit higher against the dollar Monday after European
Central Bank president Wim Duisenberg warned that persistent euro weakness might
increase the risk of inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   Some traders took the remarks to mean that the bank, which has so far been
loathe to raise interest rates or take other steps to influence the currency's
level in the marketplace, may grow concerned enough about the euro's weakness to
take action.
</P>
<P>
	   Another day of stronger blue-chip stock prices helped propel the dollar
higher. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 201.66 to 10,940.53, its steepest
point gain in more than three weeks, as investors picked up stocks that had been
slammed in a selloff last week.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currency trading, the dollar was quoted at 107.42 Japanese yen, up
from 106.98 yen late Friday. The dollar also was quoted at 1.6580 Swiss francs,
up from 1.6468, and 1.4467 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4430. The British pound
fell to $1.6150 from $1.6210.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer
traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Based on Monday's
euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.0165 German marks, up from 2.0006; 6.7631
French francs, up from 6.7085; and 1,996.36 Italian lire, up from 1,980.23.

<HEADLINE> Bird Fungus May Threaten People  </HEADLINE>
    By JOANN LOVIGLIO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- People with weakened immune systems who come in contact
with birds may be putting themselves at risk for developing life-threatening
illnesses, according to a study.
</P>
<P>
	   The meningitis death of 72-year-old Boston woman might have been caused by
breathing an airborne fungus found in bird feces, researchers report in a study
published Tuesday in the Annals of Internal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   The woman was infected with the Cryptococcus neoformans fungus and died 39
days after she was diagnosed. The fungus enters through the lungs and the
resulting infection can develop into meningitis or other ailments.
</P>
<P>
	   The fungus typically causes no problems for people with normal immune
systems. However, the woman had undergone a liver transplant in 1989 and was
taking rejection-fighting drugs, which suppress the body's immune system.
</P>
<P>
	   The woman did not live on the same floor as or provide care for a pet
cockatoo kept in the house where she lived, but she did pass its cage often.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers from New York's Albert Einstein Medical Center and the Boston
University School of Medicine found that the fungus strains in the bird's feces
and in the woman's body were virtually the same, which they say strongly
suggests the woman was infected by the bird.
</P>
<P>
	   Though many researchers believe exposure to birds and cryptococcal infection
in humans are linked, it has never been proven. The fungus is found throughout
nature, said Dr. Arturo Casadevall of Einstein Medical Center, one of the
study's authors.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't know a lot on the basis of one case so we shouldn't be making any
sweeping recommendations about what people should do," Casadevall said.
"Ideally, what we want is for physicians and patients to be aware that this is a
potential problem for immunosuppressed people."

<HEADLINE> Consumer Groups Urge Phone Fee Cuts  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Leading consumer groups said Monday they have devised a
way to slash $4 billion a year from home and business telephone bills -- even
for people who make few long-distance calls.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal, submitted to the Federal Communications Commission, would
reduce one line-item charge that consumers now see on their monthly bills and
eliminate another.
</P>
<P>
	   The coalition of groups backing the plan, including Consumers Union, the
Consumer Federation of America, the National Retail Federation and AARP, say the
innovation would take several dollars off the bottom of every home and business
phone bill.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This would guarantee that every consumer, regardless of how much calling
they do, would get the benefit of declining industry costs,'' said Gene
Kimmelman, co-director of Consumers Union's Washington office.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal responds to a plan offered by the phone industry this summer to
reduce by $5.6 billion a year ``access'' fees that local phone companies charge
long-distance carriers to connect calls.
</P>
<P>
	   If long-distance companies pass on the savings, the companies contended,
their customers would see lower rates. They predicted that total charges by
phone companies to consumers would fall by at least $5.8 billion over five
years. In turn, certain flat-rate fees on local phone bills would be
consolidated and would go up over time. Backers of the industry proposal, which
has been submitted to the FCC for consideration, include Bell Atlantic,
BellSouth, GTE, SBC, AT&AMP;T and Sprint.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer advocates have argued against the industry plan on the ground that
it contains no guarantee that long-distance companies will pass on the savings
to consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if the rates do fall slightly, that wouldn't offset the increases in
monthly fees, said Kimmelman. He said most people don't make enough
long-distance calls to benefit from rates going down if the fixed charges go up
over time.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies deny that low-volume callers would be adversely affected by
the plan.
</P>
<P>
	   The consumer plan would take $1 off the cost of the phone line from the
local phone company into the home. That charge, identified on monthly bills as
the Subscriber Line Charge, is now capped at $3.50 a month.
</P>
<P>
	   The consumer proposal also would get rid of another charge, which pays for
long-distance companies' use of the local phone network. That item varies by
company but averages about $1.50 per month.
</P>
<P>
	   The phone companies can afford the cut if they recover costs from customers
more in line with their actual expenses, said Mark Cooper, research director of
Consumer Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
	   Cooper said consumers will save even more over the course of the next four
years as regulators continue to cut access charges to reflect local phone
companies' connection costs better. This should lead to lower per-minute
long-distance rates for customers, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The industry coalition immediately rebuked the consumer plan as
shortsighted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They want to issue price controls to drive savings for consumers, when the
clear trend is to use the marketplace to drive savings for consumers,'' said
John Nakahata, a lawyer with the Washington firm Harris, Wiltshire &AMP; Grannis,
who represents the companies.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that the industry proposal contains a provision to keep local phone
service affordable to poor people and customers living in rural areas, while the
consumer plan does not.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're just abandoning rural America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC put out the industry plan for comment last year, but has said it is
interested in hearing from consumer groups.

<HEADLINE> President Marks Black History Month  </HEADLINE>
   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton on Monday marked Black History Month by
noting the 40th anniversary of the Greensboro, N.C. sit-ins that ``galvanized
young men and women of conscience across America'' to push Jim Crow segregation
into its grave.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said four freshmen from North Carolina A&AMP;T College actually
performed a service to their country by sitting quietly at a whites-only lunch
counter on Feb. 1, 1960. He said their action touched off dramatic sit-ins in
nine states that wore down segregation in restaurants, theaters and concert
halls, and led to a broader call for equality in housing, health care and
education.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The extraordinary bravery and determination of Ezell Blair Jr., Franklin
McCain, Joseph McNeil and David Richmond galvanized young men and women of
conscience across America,'' Clinton said. ``Their story of conscience and
conviction and their ultimate triumph continue to inspire us today.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said all Americans should view Black History Month as a chance to
``discover anew a treasure of stories about the triumph of the human spirit. ...
These stories are not only an important part of African American history, but an
essential part of American history.''
</P>
<P>
	   As he did last year, the president issued a proclamation declaring February
as ``National African American History Month,'' using the increasingly popular
reference to black Americans. He set ``Heritage and Horizons: The African
American Legacy and the Challenges of the 21st Century'' as the theme for this
year's observances.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is a reminder that the new century on which we have just embarked
offers us a unique opportunity to write our own chapter in the history of
African Americans and of our nation,'' Clinton said. ``We can teach our children
that America's story has been written by men and women of every race and creed
and ethnic background. We can ensure that our laws, our actions, and our words
honor the rights and dignity of every human being.''
</P>
<P>
	   The observance, honoring the contributions of black Americans, was started
by historian Carter G. Woodson in 1926 as Negro History Week. It became Black
History Week in the early 1970s, and expanded to a month in 1976.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rise: Dow Ends Up 201.66  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average rebounded Monday as
investors snapped up shares of companies battered in last week's selloff. The
Dow's strength lifted other market measures out of a slump despite lingering
worries that interest rates are headed higher.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow rose 201.66 to 10,940.53, its steepest point gain since Jan. 7. The
rally helped the Nasdaq composite index bounce back from a midday loss of 120
points to close up 53.28 at 3,940.35.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 34.30 to 1,394.46.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks rose on a surprising wave of strength from bank and brokerage stocks.
American Express, up 6 1/2 to 164 3/4, and J.P. Morgan, up 4 7/8 to 122 15/16,
led the Dow's advance.
</P>
<P>
	   Those stocks typically falter when investors are worried about rising
interest rates. But after sending most financial stocks lower last week,
investors opted Monday to punish highly priced technology stocks instead. And
with market enthusiasm still running fairly high, many investors turned back to
financial shares as relative bargains, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dow components Exxon Mobil and 3M also posted substantial gains. Exxon Mobil
rose 4 9/16 to 83 7/16 and 3M gained 1 3/8 to 93 5/8.
</P>
<P>
	   For most of the session, blue-chip industrial shares rose at the expense of
the technology sector. The Nasdaq composite fell as much as 120 points and
appeared likely to extend Friday's 152-point plunge.
</P>
<P>
	   But the technology-dominated index turned around partly because of a sharp
rise in Qualcomm, its best performing stock in 1999. Qualcomm has slumped in
recent sessions, and at its lowered price, may now be more appealing to buyers,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some of these stocks that have been in the stratosphere are just coming
back to more realistic levels," said Nick Sargen, chief investment strategist
for J.P. Morgan's private client group.
</P>
<P>
	   Qualcomm gained 16 7/16 to 127. Bargain-hunting also helped lift Yahoo!,
which gained 8 9/16 to 322 1/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading was volatile as the Fed's Open Market Committee prepared to meet in
Washington Tuesday and Wednesday. Most economists expect the Fed to raise
interest rates a quarter percentage point, but some analysts are forecasting a
steeper increase.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest sign that sharply higher interest rates may be needed to slow the
nation's runaway economic growth came Monday from the Commerce Department. The
department said personal income, which includes wages, interest and government
benefits, increased by 0.3 percent last month. That was weaker than many
analysts were expecting.
</P>
<P>
	   But the department also said spending rose a brisk 0.8 percent, helping to
push the personal savings rate to an all-time low. Feverish consumer spending
has been a major driver of the economic boom.
</P>
<P>
	   "Over the past few weeks, investors have become progressively more nervous
about the strong economy," said John H. Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist
at Advest Inc., who expects the Fed to raise rates this week, and again in March
and in May.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaughnessy said interest rate worries are likely to dominate trading until
the economy shows some sign of slowing down.
</P>
<P>
	   "Looking ahead, we are going to have to deal with a very volatile stock
market," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-7 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 1.19 billion shares, compared
with 1.31 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 8.39 to 496.23.
</P>
<P>
	   The market's three most widely used barometers wrapped up a rocky month with
a full slate of losses. The Dow ended January down about 5 percent; the S&AMP;P 500
index lost about 5 percent and the Nasdaq fell about 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Market historians warn that a market decline in January typically leads to a
decline for the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.5 percent. European indexes
were sharply lower, with Germany's Xetra DAX index down 3.3 percent, Britain's
FT-SE 100 down 1.7 percent, and France's CAC-40 down 1.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Gov't. Plans Billions in Debt Cuts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government anticipates paying off $17 billion of the
national debt this quarter and expects to pay a record $152 billion in the
April-June quarter, the Treasury Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Retirement of a portion of the $5.7 trillion in national debt is occurring
because of record budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   "By making the tough choices necessary to turn record deficits into record
surpluses, we are now in a position to start paying down the debt," President
Clinton said in a statement. "By the end of this fiscal year, we will have
repaid approximately $300 billion in debt."
</P>
<P>
	   For all of fiscal year 1999, which ended Sept. 30, the government reported a
record surplus of $124.4 billion. That followed a $69.2 billion surplus in 1998,
the first time the government finished in the black since 1969.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration is predicting a $142.5 billion surplus for fiscal
2000. If a surplus materializes as expected, it would be the first time the
government reported three consecutive years of surpluses since 1947, 1948 and
1949.
</P>
<P>
	   For the current January-March quarter, the $17 billion of the national debt
that Treasury said the government expects to pay is bigger than an earlier
estimate of $12 billion.

<HEADLINE> Labor Leader Pleads Guilty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BOSTON (AP) -- The former head of the Laborers' International Union of North
America pleaded guilty Monday to a fraud charge in a scheme that prosecutors
said allowed him to evade $100,000 in taxes on expensive sports cars.
</P>
<P>
	   Arthur A. Coia, 56, of Barrington, R.I., pleaded guilty to a federal mail
fraud charge in evading state and local taxes in Rhode Island on a succession of
Ferraris.
</P>
<P>
	   Coia and the government agreed on a sentence of two years probation, along
with $100,000 in restitution to Rhode Island and the town of Barrington, and a
$10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge George O'Toole accepted the plea at a hearing Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Coia's attorney, Howard Gutman of Washington, said Coia was the first person
to be criminally prosecuted for evading state car taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   "He clearly did the conduct, but was the first person ever to be so
prosecuted. I draw no other conclusions," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Coia retired as general president of the union at the beginning of the year.
As part of the plea agreement, Coia also agreed to be barred from any future
role in the union or its related entities and to be barred from being an
employee of any other union for a period of five years.
</P>
<P>
	   The union has more than 800,000 members, mostly in the construction,
environmental cleanup and maintenance industries.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1980s, President Reagan's Commission on Organized Crime accused the
union of having mob ties. In 1995, the union entered a formal agreement with the
Justice Department, promising to remove alleged mob lieutenants from its ranks
and hold direct elections of its officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Corruption investigations reached as high as Coia. But last year, Coia was
cleared by an independent hearing officer of charges that he had ties to
organized crime.

<HEADLINE> Leader: Oust Indonesian Army Chief  </HEADLINE>
   By EDITH M. LEDERER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Indonesia's President Abdurrahman Wahid called Monday
for ex-army chief Gen. Wiranto to ``resign at once'' from the government after
U.N. and Indonesian investigators implicated the military leadership in last
year's campaign of terror in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid, Indonesia's first democratically elected head of state in four
decades, told a news conference in Davos, Switzerland that Wiranto should ``be
examined by an internal court'' -- not an international tribunal, which U.N.
investigators called for on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto headed Indonesia's military during a bloody rampage that following
an Aug. 30 U.N.-organized referendum in which the people of East Timor voted
overwhelmingly to separate from Indonesia and become independent. He now holds
the powerful post of political affairs and security minister in Wahid's Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   Human rights activists have repeatedly blamed Jakarta's military and
pro-Indonesian militias in East Timor for the campaign of murder and
destruction. But reports issued separately Monday by the U.N. commission and
Indonesia's state-appointed commission gave official weight to the charges.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indonesian commission accused Wiranto and 32 other military officers of
``crimes against humanity.''
</P>
<P>
	   It said ``facts show the civilian and military apparatus, including the
police, cooperated with the militias to create an atmosphere that supported''
crimes including mass killings, torture, kidnapping and sexual slavery.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. commission did not name individuals but concluded that the campaign
of terror and intimidation ``would not have been possible without the active
involvement of the Indonesian army, and the knowledge and approval of the top
military command.''
</P>
<P>
	   The five U.N. investigators called for the United Nations to establish ``an
international human rights tribunal'' to prosecute those responsible.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indonesian government has vehemently opposed an international court,
insisting as Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab reiterated Monday that it is
``functioning and capable of dispensing justice.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has said that Indonesia should be given
the opportunity to prosecute those responsible before a decision is made on
whether the United Nations should take action.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson didn't endorse either
a local or international tribunal, but said it was ``heartening'' that Indonesia
had announced its intention to prosecute those responsible for human rights
violations.
</P>
<P>
	   Even East Timor's top independence leaders appeared divided over the next
steps.
</P>
<P>
	   Jose Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao said the East Timorese weren't looking for
revenge or jail terms for Wiranto and other generals. ``We just want them to
recognize and acknowledge their involvement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Nobel laureate Jose Ramos-Horta said Wiranto should face an
international war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In this day and age, you cannot kill hundreds of people, destroy a whole
country and then just get fired,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Indonesia's military exercised great power during the country's
authoritarian past, but Wahid dismissed suggestions that the army might stage a
coup because he wants Wiranto's resignation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know my country,'' Wahid said. ``I know my army.''

<HEADLINE> EU Threatens To Cut Austria Ties  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE JAHN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- The European Union warned Monday it would take the
unprecedented step of severing most political contacts with any Austrian
government that includes a far-right party whose leader has praised aspects of
Adolph Hitler's regime.
</P>
<P>
	   The warning followed a series of verbal attacks by Joerg Haider on the
leaders of France and Belgium for opposing any role for his party in the
Austrian government. The center-right Austrian People's Party has been holding
talks with Haider's populist anti-immigration Freedom Party, which finished
second in inconclusive elections in October.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider shrugged off the EU's warning, saying it was his critics -- and not
himself -- who were antidemocratic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am somewhat horrified how lightly one takes democracy in a country such
as Austria,'' Haider said Monday, describing the warnings as ``an attempt to
take influence from the outside'' on Austria's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   If the Freedom Party becomes part of a governing coalition, the 14 other
European Union members would curtail bilateral contacts with Vienna, oppose
Austrian appointments to international organizations and keep contacts with
Austrian ambassadors to a minimum, said an EU statement issued in Lisbon,
Portugal.
</P>
<P>
	   The threat signaled EU determination not only to combat what it feels are
undemocratic developments in a member country but also to send a message to
other right-wing groups that they would not be tolerated in a politically
leading role.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider won international notoriety a decade ago after praising Hitler's
``orderly employment policy,'' and later for lauding veterans of the Waffen SS
as ``decent people of good character.'' Since then, he has apologized for those
statements.
</P>
<P>
	   After the EU's warning, Austria's top diplomat to the European Union, Gregor
Woschnagg, left Brussels, Belgium, the EU capital, for Vienna. His
representatives denied the move was in response to the threat, saying the trip
had been planned in advance.
</P>
<P>
	   Just hours earlier, Haider expressed regret over his sharp criticism of
French and Belgian leaders but said they must respect the outcome of elections
that propelled his party to national prominence.
</P>
<P>
	   Prior to a meeting with Austrian President Thomas Klestil, Haider said he
wanted ``no conflict with Belgium and France,'' although he had called the
Belgian government ``corrupt'' and said French President Jacques Chirac was
ignorant of Austrian politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Klestil, in a statement after meeting Haider, said he had urged him to
temper his language.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Monday, Haider told reporters he expected negotiations with the
Austrian People's Party of Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel to be wrapped up
perhaps Tuesday so the new center-right coalition could assume power. Talks
continued after the EU warning, and the two parties agreed on a proposed budget
-- one of the most divisive issues -- by late Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed coalition between the Freedom Party and the People's Party
would control 104 seats in the 183-member parliament, and would likely have
Schuessel as its chancellor.

<HEADLINE> Corzine, Gormley set pace in raising money for congressional races  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Two candidates for U.S. Senate, Democrat Jon S.
Corzine and Republican William Gormley, each raised more than $1 million from
political donors in the final six months of 1999, setting the pace for campaign
2000 in New Jersey.
<P>
	   Corzine, the former chairman of Goldman Sachs, raised more than $1.4
million, loaned himself more than $2.65 million and spent more than $3.2 million
in the final six months of 1999, according to newly released finance reports. He
entered 2000 with $891,990 in the bank.
</P>
<P>
	   His opponent, former Gov. Jim Florio, raised $508,300, loaned himself
$200,000 and spent $440,000 over those six months. He entered the year with
$796,341.
</P>
<P>
	   Gormley, a state senator, raised $1.53 million and entered 2000 with $1.51
million. The best-funded of his opponents for the Republican nomination, Rep.
Bob Franks of Berkeley Heights, raised $876,296 and entered the election year
with $751,025, plus a debt of $5,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaign finance reports covering the six months ending Dec. 31, 1999, had
to be postmarked and on their way to the Federal Election Commission by close of
business Monday. Many campaigns agreed to provide reporters with two-page
summaries.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey's Senate race and the House contests in the 5th and 12th
districts will be among the most closely watched campaigns in the country this
year. The outcomes could affect whether Republicans hold their majorities in
both houses of Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   In the crowded 5th district, where at least five Republicans hope to succeed
Franks, the pacesetter is Mike Ferguson, who raised $126,106 in the second half
of 1999 and loaned himself $200,000. He began the year with $387,843.
</P>
<P>
	   And in the 12th district, freshman Democratic Rep. Rush Holt of Pennington,
one of the Republican Party's biggest targets this year, raised $377,626 in the
final six months of last year and entered 2000 with a hefty war chest of
$665,340.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Rep. Richard Zimmer, seeking the Republican nod to challenge Holt,
reported raising $164,025 in the last six months and entered 2000 with $442,112.
Former Rep. Michael Pappas, who lost to Holt in 1998, raised $73,211 and entered
the year with $61,439.
</P>
<P>
	   With a personal net worth estimated at $300 million, Corzine is spending
lavishly in his campaign for the Democratic nomination for Senate. His two
campaign managers, Christy Davis and Steven Goldstein, each make $20,000 a
month. The campaign is paying its top consulting agency, Message &AMP; Media,
$50,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
	   In defense of the big-dollar effort, Corzine supporters said they have an
uphill climb to compete against Florio.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will take substantial resources to match a career politician who is well
known, who has provided benefits for a lot of people, and who's apparently
committed to running a highly negative campaign," said Orin Kramer, Corzine's
finance chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Murphy, the co-chairman of the Florio campaign, retorted that
Corzine's operation "is all about money. It's like doing battle with a
bottomless checkbook."
</P>
<P>
	   Among other Republicans running for Senate, Essex County Executive James
Treffinger reported raising $694,429 in the last six months of 1999. Murray
Sabrin, the 1997 Libertarian Party candidate for governor, raised $102,559.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 5th congressional district, besides Ferguson, Assemblyman Joel
Weingarten, R-Essex, raised $108,375; Tom Kean Jr., son of former Gov. Thomas H.
Kean, raised $93,981; and Patrick Morrisey, a former congressional staff member,
raised $86,308.
</P>
<P>
	   Ferguson ran for House in the adjacent 6th district last year and prepared
for a second run before moving to the 7th district. Morrisey highlighted that
fact Monday in challenging Ferguson to offer his contributors their money back.
</P>
<P>
	   Ferguson replied, "I think New Jersey voter are tired of these sorts of
negative attacks. My supporters know where I'm running and they know why I'm
running."
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side in the 5th district, Fanwood Mayor Maryanne Connelly
reported that she raised $164,317 in the last six months of 1999 and entered
2000 with $189,049. She still owes $49,000 from a loan she took to run against
Franks in 1998.

their votes Monday in a rough-and-tumble election that featured allegations of
corruption, pacts with gangsters and a secret deal with a religious sect.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 60,000 people are registered to vote for 21 legislators and the leader
of the party with the largest number of seats becomes prime minister.
Preliminary results were expected Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign has been dominated by the Dominica Labor Party's charges that
the government's selling of passports to wealthy foreigners is besmirching the
island's image.
</P>
<P>
	   The party warns the practice may make travel more difficult for islanders
and their relatives who have left the country. Dominica has less than 80,000
residents, but another 100,000 live abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   Jasmine Felix, an 18-year-old teacher who was voting for the first time, was
more concerned that the government was not getting enough money for the
passports. Under the ``Economic Citizenship'' program, agents can charge
whatever they want as long as they give the government $50,000 for each
``investor'' who gets a passport.
</P>
<P>
	   ``St. Kitts charges $200,000. We should get more,'' said Felix.
</P>
<P>
	   Prime Minister Edison James denies Labor Party charges that some of the
estimated 1,000 economic citizens are criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   James, a member of the United Workers Party, is looking for a second term
and has been promoting his government's record of building homes, schools and
water pipelines. The government also plans to build an international airport in
hopes of quadrupling the number of tourists.
</P>
<P>
	   He has also touted the island's economic growth of 3.5 percent last year,
despite troubles within the banana industry, the biggest earner of foreign
exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 2,500 of the island's 5,000 farmers have deserted the fields, James
said, since the United States successfully challenged Caribbean banana
producers' preferred status in the European market.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. State Department has also criticized Dominica's economic
citizenship program. In a report last year, it said passports had been sold to
some 300 Russians. Noting the increasing power of Russian gangs, the report said
the passport sales raised concerns of money laundering in Dominica.
</P>
<P>
	   Islanders became concerned after Canada arrested several Chinese people
carrying Dominica passports on suspicion that they are involved in an
immigration smuggling ring run by Chinese gangs.
</P>
<P>
	   James says Labor has no proof of its charges. But his party has already been
hurt by revelations that his government loaned $38 million from the country's
social security fund to developers.
</P>
<P>
	   James says the money will be paid back, but the loans have outraged workers.
</P>
<P>
	   The government's embarrassments have kindled hope among the Labor Party that
it can stage a comeback.
</P>
<P>
	   The Labor Party dominated politics here from 1961 to 1979, when strikes and
internal bickering led to its ouster by the Dominica Freedom Party, which was
dominated by former plantation owners.
</P>
<P>
	   Now the Freedom Party is a minor contender, but it could tip the balance by
forming a coalition with Labor to keep James out of power.
</P>
<P>
	   Fearing a Labor resurgence, James repeated charges Sunday that its leader,
Rosie Douglas, had met with leaders of the South Korea-based Unification Church
and would allow it to return to Dominica. Several Caribbean countries expelled
the group, headed by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, two years ago because they
consider it a cult.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you elect Rosie Douglas, then the Moonies will come in and our
Christian way of life -- the good way of life -- all that will disappear,''
James warned at a final rally Sunday.

<HEADLINE> 3 Israeli Soldiers Killed in Ambush  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA KING Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Stung by the deaths of three Israeli soldiers in south
Lebanon, Prime Minister Ehud Barak said there would be no new peace talks with
Syria until the Damascus government reins in the Islamic militant Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Israel will not be able to negotiate peace as long as the Syrians do not
restrain Hezbollah from acting against the Israeli army,'' said a Defense
Ministry statement issued hours after the bloody attack, which also wounded four
Israeli soldiers, one critically. One of the dead was an Israeli major.
</P>
<P>
	   Before and after Hezbollah's strike in Israel's self-declared security zone
in south Lebanon, Israeli warplanes staged nine air raids against suspected
guerrilla positions, the army said. The extent of casualties from the airstrikes
was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
	   The violence, the worst in southern Lebanon in six months, comes as the
United States has been seeking to bring Israel and Syria back to the bargaining
table. Negotiations resumed in December after a four-year hiatus, but broke down
in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria said it pulled out of the talks due to Israel's refusal to commit in
advance to a total withdrawal from the disputed Golan Heights, and over what
kind of a demilitarized area would exist there.
</P>
<P>
	   Following Monday's attack -- which came only a day after Hezbollah
assassinated the man considered No. 2 in Israel's allied militia, the South
Lebanon Army -- Barak used his bluntest language yet to implicate Syria in
Hezbollah's actions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is ... the Syrians, not just Hezbollah, who are behind supply lines and
freedom of movement'' for the guerrillas, Barak, a former military chief of
staff, told lawmakers from his One Israel faction.
</P>
<P>
	   With 30,000 troops in Lebanon, Syria is its neighbor's main power broker.
Israel has longed maintained that Syria has tacitly approved -- and in some
cases, encouraged -- the flow of arms to Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Defense Ministry statement, Barak used language that in the past has
foreshadowed a major Israeli counterattack. ``We have known in the past, and we
still know, (how) to strike at the place and time of our choosing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak described the recent violence, including the death of another Israeli
soldier last week, as a ``grave intensification ... that Israel would not allow
to continue.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, U.S. officials said they didn't read Barak's statement as
setting preconditions for continuing talks, but rather as an assessment that
Hezbollah's attacks were a threat to peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We condemn the violence and urge restraint on all parties that have
influence in the region,'' said David Leavy, spokesman for the National Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
	   With Israeli combat deaths in one month in Lebanon now at four -- already
one-third of last year's total -- Barak repeated his campaign pledge to pull his
troops out of Lebanon ``as soon as possible, in an orderly fashion.''
</P>
<P>
	   He and his Cabinet have argued that Israel's northern border could be more
adequately defended from the Israeli side, with less loss of life.
</P>
<P>
	   The prime minister's move marked a dramatic turnabout. In the weeks since
the talks with Syria broke down, Barak has tried to woo Damascus with flattering
statements about Syria's President Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
	   Top political associates of Barak quickly joined in calls to stop dealings
with the Syrians while the Lebanon violence continues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our boys are killed with (the Syrians') permission. This pattern is
unacceptable,'' Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel's army radio, without citing sources, said the United States had sent
messages to Syria urging it to restrain Hezbollah. A senior U.S. administration
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the Clinton
administration had been in touch this week with all sides.
</P>
<P>
	   As is its custom, Israel kept details of the midday attack under wraps for
hours, announcing the casualties Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
	   The South Lebanon Army, which is armed, trained and funded by Israel, was
deeply shaken by Sunday's killing of Col. Akl Hashem, considered the militia's
No. 2 man, in a bombing outside his south Lebanon home. SLA militiamen are
already fearful about their fate once Israel leaves the swath of south Lebanon
it has occupied since 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   In Beirut, Hezbollah said the attack on the Israeli patrol had come despite
``all the threats of Israeli leaders'' -- a reference to Barak's statement on
Sunday that Hashem's killing would not go unpunished.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's ambush of the Israeli patrol -- which Hezbollah hailed as a
``daring attack deep in the occupied zone'' -- appeared staged to carry maximum
symbolic impact.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Lebanese security officials speaking on condition of anonymity,
it took place almost in the shadow of the Israeli-held Crusader mountaintop
fortress of Beaufort, a brooding stronghold with commanding views of south
Lebanon and northern Israel.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Guiliani already spending heavy in Senate race  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rudolph Giuliani are not
even declared candidates, yet each has spent millions of dollars on what is
shaping up as the costliest U.S. Senate race in history.
<P>
	   Over the last six months of 1999, Giuliani raised $8.8 million, according to
papers his campaign filed with the secretary of the U.S. Senate on Monday. He
spent $4.4 million last year - more than many Senate candidates have even raised
so far.
</P>
<P>
	   All total, Giuliani took in $11.5 million last year, outpacing the first
lady, who only began her fund raising in July.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton's aides estimate she has raised about $8 million. Her report
was not immediately available Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   A detailed account of who contributed what and where the campaigns spent
their money was not available. That information is contained in massive reports
each campaign is filing with the Federal Election Commission which had to be
postmarked by Jan. 31. Only summary pages were made available Monday by the
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani had $7.4 million cash on hand at the end of 1999, according to his
filing.
</P>
<P>
	   Although it was unclear specifically where Giuliani has spent his cash, his
aides have said that about $700,000 went for a television ad campaign. The
Giuliani camp has also spent money on a direct-mail campaign to solicit
donations. Many of those fund-raising letters have appealed to conservatives and
have taken shots at Mrs. Clinton. One called the first lady as "leader of the
ultra left-wing." Direct mail, much of it from outside of New York state, has
accounted for about 40 percent of Giuliani's fund raising.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of Giuliani's contributions came from individual donors. Giuliani aides
have said they have raised money from residents in all of New York's 62
counties.
</P>
<P>
	   The Giuliani camp also raised $245,311 from political action committees,
$178,536 of that in the last six months. Giuliani recently hired a Washington
D.C.-area fund raiser, Julie Wadler, who said she would specialize in raising
PAC contributions for the mayor.
</P>
<P>
	   Anthony Corrado, a government professor who specializes in campaign finance
at Colby College in Maine, said the Clinton-Giuliani race was easily on track to
be the most expensive political contest in U.S. Senate history.
</P>
<P>
	   "The difference in this race is that in addition to the candidates spending
enormous amounts of money, millions and millions of dollars will be spent by the
political parties and outside interest groups," Corrado said, referring to the
largely-unregulated soft money spent on candidates' behalf. Those totals are not
included in the candidates' filings.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're looking at a level not seen in previous Senate races."

<HEADLINE> Mexican Students, Opponents Clash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Striking university students clashed with opponents
Monday, throwing rocks and fists as the anti-strike group broke through a
barricade at a campus in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
	   Law students and faculty tore past the barricade of wire, poles, tires and
debris to confront strikers who have occupied Mexico's 280,000-student National
Autonomous University since April.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let's go. Together, the community and the law faculty, we will lift the
strike,'' law professor Othon Perez Fernandez shouted to dozens of
anti-strikers, who responded ``Yes,'' then rushed the blockade.
</P>
<P>
	   The two sides scuffled in an open plaza before Perez Fernandez was knocked
unconscious and had to be withdrawn by supporters. He was hospitalized with
minor injuries and was expected to be released Monday night, the Televisa
network reported.
</P>
<P>
	   One person was detained, the report added.
</P>
<P>
	   Confrontations between the two sides have escalated in recent days as the
anti-strike side has rallied students to challenge strikers.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Juan Ramon de la Fuente, rector of the university, delivered
results of a referendum showing nearly 90 percent of teachers and students
support his proposal to end the walkout.
</P>
<P>
	   Strike leaders have rejected the results as irrelevant and fraudulent. They
have called for negotiations to resume, but de la Fuente has demanded campuses
reopen first.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike began in April to protest plans to raise annual tuition from a
few cents to $140. Administrators withdrew the fee increase, but students later
demanded sweeping policy changes.

<HEADLINE> Test Helps Doctors Pick AIDS Drugs  </HEADLINE>
    By DANIEL Q. HANEY AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Doctors say they can improve the chance of
successfully treating AIDS by measuring how each patient's virus stands up to
the drugs intended to kill HIV.
</P>
<P>
	   Through evolution, HIV can grow resistant to any of the standard AIDS drugs,
and often it is invulnerable to several at once. The specific combination of
viral resistance varies from patient to patient. In theory, doctors can brew up
the most potent AIDS drug cocktails for their patients if they know the
strengths and vulnerabilities of the viruses they carry.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past, doctors have attempted to do this by checking the virus for the
genetic mutations that make it impervious to various drugs. However, complex
mixes of mutations are sometimes hard to translate into drug treatment plans.
</P>
<P>
	   In a new approach called phenotypic resistance testing, doctors can check
the virus against all of the standard drugs to see which ones can kill it, then
use the results to tailor their strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   "With this information, you can make better decisions," said Dr. Calvin
Cohen.
</P>
<P>
	   Understanding virus resistance is especially important when putting together
new drug combinations after the initial drug cocktail fails to wipe out all
visible signs of the virus. Doctors have 15 AIDS drugs to pick from, and the
choice often amounts to an educated guess.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen and colleagues studied phenotypic testing at the Community Research
Initiative of New England, an independent AIDS research organization in
Brookline, Mass. He described the results Monday in San Francisco at the 7th
Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections.
</P>
<P>
	   The test was developed by Virco N.M., a European biotechnology company that
financed the study with Glaxo Wellcome Inc., the pharmaceutical company.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors say an advantage of phenotypic testing is the simplicity of the
results.
</P>
<P>
	   "The person's virus is grown in a culture and then put into a test tube with
each antiviral drug," Cohen said. "We monitor to see how well it grows. If it
stops growing, that drug works. It's that simple."
</P>
<P>
	   The new test costs $800 per patient. Screening the genetic mutations in HIV
to figure out drug resistance has been around longer and costs about $400 to
$500 per patient.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors say that trying to understand how well drugs will work by analyzing
viral genes can be daunting when the virus is resistant to several drugs.
Sometimes resistance to one pill can help the virus withstand another, even
though it does not specifically have resistance to that medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   "Phenotypic resistance testing will be attractive because it is so much
easier to interpret," said Dr. Douglas D. Richman of the University of
California at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
	   To check the test's value, Cohen's team studied 274 patients who had failed
to respond to an initial round of AIDS drugs. Half were randomly assigned to
receive phenotypic testing, while the rest got standard care without testing.
</P>
<P>
	   After 16 weeks, 58 percent of the patients getting phenotypic testing had
responded so well to their new combination of drugs that the virus had fallen
too low to measure. By comparison, 37 percent of those without testing did this
well.
</P>
<P>
	   "Until this study, all of this was reasonable but unproven," Cohen said.
"Now we can prove it."

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall Before Fed Meeting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury prices fell Monday, halting a three-session rally
by the long bond, as money flowed back into stocks before a two-day Federal
Reserve meeting that's expected to bring higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year Treasury fell 7/16 point, or $4.37 1/2 per $1,000
in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.48
percent after finishing out last week at 6.45 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices of short-term Treasury securities fell 1/16 to  1/8 point, while
intermediate maturities fell 1/32 to 3/32 point, according to Bridge Telerate
news service.
</P>
<P>
	   The long bond rose at first Monday, extending last week's rally, as stocks
fell again amid worries the Fed's fight against inflation will also hurt company
profits. Fed officials, hoping to ease inflationary forces by slowing the
economy, are widely expected to boost lending rates again after they meet on
Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading Monday, yields on three-month Treasury bills rose 0.09
percentage point, finishing at 5.71 percent with a discount rate of 5.55
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Six-month yields settled at 5.93 percent with a discount of 5.67 percent, up
0.08 percentage point. One-year yields were 6.24 percent with a discount of 5.89
percent, up 0.06 percentage point to 5.83 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks,
jumped to 6.00 percent from late Friday's level of 5.56 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bond Buyer index of municipal bonds fell 3/32 point to 91 1/4. The yield
rose to 6.31 percent compared with late Friday's 6.30 percent.

<HEADLINE> Congress Toughens Date-Rape Drug Law  </HEADLINE>
   By CATHERINE STRONG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill that would significantly toughen federal laws for
possession and distribution of a powerful ``date rape'' drug passed the House on
Monday and was sent to President Clinton for his signature.
</P>
<P>
	   GHB, or gamma hydroxybutyrate, has been linked to at least 58 deaths since
1990 and more than 5,700 recorded overdoses, the Drug Enforcement Administration
has said.
</P>
<P>
	   A few drops of the colorless, odorless drug are usually slipped into a
drink. A victim who drinks it can lose consciousness within 20 minutes and often
have no memory of what happened. The drug is difficult to trace, often leaving
the body within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
	   The House passed the bill by a vote of 339-2, accepting minor revisions made
by the Senate, which passed it by voice vote in November. The two House members
voting against it were Reps. Ron Paul, R-Texas, and Helen Chenoweth, R-Idaho.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., the bill's House sponsor, said Clinton indicated
he would sign it.
</P>
<P>
	   Upton said GHB was a ``dangerous and sometimes fatal drug used to facilitate
sexual assaults.'' He said deaths from the drug ``are increasing rapidly,'' from
one in 1990 to 17 last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the legislation, GHB would be placed in a category of drugs that are
the most strictly regulated by the federal Controlled Substances Act. Anyone who
possess, manufactures or distributes GHB could face a prison term of up to 20
years.
</P>
<P>
	   Exceptions would be made for GHB clinical studies approved by the Food and
Drug Administration to determine if the drug helps with medical problems such as
narcolepsy, a sleeping disorder.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation also places tougher monitoring controls on the distribution
of GBL, a component of GHB which has commercial applications, to try to prevent
its diversion for illegal uses.
</P>
<P>
	   GHB, which can give users a high, also has been mixed in bathtubs at
parties, and instructions on how to make it can be easily obtained over the
Internet, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill is named after two teen-agers who died after GHB was slipped into
their soft drinks. One of the girls, 15-year-old Samantha Reid, died last year
after the drug was put in her soda at a party in Grosse Ile, Mich.
</P>
<P>
	   The other girl, 17-year-old Hillory J. Farias of La Porte, Texas, died in
1996 after having a soft drink laced with GHB at a nightclub.
</P>
<P>
	   GHB also is a controlled substance in 20 states including Michigan.

<HEADLINE> Judge limits scope of reporters' appearance before grand jury  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   RIVERHEAD, N.Y. (AP) - A state Supreme Court judge ruled Monday that two
Long Island reporters must appear before a grand jury investigating corruption
allegations at the Suffolk County Sheriff's Department, but severely restricted
the questions they can be asked.
<P>
	   David Schulz, the lawyer who represented both Newsday and the News12 cable
TV news channel before Judge John J.J. Jones Jr., said he was pleased that
narrow restrictions were ordered, but the news organizations were still
considering whether to appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   "We continue to believe that it is inappropriate for a district attorney to
bring reporters before a grand jury," Schulz said. The state Shield Law limits
the circumstances under which reporters can be called to testify about
information gathered while on assignment.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Suffolk County District Attorney James M. Catterson Jr.
subpoenaed the two reporters - Newsday's Elizabeth Moore and News12's Scott
Feldman - to testify before a grand jury probing corruption allegations at the
Suffolk Sheriff's Department.
</P>
<P>
	   "The issue is not freedom of the press," said Catterson spokesman John
Zaher. "Rather it is one of responsibility of the press to the citizens it
serves."
</P>
<P>
	   In his ruling Monday, Jones said the district attorney's office would be
limited to asking the News12 reporter to authenticate a videotaped interview
with Catterson and to attest to its accuracy. Similarly, questions to the
Newsday reporter would be limited to the authenticity and accuracy of her
interview.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge ordered the reporters to appear before the grand jury on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Carolyn Schurr Levin, Newsday's vice president and general counsel, said the
subpoena could compromise the reporters' independence and harm their relations
with news sources.
</P>
<P>
	   "Putting any reporter into a secret grand jury potentially harms what they
do," she said Monday. "It no longer makes them an impartial observer."
</P>
<P>
	   Catterson's year-long investigation is believed to focus on allegations of
improper political activity in Sheriff Patrick Mahoney's department, including
allegations that deputies and correction officers were required to make
political donations to the sheriff in exchange for promotions or plum
assignments.
</P>
<P>
	   Catterson and Mahoney are longtime foes; Mahoney claims the district
attorney has abused his power by threatening opponents with grand jury
investigations, a charge Catterson denies.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's final budget proposal will include
$30 million to help local communities track gun violence and promote gun safety,
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuomo said the HUD-administered program, which needs congressional approval,
would fund local efforts to computerize the mapping of gun violence and chart
gun-related incidents in a community.
</P>
<P>
	   Funding would also go toward education and outreach programs to promote gun
safety, he said. The president is to announce his year 2001 budget proposal on
Feb. 7
</P>
<P>
	   Cuomo said the spending initiative was part of a three-track administration
campaign against gun violence, joining legislative efforts and possible
litigation against gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
	   On the legislative front, Clinton has proposed issuing photo ID licenses for
handgun purchases and has urged Congress to pass gun control legislation,
stalled in last year's session, that included background checks for gun show
purchases and child safety locks. He has also proposed $280 million in funds to
hire 500 new Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents and 1,000 new
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the administration has threatened a new national class-action
lawsuit to be filed through HUD's public housing projects against gunmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuomo said that lawsuit would go forward if the manufacturers do not settle
suits filed by 28 cities charging the makers with negligently allowing firearms
to fall into the hands of criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   He said a meeting with the manufacturers scheduled for Jan. 21 in Las Vegas
fell through when some companies voiced objections, and the parties are now
dealing individually with the gunmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuomo said public housing projects, often in urban areas with higher crime
rates, are particularly vulnerable to gun violence, which kills some 30,000
people a year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The problem has become so widespread and it is such a concern of the
American people and it was such a disappointment when nothing was done last year
that this Congress cannot afford not to address it,'' Cuomo said.

<HEADLINE> U.K. Doctor Guilty of 15 Murders  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRESTON, England (AP) -- Jurors convicted a family doctor on Monday of
murdering 15 female patients, injecting the middle-aged and elderly women with
lethal doses of heroin.
</P>
<P>
	   Harold Shipman, who now ranks among Britain's most prolific modern-day
serial killers, was given 15 life sentences -- the maximum punishment in
Britain, which has no death penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators said he may have killed dozens more patients.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You are a wicked, wicked man,'' Preston Crown Court Judge Thayne Forbes
told Shipman, who remained impassive.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have little doubt that each of your victims smiled and thanked you as
she submitted to your fearful administrations,'' Forbes added.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctor, who altered medical records at his one-man practice in northern
England to cover up his crimes, also was found guilty of forging the $620,000
will of his last victim, 81-year-old Kathleen Grundy. He was sentenced to four
years for that offense.
</P>
<P>
	   Shipman, 54, enters British crime history alongside other notorious killers
such as the Yorkshire Ripper, convicted in 1981 of murdering 13 women and
attempting to kill seven others.
</P>
<P>
	   South Manchester Coroner John Pollard said police investigated up to 136
deaths of other Shipman patients. He told the British Broadcasting Corp. that
``it would not be unreasonable to say a figure of 150 would be a realistic,
possible estimate.''
</P>
<P>
	   News reports said 23 more murder charges may be filed. State prosecutor
Robert Davies said he was considering other murder charges but did not say how
many.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said Shipman killed because he enjoyed ``exercising the ultimate
power of controlling life and death.''
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators said his multiple murders came to an end only because Grundy's
daughter, a lawyer, became suspicious about the will. It arrived the day Grundy
was found dead in her house and left her entire estate to Shipman, in supposed
recognition of his work for the community.
</P>
<P>
	   During his testimony, Shipman claimed that some of the women had hidden
health problems. He also said Grundy may have been a drug addict, accounting for
the high level of heroin in her blood.
</P>
<P>
	   Five months before his arrest, police had abandoned an investigation
prompted by another doctor who became worried about how often Shipman asked his
practice to provide a second signature on cremation certificates. Only one
doctor's signature is required on other death certificates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The records looked all right, but we now know that was because Dr. Shipman
had altered them with a view to covering his tracks,'' Detective Supt. Bernard
Postles said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shipman went on to kill three more patients.
</P>
<P>
	   After the verdict, police reported that Shipman became addicted to
pethidine, a drug used to ease labor pains, as a young doctor 25 years ago and
was convicted of forging prescriptions. He was allowed to return to practice 18
months later.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctor's wife, Primrose, who was also his receptionist, hurried from the
court after the sentencing. She was accompanied by the couple's daughter and two
of their three sons.
</P>
<P>
	   Shipman prided himself on making home visits, and his 3,000-patient practice
had a waiting list.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is very sad ... because he was so well-liked,'' said Margaret Walker,
who knew several of the victims. ``There are still some who are very fond of him
as a doctor.''

<HEADLINE> N. Koreans To Let U.S. Inspect Area  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- North Korea invited the United States on Monday to send
forensics experts to an area where the communist government says it unearthed
hundreds of human remains that may be American servicemen killed in the Korean
War.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon had no immediate reaction.
</P>
<P>
	   To bolster its claim that the remains are American, North Korea released a
name from a military identification tag it said was found among the remains. The
name is Charles E. Sizemore. According to Pentagon records, Sizemore was a
soldier from Rush County, Ind., who went missing on Nov. 2, 1950, in the opening
months of the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week the North Koreans informed U.S. officials last week that it had
found approximately 415 sets of human remains during bulldozing operations at a
land reclamation project. It invited the United States to retrieve the remains
in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. The Pentagon balked, saying it needed
more details about the discovery.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Li Gun, deputy North Korean representative at his country's
mission at the United Nations, said in a telephone interview the Korean People's
Army had invited the Pentagon to send a ``fact-finding team'' to the land
reclamation project to verify that the remains are those of American servicemen.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's up to the U.S. side,'' Li said.
</P>
<P>
	   Li sent a letter Monday to Alan Liotta of the Pentagon's POW-MIA office
conveying what he described as a message from the Korean People's Army. The
letter questioned whether the Pentagon was serious about recovering war remains.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the U.S. refuses to recover the remains at this time, it should be
responsible for the consequences resulting therefrom,'' the letter said. Li
provided The Associated Press with a copy of the letter.
</P>
<P>
	   Li said the land reclamation project, which he said was known as land
rezoning in North Korea, was being suspended in certain areas to enable a U.S.
fact-finding team to verify the human remains.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The KPA cannot postpone the rezoning indefinitely, and therefore the U.S.
side should come to the site and make a decision without delay,'' the letter
said.
</P>
<P>
	   It added that the remains unearthed so far include military identification
tags, buttons and helmets, as well as personal belongings.
</P>
<P>
	   Li said last Friday that approximately 415 sets of human remains were
uncovered in December and January in an area of North Pyongan province, where
large areas of land are being cleared to create farmland. He said it is likely
that many more remains will be found before the reclamation project is
completed.
</P>
<P>
	   About 8,200 U.S. servicemen are listed as missing from the 1950-53 Korean
War, and the Pentagon has said it believes a few thousand are potentially
recoverable from North Korea. In U.S. recovery operations over the past few
years, 42 sets of remains have been recovered. Negotiations on arranging joint
recovery operations for this year broke down in December after the North Koreans
demanded that the United States donate materials and equipment for children's
clothing factories.
</P>
<P>
	   Li said that in the view of the Korean People's Army, the United States is
defeating its own purpose by refusing to talk about humanitarian assistance as
part of the remains recovery operation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the U.S. is to resolve the (remains) issue, it should hold talks or, if
not, do as it wishes,'' he wrote in the letter to Liotta.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rico Reaches Navy Range Pact  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Puerto Rico agreed Monday to permit the U.S. Navy to
resume limited training on the island of Vieques and said it would help clear
the bombing range of protesters who want the Navy to leave.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement, following months of negotiations, also calls for a referendum
that would give islanders two choices: let the Navy resume use of the range on
its own terms -- including the use of live bombs -- or require the Navy to cease
all training by May 1, 2003. That is two years earlier than the Navy previously
indicated it was willing to give up what it calls the ``crown jewel'' of its
Atlantic training sites.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal apparently clears the way for the USS George Washington carrier
battle group to use Vieques for training in March prior to heading to sea for a
six-month deployment. The last carrier battle group scheduled to use Vieques,
last December, was forced to forego the training prior to deploying -- a
situation the Navy's leaders said could not be repeated.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe this plan will help resolve the impasse over Vieques in the
fairest possible way, because it will meet our training needs while giving the
people most affected by this decision -- the people who actually live on the
island -- the ability to choose for themselves the future of their island,''
President Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The Puerto Rican Independence Party, which has led dozens of protesters
camping inside the Vieques bombing range, announced it would oppose any renewed
military exercises.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will continue with our civil disobedience,'' said party Vice President
Fernando Martin. ``For us, any proposal that supposes the renewal of bombing is
unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to Clinton, Puerto Rican Gov. Pedro Rossello called Clinton's
plan for Vieques ``a fair and positive basis'' for resolving the conflict that
began after a civilian security guard was killed by an errant bomb in April.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The government of Puerto Rico shall conduct a referendum for the citizens
of Vieques to decide the future of training operations on the island of
Vieques,'' Rossello wrote in the letter dated Monday. The Pentagon released
copies.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton issued directives Monday to Defense Secretary William Cohen ordering
that the Vieques referendum be held at a date set by the Navy, probably on May
1, 2001, but possibly nine months later or nine months earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   If the people of Vieques vote to let the Navy resume full-scale training,
the administration will ask Congress to provide an extra $50 million in aid to
Vieques for housing and infrastructure improvements.
</P>
<P>
	   If the referendum vote goes against the Navy, then Navy land on the eastern
side of Vieques -- including the area where live ordnance has been dropped
during years of practice bombing -- will be transferred within one year of the
referendum to the General Services Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate Armed Services Committee postponed a scheduled Tuesday hearing on
Vieques, following the announcement. After being briefed by the defense
secretary, Committee Chairman Sen. John Warner said the agreement, while not
complete, would enable the U.S. military to conduct important training.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The U.S. taxpayers are paying a heavy price in dollars and land for this
'half a loaf' agreement, but the training is essential as a part of preparation
of our Navy and Marine Corps battle groups,'' said Warner, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
	   Between now and the time of the referendum, the Navy will be permitted to
resume training on Vieques, but using only dummy bombs instead of live ordnance.
And training would be limited to 90 days a year, instead of the 180 days a year
that was once standard.
</P>
<P>
	   Puerto Ricans have long objected to the Navy's practice bombing on Vieques,
but the controversy boiled over -- and the Navy suspended training -- after the
guard was killed by a bomb dropped by a Marine Corps jet.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, the Navy announced what it thought was an agreement with
Rossello to resume training on Vieques this spring using dummy bombs. That deal
fell through, however, with Puerto Rico insisting that no training of any kind
be allowed.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal announced Monday was similar except that it offered an extra $50
million in economic assistance, should the referendum vote turn out in the
Navy's favor.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement released at the Pentagon, Cohen welcomed what he called
progress in ``establishing a framework'' to resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This clears a path for a fair, objective referendum through which the
people of Vieques can chart the future and how the Navy fits within that
vision,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the $50 million, Clinton repeated his previous offer to ask
Congress to provide $40 million in economic assistance once the Navy has resumed
its limited training on Vieques. This money would finance such projects as the
construction of a new commercial ferry pier and terminal, and projects to help
commercial fishing areas.

<HEADLINE> Russians Claim Advance in Grozny  </HEADLINE>
   By LYOMA TURPALOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALKHAN-YURT, Russia (AP) -- Russian forces pushed into a key square in the
capital of rebel Chechnya on Monday after more than a week of intense battles
with snipers firing from high-rise buildings, Russian officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sergei Yastrzembsky, acting President Vladimir Putin's spokesman for the
Chechnya war, said federal forces were in control of a third of Grozny's Minutka
Square in the afternoon, but Russian television reports later said the square
was completely under their control.
</P>
<P>
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed. Defense Ministry officials
could not be reached for comment Monday evening, and Russia previously has made
premature claims of controlling sections of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   But any Russian advance into the square could be a significant boost to the
campaign to take the capital.
</P>
<P>
	   ``After taking this square, I can say that we can totally control the
city,'' a Russian commander, Yevgeny Kurkarin, said on the NTV channel. The
square is adjacent to several of Grozny's main thoroughfares and could be a
staging point for a drive into the center.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian advance came under withering sniper fire from rebels in battered
high-rise buildings along the streets that approach the square -- attacks that
sometimes brought the Russian drive to a standstill. Rebels elsewhere in the
city have put up fierce resistance, and the rebel command shows no sign of
backing down.
</P>
<P>
	   In the northern part of the city, rebels have established substantial
defenses in the old university complex, the news agency Interfax said, citing
Russian defense sources.
</P>
<P>
	   Yastrzhembsky said Monday that about 140 guerrillas had surrendered in
Grozny in recent days, but the figure was questioned by a leader of the
Kremlin-backed Chechen State Council, Malik Saidullayev.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As far as I know there were 57 of them,'' Saidullayev said, according to
Interfax, adding ``it will take rather a long time'' to overrun Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a senior Taliban commander told The Associated Press in the
Afghan capital of Kabul that a group of reinforcements went to Chechnya about 20
days ago. The Taliban militia, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan, had
previously denied Russian allegations that the regime was sending fighters to
Chechnya. The commander spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   In the face of Western criticism, Russia has justified its nearly
5-month-long ground assault in Chechnya as necessary to wipe out Islamic
militants it identifies as terrorists. Russian officials have often cited a
Taliban connection.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in Moscow on Monday, called
Russia's military campaign ``an incredible act of misery'' that would not
extinguish terrorism. But Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov responded that
Moscow had to move firmly against terrorism and that no one has come up with an
effective recipe other than force.
</P>
<P>
	   The offensive clearly is wearing on Russian forces and stretching their
resources. A Russian officer told The Associated Press on Monday that troops
have begun blowing up roads in Chechnya because there aren't enough soldiers to
man sufficient checkpoints to control rebel movements.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia also is fighting rebels in the southern mountains of Chechnya, where
fighters can take shelter in steep, trackless gorges and mount hit-and-run
attacks. Fighting was especially heavy at Duba-Yurt, at the entrance to the
Argun Gorge, on Monday, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite inclement weather, Russian warplanes and helicopters flew more than
110 combat missions over the past 24 hours, the military command said Monday.
Targets included the Argun and Vedeno gorges in the southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   No overall casualty report was issued Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Military officials reported, however, that a highly decorated commander of a
Russian helicopter regiment was killed Saturday as he was flying to pick up
paratroopers near the southern village of Shatoi. Col. Nikolai Maydanov, 43,
died after rebels fired on his helicopter and hit him in the neck.
</P>
<P>
	   Moscow sent troops into Chechnya in September after an invasion by
Chechen-based militants into the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan in
August, and a series of deadly apartment bombings elsewhere in Russia that were
blamed on Chechens.

<HEADLINE> Senate panel approves annual State Police reports, but Collins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The Senate Judiciary Committee has wasted little
time getting a bill moving again to require annual reports from the New Jersey
State Police on civilian complaints of trooper misconduct.
<P>
	   The Senate passed this bill eight months ago but it died when the session
expired in January because the Assembly did not take up the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. William Gormley, R-Atlantic, the bill sponsor and Judiciary Committee
chairman, said he posted the bill for quick action in the new term to highlight
its importance. His committee passed it unanimously and now it awaits action in
the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill, S-650, would provide for reports detailing the complaints filed,
their nature and the outcome following internal investigation, including
discipline or the finding that the complaint was fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
	   "You are not just talking about the complaint, you are talking about the
resolution of the complaint," Gormley said.
</P>
<P>
	   But ultimately it will again be up to Assembly Speaker Jack Collins whether
the lower house will conduct committee hearings and vote on the legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   At the end of the last legislative session, Collins said he didn't know
about the bill in enough time to get it listed on a crowded agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Collins was noncommittal. He wondered aloud if a new statute was
really necessary, and further whether it might not be best to wait until
proposed State Police reforms take hold.
</P>
<P>
	   "It looks to me that a lot of these things might have already been dealt
with," Collins said.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Police have been embroiled in a controversy over allegations of
racial profiling, the practice of stopping motorists on nothing more than the
basis of their race. Attorney General John Farmer in July issued a report
promising improved handling of citizen complaints.
</P>
<P>
	   However, in terms of public reporting, the only thing promised were reports
on traffic stops. Most recently, a legal settlement between Farmer and the U.S.
Justice Department included the provision that reports be made every six months.
</P>
<P>
	   While the disclosure covered in Gormley's legislation differs from the
material to be disclosed through the federal settlement, Gormley said the idea
is the same, and it would be good to have it permanently incorporated in state
law.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is something that makes the process survive beyond a particular
administration, beyond a particular person (at the State Police), beyond a
particular attorney general," Gormley said.
</P>
<P>
	   That point, Collins agreed, had merit. "That might be the argument that
carries the day," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Reginald Jackson, executive director of the Black Ministers Council
of New Jersey, said he will press Collins for action once the bill clears the
Senate for a second time.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson said he was surprised by Collins' claims in December that he was
unaware of the bill until it was too late to get it listed on the crowded
agendas at the end of the session.
</P>
<P>
	   "But if the speaker didn't know, then I take him at his word. You can be
sure he will hear from me in person when it passes the Senate this time,"
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gormley said despite the snafu last term, he does not believe Collins
opposes his bill.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel confident that he will be very reasonable," Gormley said. "I think
Jack is committed, as we all are, that we demonstrate to the public our
commitment to appropriate disclosure."

<HEADLINE> N. Koreans To Let U.S. Inspect Area  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- North Korea invited the United States on Monday to send
forensics experts to an area where the communist government says it unearthed
hundreds of human remains that may be American servicemen killed in the Korean
War.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon said the offer is under review.
</P>
<P>
	   To bolster its claim that the remains are American, North Korea released a
name from a military identification tag it said was found among the remains. The
name is Charles E. Sizemore. According to Pentagon records, Sizemore was a
soldier from Rush County, Ind., who went missing on Nov. 2, 1950 -- a date that
coincides with major clashes in the part of North Korea where the remains are
claimed to have been found.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week the North Koreans informed U.S. officials last week that it had
found approximately 415 sets of human remains during bulldozing operations at a
land reclamation project. It invited the United States to retrieve the remains
in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. The Pentagon balked, saying it needed
more details about the discovery.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Li Gun, deputy North Korean representative at his country's
mission at the United Nations, said in a telephone interview the Korean People's
Army had invited the Pentagon to send a ``fact-finding team'' to the land
reclamation project to verify that the remains are those of American servicemen.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's up to the U.S. side,'' Li said.
</P>
<P>
	   Li sent a letter Monday to Alan Liotta of the Pentagon's POW-MIA office
conveying what he described as a message from the Korean People's Army. The
letter questioned whether the Pentagon was serious about recovering war remains.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the U.S. refuses to recover the remains at this time, it should be
responsible for the consequences resulting therefrom,'' the letter said. Li
provided The Associated Press with a copy of the letter.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenneth Bacon, spokesman for Defense Secretary William Cohen, said the
Pentagon was reviewing Li's offer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are committed to identifying and returning remains of Americans who
served in the Korean or any other war,'' Bacon said. ``Our policy is that the
return of remains is a humanitarian act and should be decoupled from politics or
extraordinary payments. We look forward to working with the North Koreans to
return remains in accordance with our policy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Li said the land reclamation project, which he said was known as land
rezoning in North Korea, was temporarily suspended in certain areas to enable a
U.S. fact-finding team to verify the human remains.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The KPA cannot postpone the rezoning indefinitely, and therefore the U.S.
side should come to the site and make a decision without delay,'' the letter
said.
</P>
<P>
	   It added that the remains unearthed so far include military identification
tags, buttons and helmets, as well as personal belongings.
</P>
<P>
	   Li said last Friday that approximately 415 sets of human remains were
uncovered in December and January in an area of North Pyongan province, where
large areas of land are being cleared to create farmland. He said it is likely
that many more remains will be found before the reclamation project is
completed.
</P>
<P>
	   About 8,200 U.S. servicemen are listed as missing from the 1950-53 Korean
War, and the Pentagon has said it believes a few thousand are potentially
recoverable from North Korea. In U.S. recovery operations over the past few
years, 42 sets of remains have been recovered. Negotiations on arranging joint
recovery operations for this year broke down in December after the North Koreans
demanded that the United States donate materials and equipment for children's
clothing factories.
</P>
<P>
	   Li said that in the view of the Korean People's Army, the United States is
defeating its own purpose by refusing to talk about humanitarian assistance as
part of the remains recovery operation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the U.S. is to resolve the (remains) issue, it should hold talks or, if
not, do as it wishes,'' he wrote in the letter to Liotta.

<HEADLINE> Corzine, Gormley set pace in raising money for congressional races  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Two candidates for U.S. Senate, Democrat Jon S.
Corzine and Republican William Gormley, each raised more than $1 million from
political donors in the final six months of 1999, setting the pace for campaign
2000 in New Jersey.
<P>
	   Corzine, the former chairman of Goldman Sachs, raised more than $1.4
million, loaned himself more than $2.65 million and spent more than $3.2 million
in the final six months of 1999, according to newly released finance reports. He
entered 2000 with $891,990 in the bank.
</P>
<P>
	   His opponent, former Gov. Jim Florio, raised $508,300, loaned himself
$200,000 and spent $440,000 over those six months. He entered the year with
$796,341.
</P>
<P>
	   Gormley, a state senator, raised $1.53 million and entered 2000 with $1.51
million. The best-funded of his opponents for the Republican nomination, Rep.
Bob Franks of Berkeley Heights, raised $876,296 and entered the election year
with $751,025, plus a debt of $5,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaign finance reports covering the six months ending Dec. 31, 1999, had
to be postmarked and on their way to the Federal Election Commission by close of
business Monday. Many campaigns agreed to provide reporters with two-page
summaries.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey's Senate race and the House contests in the 7th and 12th
districts will be among the most closely watched campaigns in the country this
year. The outcomes could affect whether Republicans hold their majorities in
both houses of Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   In the crowded 7th district, where at least five Republicans hope to succeed
Franks, the pacesetter is Mike Ferguson, who raised $126,106 in the second half
of 1999 and loaned himself $200,000. He began the year with $387,843.
</P>
<P>
	   And in the 12th district, freshman Democratic Rep. Rush Holt of Pennington,
one of the Republican Party's biggest targets this year, raised $377,626 in the
final six months of last year and entered 2000 with a hefty war chest of
$665,340.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Rep. Richard Zimmer, seeking the Republican nod to challenge Holt,
reported raising $164,025 in the last six months and entered 2000 with $442,112.
Former Rep. Michael Pappas, who lost to Holt in 1998, raised $73,211 and entered
the year with $61,439.
</P>
<P>
	   With a personal net worth estimated at $300 million, Corzine is spending
lavishly in his campaign for the Democratic nomination for Senate. His two
campaign managers, Christy Davis and Steven Goldstein, each make $20,000 a
month. The campaign is paying its top consulting agency, Message &AMP; Media,
$50,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
	   In defense of the big-dollar effort, Corzine supporters said they have an
uphill climb to compete against Florio.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will take substantial resources to match a career politician who is well
known, who has provided benefits for a lot of people, and who's apparently
committed to running a highly negative campaign," said Orin Kramer, Corzine's
finance chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Murphy, the co-chairman of the Florio campaign, retorted that
Corzine's operation "is all about money. It's like doing battle with a
bottomless checkbook."
</P>
<P>
	   Among other Republicans running for Senate, Essex County Executive James
Treffinger reported raising $694,429 in the last six months of 1999. Murray
Sabrin, the 1997 Libertarian Party candidate for governor, raised $102,559.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 7th congressional district, besides Ferguson, Assemblyman Joel
Weingarten, R-Essex, raised $108,375; Tom Kean Jr., son of former Gov. Thomas H.
Kean, raised $93,981; and Patrick Morrisey, a former congressional staff member,
raised $86,308.
</P>
<P>
	   Ferguson ran for House in the adjacent 6th district last year and prepared
for a second run before moving to the 7th district. Morrisey highlighted that
fact Monday in challenging Ferguson to offer his contributors their money back.
</P>
<P>
	   Ferguson replied, "I think New Jersey voter are tired of these sorts of
negative attacks. My supporters know where I'm running and they know why I'm
running."
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side in the 7th district, Fanwood Mayor Maryanne Connelly
reported that she raised $164,317 in the last six months of 1999 and entered
2000 with $189,049. She still owes $49,000 from a loan she took to run against
Franks in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Watts Announces for Fourth Term  </HEADLINE>
   By RON JENKINS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORMAN, Okla. (AP) -- Despite his pledge to serve only three terms, Rep.
J.C. Watts Jr. announced Monday that he would run for a fourth term.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Regardless of what I said in 1994, I will stand for re-election for the
citizens of the Fourth District of Oklahoma and let them judge me on election
day,'' Watts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Watts, the only black Republican member of Congress, said he believed his
constituents liked what Congress has accomplished since the mid-1990s, including
welfare reform and a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But we think much more needs to be done,'' Watts said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Watts, 42, had a fast ride to the party's top echelon after his election
among the Republicans' conservative class of 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   He spoke during the 1996 GOP presidential convention, gave the party's
response to the State of the Union address in 1997, and in 1998, he was named
chairman of the Republican Conference, the No. 4 position in the House.
</P>
<P>
	   The former University of Oklahoma football star said keeping the balance of
power in Washington was a factor in his decision. He said if Democrats gain
control, chances of a tax cut and increase in military spending would ``come to
a screeching halt.''
</P>
<P>
	   There are 222 Republicans in the House, 211 Democrats and two independents.
</P>
<P>
	   Watts said he weighed the pros and cons during the past two months but did
not decide he would run again until Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he still believed in term limits, but added, ``I don't believe
Oklahoma should restrict itself and the 49 other states not restrict
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
	   If voters return him to Washington, he said would seek re-election as
chairman of the House Republican Conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats have accused Watts of breaking his pledge to not serve more than
three terms in the House and produced a document showing his support of term
limits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I honestly don't know if I did or didn't'' sign such a pledge, Watts said
Monday. He said he anticipates term limits to be a campaign issue in November,
but he would defend his record and ``await the election results in peace.''
</P>
<P>
	   So far, no Democrats have announced plans to run for Watts' post.

<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- The Argentine navy dispatched an ice cutter
Monday to help free a ship carrying 186 people trapped in the icy waters off
Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
	   The ``Clipper Adventurer'' tourist boat, traveling through the Belgrano and
Liar islands near Antarctica, was surrounded by sheets of ice after a sudden
change in the wind direction, the Argentine navy said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The situation does not pose an imminent threat to the people on board,''
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
	   The navy said an ice cutter had been sent from a naval base on Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
	   Flying a Bahamian flag and carrying 116 passengers and 71 crew members, the
ship left for Antarctica on Friday from the Argentine port city of Ushuaia,
1,515 miles south of Buenos Aires.

<HEADLINE> Judge hands man who masqueraded as a lawyer the stiffest possible  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A man who jeopardized dozens of criminal cases by
falsely posing as a lawyer was sentenced to three years and five months in
prison on Monday by a judge who said the criminal justice system was the victim.
<P>
	   "He jeopardized in every instance the administration of justice," U.S.
District Judge Barbara S. Jones said as she sentenced Paul C. Kurtz at the top
of the federal sentencing guideline range. "He grossly jeopardized his clients'
rights."
</P>
<P>
	   Kurtz, wearing a suit and calling out to his lawyer at a lectern or rapping
a pen on the table to get his attention during pre-sentence arguments,
apologized to the court and "every other place" where he had falsely represented
himself.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know what I did was wrong," the 58-year-old Bethesda, Md., man told the
judge. "I have some good in me as well."
</P>
<P>
	   He said what he did was "shameful behavior."
</P>
<P>
	   "I never intended to hurt anybody. I really intended to help guys who were
in trouble."
</P>
<P>
	   Jones said she was not impressed.
</P>
<P>
	   "To some extent your words ring hollow in view of your prior criminal
history and incarcerations and your efforts to somehow minimize your conduct in
this case," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kurtz's criminal history includes four felony convictions for crimes
involving fraud, deceit or false statements. The crimes took place in Virginia,
Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides the prison sentence, Kurtz also must pay a $5,000 fine and $12,812
in restitution.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge allowed him to surrender voluntarily on March 15 because his
mother and fiancee were ill, but she said she thought he might be better off
going to prison immediately.
</P>
<P>
	   Kurtz's lawyer, Brian Shaughnessy, said the judge should recommend that
Kurtz serve his sentence at a Maryland facility which has an alcohol
rehabilitation program "that would be of considerable help to him."
</P>
<P>
	   Kurtz was charged with making false statements and obstruction of justice
after he was arrested in Bethesda.
</P>
<P>
	   Last June, he pleaded guilty to making false statements and credit card
fraud. Prosecutors had cited scores of cases in which he allegedly held himself
out to be a lawyer even though he had no license to practice law.
</P>
<P>
	   The cases included approximately 14 federal criminal cases between late 1992
and mid-1998 as well as five cases before the Immigration and Naturalization
Service and one case in federal bankruptcy court.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is far from a routine white-collar criminal case," Assistant U.S.
Attorney James J. Benjamin Jr. said in court papers. "Kurtz has embarked on a
calculated and apparently widespread effort to misrepresent himself as a
licensed attorney in numerous federal criminal cases."
</P>
<P>
	   After Kurtz's arrest, prosecutors notified courts and prosecutors in cases
in which he had appeared.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaughnessy said that the notifications resulted in just one guilty plea
that was nullified and had to be renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
	   But the judge said Kurtz had falsely represented himself in an "incredibly
numerous number of cases" and caused an enormous outpouring of government
resources.

<HEADLINE> Navy Opponents To Keep Protesting  </HEADLINE>
   By JAMES ANDERSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Many Puerto Ricans reacted with shock Monday
at news that their governor had agreed to allow the U.S. Navy to resume limited
military training on Vieques island.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gov. Pedro Rossello called the deal a ``just and reasonable solution of
this complex and long-standing problem'' and insisted that he had achieved what
most Puerto Ricans have longed for: allowing Vieques residents to decide
whether, after more than 50 years, the Navy should leave the eastern island.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The people of Vieques will decide on their own future, as it should be,''
Rossello said in his annual state of Puerto Rico address at the Capitol
building. In protest, two pro-independence legislators walked out during
Rossello's speech.
</P>
<P>
	   Protesters have occupied the Vieques range since a civilian security guard
was killed in an accidental bombing on the base in April.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's agreement calls for a referendum giving Vieques residents two
choices: let the Navy resume use of the range on its own terms -- including the
use of live bombs -- or require the Navy to cease all training by May 1, 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, however, the Navy can resume exercises using inert bombs --
something Rossello and other island leaders had vowed would never occur.
</P>
<P>
	   The Puerto Rican Independence Party, which has been at the forefront of the
protests, vowed to oppose any renewed military exercises.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will continue with our civil disobedience,'' said Fernando Martin,
party vice president. ``For us, any proposal that supposes the renewal of
bombing is unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
	   Independence Party leader Ruben Berrios and supporters have camped amidst
unexploded ordnance on the range since May 8. Martin said they would not resist
arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This agreement represents a tyrannical imposition on the people of
Vieques,'' Martin said. ``The United States government has shown a profound lack
of respect for the rights of Vieques.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bombing opponents said they were surprised that Rossello accepted the deal
after months of insisting that not one more bomb would be dropped on the island
range.
</P>
<P>
	   They also objected that Vieques' 9,400 residents won't be able to consider
in the referendum an immediate halt to any military exercise whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
	   Puerto Rican leaders of all political stripes -- pro-statehood,
pro-commonwealth and pro-independence -- along with the Catholic Church and
numerous activist groups had been united in their opposition to the Navy's
presence on Vieques. The anti-Navy cause drew some support in the U.S. mainland
as well: legislators and activists, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, rallied to
the cause.
</P>
<P>
	   The local coalition foundered after Monday's announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The governor broke the consensus today and returned to his old style,''
said Anibal Acevedo Vila, a leader of the pro-commonwealth Popular Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe it was a show of disrespect for him to call us to a meeting and
when we come in, for the governor to give us a copy of the letter that he had
sent to Clinton today accepting the proposal ... without consulting anyone ahead
of time.''
</P>
<P>
	   One pro-independence activist, Jorge Farinacci of the Socialist Front,
predicted that the decision will ``bury'' Rossello's pro-statehood party, the
New Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, the Navy announced what it thought was an agreement with
Rossello to resume training on Vieques this spring using dummy bombs. Rossello
rejected that deal, insisting that no training of any kind be allowed.

<HEADLINE> Split Seen in Episcopal Church  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD N. OSTLING AP Religion Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The irregular elevation of two conservative American
priests to the rank of bishop in the Episcopal Church was denounced Monday by
church leaders who apparently fear the move will worsen a right-left split.
</P>
<P>
	   Homosexuality is the most divisive issue in the worldwide Angligan Communion
and its U.S. branch, the Episcopal Church.
</P>
<P>
	   Defying church procedure and protocol, six bishops joined to consecrate the
two Americans in a Saturday ritual at Singapore's St. Andrew's Cathedral. Those
participating were the archbishops who lead the Anglican branches in Southeast
Asia and Rwanda, two retired bishops from the U.S., and two other bishops.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Anglican rules, one national branch does not interfere with the
hierarchy of another branch. Under Episcopal Church rules, bishops are elected
by a region's clergy and lay delegates, then endorsed by vote of the full U.S.
hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
	   The head of the Episcopal Church, Presiding Bishop Frank T. Griswold, sent a
statement to all U.S. bishops and Anglican leaders internationally, declaring
that he is ``appalled by this irregular action.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Anglican Communion's world leader, Archishop of Canterbury George Carey,
issued a statement through his London office regretting that the two bishops had
been elevated prior to a scheduled meeting of the heads of all of the
independent Anglican branches March 23-28 in Oporto, Portugal.
</P>
<P>
	   He declared that the Singapore consecrations are ``irresponsible and
irregular and only harm the unity of the communion.''
</P>
<P>
	   The newly elevated U.S. bishops are the Rev. Charles H. Murphy III, rector
of All Saints Episcopal Church in Pawley's Island, S.C., and the Very Rev. John
H. Rodgers, Jr., dean emeritus of Trinity Episcopal School for Ministry in
Ambridge, Pa.
</P>
<P>
	   Murphy is a leader in the First Promise organization and Rodgers in the
Association of Anglican Congregations on Mission. Both groups oppose liberal
trends in the Episcopal Church and have appealed to overseas Anglicans for help.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodgers said he and Murphy would organize those who believe ``the authority
of Scripture and the historic creeds are central to our faith, conduct and unity
as Anglicans.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are committed to lead the church, not leave it,'' Murphy stated.
</P>
<P>
	   The most emotion-laden issue for Episcopal and Anglican conservatives is the
commitment of some U.S. bishops to ordain gay and lesbian clergy and allow
blessing ceremonies for same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
	   At an international conference of Anglican bishops in 1998, a strong
majority endorsed a policy statement that ``abstinence is right for those who
are not called to marriage'' and ``rejecting homosexual practices as
incompatible with Scripture.''
</P>
<P>
	   The statement said the world Anglican hierarchy ``cannot advise the
legitimizing or blessing of same-sex unions, or ordination of those involved in
same-gender unions.''

<HEADLINE> Girls Arraigned for Antigay Assault  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Two 15-year-old girls pleaded innocent in juvenile court
Monday to charges stemming from an alleged sexual assault of a classmate they
believed was a lesbian, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   A third Boston High School student, Nykesha Gant, 17, was scheduled to be
arraigned as an adult Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The alleged attack happened Thursday, when five girls and a boy on a subway
train encountered a 16-year-old girl who had apparently been seen holding hands
with another girl, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the female students allegedly groped the girl, ripped her clothes
and pointed at their genitals, shouting, ``Do you like this? Is this what you
like?''
</P>
<P>
	   When the girl resisted, the boy pulled a knife, held it to her throat and
threatened to slash her, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   The two 15-year-old girls were charged Monday with juvenile delinquency for
indecent assault and battery; assault with a dangerous weapon; attempted rape;
and civil rights violations. Their names were not released because they are
juveniles.
</P>
<P>
	   Juvenile Court Judge Leslie Harris set $500 cash bail for one of the girls.
The other was released on her own recognizance.

<HEADLINE> Michigan Fraternity Ordered Shut  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- A University of Michigan fraternity was ordered
closed Monday by its national organization for hazings that included a pledge
being shot in the groin with a BB gun.
</P>
<P>
	   With the school's blessings, Alpha Epsilon Pi Fraternity Inc.'s national
board voted to suspend the Ann Arbor chapter's charter and revoke its
recognition, thereby disbanding the roughly 70-man group and closing operations
dating at the school to 1948.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was the appropriate response to very negative behavior,'' said Sidney
Dunn, the Indianapolis-based national's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   Adam Silver, the school's Interfraternity Council president, said in a
statement the move ``should serve as a prime example of the consequences that
fraternities will face if they haze their members.''
</P>
<P>
	   The chapter had been barred from putting on organized activities since being
suspended Dec. 6, a day after a fraternity member accidentally shot a pledge in
the groin with a BB gun.
</P>
<P>
	   That victim, a 19-year-old freshman from New York state, required surgery
and has not been identified.

<HEADLINE> Execution Witness Case on Trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The issue of how much of an execution media and other
witnesses should be allowed to see will go to trial, a federal judge ruled
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   On behalf of the public and the press, the Society of Professional
Journalists and the California First Amendment Coalition argued that execution
witnesses should be allow to view the proceedings from the moment inmates are
strapped to the gurney in preparation for the injection of lethal chemicals.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses, including reporters, had watched gas chamber executions in
California from the time the prisoner was led into the chamber. After courts
forced the state to switch to lethal injection in 1996, prison officials argued
that exposure during the longer preparation period, 10 to 20 minutes, would
endanger guards.
</P>
<P>
	   California Corrections Department officials now draw a curtain until inmates
are fully strapped down and the intravenous tubes are inserted.
</P>
<P>
	   Prison officials argue the time-consuming preparations expose the identities
of the guards helping with the execution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If their identities are known by inmates, that would endanger the staff,''
Karl Mayer of the state Attorney General's office said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayer said no harassment or threats against guards in past executions have
been reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The plaintiffs argue that the identities of the execution team could be
protected another way -- possibly through the use of surgical gowns and masks.
</P>
<P>
	   A trial date was set for Feb. 14. The next execution scheduled in California
is March 15.

<HEADLINE> High-Speed Amtrak Train On Track  </HEADLINE>
   By JEAN McMILLAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- The inaugural trip of Amtrak's high-speed train to New York
and Washington got off to an inauspicious start Monday: a 20-minute delay due to
engine trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, officials on a ceremonial train trip a few hours later claim the
all-electric Acela Regional train service will reinvigorate rail travel and cut
more than an hour off the five-hour Boston-to-New York trip. They said the
problem with the earlier train was minor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``After 50 years of pouring billions into an ever-expanding Interstate
highway system, there's a new love affair across America for passenger rail,''
said Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, chairman of Amtrak's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
	   A ceremonial train departed -- on time -- to New York with Thompson, other
rail officials and regional lawmakers on board.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's departure started Acela's two-train-a-day regional service from
Boston to Washington. Amtrak plans to eventually have as many as seven regional
trains and 10 express trains, which are to debut later this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The regional trains will travel at about 110 mph on their four-hour trip on
the New York to Boston leg. After new signaling equipment is installed, they
will speed up to 125 mph in some areas.
</P>
<P>
	   The express service will hit speeds up to 150 mph, cutting the Boston-New
York trip to three hours.
</P>
<P>
	   ''(The express) is to make Amtrak more competitive with the air shuttles,
and the regional service is to make us more competitive with driving,'' said
Amtrak spokesman Rick Remington.
</P>
<P>
	   Acela service was inaugurated with a ``flipping of the switch'' ceremony to
electrify the track between Boston and New Haven, Conn. Until now, trains going
from New York to Boston have had to stop in New Haven to swap their electric
locomotives for diesels.
</P>
<P>
	   The cost of a one-way Acela ticket between New York and Boston will rise
from $50 to $56. The New York-to-Washington fare will remain $84.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Kids Exercise Less, Eat Worse  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- American students, watch out. A new report suggests that
kids in other countries could whoop you in a track meet.
</P>
<P>
	   Students in the United States exercise less and eat less healthy diets than
kids in most other countries, according to the report issued Monday by the World
Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   But kids in other countries smoke more, said the report, which details a
study of more than 120,000 students in 28 countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. ranks only 24th out of 28 for daily smoking, with 12 percent of
15-year-olds smoking every day. Greenland ranked highest, with 56 percent of
15-year-olds boys lighting up daily and 45 percent of 15-year-old girls joining
them.
</P>
<P>
	   But when it comes to keeping fit, U.S. students are lagging behind kids in
many European countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Two-thirds of American students reported exercising for more than two hours
a week, compared to 80 percent of students in Austria, Germany and the Slovak
Republic who reported exercising regularly.
</P>
<P>
	   Kids in the U.S. are downing more fries, potato chips and candy bars than
most of their global counterparts. Thirty-one percent of American 15-year-olds
reported eating fries every day, putting the country fifth behind North Ireland,
Scotland, Israel and England.
</P>
<P>
	   Among students aged 15, the United States ranked among the top three
countries where kids eat sweets, chocolate and soft drinks every day.
</P>
<P>
	   American students rank in the middle when it comes to alcohol consumption.
About 23 percent of 15-year-olds said they drank beer, wine or spirits a least
weekly. In Wales, the number was 53 percent, in Greece it was 52 percent and in
England it was 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Coordinated by the WHO, the study of health behaviors of school-aged
children looked at students aged 11, 13 and 15 in 26 European countries and
regions, Canada and the United States. The findings were derived from a
1997-1998 survey.
</P>
<P>
	   The study is conducted every four years.

<HEADLINE> Senate committees take action on auto emissions over Whitman  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Over Whitman administration objections, two state
Senate committees on Monday approved a bill that would suspend new emissions
tests at all Division of Motor Vehicle inspection stations and give motorists a
$50 break at private garages until a private vendor can solve problems that have
caused chronically long lines.
<P>
	   The committee votes on Senate President Donald DiFrancesco's bill sets up a
vote in the full Senate next Monday. However, Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, who
prefers suspending the whole program for a while and giving all motorists a
four-month extension for inspections, expressed doubts about the Senate
president's approach. Both are eyeing a run for governor next year.
</P>
<P>
	   The action came as the Whitman administration enacted the latest in a series
of moves designed to buy time for contractor Parsons Infrastructure and
Technology. Problems have bedeviled the system since a new test designed to help
New Jersey clean its air was instituted Dec. 13. Parsons is operating the system
under a seven-year $400 million contract
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers ignored pleas from Division of Motor Vehicles Director Richard
Kamin and state Environmental Commissioner Robert Shinn to give the latest
changes time to work. DiFrancesco's bill gained bipartisan support in the
Senate's transportation and budget committees.
</P>
<P>
	   "We can just keep talking about how outraged we are or we can make changes,"
DiFrancesco said. "I think we should participate in this process once again for
the benefit of the motoring public."
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman on Monday suspended the tougher auto emissions test and a computer
system designed to monitor the process at the 15 centralized DMV stations that
had the longest waiting times. An old tailpipe test that essentially looks for
carbon monoxide levels is being used at these stations.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the enhanced emissions test, which looks for asthma-causing smog
compounds, remains in effect at the 17 other centralized inspection stations
operated by Parsons, and at more than 1,400 private garages.
</P>
<P>
	   The state also is spending up to $12 million to cut the average $75 price
tag for inspections at private garages by $25. Motorists don't pay a charge at
the centralized stations, which are subsidized by state taxes and fees.
</P>
<P>
	   DiFrancesco's bill would order the state to suspend the tougher emissions
tests at all the centralized stations operated by Parsons and replace them with
the old tailpipe test.
</P>
<P>
	   DiFrancesco said, however, that motorists getting inspections at these
centralized stations would have to return for inspections next year rather than
get a two-year sticker. He said this would encourage motorists to go to private
garages, thus reducing lines at the centralized stations. And to sweeten the
pot, the bill orders a $50 per inspection subsidy to private garages to reduce
the price tag for motorists.
</P>
<P>
	   At the beginning of the day, DiFrancesco was proposing to have the state pay
for the subsidy to private garages. But lawmakers on both committees objected to
this, saying Parsons should pay. DiFrancesco said this might prompt a lawsuit
from Parsons, but quickly accepted the change. He also consented to a change
that would prevent Parsons from making any more money from the yearly
inspections his bill would order.
</P>
<P>
	   "People are talking about this," said Sen. Diane Allen, R-Burlington. "We're
holding up thousands and thousands of residents from getting on with their
lives."
</P>
<P>
	   Kamin and Shinn, however, said the lawmakers should wait to see if the
measures the administration is taking will pan out. They told the committees
that the bill should take effect June 30 - the date the Whitman administration
has pledged that the difficulties will be cleared up. The measure would only
take effect if there are still problems.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're asking for your patience in giving this plan time to work," Kamin
said. "We are doing all we can. Whatever it takes, we're going to fix it."
</P>
<P>
	   DMV spokesman Dana Sullivan said lines were generally shorter at most of the
15 stations on Monday. However, several stations did have waiting times
exceeding one hour at 1 p.m., he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Shinn reminded lawmakers that the federal Environmental Protection Agency
could slap the state with sanctions affecting the state's ability to lure
industry and get federal highway funds if the inspection process is further
stalled.
</P>
<P>
	   Kamin said that DiFrancesco's plan would also remove the enhanced emissions
test from 17 centralized inspection stations that have not had serious problems.
He said providing one-year inspection stickers could clog the lanes again when
these cars return for inspections next year.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers from both parties, however, criticized the administration's
approach. Some said administering the old test at centralized facilities would
give motorists even less of an incentive to go to private garages.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Sharpe James, D-Essex, said using tax money to help defray the cost of
inspections at private garages "amounts to double taxation."
</P>
<P>
	   "You have a non-performing vendor, and the relief is to tax the victims,"
said James.

<HEADLINE> Japan Unemployment Rate Rises  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's jobless rate rose in December for the first time in
six months, edging up to 4.6 percent from 4.5 percent in November amid surging
job cuts at companies under pressure to trim costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Unemployed people totaled 2.88 million in December, up 150,000 from the year
before, the statistics bureau of the Management and Coordination Agency said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Reflecting the impact of corporate restructuring, the number of people
seeking work who left their jobs involuntarily rose by 30,000 on year to
920,000. The number of jobholders fell by 160,000 to 64.27 million, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The rate was slightly higher than the 4.5 percent forecast by economists
surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan's unemployment rate has risen as the nation struggles to rebound from
its worst recession in decades. The jobless rate stood at a record 4.9 percent
in June and July last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The government has used public spending to jump-start the economy, which it
expects to grow by 1 percent in the coming fiscal year beginning in April.
</P>
<P>
	   Underscoring the severity of the employment situation, the data showed that
more and more jobs are being filled by temporary workers. Companies are
increasingly turning to temps, who cost less in terms of benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of temporary job holders continued to rise in December to 5.43
million, up 3.8 percent from the previous year. The rise has continued since
September 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of people with permanent full-time jobs fell 550,000 to 46.34
million last month, the 24th straight decrease. That drop was much sharper than
the 400,000 recorded in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, the Labor Ministry said the ratio of job offers to job seekers,
an indicator of demand for labor, stayed at 0.49 in December, unchanged from
November. The ratio shows that 49 jobs were being offered for every 100 workers
seeking employment in December.
</P>
<P>
	   In all of 1999, the job offers-to-seekers ratio averaged 0.48, the lowest
since the ministry began compiling comparable data in 1963. The new
offers-to-seekers ratio averaged 0.87, matching the 1982 average.

<HEADLINE> 'Simpsons' Character To Die Off  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BY LYNN ELBER AP Television Writer
</P>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A character on the "The Simpsons" is going to kick the
cartoon bucket this month during the February sweeps period.
</P>
<P>
	   Maude Flanders, wife of do-good Simpson family neighbor Ned Flanders, is
rumored to be the character that dies in the Feb. 13 episode, although the
makers of the Fox animated series refused to confirm her passing.
</P>
<P>
	   Executive producer Mike Scully said Maude is among the possibilities. The
others are school principal Seymour Skinner and Mo the bartender, a man close to
beer-guzzling dad Homer Simpson's heart.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're in our 11th season and we're always looking for new ways to shake up
the show a little and do something that might open up new story possibilities,"
Scully said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The episode's title, "Alone Again, Natura-Diddly," is a dead giveaway. Ned
Flanders, Maude's husband, is known for his annoyingly chirpy overuse of the
word "diddly."
</P>
<P>
	   The odds are further stacked against poor Maude. Meggie Roswell, the woman
who provided the character's voice, left the show because she tired of commuting
from Denver to Los Angeles to record her lines.
</P>
<P>
	   The voices of Skinner and Mo are done, respectively, by series regular Harry
Shearer and Hank Azaria. The two actors play a number of other characters on the
series about Homer and Marge Simpson, their kids Bart and Lisa and their wacky
hometown.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Simpsons," created by Matt Groening, has been acclaimed as a brilliant
and sophisticated satire on America and family life.
</P>
<P>
	   If Maude is the one to go, her sacrifice would not be in vain. The episode
airs during the February "sweeps," a key ratings period used to help set
advertising rates.
</P>
<P>
	   "We thought it would be interesting to show how the surviving characters
cope with the death and maybe take them in a new direction," Scully said. "Plus,
it's sweeps. "
</P>
<P>
	   The character won't be the first to die on "The Simpsons." A gravestone will
be shown in the upcoming death episode with the names of four others who have
passed out of the series to cartoon heaven.
</P>
<P>
	   They include Bleeding Gums Murphy, the jazz musician who was Lisa's musical
idol; family shrink Dr. Marvin Monroe; Beatrice Simmons, girlfriend to Grampa
Simpson; and Frank "Grimy" Grimes, an unlucky co-worker of Homer's at the
nuclear power plant.
</P>
<P>
	   Since "The Simpsons" draws children as well as adult viewers, the show is
taking the death seriously -- to an extent.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was a lot of discussion about making sure we did deal with some of
the emotional ramifications of the death and not just make it all joke, joke,
joke," Scully said. "But at the same time, we're a comedy, they're animated,
they're not real."

<HEADLINE> San Francisco Approves Pot ID Cards  </HEADLINE>
   By RON HARRIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The San Francisco Board of Supervisors put its stamp
of approval Monday on a plan to issue identification cards to medical marijuana
users.
</P>
<P>
	   The city ordinance is designed to allow qualified cardholders to obtain
high-grade marijuana from several dispensaries without fear of being arrested.
It was approved 10-1, but still must be considered by Mayor Willie Brown.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For people who are suffering, this is a giant step because here's a
medicine that I think really, really works. Reefer madness is dead,'' said Gary
Farnsworth, a director at the San Francisco Patients Resource Center. His center
is one of several medical marijuana dispensaries in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What the card does is to certify that the holder fits the requirements of
the California medical marijuana statute,'' said deputy city attorney Marc
Slavin.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the card will not contain a name or photo for confidentiality
purposes but will display a serial number. No fees for the cards have been
determined. ``This is an ordinance that is simply designed to give effect to the
statewide proposition,'' Slavin said.
</P>
<P>
	   If approved by the mayor, it would be the third such program in the state.
All are byproducts of a proposition approved by voters in 1996 that allows for
possession, cultivation and use of marijuana for medicinal purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   Similar ID card programs are used in Mendocino County and Arcata, where the
chief of police personally issues photo ID cards to registered medical marijuana
patients.
</P>
<P>
	   Randi Webster, who attended Monday's meeting and is hobbled by a
degenerative arthritis, gall stones and soft tissue disease, praised the
decision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Imagine having your legs stabbed and also having heat applied. And having
that between your fingers, your shoulders, your jaws, your eye sockets, your
back, your knees,'' Webster said. ``When I ingest through the inhalation of
either smoking or vaporizing, it's instantaneous.''

<HEADLINE> EU Threatens To Cut Austria Ties  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE JAHN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- The European Union warned Monday it would take the
unprecedented step of severing most political contacts with any Austrian
government that includes a far-right party whose leader has praised aspects of
Adolf Hitler's regime.
</P>
<P>
	   The warning followed a series of verbal attacks by Joerg Haider on the
leaders of France and Belgium for opposing any role for his party in the
Austrian government. The center-right Austrian People's Party has been holding
talks with Haider's populist anti-immigration Freedom Party, which finished
second in inconclusive elections in October.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider shrugged off the EU's warning, saying it was his critics -- and not
himself -- who were antidemocratic.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am somewhat horrified how lightly one takes democracy in a country such
as Austria,'' Haider said Monday, describing the warnings as ``an attempt to
take influence from the outside'' on Austria's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   If the Freedom Party becomes part of a governing coalition, the 14 other
European Union members would curtail bilateral contacts with Vienna, oppose
Austrian appointments to international organizations and keep contacts with
Austrian ambassadors to a minimum, said an EU statement issued in Lisbon,
Portugal.
</P>
<P>
	   The threat signaled EU determination not only to combat what it feels are
undemocratic developments in a member country but also to send a message to
other right-wing groups that they would not be tolerated in a politically
leading role.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider won international notoriety a decade ago after praising Hitler's
``orderly employment policy,'' and later for lauding veterans of the Waffen SS
as ``decent people of good character.'' Since then, he has apologized for those
statements.
</P>
<P>
	   After the EU's warning, Austria's top diplomat to the European Union, Gregor
Woschnagg, left Brussels, Belgium, the EU capital, for Vienna. His
representatives denied the move was in response to the threat, saying the trip
had been planned in advance.
</P>
<P>
	   Just hours earlier, Haider expressed regret over his sharp criticism of
French and Belgian leaders but said they must respect the outcome of elections
that propelled his party to national prominence.
</P>
<P>
	   Prior to a meeting with Austrian President Thomas Klestil, Haider said he
wanted ``no conflict with Belgium and France,'' although he had called the
Belgian government ``corrupt'' and said French President Jacques Chirac was
ignorant of Austrian politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Klestil, in a statement after meeting Haider, said he had urged him to
temper his language.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Monday, Haider told reporters he expected negotiations with the
Austrian People's Party of Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel to be wrapped up
perhaps Tuesday so the new center-right coalition could assume power. Talks
continued after the EU warning, and the two parties agreed on a proposed budget
-- one of the most divisive issues -- by late Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed coalition between the Freedom Party and the People's Party
would control 104 seats in the 183-member parliament, and would likely have
Schuessel as its chancellor.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court assigns racial profiling claims to single Union  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - It will now be up to a single Superior Court judge
to decide whether criminal defendants across the state may get records from the
State Police to show they were stopped because of racial profiling.
<P>
	   Proving such a claim could be a basis for defense lawyers to have the
evidence against their clients thrown out of court and thus the charges against
them dismissed. Claims of racial profiling have been made in scores of cases by
motorists accused of drug or gun crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Supreme Court on Monday ordered all future racial profiling claims
be handled by Judge Walter Barisonek, who sits in Elizabeth in Union County. He
will rule case by case on what documents the State Police must provide to a
particular defendant's lawyer, if any, and what degree of detail the documents
must contain.
</P>
<P>
	   The high court also asked presiding appellate division Judge Sylvia Pressler
to designate one panel of appeals judges to handle the three cases in which the
State Police have already received such orders.
</P>
<P>
	   William Buckman, who is handling one of these cases on behalf of the
American Civil Liberties Union, said his request for information is aimed at
disclosing patterns of racial discrimination by troopers who patrol interstate
highways.
</P>
<P>
	   Racial profiling is the alleged practice of stopping motorists for no other
reason than their race. Until now, legal action and official reports have been
confined to trooper conduct on the New Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
	   Buckman's Hispanic client, Ramona Maiolino, was charged with drug possession
after her car was stopped and searched on Interstate 78. He said he is seeking
not only traffic stop data but internal "audits" that show authorities had
detected racial profiling years ago but failed to put a stop to it.
</P>
<P>
	   "They did these audits and yet for three more years they denied the
problem," Buckman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Public Defender's office had opposed Monday's order from the
Supreme Court, saying the separate cases should have been allowed to proceed in
their separate jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our position was that there was no reason to take these cases outside the
normal process" in local courts, said Assistant Public Defender Joel Harris. "We
believe that (records) should be turned over in order that we can make an
independent evaluation of those documents, and it should not be screened" by a
single judge.
</P>
<P>
	   But Attorney General John Farmer pushed for the order to prevent the
confusion he feared would occur if a variety of judges issued a variety of
orders demanding records from the State Police, with each one requiring separate
filings and legal arguments.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were seeking a more efficient way of doing all of these things without
them being spread all over the place," said First Assistant Attorney General
Paul Zoubek. "What we have asked for and what the state deserves is a uniform
manner of handling these cases."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Reginald Jackson, executive director of the Black Ministers Council
of New Jersey, said he was skeptical of the Whitman administration tactics
because he feared the object was to conceal embarrassing information.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson said it looks bad for Farmer to take any steps that appear to impede
the disclosure of records. "We have seen a refusal to provide information to the
public before, and we do not want to see it again," he said.

<HEADLINE> Airliner Crashes Off Coast Near L.A.  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFF WILSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OXNARD, Calif. (AP) -- An Alaska Airlines jet carrying 65 passengers and
five crew members from Mexico to San Francisco crashed Monday in the Pacific
Ocean after reporting mechanical difficulties.
</P>
<P>
	   Flight 261 from Puerto Vallarta was reported down 20 miles northwest of the
Los Angeles airport about 3:45 p.m., the Federal Aviation Administration said.
Pieces of wreckage could be seen in the water, but there was no sign of
survivors.
</P>
<P>
	   A Coast Guard helicopter, a Navy airplane and small boats were searching a
large field of debris rolling in swells off Point Mugu as darkness began to
descend on the ocean. Spotlights illuminated the water, which typically has a
temperature in the low 50s this time of year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Right now they are searching for survivors,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Jeanne
Reincke. ``They see a large debris field, but that's all we've heard from
them.''
</P>
<P>
	   The jet's crew had reported mechanical difficulties and asked to land at Los
Angeles, said Ron Wilson, a spokesman for the San Francisco airport. The flight
was scheduled to continue to Seattle after San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Radar indicates it fell from 17,000 feet and then was lost from radar,''
Wilson told KRON-TV in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   FAA spokesman Mitch Barker said the plane was a Boeing 737. Boeing spokeman
Craig Martin said the company was told by Alaska Airlines that the plane was an
MD-80.
</P>
<P>
	   Cynthia Emery, FAA flight operations officer in Seattle, confirmed the
number of passengers and crew.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, a Kenya Airways flight crashed into the Atlantic Ocean shortly
after take off from Abidjan, Ivory Coast. The Airbus 310 carried 10 crew members
and 169 passengers. At least 10 people survived.
</P>
<P>
	   Last Oct. 31, EgyptAir Flight 990 plummeted into the ocean 60 miles south of
the Massachusetts island of Nantucket. All 217 people aboard the Boeing 767 were
killed.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines, which has a distinctive image of an Eskimo painted on the
tails of its planes, has an excellent safety record. It has built itself into a
western power by serving more than 40 cities in Alaska, Canada, Mexico and five
Western states. Its headquarters are in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline had two fatal accidents in the 1970s, both in Alaska, according
to Airsafe.com, a Web site that tracks plane crashes.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1971, an Alaska Airlines Boeing 727 approaching Juneau crashed into a
mountain slope after the crew had received misleading navigational information.
All 104 passengers and seven crew members and were killed.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1976, one passenger was killed when a 727 overran the runway after
landing in Ketchikan.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline operates several flights from Puerto Vallarta, a resort on
Mexico's Pacific coast, to San Jose, San Francisco and other California cities.

<HEADLINE> IRA Stalling Could Kill Government  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Northern Ireland's fledgling
Protestant-Catholic administration faces imminent suspension if the Irish
Republican Army doesn't agree to disarm, the senior Cabinet minister warned
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   David Trimble, Protestant leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, said Britain
might shut down the 8-week-old administration if -- as expected -- a report by
Northern Ireland's disarmament commission shows the Irish Republican Army has
failed to begin turning in its weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission presented copies of the report to the British and Irish
governments late Monday. Its contents were expected to be distributed to
Northern Ireland parties and the public on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The province's major British Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, said
the fallout could blow apart the careful compromise package struck in November
by American mediator George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
	   Seeking to achieve two long-elusive goals of 1998's Good Friday peace
accord, Mitchell persuaded the Ulster Unionists to move first by forming a
four-party Cabinet that includes the IRA-linked Sinn Fein. In return, the IRA
was supposed to help the commission pinpoint and neutralize its hidden weapons
dumps.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitchell's formula specified that the disarmament commission should issue a
progress report in January to confirm whether this was happening. But the
late-night uncertainty over the report -- reflecting frantic behind-the-scenes
efforts involving Sinn Fein and the two governments -- indicated serious
shortcomings remained.
</P>
<P>
	   Trimble said the best way to keep his party inside the Cabinet, and thereby
prevent its outright collapse, would be for Britain to suspend its powers and
resume ``direct rule,'' the quasi-colonial system of governance in force here
from 1972 to last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It looks as though our risk-taking in accepting Sinn Fein has met no
response from the IRA,'' Trimble said. ``If so, it will become impossible to
sustain the administration and a return to direct rule will be inevitable. I
hope this will be temporary.''
</P>
<P>
	   Trimble has spent the past three years struggling against critics --
representatives of about half the Protestant electorate -- who have condemned
his past flexibility on the arms issue.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, Trimble won only narrow approval from his party's grassroots
council to form the Cabinet. As part of his sales pitch then to skeptical
supporters, he promised to reconvene the group Feb. 12 to debate the Ulster
Unionists' possible withdrawal from Cabinet and his own future as party leader.
</P>
<P>
	   If the British government did suspend the Cabinet's powers, this would take
much of the heat out of the Ulster Unionists' Feb. 12 meeting and make it easier
for the party's four ministers to remain within the 12-member administration.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Catholic parties in the Cabinet warned that any suspension would
only make progress -- particularly on IRA disarmament -- more difficult.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview Sunday, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams suggested that the IRA
might break off contacts with the disarmament commission if the administration
is suspended.
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein's larger rival for Catholic votes, the pacifist Social Democratic
and Labor Party, argued Monday that suspending the Cabinet would play into the
hands of extremists who never wanted a power-sharing government in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Don't make a bad situation worse,'' warned the party's deputy leader,
Seamus Mallon, who jointly leads the Cabinet alongside Trimble.

<HEADLINE> East Sees Slush, Ice With Storm  </HEADLINE>
   By ROGER PETTERSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Roads were a slushy mess along parts of the East Coast on Monday and
thousands of families and businesses still had no electricity following a deadly
snow and ice storm.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 17 deaths had been blamed on the storm as it moved through the
southern Plains, the Southeast and up the East Coast. Snow showers were
scattered through New England on Monday as the remnants of the storm headed into
Canada and out to sea.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton approved a federal disaster declaration for 31 counties of
North Carolina on Monday, making federal funds available to help communities
there dig out from last week's record snowfall.
</P>
<P>
	   Chilly rain that continued in North Carolina turned snow to slush that froze
Monday morning on highways and sidewalks. Refreezing was expected again Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
	   Police warned motorists against becoming overconfident as temperatures
eased.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You're on water one minute and ice the next,'' North Carolina Highway
Patrol Sgt. Jeff Winstead said.
</P>
<P>
	   Millions of chickens in parts of Arkansas and Texas died or were left in the
cold when the roofs of more than 500 chicken barns collapsed under the weight of
as much of a foot of snow and ice last week. An industry official said Monday
the losses could crimp the nation's poultry supply and lead to higher prices.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is a significant loss, because it is so concentrated in one area,''
said Richard Lobb, spokesman for the Washington-based National Chicken Council.
</P>
<P>
	   Pennsylvania's Legislature called off Monday's session because of slippery
roads, and schools were closed or delayed their starts from North Carolina to
Maine.
</P>
<P>
	   For some schools in North Carolina, it was the fifth consecutive class day
they were closed because of the storm and the aftereffects of a storm last week
that piled up more than 20 inches of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   In Virginia, about 81,000 homes and businesses still had no power Monday
night, Virginia Power reported. And in North Carolina, about 35,000 homes and
business, down from 112,000 late Sunday, remained without electricity.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Announce Gun Safety Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's final budget proposal will include
$30 million to help local communities track gun violence and promote gun safety,
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuomo said the HUD-administered program, which needs congressional approval,
would fund local efforts to computerize the mapping of gun violence and chart
gun-related incidents in a community.
</P>
<P>
	   Funding would also go toward education and outreach programs to promote gun
safety, he said. The president is to announce his year 2001 budget proposal on
Feb. 7
</P>
<P>
	   Cuomo said the spending initiative was part of a three-track administration
campaign against gun violence, joining legislative efforts and possible
litigation against gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
	   On the legislative front, Clinton has proposed issuing photo ID licenses for
handgun purchases and has urged Congress to pass gun control legislation,
stalled in last year's session, that included background checks for gun show
purchases and child safety locks. He has also proposed $280 million in funds to
hire 500 new Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents and 1,000 new
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the administration has threatened a new national class-action
lawsuit to be filed through HUD's public housing projects against gunmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuomo said that lawsuit would go forward if the manufacturers do not settle
suits filed by 28 cities charging the makers with negligently allowing firearms
to fall into the hands of criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   He said a meeting with the manufacturers scheduled for Jan. 21 in Las Vegas
fell through when some companies voiced objections, and the parties are now
dealing individually with the gunmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuomo said public housing projects, often in urban areas with higher crime
rates, are particularly vulnerable to gun violence, which kills some 30,000
people a year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The problem has become so widespread and it is such a concern of the
American people and it was such a disappointment when nothing was done last year
that this Congress cannot afford not to address it,'' Cuomo said.

<HEADLINE> 3 Israeli Soldiers Killed in Ambush  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA KING Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Stung by the deaths of three Israeli soldiers in south
Lebanon, Prime Minister Ehud Barak said there would be no new peace talks with
Syria until the Damascus government reins in the Islamic militant Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Israel will not be able to negotiate peace as long as the Syrians do not
restrain Hezbollah from acting against the Israeli army,'' said a Defense
Ministry statement issued hours after the bloody attack, which also wounded four
Israeli soldiers, one critically. One of the dead was an Israeli major.
</P>
<P>
	   Before and after Hezbollah's strike in Israel's self-declared security zone
in south Lebanon, Israeli warplanes staged nine air raids against suspected
guerrilla positions, the army said. The extent of casualties from the airstrikes
was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
	   The violence, the worst in southern Lebanon in six months, comes as the
United States has been seeking to bring Israel and Syria back to the bargaining
table. Negotiations resumed in December after a four-year hiatus, but broke down
in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria said it pulled out of the talks due to Israel's refusal to commit in
advance to a total withdrawal from the disputed Golan Heights, and over what
kind of a demilitarized area would exist there.
</P>
<P>
	   Following Monday's attack -- which came only a day after Hezbollah
assassinated the man considered No. 2 in Israel's allied militia, the South
Lebanon Army -- Barak used his bluntest language yet to implicate Syria in
Hezbollah's actions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is ... the Syrians, not just Hezbollah, who are behind supply lines and
freedom of movement'' for the guerrillas, Barak, a former military chief of
staff, told lawmakers from his One Israel faction.
</P>
<P>
	   With 30,000 troops in Lebanon, Syria is its neighbor's main power broker.
Israel has longed maintained that Syria has tacitly approved -- and in some
cases, encouraged -- the flow of arms to Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Defense Ministry statement, Barak used language that in the past has
foreshadowed a major Israeli counterattack. ``We have known in the past, and we
still know, (how) to strike at the place and time of our choosing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak described the recent violence, including the death of another Israeli
soldier last week, as a ``grave intensification ... that Israel would not allow
to continue.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, U.S. officials said they didn't read Barak's statement as
setting preconditions for continuing talks, but rather as an assessment that
Hezbollah's attacks were a threat to peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We condemn the violence and urge restraint on all parties that have
influence in the region,'' said David Leavy, spokesman for the National Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
	   With Israeli combat deaths in one month in Lebanon now at four -- already
one-third of last year's total -- Barak repeated his campaign pledge to pull his
troops out of Lebanon ``as soon as possible, in an orderly fashion.''
</P>
<P>
	   He and his Cabinet have argued that Israel's northern border could be more
adequately defended from the Israeli side, with less loss of life.
</P>
<P>
	   The prime minister's move marked a dramatic turnabout. In the weeks since
the talks with Syria broke down, Barak has tried to woo Damascus with flattering
statements about Syria's President Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
	   Top political associates of Barak quickly joined in calls to stop dealings
with the Syrians while the Lebanon violence continues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our boys are killed with (the Syrians') permission. This pattern is
unacceptable,'' Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel's army radio, without citing sources, said the United States had sent
messages to Syria urging it to restrain Hezbollah. A senior U.S. administration
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the Clinton
administration had been in touch this week with all sides.
</P>
<P>
	   As is its custom, Israel kept details of the midday attack under wraps for
hours, announcing the casualties Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
	   The South Lebanon Army, which is armed, trained and funded by Israel, was
deeply shaken by Sunday's killing of Col. Akl Hashem, considered the militia's
No. 2 man, in a bombing outside his south Lebanon home. SLA militiamen are
already fearful about their fate once Israel leaves the swath of south Lebanon
it has occupied since 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   In Beirut, Hezbollah said the attack on the Israeli patrol had come despite
``all the threats of Israeli leaders'' -- a reference to Barak's statement on
Sunday that Hashem's killing would not go unpunished.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's ambush of the Israeli patrol -- which Hezbollah hailed as a
``daring attack deep in the occupied zone'' -- appeared staged to carry maximum
symbolic impact.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Lebanese security officials speaking on condition of anonymity,
it took place almost in the shadow of the Israeli-held Crusader mountaintop
fortress of Beaufort, a brooding stronghold with commanding views of south
Lebanon and northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Monday, the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to keep U.N.
peacekeepers in Lebanon for another six months -- through July 31. The U.N. has
stationed peacekeepers in southern Lebanon since 1978.

<HEADLINE> Kamin: Issues raised in Sierra memos were "nothing new"  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The warnings raised by a subcontractor about a
potential disaster with the state's enhanced auto inspection tests were "nothing
new" to those who knew about such programs, Division of Motor Vehicles Director
Richard Kamin told a Senate committee on Monday.
<P>
	   Gov. Christie Whitman has ordered Attorney General John Farmer to
investigate why warnings of subcontractor Sierra Research of Pasadena, Calif.,
went unheeded. Many of the firm's warnings about mechanical problems during
freezing weather, computer glitches and inadequate staffing levels came true
after the tougher test was implemented on Dec. 13. The memos were sent to a
consultant hired to oversee the contract, who in turn says state officials were
directly warned.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman and Department of Transportation Commissioner James Weinstein said
they knew nothing of potential problems until the memos were requested by a
newspaper two weeks ago. Kamin, however, said the issues raised were not unusual
ones.
</P>
<P>
	   "The letters and the issues raised in those letters are nothing new to
anyone involved in clean air programs," Kamin said. "The history of clean air
programs, all across the country, is they've all had problems."
</P>
<P>
	   Kamin told lawmakers, "You bet we had concerns" but said state officials
were told by the private vendor, Parsons Infrastructure and Technology, that
potential problems would be addressed.
</P>
<P>
	   "We thought it would be satisfactory," Kamin said. "Clearly it was not."
</P>
<P>
	   Kamin later would not comment on specifics of the memos and who had seen
them, saying the issue is under investigation by Farmer.
</P>
<P>
	   The attorney general is expected to appoint a panel to investigate the
matter.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the attorney general's probe, the State Commission of
Investigation and Senate President Donald DiFrancesco plan to look into the
circumstances surrounding the awarding of the seven-year, $400 million contract
to Parsons.

<P>
	   OXNARD, Calif. (AP) -- An Alaska Airlines jet carrying 65 passengers and
five crew members from Mexico to San Francisco crashed Monday in the Pacific
Ocean after reporting mechanical difficulties.
</P>
<P>
	   Flight 261 from Puerto Vallarta was reported down 20 miles northwest of the
Los Angeles airport about 3:45 p.m., the Federal Aviation Administration said.
The Coast Guard said several bodies were recovered from the site, where pieces
of wreckage could be seen floating.
</P>
<P>
	   A Coast Guard helicopter, a Navy airplane and small boats were searching the
large field of debris, rolling in swells off Point Mugu after darkness had
descended on the ocean. Commercial squid boats, which have high-power lights,
were illuminating the debris field.

<HEADLINE> Christie's Has Amnesty in Probe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Christie's has been given ``conditional amnesty'' in a
federal antitrust investigation after supplying the U.S. Justice Department with
new information on its practices, the auction house said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Christie's and rival Sotheby's are the subjects of a three-year probe
focused on alleged price-fixing -- specifically the commissions paid to sellers
-- in the highly competitive fine arts market.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York art world was shaken in 1997 by the disclosure that the
government had seized truckloads of documents as part of an inquiry into alleged
improprieties involving the two auction houses and a dozen or so art galleries
and dealers.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, Christie's general counsel Jo Backer Laird said the firm
``recently became aware of information relevant to the antitrust
investigation,'' and promptly informed the government.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, she said, the company was granted conditional amnesty by the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
	   Laird said the information concerned ``possible conduct'' of company affairs
before its present owner, French investor Francois Pinault, acquired the firm in
1998. Pinault also owns the French department store Au Printemps and the Chateau
Latour winery.
</P>
<P>
	   Laird would not comment beyond the statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Published reports have said Christie's was seeking immunity in the case, and
noted that the deal came a month after the sudden resignation of Christopher
Davidge, Christie's chief executive for the past six years.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1995, Christie's replaced its long-standing 10 percent commission to
sellers with a sliding scale of 2 percent to 10 percent, and Sotheby's soon
adopted a similar policy.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal Sherman Antitrust Act prohibits collusion in such arrangements
as illegal restraint of trade, punishable by fines and imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
	   Diana Phillips, a Sotheby's official, said that auction house would have no
comment on the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Gina Talmona, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department's antitrust division,
declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> Japan Unemployment Rate Rises  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The government said Tuesday that Japan's jobless rate averaged
a record 4.7 percent last year, topping the previous record of 4.1 percent for
1998, amid surging job cuts at companies under pressure to trim costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Until the last few years, Japan had boasted a relatively low unemployment
rate. The record before 1998 was 3.4 percent, set in both 1997 and 1996, and
last year's rate was the highest since the government started compiling such
figures in 1953.
</P>
<P>
	   The unemployment rate has risen as the nation struggles to bounce back from
its worst recession in decades. The jobless rate crept as high as a record 4.9
percent in June and July last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The government has used public spending to jump-start the economy. But the
new figures showed that such efforts weren't keeping up with the impact of
corporate restructuring.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, the Management and Coordination Agency said Japan's jobless
rate rose in December for the first time in six months, edging up to 4.6 percent
from 4.5 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
	   The rate was slightly higher than the 4.5 percent forecast by economists
surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires.
</P>
<P>
	   Unemployed people in December totaled 2.88 million, up 150,000 from the year
before, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of people seeking work who left their jobs involuntarily rose by
30,000 on year to 920,000 in December. The number of jobholders fell by 160,000
to 64.27 million, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, the total number of jobless topped the 3 million mark for the
first time ever, averaging 3.17 million in 1999 -- an increase of 380,000 from
the year before.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of jobholders in 1999 fell 520,000 to an average 64.62 million,
breaking the previous record for the largest drop set in 1998. The number of
full-time jobholders fell 370,000 to an average 53.31 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Underscoring the severity of the employment situation, the data for December
showed that more and more jobs are being filled by temporary workers, who cost
less in terms of benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of temporary job holders continued to rise in December to 5.43
million, up 3.8 percent from the previous year. The rise has continued since
September 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of people with permanent full-time jobs fell 550,000 in December,
to 46.34 million, for the 24th straight decrease. That drop was much sharper
than the 400,000 recorded in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, the Labor Ministry said that the ratio of job offers to job
seekers, an indicator of demand for labor, stayed at 0.49 in December, unchanged
from November. The ratio shows that 49 jobs were being offered for every 100
workers seeking employment.
</P>
<P>
	   In all of 1999, the job offers-to-seekers ratio averaged 0.48, the lowest
since the ministry began compiling comparable data in 1963.
</P>
<P>
	   The labor market was tight for both men and women in December. The jobless
rate inched up 0.1 point from the previous month for both, to 4.8 percent for
men and 4.3 percent for women.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen early Tuesday following a
surge on Wall Street. Tokyo stocks declined slightly.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was trading at 107.22 yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange market,
up 0.32 yen from the previous day, but below its late New York level of 107.42
yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 84.89 points, or 0.43
percent, to 19,539.70 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Monday, the average
closed up 104.92 points, or 0.54 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was higher following gains in the Dow Jones industrial average in
New York, where investors snapped up shares of companies battered in a selloff
last week.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow on Monday rose 201.66 points, or 1.9 percent, to 10,940.53. The
tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index rose 53.37 points, or 1.37 percent, to
3,940.44.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro traded at 104.10 yen early Tuesday, below its
level of 104.80 yen late Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   In stock trading, the Nikkei fell amid concern the U.S. Federal Reserve will
try to contain inflationary pressures by raising interest rates at its meeting
this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Such a step would curb U.S. business expansion by making it more expensive
to borrow money. It could also hurt stock markets by enhancing the
attractiveness of U.S. fixed-income investments.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index was down 0.88 points, or 0.05 percent,
at 1,707.08 early Tuesday. The TOPIX rose 5.35 points, or 0.31 percent, to
1,707.96 Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.7100
percent Tuesday from its Monday finish of 1.7150 percent. Its price rose 0.04
point to 99.91.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Told To End Kaiser Metal Use  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN K. WILEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- A union locked out at Kaiser Aluminum Corp. for more
than a year is urging Boeing Co. to quit using Kaiser metals in its airplanes.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaiser declined to provide production figures but said Boeing is a
significant customer for the rolled aluminum made at its Trentwood mill in the
Spokane Valley. The United Steelworkes Union says about 40 percent of Kaiser's
aluminum goes to the aerospace and automotive industries and of that, about 12.5
percent is sold to Boeing.
</P>
<P>
	   Steelworkers and supporters plan a rally Tuesday in front of Boeing's
corporate headquarters in Seattle. The union plans to deliver more than 10,000
protest postcards to the office of Boeing's president, Phil Condit, said Jon
Youngdahl, a union spokesman. A rally also is planned at Boeing's Wichita, Kan.,
plant.
</P>
<P>
	   The labor dispute began when more than 3,000 Steelworkers struck five Kaiser
plants in September 1998. The company locked the union employees out in January
1999 and continued to use replacement workers and managers to operate the
plants.
</P>
<P>
	   The postcards will ask Condit to stop buying or using Kaiser products until
the lockout ends.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said the world's largest aircraft maker will
honor its contracts with Kaiser, and will continue to hold the aluminum company
to the highest quality standards.
</P>
<P>
	   "Most importantly, it is not Boeing's practice to become involved in labor
disputes affecting its suppliers," Conte said. "We're hoping an amicable
resolution can be reached."
</P>
<P>
	   Quality audits of Kaiser metal since the labor dispute began "indicate that
the product continues to be of the highest quality," Conte said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaiser spokeswoman Susan Ashe, said the postcard campaign diverts attention
from issues, such as the need to increase productivity at Kaiser plants.
</P>
<P>
	   "The place to resolve this is at bargaining table," Ashe said. "We're
looking forward to another round of discussions in February."

<HEADLINE> Dollar Is Higher on Stock Rally  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar, pushed ahead by a stock rally, rumbled higher
against other currencies Monday and set another high mark against the euro.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro went as low as 96.75 cents Monday, another in a series of low
points against the dollar, before recovering somewhat to 96.99 cents in late
trading. The euro also had a tough day on Friday, settling at 97.78 cents in New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders have been pushing down the fledgling European currency, which turned
1 year old in January, to see how far policy-makers will let it go. Prospects
for strong U.S. growth and another rate increase also have been making the
dollar more attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
	   But the euro scraped a bit higher against the dollar Monday after European
Central Bank president Wim Duisenberg warned that persistent euro weakness might
increase the risk of inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   Some traders took the remarks to mean that the bank, which has so far been
loathe to raise interest rates or take other steps to influence the currency's
level in the marketplace, may grow concerned enough about the euro's weakness to
take action.
</P>
<P>
	   Another day of stronger blue-chip stock prices helped propel the dollar
higher. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 201.66 to 10,940.53, its steepest
point gain in more than three weeks, as investors picked up stocks that had been
slammed in a selloff last week.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currency trading, the dollar was quoted at 107.42 Japanese yen, up
from 106.98 yen late Friday. The dollar also was quoted at 1.6580 Swiss francs,
up from 1.6468, and 1.4467 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4430. The British pound
fell to $1.6150 from $1.6210.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer
traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Based on Monday's
euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.0165 German marks, up from 2.0006; 6.7631
French francs, up from 6.7085; and 1,996.36 Italian lire, up from 1,980.23.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   OXNARD, Calif. (AP) -- An Alaska Airlines jet carrying 65 passengers and
five crew members from Mexico to San Francisco crashed Monday in the Pacific
Ocean after reporting mechanical difficulties.
</P>
<P>
	   Flight 261 from Puerto Vallarta was reported down 20 miles northwest of the
Los Angeles airport about 3:45 p.m., the Federal Aviation Administration said.
The Coast Guard said several bodies were recovered from the site, but there were
no reports of survivors.
</P>
<P>
	   A large field of debris rolled in big swells off Point Mugu as aircraft and
small boats converged on the area just before sunset. Hours later, the
high-power lights of commercial squid boats illuminated the darkness as a cutter
and small boats continued the search.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Right now they are searching for survivors,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Jeanne
Reincke.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane was an MD-83, part of the MD-80 series aircraft built by McDonnell
Douglas, now part of Boeing, said John Thom, a spokesman for Boeing's Douglas
aircraft unit. The downed plane was delivered to Alaska Airlines in 1992, Thom
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The jet's crew had reported mechanical difficulties and asked to land at Los
Angeles, said Ron Wilson, a spokesman for the San Francisco airport. The flight
was scheduled to continue to Seattle after San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Radar indicates it fell from 17,000 feet and then was lost from radar,''
Wilson told KRON-TV in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   Len Sloper, an Alaska Airlines customer service agent in Los Angeles, said
the pilot had reported having problems with the ``stabilizer trim'' shortly
before the plane crashed.
</P>
<P>
	   If the pilots were having trouble trimming the horizontal stabilizer, it
would mean that they were having difficulty bringing the plane into the proper
pitch up or down.
</P>
<P>
	   The stabilizer is brought into balance, or ``trimmed,'' by spinning a wheel
in the cockpit. When a plane has the proper trim, its nose will fly level,
instead of pitching up or down.
</P>
<P>
	   Cynthia Emery, FAA flight operations officer in Seattle, confirmed the
number of passengers and crew.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines, which has a distinctive image of an Eskimo painted on the
tails of its planes, has an excellent safety record. It serves more than 40
cities in Alaska, Canada, Mexico and five Western states.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather was clear at the crash site, and the water typically has a
temperature in the low 50s this time of year. The water is between 300 and 600
feet deep.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Transportation Safety Board was assembling a team of
investigators in Washington, D.C., and planned to send them to the crash site
late Monday night or early Tuesday morning, spokesman Pat Cariseo said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, a Kenya Airways flight crashed into the Atlantic Ocean shortly
after take off from Abidjan, Ivory Coast. The Airbus 310 carried 10 crew members
and 169 passengers. At least 10 people survived.
</P>
<P>
	   Last Oct. 31, EgyptAir Flight 990 plummeted into the ocean 60 miles south of
the Massachusetts island of Nantucket. All 217 people aboard the Boeing 767 were
killed.
</P>
<P>
	   The most recent fatal crash in the United States involving an MD-80 series
jet was last summer's American Airlines accident in Little Rock, Ark. Eleven
people were killed and 110 injured when Flight 1420 landed in high wind and
heavy rain, ran off the runway, broke apart and caught fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines, based in Seattle, operates several flights from Puerto
Vallarta, a resort on Mexico's Pacific coast, to San Jose, San Francisco and
other California cities.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline had two fatal accidents in the 1970s, both in Alaska, according
to Airsafe.com, a Web site that tracks plane crashes.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1971, an Alaska Airlines Boeing 727-100 approaching Juneau crashed into a
mountain slope after the crew had received misleading navigational information.
All 104 passengers and seven crew members and were killed.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1976, one passenger was killed when a 727 overran the runway after
landing in Ketchikan.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the NTSB, an Alaska Airlines 737-400 flying from Seattle-Tacoma
to Juneau, carrying 140 passengers and five crew members, sustained substantial
damage during a landing at Juneau in 1998. There were no injuries, and no
probable cause was listed on the report.
</P>
<P>
	   The previous year, an Alaska Airlines DC-9-82 landing at Seattle-Tacoma ran
into problems when its nose landing gear collapsed, according to the NTSB.
Nineteen passengers sustained minor injuries, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Exchanges Near Resolving Dispute  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Singapore and Malaysia have moved closer to
resolving a dispute over frozen Malaysian shares worth about $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange and the Singapore Exchange Ltd. have
accepted a proposal from a private company, Effective Capital, to end the
impasse over Malaysian shares formerly traded in Singapore, the Malaysian bourse
said in a statement late Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement was made after officials from the two stock exchanges met in
Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
	   The shares, which are mostly held by about 170,000 Singapore-based investors
on Singapore's Central Limit Order Book, or CLOB, were thrown into limbo when
Malaysia banned external trading of its stocks in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Several Malaysian companies have attempted to resolve the dispute by
proposing buyout schemes, none of which have been wholeheartedly accepted by the
investors.
</P>
<P>
	   Effective Capital had proposed that the shares be released on the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange on a staggered basis over an 18-month period.
</P>
<P>
	   The KLSE statement said the Singapore exchange recognizes the proposal as
"part of a comprehensive and expeditious solution to the CLOB issue."
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement requires approval of CLOB investors, the KLSE statement said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wraps Up Africa Month  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- After focusing the U.N. Security Council on crises in
Africa for a month, U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke came under pressure Monday
to match his rhetoric with action: U.S. approval for major peacekeeping
operations around the continent.
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke, whose monthlong presidency of the council ends Monday night, said
the United States was committed to mounting the operations.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration has already begun to consult with Congress on authorizing
an expanded peacekeeping force for Sierra Leone and a mission of cease-fire
monitors for Congo, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But ambassador after ambassador at Monday's open meeting stressed that words
must be matched by actions -- a point repeated throughout the half-dozen open
meetings on Africa that Holbrooke had organized during January.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What the council has done is far from enough,'' said Chinese Ambassador
Qin Huasun. ``There is still more rhetoric than real action.''
</P>
<P>
	   In particular, diplomats and African presidents have stressed the need for
the United Nations to live up to its commitments in the 6-month-old cease-fire
accord for Congo, which calls for the deployment of U.N. peacekeepers and the
withdrawal of foreign forces.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My appeal to this council is to meet the parties halfway,'' Zambian
President Frederick Chiluba told the Security Council on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Chiluba oversaw the signing last summer of a cease-fire agreement for Congo.
The deal was signed in the Zambian capital of Lusaka by Congo and its allies:
Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola. Rwanda, Uganda and the Congolese rebel groups they
support also signed.
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke has made no secret of the United States' reluctance to authorize
the Congo force, saying the failure to date of the main players to abide by the
Lusaka agreement would doom any U.N. mission.
</P>
<P>
	   But with the presidents of Congo and other key players pledging before the
council last week to recommit themselves to the peace process, Holbrooke said
Monday ``the time had come for our next steps.''
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations has recommended that a 5,500-strong force -- including
500 military observers and 3,400 troops to protect them -- be sent to Congo to
pave the way for a full-fledged peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke told reporters he didn't anticipate much opposition from Congress
in authorizing the missions. ``Every member of Congress we've talked to so far
understands the importance of this issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Several ambassadors and diplomats have said Holbrooke's ability to deliver
on such pledges will be the true test of his decision to devote an entire month
of the council's agenda to meetings on Congo, Angola, Burundi, the plight of
refugees and the AIDS epidemic on the continent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's no doubt that the month of Africa was to some extent a calculated
risk,'' British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Lusaka parties have made quite clear that the longer they have to wait
for deployment of these observers to monitor the cease-fire, and redeployment of
forces, the less likely it is that their commitments will hold,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged With Threat After Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Authorities on Monday arrested a man who allegedly sent
an e-mail message threatening a second fire at Seton Hall University, one day
after a fatal dormitory blaze killed three students there.
</P>
<P>
	   Rivano Andika, 25, of Jersey City, was charged with making a terroristic
threat, which carries a maximum term of five years in prison. He was being held
Monday night on $50,000 bail, said Charlotte Smith, Essex County executive
assistant prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith said investigators believe the Jan. 19 fire and the threat were not
related, but added, ``We're not ruling it out because the investigation is still
going on.''
</P>
<P>
	   The e-mail message was sent to a Seton Hall Internet account.
</P>
<P>
	   Three 18-year-old students were killed and 62 people were injured in the
blaze that broke out on the third floor of a freshman dormitory.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators were still trying to determine what caused the fire. Classes
resumed at the 9,200-student Roman Catholic university on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Avalanches Strand Cars in Alaska  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Two avalanches stranded at least five cars Monday
on a highway linking Anchorage and the Kenai Peninsula, and unstable snow and
blizzard conditions made rescue operations uncertain, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we can't get to them, they will have to stay there,'' said Alaska State
Troopers spokesman Greg Wilkinson.
</P>
<P>
	   Driving snow was making it too dangerous to try and rescue the people by
helicopter, and road crews were forced to pull back from the area because of the
possibility of more avalanches, Wilkinson said. He said Blizzard conditions
prevented rescuers from dropping supplies such as food and blankets for the
stranded travelers.
</P>
<P>
	   The temperature in the area was expected to dip into the low teens
overnight.
</P>
<P>
	   The motorists were stranded between two avalanches on the only surface link
between the Kenai Peninsula and Anchorage.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilkinson said other nearby areas were snow-heavy and avalanches were
likely. He said road crews were using recoilless rifles to try and bring down
the snow in a controlled manner until the situation became too dangerous.

<HEADLINE> Missionary Murder Suspect Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- The main suspect in the burning death of an
Australian missionary and his two sons a year ago has been arrested, a newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Dara Singh had been sought by police throughout eastern Orissa state since
last January, when Graham Staines, 58, and his children were burned to death as
they slept in their jeep after a Bible study meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   The Statesman reported that police had arrested Singh just after midnight
Monday as he and his companions slept in a forest. Police said that Hindu
villagers in the region were protecting and hiding Singh during the past year.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said Singh did not resist arrest but one of his associates
escaped as police approached. Singh was reportedly armed only with a spear.
</P>
<P>
	   The murder of Baptist missionary and his young sons -- Philip, 10, and
Timothy, 8 -- set off a national debate about the growing strength of the Hindu
fundamentalist movement.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Hindu leaders have accused Christians -- especially missionaries -- of
fooling illiterate tribal people into converting. Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee has said there is no evidence of forced conversions to Christianity in
India, where churches have for centuries run hospitals and schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Christian organizations charged that Singh was connected to political and
cultural movements affiliated with Vajpayee's party. A government investigating
commission found no link.

<HEADLINE> Jury selection begins in Diallo case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A black woman who once lived in the Bronx was chosen
Monday to lead the jury charged with deciding the fate of four white police
officers accused of killing Amidou Diallo.
<P>
	   But the choice of a jury foreperson didn't come easy: Prosecution and
defense attorneys privately accused each other of trying to pick jurors based on
race.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, five jurors were chosen Monday, including two black women the
defense unsuccessfully tried to bar from the panel. Two white women and a white
man also were chosen before court recessed for the day.
</P>
<P>
	   The proceedings opened almost a year after police fired 41 shots at Diallo
in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building on Feb. 4, 1999. The unarmed
African immigrant was hit 19 times.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial is taking place in Albany, 150 miles from the scene of the
shooting. A state appeals court decided that the accused cops - all white -
wouldn't get a fair trial in the Bronx because of publicity and racially charged
protests.
</P>
<P>
	   "The fact that this case is being tried in Albany County is irrelevant,"
Justice Joseph Teresi told prospective jurors after reading the second-degree
murder indictment.
</P>
<P>
	   "This case is not going to be decided on anything you might have read or
heard in the media," Teresi added. "This case is not going to be decided on
anything that happens outside this courtroom. You must decide this case on the
evidence."
</P>
<P>
	   Kadiatou Diallo, the dead man's mother, told reporters outside the
courtroom: "We are praying for Amadou and to achieve justice in a peaceful way."
</P>
<P>
	   One of the accused officers, Sean Carroll, told reporters he wanted to
express "my condolences to the Diallo family in this time of tragedy. I hope one
day I'll be able to sit with the Diallo family and tell them I'm sorry about the
loss of their son."
</P>
<P>
	   The jury of 12 jurors and four alternates will be chosen from a pool of
nearly 2,000 people. On Monday, 242 people were sworn in; 39 were excused while
undergoing questioning in smaller groups by the judge and attorneys.
</P>
<P>
	   The five jurors picked were chosen after both the prosecution and defense
accused opposing counsel of challenging potential jurors based on race, which is
illegal.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors sought to remove 10 prospective jurors, including seven white
men; while the defense tried to keep three black women off the jury, according
to the transcript of a conversation at the judge's bench later read to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorney Bennett Epstein accused the prosecution of trying to remove
jurors "solely based on the fact they are white males."
</P>
<P>
	   But prosecutor Eric Warner told Teresi the prosecution challenges were fair,
given the make-up of Albany's population. "This is not the Bronx," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to 1990 census figures, the white population of the Bronx was
about 39 percent and the white population of Albany County about 89 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner also labeled defense attempts to disqualify the three blacks
"blatantly discriminatory." Epstein denied the charge, arguing that the women
could be biased because one had lived in the Bronx, and two had relatives who
had brushes with the law.
</P>
<P>
	   Teresi decided to allow two of the three black women to serve on the jury.
He also upheld all of the prosecution's challenges, leaving the five jurors who
were seated.
</P>
<P>
	   While the screening took place, demonstrators staged a prayer vigil outside
the courthouse. About 100 protesters who had traveled from Harlem to Albany by
bus chanted "Amadou, we love you" and "No justice, no peace." The Rev. Al
Sharpton and other civil rights activists have portrayed the case as symbolic of
racism and police brutality.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton and the Diallos sat in the back of the courtroom, as did relatives
of the accused officers. The defendants sat in front, each at a separate table.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll, 36, and fellow plainclothes officers Edward McMellon, 27, Kenneth
Boss, 28, and Richard Murphy, 27, were indicted in March. They aimed their
barrage at Diallo, a street vendor carrying only a wallet and a pager, while
searching his Bronx neighborhood for violent criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers, who plan to testify, have claimed they used deadly force only
after Diallo refused to halt and appeared to be reaching for a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   Each faces up to 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial, which will be televised, is expected to last a month.

<HEADLINE> Rangers 5, Predators 1  </HEADLINE>
    By IRA PODELL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Radek Dvorak scored a career-high three goals, the last two
on breakaways, as the New York Rangers beat the Nashville Predators 5-1 on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Dvorak, playing on an all-Czech line with Petr Nedved and Jan Hlavac, has
five goals and five assists in his last 10 games and 12 points overall since
being acquired last month.
</P>
<P>
	   The line had seven points, with Hlavac assisting on three goals and Nedved
also getting an assist.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rangers, who outshot the Predators 34-30, had lost two straight
following a seven-game winning streak, their longest in six seasons. New York
had its first 10-win January since 1973.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Richter, the Rangers' lone representative in this weekend's All-Star
game made 29 saves, including a penalty-shot stop against Randy Robitaille in
the first period.
</P>
<P>
	   Richter, who stopped Washington's Richard Zednik on Nov. 11, has been
successful on 11 of 12 career penalty shots, nine in the regular season and two
in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   He allowed only Robitaille's 10th goal in the closing seconds of the second
period. Richter does not have a shutout this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Dvorak gave the Rangers a 1-0 lead just 4:33 in when Nedved, along the right
boards, fed him a perfect backhand pass between the circles. Dvorak beat Mike
Dunham between the pads.
</P>
<P>
	   Just under 10 minutes later, Robitaille was dragged down by defenseman
Sylvain Lefebvre and awarded the penalty shot. On the attempt, Robitaille deked
to the backhand, but was denied when he tried to slip the puck through Richter's
legs.
</P>
<P>
	   Rookie Mike York scored his 16th goal, tying him for the team lead, with
2:22 left in the first to make it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
	   Alexandre Daigle's fifth goal and first in 20 games gave New York a
three-goal lead at 12:01 of the second.
</P>
<P>
	   After Robitaille made it 3-1, with a deflection of Craig Millar's point shot
with five seconds left in the period, Dvorak put the game away for New York in
the third.
</P>
<P>
	   Hlavac hit Dvorak with a pass from the New York zone and sent him in alone
on Dunham at 7:28. Dvorak made it 5-1 with his 12th goal 7:33 later when Hlavac
started another breakaway.
</P>
<P>
	   Nashville, which killed off both Rangers power plays, has not allowed a
power-play goal in four games and 13 chances. The Rangers, perfect on four
chances, have yielded only five goals in their last 53 times short-handed.
</P>
<P>
	   Predators forward Robert Valicevic did not return after sustaining a mild
concussion in the first period.

<P>
    MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Bobby Jackson had 17 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists
for his first career triple-double as the Minnesota Timberwolves beat the
Sacramento Kings 105-90 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson, starting for the third time this season in place of the injured
Terrell Brandon, had season highs in rebounds and assists. Brandon sat out after
spraining his left ankle in Saturday's victory over Utah.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the third triple-double by the Timberwolves this season and seventh
in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin Garnett had 31 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists for Minnesota,
which has won 18 of 22 since snapping an eight-game losing streak. At 25-17, the
Wolves have matched their best record ever after 42 games (1997-98).
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Webber had 14 points to lead seven players in double-figures for
Sacramento, which has lost four of six since winning seven in a row. The Kings
were making their fifth stop on an eight-game road trip, the longest trip by an
NBA team this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Sacramento's Jason Williams got a technical and scored just two points, one
night after scoring five points and getting ejected in New York. Sacramento
scored fewer than 100 points for the first time in 13 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Garnett scored 13 points in the third quarter as Minnesota took control
against a worn down Sacramento team.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kings fell behind 66-49 early in the third before Vlade Divac scored
nine of their next 11 points to make it 68-60 with 4:24 left.
</P>
<P>
	   But, Garnett answered with a 7-0 run of his own, including a one-handed dunk
over Divac. The Wolves took an 84-66 lead into the fourth and didn't look back.
</P>
<P>
	   Minnesota went on a 20-2 run in the first quarter to take a 26-12 lead with
4:18 left in the period. The Timberwolves shot 15-for-23 (.652) in the quarter
and held a 32-21 lead into the second.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kings' bench provided a spark in the second, as Scot Pollard scored
eight points and Darrick Martin scored seven to bring Sacramento within 47-43 at
the 5:39 mark. But, Minnesota ended the quarter on a 13-6 run to take a 60-49
halftime lead.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   OXNARD, Calif. (AP) -- An Alaska Airlines jet carrying 70 people plummeted
into the Pacific Ocean 20 miles northwest of the Los Angeles airport on Monday
after reporting mechanical problems. Several bodies were recovered from the
chilly water, but there was no sign of survivors.
</P>
<P>
	   Flight 261, heading from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco and later
to Seattle, was reported down about 3:45 p.m., the Federal Aviation
Administration said.
</P>
<P>
	   A large field of debris rolled in big swells off Point Mugu as aircraft and
small boats converged on the area just before sunset. Hours later, the
high-power lights of commercial squid boats illuminated the darkness as a cutter
and small boats continued the search.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Right now they are searching for survivors,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Jeanne
Reincke.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane was an MD-83, part of the MD-80 series aircraft built by McDonnell
Douglas, now part of Boeing, said John Thom, a spokesman for Boeing's Douglas
aircraft unit. The downed plane was delivered to Alaska Airlines in 1992, Thom
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The jet's crew had reported mechanical difficulties and asked to land at Los
Angeles, said Ron Wilson, a spokesman for the San Francisco airport.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Radar indicates it fell from 17,000 feet and then was lost from radar,''
Wilson told KRON-TV in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   Len Sloper, an Alaska Airlines customer service agent in Los Angeles, said
the pilot reported having problems with the ``stabilizer trim'' shortly before
the plane crashed.
</P>
<P>
	   If the pilots were having trouble trimming the horizontal stabilizer, it
would mean that they were having difficulty bringing the plane into the proper
pitch up or down.
</P>
<P>
	   The stabilizer is brought into balance, or ``trimmed,'' by spinning a wheel
in the cockpit. When a plane has the proper trim, its nose will fly level,
instead of pitching up or down.
</P>
<P>
	   Airline spokesman Jack Evans said the aircraft had no previous stabilizer
trim problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines, which has a distinctive image of an Eskimo painted on the
tails of its planes, has an excellent safety record. It serves more than 40
cities in Alaska, Canada, Mexico and five Western states.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather was clear at the crash site, and the water typically has a
temperature in the low 50s this time of year. The water is about 750 feet deep,
said Coast Guard Cmr. Jim McPherson.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Transportation Safety Board was assembling a team of
investigators in Washington, D.C., and planned to send them to the crash site,
spokesman Pat Cariseo said. Gov. Gray Davis said he had ordered the California
National Guard to offer whatever help is needed.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, a Kenya Airways flight crashed into the Atlantic Ocean shortly
after take off from Abidjan, Ivory Coast. The Airbus 310 carried 10 crew members
and 169 passengers. At least 10 people survived.
</P>
<P>
	   Last Oct. 31, EgyptAir Flight 990 plummeted into the ocean 60 miles south of
the Massachusetts island of Nantucket. All 217 people aboard the Boeing 767 were
killed.
</P>
<P>
	   The most recent fatal crash in the United States involving an MD-80 series
jet was last summer's American Airlines accident in Little Rock, Ark. Eleven
people were killed and 110 injured when an MD-82 landed in high wind and heavy
rain, ran off the runway, broke apart and caught fire.
</P>
<P>
	   The MD-80 is a twin-jet version of the more widely known DC-9, with a single
aisle and an engine on each side of the tail. It went into service in 1980 and
has had at least five variations that offer different ranges and seating
capacities.
</P>
<P>
	   Cynthia Emery, FAA flight operations officer in Seattle, confirmed the
number of passengers and crew on Monday's flight.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines, based in Seattle, operates several flights from Puerto
Vallarta, a resort on Mexico's Pacific coast, to San Jose, San Francisco and
other California cities.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline had two fatal accidents in the 1970s, both in Alaska, according
to Airsafe.com, a Web site that tracks plane crashes.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1971, an Alaska Airlines Boeing 727-100 approaching Juneau crashed into a
mountain slope after the crew had received misleading navigational information.
All 104 passengers and seven crew members and were killed.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1976, one passenger was killed when a 727 overran the runway after
landing in Ketchikan.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the NTSB, an Alaska Airlines 737-400 flying from Seattle-Tacoma
to Juneau, carrying 140 passengers and five crew members, sustained substantial
damage during a landing at Juneau in 1998. There were no injuries, and no
probable cause was listed on the report.
</P>
<P>
	   The previous year, an Alaska Airlines DC-9-82 landing at Seattle-Tacoma ran
into problems when its nose landing gear collapsed, according to the NTSB.
Nineteen passengers sustained minor injuries, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson said San Francisco airport officials offered to help friends and
families of the victims Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whatever they want us to do,'' he said. ``We'll put them up for the night.
We'll feed them. We'll console them. We'll bring to them whatever they desire.''

<HEADLINE> Russians Claim Advance in Grozny  </HEADLINE>

<P>
	   ALKHAN-YURT, Russia (AP) -- Russian forces pushed into a key square in the
capital of rebel Chechnya on Monday after more than a week of intense battles
with snipers firing from high-rise buildings, Russian officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sergei Yastrzembsky, acting President Vladimir Putin's spokesman for the
Chechnya war, said federal forces were in control of a third of Grozny's Minutka
Square in the afternoon, but Russian television reports later said the square
was completely under their control.
</P>
<P>
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed. Defense Ministry officials
could not be reached for comment Monday evening, and Russia previously has made
premature claims of controlling sections of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   But any Russian advance into the square could be a significant boost to the
campaign to take the capital.
</P>
<P>
	   ``After taking this square, I can say that we can totally control the
city,'' a Russian commander, Yevgeny Kurkarin, said on the NTV channel. The
square is adjacent to several of Grozny's main thoroughfares and could be a
staging point for a drive into the center.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian advance came under withering sniper fire from rebels in battered
high-rise buildings along the streets that approach the square -- attacks that
sometimes brought the Russian drive to a standstill. Rebels elsewhere in the
city have put up fierce resistance, and the rebel command shows no sign of
backing down.
</P>
<P>
	   In the northern part of the city, rebels have established substantial
defenses in the old university complex, the news agency Interfax said, citing
Russian defense sources.
</P>
<P>
	   Yastrzhembsky said Monday that about 140 guerrillas had surrendered in
Grozny in recent days, but the figure was questioned by a leader of the
Kremlin-backed Chechen State Council, Malik Saidullayev.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As far as I know there were 57 of them,'' Saidullayev said, according to
Interfax, adding ``it will take rather a long time'' to overrun Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a senior Taliban commander told The Associated Press in the
Afghan capital of Kabul that a group of reinforcements went to Chechnya about 20
days ago. The Taliban militia, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan, had
previously denied Russian allegations that the regime was sending fighters to
Chechnya. The commander spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   In the face of Western criticism, Russia has justified its nearly
5-month-long ground assault in Chechnya as necessary to wipe out Islamic
militants it identifies as terrorists. Russian officials have often cited a
Taliban connection.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in Moscow on Monday, called
Russia's military campaign ``an incredible act of misery'' that would not
extinguish terrorism. But Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov responded that
Moscow had to move firmly against terrorism and that no one has come up with an
effective recipe other than force.
</P>
<P>
	   The offensive clearly is wearing on Russian forces and stretching their
resources. A Russian officer told The Associated Press on Monday that troops
have begun blowing up roads in Chechnya because there aren't enough soldiers to
man sufficient checkpoints to control rebel movements.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia also is fighting rebels in the southern mountains of Chechnya, where
fighters can take shelter in steep, trackless gorges and mount hit-and-run
attacks. Fighting was especially heavy at Duba-Yurt, at the entrance to the
Argun Gorge, on Monday, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite inclement weather, Russian warplanes and helicopters flew more than
110 combat missions over the past 24 hours, the military command said Monday.
Targets included the Argun and Vedeno gorges in the southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   No overall casualty report was issued Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Military officials reported, however, that a highly decorated commander of a
Russian helicopter regiment was killed Saturday as he was flying to pick up
paratroopers near the southern village of Shatoi. Col. Nikolai Maydanov, 43,
died after rebels fired on his helicopter and hit him in the neck.
</P>
<P>
	   Moscow sent troops into Chechnya in September after an invasion by
Chechen-based militants into the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan in
August, and a series of deadly apartment bombings elsewhere in Russia that were
blamed on Chechens.

<HEADLINE> Jury Selection Opens in Diallo Case  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM HAYS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- With protesters shouting ``No justice, no peace!''
outside and the dead man's parents sitting with the Rev. Al Sharpton inside,
jury selection began Monday in the trial of four white policemen charged with
killing an unarmed African immigrant.
</P>
<P>
	   Amadou Diallo's death in a hail 41 bullets touched off widespread
demonstrations in New York City, where protesters decried the shooting as
another case of police brutality against minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial is taking place in Albany, 150 miles north of New York. An appeals
court decided the officers could not get a fair trial in the Bronx because of
heavy publicity and racially charged protests, which led to more than 1,000
arrests.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fact that this case is being tried in Albany County is irrelevant,''
Justice Joseph Terisi told prospective jurors. ``This case is not going to be
decided on anything you might have read or heard in the media. This case is not
going to be decided on anything that happens outside this courtroom. You must
decide this case on the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo, 22, was shot in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building on
Feb. 4, 1999. He was hit 19 times. The officers, members of an elite
plainclothes street-crime unit that had been looking for a rapist, said they
thought Diallo was armed. He was carrying only a pager and a wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers could get 25 years to life in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial will be televised. The judge ruled last week New York's ban on
cameras in the courtroom is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
	   Twelve jurors and four alternates will ultimately be chosen from a pool of
nearly 2,000 people -- 20 times the number normally summoned for a murder trial
in Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   Five jurors were selected Monday, and the first person picked, a black woman
who once lived in the Bronx, will serve as forewoman.
</P>
<P>
	   The choice of a jury forewoman didn't come easy and prosecution and defense
attorneys accused each other of trying to pick jurors based on race.
</P>
<P>
	   The move to Albany is almost certain to affect the racial makeup of the
jury. According to 1990 census figures, the Bronx had a white population of 39
percent while Albany County was 89 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   About 400 demonstrators staged a prayer vigil outside. Protesters chanted,
``Amadou, we love you'' and ``No justice, no peace!''
</P>
<P>
	   Kadiatou Diallo, Diallo's mother, said outside the courtroom: ``We are
praying for Amadou and to achieve justice in a peaceful way.''
</P>
<P>
	   His father, Saikou Diallo, said simply: ``Shooting him is murder. Shooting
him 41 times is discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
	   One of the accused officers, Sean Carroll, told reporters he wanted to
express ``my condolences to the Diallo family in this time of tragedy. I hope
one day I'll be able to sit with the Diallo family and tell them I'm sorry about
the loss of their son.''
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll, 36, was charged along with fellow plainclothes officers Edward
McMellon, 27, Kenneth Boss, 28, and Richard Murphy, 27.

<P>
	   OXNARD, Calif. (AP) -- An Alaska Airlines jet carrying at least 70 people
plummeted into the Pacific Ocean 20 miles northwest of the Los Angeles airport
Monday after reporting mechanical problems. Several bodies were recovered from
the chilly water, but there was no sign of survivors.
</P>
<P>
	   Flight 261, heading from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco and later
to Seattle, was reported down about 3:45 p.m., the Federal Aviation
Administration said.
</P>
<P>
	   A large field of debris rolled in big swells off Point Mugu as aircraft and
small boats converged on the area just before sunset. Hours later, the
high-power lights of commercial squid boats illuminated the darkness as a cutter
and small boats continued the search.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Right now they are searching for survivors,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Jeanne
Reincke. Several bodies were found, Coast Guard Lt. Chuck Diorio said, but he
could not give a specific number.
</P>
<P>
	   Cynthia Emery, FAA flight operations officer in Seattle, said there were 65
passengers and five crew members on the flight. Alaska Airlines spokesman Jack
Evans said there were 80 passengers and 5 crew members.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane was an MD-83, part of the MD-80 series aircraft built by McDonnell
Douglas, now part of Boeing, said John Thom, a spokesman for Boeing's Douglas
aircraft unit. The plane the crashed was delivered to Alaska Airlines in 1992,
Thom said.
</P>
<P>
	   The jet's crew had reported mechanical difficulties and asked to land at Los
Angeles, said Ron Wilson, a spokesman for the San Francisco airport.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Radar indicates it fell from 17,000 feet and then was lost from radar,''
Wilson told KRON-TV in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   Len Sloper, an Alaska Airlines customer service agent in Los Angeles, said
the pilot reported having problems with the ``stabilizer trim'' shortly before
the plane crashed.
</P>
<P>
	   If the pilots were having trouble trimming the horizontal stabilizer, it
would mean that they were having difficulty bringing the plane into the proper
pitch up or down.
</P>
<P>
	   The stabilizer is brought into balance, or ``trimmed,'' by spinning a wheel
in the cockpit. When a plane has the proper trim, its nose will fly level,
instead of pitching up or down.
</P>
<P>
	   Evans said the aircraft had no previous stabilizer trim problems. He also
said the plane had a low-level service check on Jan. 11 and a more thorough
check as part of normal maintenance last January.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines, which has a distinctive image of an Eskimo painted on the
tails of its planes, has an excellent safety record. It serves more than 40
cities in Alaska, Canada, Mexico and five Western states.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Transportation Safety Board was assembling a team of
investigators in Washington, D.C., and planned to send them to the crash site,
spokesman Pat Cariseo said. Gov. Gray Davis said he had ordered the California
National Guard to offer whatever help is needed.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather was clear at the crash site, and the water typically has a
temperature in the low 50s this time of year. The water is about 750 feet deep,
said Coast Guard Cmr. Jim McPherson.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, a Kenya Airways flight crashed into the Atlantic Ocean shortly
after take off from Abidjan, Ivory Coast. The Airbus 310 carried 10 crew members
and 169 passengers. At least 10 people survived.
</P>
<P>
	   Last Oct. 31, EgyptAir Flight 990 plummeted into the ocean 60 miles south of
the Massachusetts island of Nantucket. All 217 people aboard the Boeing 767 were
killed.
</P>
<P>
	   The most recent fatal crash in the United States involving an MD-80 series
jet was last summer's American Airlines accident in Little Rock, Ark. Eleven
people were killed and 110 injured when an MD-82 landed in high wind and heavy
rain, ran off the runway, broke apart and caught fire.
</P>
<P>
	   The MD-80 is a twin-jet version of the more widely known DC-9, with a single
aisle and an engine on each side of the tail. It went into service in 1980 and
has had at least five variations that offer different ranges and seating
capacities.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines, based in Seattle, operates several flights from Puerto
Vallarta, a resort on Mexico's Pacific coast, to San Jose, San Francisco and
other California cities.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline had two fatal accidents in the 1970s, both in Alaska, according
to Airsafe.com, a Web site that tracks plane crashes.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1971, an Alaska Airlines Boeing 727-100 approaching Juneau crashed into a
mountain slope after the crew had received misleading navigational information.
All 104 passengers and seven crew members and were killed.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1976, one passenger was killed when a 727 overran the runway after
landing in Ketchikan.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson said San Francisco airport officials offered to help friends and
families of the victims Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whatever they want us to do,'' he said. ``We'll put them up for the night.
We'll feed them. We'll console them. We'll bring to them whatever they desire.''

<HEADLINE> 179 Aboard Kenya Airways Crash  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEXANDRA ZAVIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OFF THE IVORY COAST (AP) -- As dawn broke Monday across the inky waters of
the Atlantic, the men of the Artaban launched their ship into a nightmare.
Bodies surrounded them: men, women, children, limbs that had been torn away.
</P>
<P>
	   The remains floated amid the baggage, books and clothes of dozens of
passengers killed when Kenya Airways Flight 431 slammed into the sea. When the
corpse of a baby dressed in a purple dress bobbed past, face down, the ship's
commander Jean Pierre Athalys turned away in horror.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's too much,'' he muttered, as the tiny body was fished out and zipped
into a billowing, adult-sized body bag.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 10 people survived the disaster. By Monday evening, 86 bodies had
been brought to shore, rescue workers said, and most searchers had given up for
the night.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane, an Airbus 310, took off at 9:08 p.m. Sunday into overcast skies.
Destined for Lagos, Nigeria, it crashed into the ocean after only one minute in
the air, according to George Dapre Yao, the head of air traffic at Abidjan's
Felix Houphouet-Boigny Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Flight 431 carried 10 crew members and 169 passengers, officials said. It
originated Sunday in Nairobi, Kenya, and was to have landed in Lagos that
afternoon. But because of bad weather, it went on to Abidjan, Ivory Coast's main
commercial city.
</P>
<P>
	   The hulking Dutch-owned Artaban, which services oil rigs, was one of more
than a dozen vessels -- from military speed boats to fishing ships -- that set
out into the choppy waters around 11 p.m. in a spontaneous rescue effort.
</P>
<P>
	   With only the light beamed down by two helicopters to guide them, the ships
cut through the wreckage -- long streams of twisted metal, broken hunks of
plastic, battered suitcases and thin oil slicks carried along by the Atlantic
currents -- in an overwhelming, and an often terrifying darkness.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We had no visibility last night, but we could hear the screams of people
-- that was painful,'' fire department rescuer Tanoh Price told an Associated
Press reporter who spent much of Monday aboard the Artaban along with the crew,
French soldiers and members of other Ivorian rescue services.
</P>
<P>
	   The men on the Artaban were tough and stoic, unaccustomed to being
emotionally affected by their work. Many, despite the shell-shocked looks that
would wash over their faces when they'd see another horror, could only talk
about it in the most clinical terms.
</P>
<P>
	   But sometimes, it was just too much.
</P>
<P>
	   Three bodies were hauled onto the ship along with several severed limbs.
Finally, in the hours before dawn, a man was brought from the ocean alive, only
to roll over a few minutes later and die.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Enough to bring tears to my eyes,'' said Keith Francklin, a South African
diver among the predominantly French and Ivorian crew, shaking his head in
frustration.
</P>
<P>
	   Two survivors, a man and a woman, were later found clinging frantically to
wreckage three or four miles offshore, giving the crew its first surge of hope.
The woman, however, had blood pouring from a head wound, and the boat headed
back to port.
</P>
<P>
	   The next time out, a hazy sun shed light on the search, but the bodies and
wreckage had been spread by the current across three or four miles of ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   Crew members scanned the waters with binoculars, pointing excitedly when
they spotted anything that looked like a person.
</P>
<P>
	   This time, though, there were no survivors. They retrieved six bodies, some
only partially clad, using a long hook to grab the corpses' clothing. Two more
were collected from French soldiers who moved about in small speed boats.
</P>
<P>
	   The bodies were dropped off at the dock, where they were lined up in a long
row, their arms frozen in twisted gestures.
</P>
<P>
	   One American man was registered on the flight, according to the U.S. Embassy
in Nairobi. It was unclear if he was among the survivors.
</P>
<P>
	   A Nigerian passenger rescued by another ship blamed some of the deaths on
the two hours it took rescuers to arrive.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they had come sooner, a lot of us would have been saved,'' Samuel
Ogbada Adje, wrapped in a blanket at Abidjan's port, said bitterly before being
pushed into an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
	   But Lt. Col. Blaise Grah, an Ivorian firefighting official, defended the
rescue effort.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Two hours, we believe, is a reasonable time, given the materials that had
to be gathered, the vastness of the ocean and the imprecise information we were
given'' about the wreckage's location.
</P>
<P>
	   What went wrong with the flight remained unclear Monday. Adje said the plane
had problems immediately after takeoff.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It wasn't quite balanced, and the next thing we knew we were in the
water,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Airline officials declined to speculate on a cause, but Kenya Airways
Technical Director Steve Clarke, speaking in Nairobi, said ``there were no
technical problems of any significance.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kenya Airways engineers and investigators were headed for the Ivory Coast
and Nigeria, Clark said, along with a team of Airbus engineers and three French
investigators.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the passengers were believed to have been Nigerians, Clarke said.
The route is popular among Nigerians heading to Dubai for duty-free shopping.

<HEADLINE> After N.H., Bush Heading To S.C.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush will
stop at Bob Jones University -- the home of the state's staunchest
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
	   The school and its leader, Bob Jones III, have hosted a number of Republican
presidential candidates, including former President Reagan, Jack Kemp and Bob
Dole.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker did not know what day this week he would visit
the fundamentalist school, which has stirred up more than its share of
controversy. He is scheduled to arrive in South Carolina on Wednesday for a
two-day stay.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The main discussion was the fact that Republican presidential candidates
have a history of visiting the university to campaign for the conservative
vote,'' Tucker said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The university lost its tax-exempt status in the 1970s because the Internal
Revenue Service said it discriminated on the basis of race. At the time, the
school did not admit blacks and forbade interracial dating among students. The
school now accepts black students but still bans interracial dating and
marriage.
</P>
<P>
	   Recently, Jones has alienated some conservative backers by saying the state
should remove the Confederate flag from the Statehouse dome.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is boycotting
South Carolina until the flag is removed. Flag opponents say it is a symbol of
racism and hatred. Supporters say it honors those killed in the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush isn't the only candidate passing through the state in advance of its
Feb. 19 Republican presidential primary. Sen. John McCain plans a three-day bus
tour of the state beginning Wednesday, hours after the polls close in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's supporters sought Monday to get a jump on the campaign in South
Carolina, which he has made a must-win state in his bid for the GOP presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters held a news conference Monday to head off criticism by the
National Right to Life Committee and South Carolina Citizens for Life. Both
groups say McCain tailors his abortion stance to the audience he is addressing
and is not staunchly anti-abortion.

    DALLAS (AP) -- Guy Carbonneau scored with 6:44 left and Ed Belfour made 20
saves as the Dallas Stars beat the Edmonton Oilers 2-1 on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Carbonneau drove to the net and directed Brett Hull's shot from the left
point past Oilers goalie Tommy Salo. The 39-year-old forward has six goals this
season.
</P>
<P>
	   The Stars are 6-0-2 in their last eight regular-season meetings against
Edmonton, and 22-3-3 in the last 28. Since 1993, the Oilers are 1-12-1 against
the Stars in Dallas.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Down at Midday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen Tuesday morning
following a surge on Wall Street. Tokyo stock prices declined.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was trading at 107.41 yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange market,
up 0.51 yen from the previous day, but just below its late Monday level of
107.42 yen in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average finished the morning session
down 182.01 points, or 0.93 percent, to 19,357.69. On Monday, the average closed
up 104.92 points, or 0.54 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was higher following the rise in the Dow Jones industrial average
in New York, where investors snapped up shares of companies battered in a
selloff last week.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow rose 201.66 points, or 1.9 percent, to close Monday at 10,940.53.
The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index rose 53.37 points, or 1.37 percent, to
3,940.44.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro traded at 104.32 yen at midday Tuesday, below
its level of 104.80 yen late Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   In stock trading, the Nikkei fell amid concern the U.S. Federal Reserve will
try to contain inflationary pressures by raising interest rates at its meeting
Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Such a step would curb U.S. business expansion by making it more expensive
to borrow money. It could also hurt stock markets by enhancing the
attractiveness of U.S. fixed-income investments.

<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all first-section companies was down
21.90 points, or 1.28 percent, at 1,686.06. The TOPIX rose 5.35 points, or 0.31
percent, to 1,707.96 on Monday.

No Survivors Reported in Alaskan Crash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   OXNARD, Calif. (AP) -- No survivors were reported after Alaskan Airlines
flight 261 plummeted into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Los Angeles this
afternoon. The plane, carrying at least 70 people, was headed from Puerto
Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco and later to Seattle. The plane's crew
reported mechanical problems and requested to land at the Los Angeles Airport.
The plane was an MD-83, part of the MD-80 series aircraft built by McDonnell
Douglas, now part of Boeing, said John Thom, a spokesman for Boeing's Douglas
aircraft unit. Alaska Airlines, which has a distinctive image of an Eskimo
painted on the tails of its planes, has an excellent safety record. It serves
more than 40 cities in Alaska, Canada, Mexico and five Western states.

of New Hampshire campaigning shoveling snow, flipping pancakes and trudging
through slushy streets. The stakes were high for McCain who badly needs a
victory in his nomination fight with better-financed George W. Bush. Bush is
seeking a come-from-behind victory here to burnish his front-running national
campaign, while staunch conservatives Steve Forbes, Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer

Congress Toughens Date-Rape Drug Law
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill that would significantly toughen federal laws for
possession and distribution of a powerful "date rape" drug passed the House
today and was sent to President Clinton for his signature. GHB, or gamma
hydroxybutyrate, has been linked to at least 58 deaths since 1990 and more than
5,700 recorded overdoses, the Drug Enforcement Administration has said. Under
the legislation, GHB would be placed in a category of drugs that are the most
strictly regulated by the federal Controlled Substances Act. Anyone who possess,
manufactures or distributes GHB could face a prison term of up to 20 years.

Monday. David Trimble, Protestant leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, said
Britain might shut down the 8-week-old administration if -- as expected -- a
report by Northern Ireland's disarmament commission shows the Irish Republican
Army has failed to begin turning in its weapons. The commission presented copies
of the report to the British and Irish governments late Monday. Its contents

body is banning imports of the writing tools. The world body made the assertion
just hours after a group in Jordan ferried 3.5 million pencils to Iraq in the
belief that the United Nations had banned pencils for fear the graphite lead
could be put to military use. He added that experts said it was "extremely
unlikely" that pencil graphite could be used for military purposes.

'Simpsons' Character To Die Off

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A character on the "The Simpsons" is going to kick the
cartoon bucket during the February sweeps period. Maude Flanders, wife of
do-good Simpson family neighbor Ned Flanders, is rumored to be the character
that dies in the Feb. 13 episode, although the makers of the Fox animated series
refused to confirm her passing. The episode's title, "Alone Again,

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Radek Dvorak scored a career-high three goals, the last two
on breakaways, as the New York Rangers beat the Nashville Predators 5-1 tonight.
Dvorak, playing on an all-Czech line with Petr Nedved and Jan Hlavac, has five
goals and five assists in his last 10 games and 12 points overall since being
acquired last month. The Rangers, who outshot the Predators 34-30, had lost two
straight following a seven-game winning streak, their longest in six seasons.
Mike Richter, the Rangers' lone representative in this weekend's All-Star game
made 29 saves, including a penalty-shot stop against Randy Robitaille in the
first period.

<HEADLINE> Airliner Crashes Off Coast Near L.A.  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFF WILSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OXNARD, Calif. (AP) -- An Alaska Airlines jet carrying at least 70 people
plummeted into the Pacific Ocean 20 miles northwest of the Los Angeles airport
Monday after reporting mechanical problems. Several bodies were recovered from
the chilly water, but there was no sign of survivors.
</P>
<P>
	   Flight 261, heading from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco and later
to Seattle, was reported down about 3:45 p.m. It had been diverted to Los
Angeles to attempt an emergency landing, the Federal Aviation Administration
said.
</P>
<P>
	   A large field of debris rolled in big swells off Point Mugu as aircraft and
small boats converged on the crash site just before sunset. Hours later, the
high-power lights of commercial squid boats illuminated the darkness as a cutter
and small boats continued the search.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Right now they are searching for survivors,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Jeanne
Reincke. Several bodies were found, Coast Guard Lt. Chuck Diorio said, but he
could not give a specific number.
</P>
<P>
	   Cynthia Emery, FAA flight operations officer in Seattle, said there were 65
passengers and five crew members on the flight. Alaska Airlines spokesman Jack
Evans said there were 80 passengers and 5 crew members.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane was an MD-83, part of the MD-80 series aircraft built by McDonnell
Douglas, now part of Boeing, said John Thom, a spokesman for Boeing's Douglas
aircraft unit. The plane the crashed was delivered to Alaska Airlines in 1992,
Thom said.
</P>
<P>
	   The jet's crew had reported mechanical difficulties and asked to land at Los
Angeles, said Ron Wilson, a spokesman for the San Francisco airport.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Radar indicates it fell from 17,000 feet and then was lost from radar,''
Wilson told KRON-TV in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   Len Sloper, an Alaska Airlines customer service agent in Los Angeles, said
the pilot reported having problems with the ``stabilizer trim'' shortly before
the plane crashed.
</P>
<P>
	   On the MD-80 series airplanes, the horizontal stabilizer looks like a small
wing mounted on top of the tail. The stabilizer, which includes elevators --
panels that pitch the nose up and down -- is brought into balance, or
``trimmed,'' from the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
	   If a plane lost its horizontal stabilizer, it would have no means to keep
the nose pointed at the proper angle up or down, and the plane would begin an
uncontrollable dive.
</P>
<P>
	   A source with close knowledge of the investigation, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the flight was normal and stable until the crew reported control
problems. Radar showed the plane plunging toward the ocean shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   Evans, the airline spokesman, said the aircraft had no previous stabilizer
trim problems. He also said the plane had a low-level service check on Jan. 11
and a more thorough check as part of normal maintenance last January.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines, which has a distinctive image of an Eskimo painted on the
tails of its planes, has an excellent safety record. It serves more than 40
cities in Alaska, Canada, Mexico and five Western states.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Transportation Safety Board was assembling a team of
investigators in Washington, D.C., and planned to send them to the crash site,
spokesman Pat Cariseo said. Gov. Gray Davis said he had ordered the California
National Guard to offer whatever help is needed.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather was clear at the crash site, and the water typically has a
temperature in the low 50s this time of year. The water is about 750 feet deep,
said Coast Guard Cmdr. Jim McPherson.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, a Kenya Airways flight crashed into the Atlantic Ocean shortly
after take off from Abidjan, Ivory Coast. The Airbus 310 carried 10 crew members
and 169 passengers. At least 10 people survived.
</P>
<P>
	   Last Oct. 31, EgyptAir Flight 990 plummeted into the ocean 60 miles south of
the Massachusetts island of Nantucket. All 217 people aboard the Boeing 767 were
killed.
</P>
<P>
	   The most recent fatal crash in the United States involving an MD-80 series
jet was last summer's American Airlines accident in Little Rock, Ark. Eleven
people were killed and 110 injured when an MD-82 landed in high wind and heavy
rain, ran off the runway, broke apart and caught fire.
</P>
<P>
	   The MD-80 is a twin-jet version of the more widely known DC-9, with a single
aisle and an engine on each side of the tail. It went into service in 1980 and
has had at least five variations that offer different ranges and seating
capacities.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines, based in Seattle, operates several flights from Puerto
Vallarta, a resort on Mexico's Pacific coast, to San Jose, San Francisco and
other California cities.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline had two fatal accidents in the 1970s, both in Alaska, according
to Airsafe.com, a Web site that tracks plane crashes.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1971, an Alaska Airlines Boeing 727-100 approaching Juneau crashed into a
mountain slope after the crew had received misleading navigational information.
All 104 passengers and seven crew members and were killed.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1976, one passenger was killed when a 727 overran the runway after
landing in Ketchikan.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson said San Francisco airport officials offered to help friends and
families of the victims Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whatever they want us to do,'' he said. ``We'll put them up for the night.
We'll feed them. We'll console them. We'll bring to them whatever they desire.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Nears Campaign Spending Record  </HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN D. SALANT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush spent almost $17.3 million -- some
$200,000 a day -- in the three months before the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire
primary and is nearing the spending record for an entire presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   His spending total for the period between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31 was far more
than any of the other contenders for the Republican nomination, according to
reports filed Monday with the Federal Election Commission. Bush already has
spent almost as much money -- $37.3 million -- as most of the other candidates
will be allowed to spend for their entire campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is not accepting federal matching funds so he is not bound by spending
limits.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore has raised $29 million, plus
$2.9 million to pay legal and accounting costs in the general election. Former
Sen. Bill Bradley has raised $27.7 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley outspent Gore during the fourth quarter of last year, $10.9 million
to $8.7 million. Overall, Gore has spent $23.2 million in his quest for the
nomination to Bradley's $19.4 million.
</P>
<P>
	   With Bradley and Gore battling, political observers say the eventual nominee
may reach the $40 million spending limit long before the party convention next
August, while Bush has millions more to spend. That's the problem Bob Dole faced
in 1996 against Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There would be in effect a blackout,'' said Herbert Alexander, professor
emeritus of political science at the University of Southern California. ``The
presidential candidate who's going to be nominated in August cannot spend money
to keep staff, to advertise, to say things he wants to say in ways he wants to
say it.''
</P>
<P>
	   During the last three months of the year, Bush raised $11 million, bringing
his total to $68.7 million. He also took in $1.3 million for a separate account
to pay his legal and accounting costs for the general election. Bush had $31.4
million in the bank as of Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   He already has raised more money than any other presidential candidate ever
has, and is about to break all spending records as well. In 1996, Republican
nominee Dole spent $42.2 million for his entire campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is not accepting taxpayer funds for his campaign; candidates who accept
the federal matching funds must limit their spending to around $40 million.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What's extraordinary is how the money keeps coming in,'' said Anthony
Corrado, a professor of government at Colby College in Waterville, Maine. ``To
put this in some perspective, Bush essentially by the first week of January 2000
had spent about what the other candidates would be able to spend under the
spending caps for the entire campaign -- and he still has another campaign's
worth of money left to spend.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also has been able to outspend publisher Steve Forbes, who is not
accepting federal matching funds and is mostly financing his own campaign.
Forbes reported spending $33.6 million, including $14 million during the last
three months of 1999. He reached into his own pocket for $28.7 million for his
presidential run last year, including $12.4 million between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31.
When he ran in 1996, he spent $37.5 million of his own money.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We plan on spending what it takes to be successful,'' Forbes campaign
manager Bill Dal Col said. ``We still fund-raise when we have the opportunity,
but we spend most of our time concentrating on building a grass-roots
organization and keeping Steve on the road delivering his message to the
voters.''
</P>
<P>
	   An Associated Press computer analysis of Bush's fourth-quarter figures found
$3 of every $10 spent by the Texas governor going for TV commercials. Besides
Iowa and New Hampshire, Bush ran commercials in Michigan, South Carolina,
Arizona, and Delaware, where early primaries are being held.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can't turn on a TV or listen to the radio and not hear or see
something about George Bush,'' said Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who is backing
one of Bush's opponents, Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the $37.3 million Bush spent through Dec. 31, about $10 million went for
fund raising, $6 million for television commercials, $6 million for general
operations and $4 million for travel.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, R-Ariz., reported raising $13.7 million, plus an additional $2
million transferred from his Senate campaign fund. He raised $6.3 million
between October and December. He had $1.5 million in the bank as of Dec. 31.,
but also had $1.3 million in debts. McCain spent $6.9 million in the last three
months of 1999 and has spent $14.2 million overall.
</P>
<P>
	   Among Democrats, Bradley raised twice as much money as Gore during the last
three months of 1999 -- $8.5 million to $4.1 million. Bradley had $8.3 million
in the bank at the end of the year to Gore's $5.7 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Reform Party candidate Patrick Buchanan reported raising $1.2 million during
the last quarter of 1999, when he left the Republican Party, and borrowed $1.4
million. For the year, he raised $5.1 million and borrowed another $1.4 million.
He had $372,283 in the bank and debts of $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, FEC records show that Republican candidate Alan Keyes is six
months overdue in filing a form with the commission disclosing his personal
finances. A Keyes spokeswoman said she thought the form had been filed, but that
the campaign would get it in.

<HEADLINE> Boats Search for Plane, People  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFF WILSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OXNARD, Calif. (AP) -- As darkness fell along the California coast Monday,
an armada of boats circled through rising swells and spreading oil, searching
for signs of hope at the crash site of an Alaska Airlines jet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're still hoping for the best,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Jeanne Reincke,
relaying reports from the red-and-white helicopters that hovered over the slick.
</P>
<P>
	   About 8 miles off the beaches and headlands northwest of Los Angeles, the
ocean's surface was streaked with widening lines of foam, plastic, paper and
what appeared to be pieces of the jet.
</P>
<P>
	   With light fading, the searchers started finding bodies along with debris.
</P>
<P>
	   A glow spread across the waves from the high-powered lights of squid fishing
boats, beaming their searchlights onto the water.
</P>
<P>
	   Help came from small boats and cargo ships, military planes and oil
platforms. The Navy was sending ships from San Diego, and a Navy plane flew
patterns over the crash site.
</P>
<P>
	   When word of the crash spread, fishing boats took off from the Channel
Islands Harbor, a popular tourist port for whale-watching, fishing charters and
island tours.
</P>
<P>
	   From the oil drilling platform Gina between the Channel Islands and the
mainland, rig workers set out in crew boats for the search site several miles
away. They were fighting wind and swells, and were not optimistic about finding
survivors, said Lee Clark of the Torch Operating Co., which runs the platform.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It doesn't look like it's good news,'' Clark said.

<HEADLINE> Dem. Convention Organizer Quits  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT LINDLAW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Don Foley, a top organizer of the Democratic
National Committee's convention, has resigned, citing demands on his other job
as a vice president at Northwest Airlines and his family.
</P>
<P>
	   Foley, who was working part time for the convention on news media logistics,
told convention chief executive officer Lydia Camarillo of his decision Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
	   He had been shuttling back and forth from the airline's Minneapolis
headquarters to Los Angeles for about three months, said convention chief of
staff Rod O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He let Lydia know this morning that the balance wasn't going to work for
him the way he would like it,'' O'Connor said. ``So he's going to forgo the
opportunity and make sure the convention is not hampered and has the time it
needs'' to pull the media logistics together.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor said the resignation will not affect planning for the convention,
which some officials have said is behind schedule. The convention is Aug. 14-17
in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Organizers did not immediately decide to replace Foley, who offered to
continue working in the short term. He had been working on the convention about
one day a week.

<HEADLINE> Glance at the MD-80 Series  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   The Alaska Airlines jet that crashed off the Los Angeles coast was an MD-83,
part of the MD-80 series aircraft built by McDonnell Douglas.
</P>
<P>
	   The MD-80, designed by McDonnell Douglas' commercial airframe division in
Long Beach, Calif., is a twin-jet version of the more widely known DC-9, with a
single aisle and an engine on each side of the tail.
</P>
<P>
	   The MD-80 went into service in 1980 and has had at least five variations
that offer different ranges, seating capacities and cockpit electronics. The
jetliners sold for $26 million in 1984 and have been flown by many airlines on
short-to-medium trips.
</P>
<P>
	   The MD-80 series was almost solely responsible for returning the St.
Louis-based McDonnell Douglas to profitability in 1985 after more than a decade
of red ink.
</P>
<P>
	   In November 1997, the Boeing Co. announced it would phase out the MD-80 and
MD-90 passenger aircraft models it inherited when it bought McDonnell Douglas.
</P>
<P>
	   Fatal events involving MD-80 series aircraft include:
</P>
<P>
	   --On June 1, 1999, an American Airlines MD-82 crashed and ran off the runway
in Little Rock, Ark., killing 11 people.
</P>
<P>
	   --On July 6, 1996, a Delta MD-88 taking off from Pensacola, Fla., aborted
its landing after an engine fan hub blew apart, killing a vacationing mother and
her son and injuring three others.
</P>
<P>
	   --On Nov. 13, 1993, an MD-82 belonging to China's Northern Airlines crashed
and burned in a rice paddy in Urumqi, a western Chinese city, killing 12 people
and injuring at least 60.
</P>
<P>
	   --On Oct. 26, 1993, an MD-82 overshot a runway in China, killing two people.
</P>
<P>
	   --On Aug. 16, 1987, a Northwest Airlines MD-80 crashed on takeoff at Detroit
Metropolitan Airport, killing 156.

<HEADLINE> Missionary Murder Suspect Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- The main suspect in the burning death of an
Australian missionary and his two sons a year ago was arrested Tuesday in a
police sting operation, news media reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Dara Singh had been sought by police throughout eastern Orissa state since
last January, when Graham Staines, 58, and his children were burned to death as
they slept in their off-road vehicle after a Bible study meeting in the village
of Manoharpur.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite a $23,250 price on Singh's head, Hindu villagers had been protecting
and hiding him since the Jan. 23 mob attack, police have said. Staines had
worked since 1965 with leprosy patients in the area. His widow, Gladys, and
14-year-old daughter, Esther, have remained in India.
</P>
<P>
	   Police followed Singh and two companions in the Guhari forest for two days,
then swooped down on them as they slept early Tuesday, police superintendent
Yogesh Khurania was quoted as telling The Statesman newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   Khurania said that Singh, armed with a spear, put up no resistance, and was
arrested along with one companion, while the other escaped, The Statesman
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Singh and his unidentified accomplice were brought to the Thakurmada police
station for identification, Press Trust of India news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The murder of the Baptist missionary and his sons -- Philip, 10, and
Timothy, 8 -- set off a national debate about the growing strength of the Hindu
militant movement. Some Hindu leaders have accused Christians -- especially
missionaries -- of fooling illiterate tribal people into converting.

W51BF-Hermitage, W51AO-Brookville, a 24-hour satellite channel and 163 affiliate
stations.
</P>
<P>
	   Bixler also was a pastor for 13 years, and wrote and edited for eight
Christian book publishers. He was a member of the board of directors of the
National Religious Broadcasters.

Ron Feiereisel
</P>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Ron Feiereisel, who played professional basketball before
becoming a coach and referee, died Friday of natural causes. He was 68.
</P>

	   While playing at DePaul from 1950-53, Feiereisel's 1,106 points made him
28th on the Blue Demons' career list.
</P>
<P>
	   He later played two years for the NBA's Minneapolis Lakers.
</P>
<P>
	   After leaving the NBA and coaching at DePaul and at an Arlington Heights
high school, Feiereisel became a referee, first in the American Basketball
Association, then in the Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1980, he returned to DePaul to coach the women's team. His teams were
61-57 in four seasons. His daughter, JoAnn, was one of the top scorers.
Gordon Fraser
</P>
<P>
	   WINTER PARK, Fla. (AP) -- John Gordon Fraser, a broadcast news pioneer who
delivered historic accounts of battles during World War II, died Thursday. She
was 91.
</P>
<P>
	   He began his lengthy broadcasting career in 1932 and was the on-camera
announcer when President Franklin D. Roosevelt presided over a historic
demonstration of television at the 1939 New York World's Fair.
</P>
<P>

correspondent attached to the 1st Armored Division.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1955, Fraser helped launch NBC's Monitor, a weekend news and features

John J. Gaherin
</P>
<P>
	   HYANNIS, Mass. (AP) -- John J. Gaherin, a negotiator who represented
newspaper publishers and helped write the first labor contracts and pension plan
for Major League Baseball, died Jan. 24. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
	   From 1964 to 1967, he was president and chief negotiator of the New York
Newspaper Publishers Association, representing seven newspapers against 10

association, he negotiated the first basic labor contract for Major League
Baseball in 1968. A year later, he negotiated the first baseball players pension
plan.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1975, he was involved in talks tied to baseball's reserve clause, which
kept players with one team unless traded or sold. When club owners rejected the
proposal to negotiate, an arbitrator tossed out the clause. That led to free
agency, allowing players to negotiate for millions of dollars with the team that
bids highest.

<HEADLINE> Polls Aplenty, With Some Off Mark  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- No matter who wins the presidential primaries in New
Hampshire on Tuesday night, it's a safe bet that some pollsters predictions will
be off the mark.
</P>
<P>
	   Some polls show Sen. John McCain ahead of George W. Bush in the Republican
presidential race and others have the two in a tie. Vice President Al Gore leads
in some polls of the Democratic candidates though the margin was narrowing, and
a new one out Monday had Gore and Bill Bradley too close to call.
</P>
<P>
	   Some pollsters may get the winner right, but miss the margin of victory,
allowing a close second-place finisher to say he ``beat the expectations.'' Or
the results may embarrass almost everyone.
</P>
<P>
	   New Hampshire, with its independent-minded voters who closely follow the
primary campaigns, has a habit of confounding at least some of the pollsters --
a situation made worse by the sheer number of polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the late polls in the 1996 GOP primary in New Hampshire, some said Bob
Dole would win and some picked Pat Buchanan, the eventual winner.
</P>
<P>
	   Veteran New Hampshire pollsters concede that the public gets a little
cynical about all the polls and the differing findings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It just reinforces people's notion that you can't believe what the polls
say,'' said Dick Bennett of the American Research Group in Manchester, who said
getting an accurate picture of the electorate is a tricky business. ``It's like
three-dimensional chess.''
</P>
<P>
	   RKM Research of Portsmouth asked during one of its recent presidential polls
how many of the respondents had participated in a political poll in the last six
months. Two-thirds said they had at least once, some several times.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nowhere else do so many pollsters compete for the attention of so few
voters,'' said R. Kelly Myers, director of research for RKM.
</P>
<P>
	   To make things even tougher, a third of likely voters in a recent poll said
they had not yet made a firm decision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You don't leave the game early when it's this close,'' said New Hampshire
Secretary of State Bill Gardner, who has counted 18 firms polling in the state.
``Most people want to see the whole game.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some candidates can't resist needling reporters whose paper shows the other
guy winning. On Monday, Bush looked at a USA Today reporter whose paper had a
poll showing him 10 points behind McCain and said: ``You need to check your
polls.''

<HEADLINE> Six Muslims Killed in Philippines  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Marines stormed a mountain hide-out of a
Muslim extremist group early Tuesday, killing six rebels, a military commander
said. The group has been blamed for numerous kidnappings in the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
	   The raid on a mountain in Patikul town on Jolo island triggered a one-hour
battle with about 60 members of the Abu Sayyaf group that also left eight
soldiers wounded, said Lt. Gen. Edgardo Espinosa, chief of the Southern Command.
</P>
<P>
	   The soldiers, backed by two helicopter gunships, attacked the rebel hide-out
before dawn Tuesday, several days after the group's latest victim was released
unharmed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Abu Sayyaf allegedly was responsible for the kidnapping of a store clerk
who was released to a group of government negotiators Saturday after 70 days in
captivity. The captors had demanded $125,000 for his release.
</P>
<P>
	   No ransom was paid, but the man's relatives said they gave his captors a
small amount of money to cover the expense of keeping him.
</P>
<P>
	   Abu Sayyaf is a small but violent group seeking an independent Islamic state
in the southern Philippines. The rebels are active in Sulu province, about 500
miles south of Manila.

<HEADLINE> Boats Search for Plane, People  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFF WILSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OXNARD, Calif. (AP) -- As darkness fell along the California coast Monday,
an armada of boats circled through rising swells and spreading oil, searching
for signs of hope at the crash site of an Alaska Airlines jet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're still hoping for the best,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Jeanne Reincke,
relaying reports from the red-and-white helicopters that hovered over the slick.
</P>
<P>
	   About 10 miles off the beaches and headlands northwest of Los Angeles, the
ocean's surface was streaked with widening lines of foam, plastic, paper and
what appeared to be pieces of the jet.
</P>
<P>
	   With light fading, the searchers started finding bodies along with debris.
</P>
<P>
	   A glow spread across the waves from the high-powered lights of squid fishing
boats, beaming their searchlights onto the water.
</P>
<P>
	   Help came from small boats and cargo ships, military planes and oil
platforms. The Navy was sending ships from San Diego, and a Navy plane flew
patterns over the crash site.
</P>
<P>
	   When word of the crash spread, fishing boats took off from the Channel
Islands Harbor, a popular tourist port for whale-watching, fishing charters and
island tours.
</P>
<P>
	   From the oil drilling platform Gina between the Channel Islands and the
mainland, rig workers set out in crew boats for the search site several miles
away. They were fighting wind and swells, and were not optimistic about finding
survivors, said Lee Clark of the Torch Operating Co., which runs the platform.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It doesn't look like it's good news,'' Clark said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Giuliani already spending heavy in Senate race  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rudolph Giuliani are not
even declared candidates, yet each has spent millions of dollars on what is
shaping up as the costliest U.S. Senate race in history.
<P>
	   Over the last six months of 1999, Giuliani raised $8.8 million, according to
papers his campaign filed with the secretary of the U.S. Senate on Monday. He
spent $4.6 million last year - more than many Senate candidates have even raised
so far.
</P>
<P>
	   All total, Giuliani took in $11.5 million last year, outpacing the first
lady, who only began her fund raising in July.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton raked in $8 million. Like the mayor, the first lady spent
heavily, shelling out $3.4 million in her six months of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
	   A detailed account of who contributed what and where the campaigns spent
their money was not available. That information is contained in massive reports
each campaign is filing with the Federal Election Commission that had to be
postmarked by Jan. 31. Only summary pages were made available Monday by the
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani had $7.4 million in cash on hand at the end of 1999, according to
his filing. Mrs. Clinton trailed him with $4.7 million on hand, her report
showed.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, Mrs. Clinton's spokesman Howard Wolfson called the first lady's
financial filing "very strong." Mrs. Clinton is set to formally announce her
candidacy Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Although it was unclear specifically where either candidate spent the cash,
Giuliani's aides have said that about $700,000 went for a television ad
campaign. The Giuliani camp has also spent money on a direct-mail campaign to
solicit donations. Many of those fund-raising letters have appealed to
conservatives and have taken shots at Mrs. Clinton. One called the first lady
"leader of the ultra left-wing." Direct mail, much of it from outside of New
York state, has accounted for about 40 percent of Giuliani's fund raising.
</P>
<P>
	   The bulk of each candidate's contributions came from individual donors, who
can only give up to $2,000. Giuliani raised $8.7 million from those individual
contributors, Mrs. Clinton $6.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani aides have said they have raised money from residents in all of New
York's 62 counties.
</P>
<P>
	   The Giuliani camp also raised $245,311 from political action committees,
$178,536 of that in the last six months. Giuliani recently hired a Washington,
D.C.-area fund raiser, Julie Wadler, who said she would specialize in raising
PAC contributions for the mayor.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton brought in $219,925 from PACs.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton's report also showed a $1.2 million transfer from a committee
set up by her campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Mrs.
Clinton did several joint fund raisers with the DSCC and was required to set up
a separate account for those contributions under federal election law, her
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Anthony Corrado, a government professor who specializes in campaign finance
at Colby College in Maine, said the Clinton-Giuliani race was easily on track to
be the most expensive political contest in U.S. Senate history.
</P>
<P>
	   "The difference in this race is that in addition to the candidates spending
enormous amounts of money, millions and millions of dollars will be spent by the
political parties and outside interest groups," Corrado said, referring to the
largely unregulated soft money spent on candidates' behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   Those totals are not included in the candidates' filings.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're looking at a level not seen in previous Senate races," Corrado said.

<HEADLINE> No. 18 Oklahoma 83, No. 16 Texas 59  </HEADLINE>
    By OWEN CANFIELD AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORMAN, Okla. (AP) -- J.R. Raymond scored 25 points and Eduardo Najera had
18 points and 16 rebounds as No. 18 Oklahoma handed No. 16 Texas its most
lopsided loss of the season, 83-59 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sooners (17-3, 5-2 Big 12) held Texas to 34 percent shooting, a far cry
from the 57 percent the Longhorns shot in beating Oklahoma 79-66 on Jan. 15.
</P>
<P>
	   Gabe Muoneke of Texas tied a career high with 30 points in that game, but
wasn't a factor this time. The Longhorns (14-6, 6-2) had to rely on 7-footer
Chris Mihm, who had 21 points and 12 rebounds but was swarmed by two and three
defenders just about every time he touched the ball. As a result, he was just
7-of-17 from the field.
</P>
<P>
	   Najera didn't appear bothered by a broken bone in his left hand, an injury
suffered in practice last week. He banged with Mihm all night, and occasionally
Muoneke, and sparked Oklahoma with his hustle.
</P>
<P>
	   Muoneke, who averages 14 points per game, picked up two fouls, one of them a
technical, in the first two minutes. He never got going and finished with six
points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Longhorns survived from the perimeter early, but didn't hit from inside
or outside while going nearly 7 1/2 minutes without scoring midway through the
first half.
</P>
<P>
	   Oklahoma outscored the Longhorns 11-0 during that stretch to take a 27-17
lead. Texas got within 29-25 with 2:45 remaining, but Najera fueled an 11-3
spurt the rest of the way, scoring six points and making a steal as Oklahoma
took a 40-28 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   The closest Texas got after that was 10 points, on two free throws by
Muoneke to open the second half. Oklahoma repeatedly beat the Longhorns down
court for easy baskets and took advantage of their poor shooting to keep pulling
away.
</P>
<P>
	   Oklahoma got contributions from throughout the lineup -- Victor Avila came
off the bench to score 13, and Kelley Newton had nine points and six rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Monday, the Longhorns' worst loss had been 61-45 at Wisconsin on Dec.
7.

<HEADLINE> Labor Unseats Dominica Government  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE FAUL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROSEAU, Dominica (AP) -- The Dominica Labor Party ousted the government in a
closely contested election that featured allegations of corruption, pacts with
international gangsters and a secret deal with a religious sect.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after preliminary results were announced, incoming leader Rosie
Douglas said he would halt Dominica's controversial program of raising money by
selling passports to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
	   The policy played center stage during the campaign, with Douglas' party
claiming it sullied the Caribbean island's reputation.

<P>
	   Labor's narrow victory will force it into a coalition -- already discussed
before the vote -- with one-time rivals from the conservative Dominica Freedom
Party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I thought we would have done even better,'' Douglas told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview. He added that he would work to allow the Freedom
Party ``to feel comfortable in the government, in that way we will be able to
effectively rule.''
</P>
<P>
	   Preliminary results Monday night gave Labor 10 seats -- up from five -- nine
seats for the outgoing United Workers' Party and two seats for the Dominica
Freedom Party. Official results were expected by early Tuesday. Some 60,000
people were registered to vote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We concede that we have lost the election,'' the outgoing Communications
Minister Earl Williams said on private Marpin Channel 5 television.
</P>
<P>
	   Freedom Party leader Charles Savarin -- who retained his seat by a mere six
votes -- said election results were a victory for Dominicans, especially the
poor who refused to have their votes bought ``by politicians seeking to win by
corruption.''
</P>
<P>
	   Douglas said his government would immediately halt and review the
passport-selling program. His party charged repeatedly during the campaign that
the program has hurt Dominica's image.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm going to stop it immediately,'' said Douglas, 56, a veteran politician
with a degree in political science from Canada's McGill University.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to get out all the kinks, and to see if it is able to measure up
to international law ... It must be something strictly to help the development
of the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Labor Party warned the practice may make travel more difficult for
islanders and their relatives who have left the country. Dominica has less than
80,000 residents, but another 100,000 live abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   During the campaign, Prime Minister Edison James denied Labor Party charges
that some of the estimated 1,000 economic citizens are criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   James was looking for a second term and had been promoting his government's
record of building homes, schools and water pipelines. He also touted the
island's economic growth of 3.5 percent last year, despite troubles within the
banana industry, the biggest earner of foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. State Department has also criticized Dominica's economic
citizenship program. In a report last year, it said passports had been sold to
some 300 Russians. Noting the increasing power of Russian gangs, the report said
the passport sales raised concerns of money laundering in Dominica.
</P>
<P>
	   Islanders became concerned after Canada arrested several Chinese people
carrying Dominica passports on suspicion that they are involved in an
immigration smuggling ring run by Chinese gangs.
</P>
<P>
	   James says Labor has no proof of its charges. But his party has already been
hurt by revelations that his government loaned $38 million from the country's
social security fund to developers.
</P>
<P>
	   James said the money will be paid back, but the loans have outraged workers.

<HEADLINE> Airliner Crashes Off Coast Near L.A.  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFF WILSON Associated Press Writer

<P>
	   OXNARD, Calif. (AP) -- An Alaska Airlines jet carrying at least 70 people
plummeted into the Pacific Ocean 40 miles northwest of the Los Angeles airport
Monday after reporting mechanical problems. Several bodies were recovered from
the chilly water, but there was no sign of survivors.
</P>
<P>
	   Flight 261 was heading from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco and
later to Seattle. It had been diverted to Los Angeles to attempt an emergency
landing, the Federal Aviation Administration said.
</P>
<P>
	   A large field of debris rolled in big swells about eight miles offshore as
aircraft and small boats converged on the site just before sunset. Hours later,
the high-power lights of commercial squid boats illuminated the darkness as a
cutter and small boats continued the search.
</P>
<P>
	   Several bodies were found, Coast Guard Lt. Chuck Diorio said, but he could
not give a specific number.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every resource is out there to find people,'' said Coast Guard Capt.
George Wright. ``We're actively searching for survivors. ... In 58-degree water
temperature, people can survive. We're not going to quit until we're positive
there's absolutely no chance.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cynthia Emery, FAA flight operations officer in Seattle, said there were 65
passengers and five crew members on the flight. Alaska Airlines spokesman Jack
Evans said there were 80 passengers and 5 crew members.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane was an MD-83, part of the MD-80 series aircraft built by McDonnell
Douglas, now part of Boeing, said John Thom, a spokesman for Boeing's Douglas
aircraft unit. The plane that crashed had been delivered to Alaska Airlines in
1992, Thom said.
</P>
<P>
	   The jet's crew had reported mechanical difficulties and asked to land at Los
Angeles, said Ron Wilson, a spokesman for the San Francisco airport.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Radar indicates it fell from 17,000 feet and then was lost from radar,''
Wilson told KRON-TV in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline said the pilot reported having problems with the ``stabilizer
trim'' shortly before the plane crashed.
</P>
<P>
	   On the MD-80 series airplanes, the horizontal stabilizer looks like a small
wing mounted on top of the tail. The stabilizer, which includes panels that
pitch the nose up and down, is brought into balance, or ``trimmed,'' from the
cockpit.
</P>
<P>
	   If a plane lost its horizontal stabilizer, it would have no means to keep
the nose pointed at the proper angle up or down, and the plane would begin an
uncontrollable dive.
</P>
<P>
	   A source with close knowledge of the investigation, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the flight was normal and stable until the crew reported control
problems. Radar showed the plane plunging toward the ocean shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coast Guard and Alaska Airlines put the time of the crash at 4:36 p.m.
FAA spokesman Eliott Brenner in Washington said it went into the water about
4:15.
</P>
<P>
	   Evans, the airline spokesman, said the aircraft had no previous stabilizer
trim problems. He also said the plane was serviced on Sunday, went through a
low-level maintenance check on Jan. 11 and had a more thorough routine check
last January.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines, which has a distinctive image of an Eskimo painted on the
tails of its planes, has an excellent safety record. It serves more than 40
cities in Alaska, Canada, Mexico and five Western states.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Transportation Safety Board was assembling a team of
investigators in Washington, D.C., and planned to send them to the crash site,
spokesman Pat Cariseo said. Gov. Gray Davis said he had ordered the California
National Guard to offer whatever help is needed.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather was clear at the crash site, where the water is about 750 feet
deep, said Coast Guard Cmdr. Jim McPherson.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, a Kenya Airways flight crashed into the Atlantic Ocean shortly
after take off from Abidjan, Ivory Coast. The Airbus 310 carried 10 crew members
and 169 passengers. At least 10 people survived.
</P>
<P>
	   Last Oct. 31, EgyptAir Flight 990 plummeted into the ocean 60 miles south of
the Massachusetts island of Nantucket. All 217 people aboard the Boeing 767 were
killed.
</P>
<P>
	   The most recent fatal crash in the United States involving an MD-80 series
jet was last summer's American Airlines accident in Little Rock, Ark. Eleven
people were killed and 110 injured when an MD-82 landed in high wind and heavy
rain, ran off the runway, broke apart and caught fire.
</P>
<P>
	   The MD-80 is a twin-jet version of the more widely known DC-9, with a single
aisle and an engine on each side of the tail. It went into service in 1980 and
has had at least five variations that offer different ranges and seating
capacities.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines, based in Seattle, operates several flights from Puerto
Vallarta, a resort on Mexico's Pacific coast, to San Jose, San Francisco and
other California cities.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline had two fatal accidents in the 1970s, both in Alaska, according
to Airsafe.com, a Web site that tracks plane crashes.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1971, an Alaska Airlines Boeing 727-100 approaching Juneau crashed into a
mountain slope after the crew had received misleading navigational information.
All 104 passengers and seven crew members and were killed.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1976, one passenger was killed when a 727 overran the runway after
landing in Ketchikan.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson said San Francisco airport officials offered to help friends and
families of the victims Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whatever they want us to do,'' he said. ``We'll put them up for the night.
We'll feed them. We'll console them. We'll bring to them whatever they desire.''

<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Jaromir Jagr scored the tying goal with 8:42 left in the
third period, then set up Robert Lang for the game-winner in overtime as the
Pittsburgh Penguins beat the Atlanta Thrashers 2-1 on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   With the Penguins on a power play, Jagr skated out of the right corner and
fed a pass to Lang parked wide open in front of the net. He buried the shot with
32 seconds remaining in the extra period, giving Pittsburgh its first overtime
victory in 10 games this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Barasso stopped 27 shots for his 350th career victory.
</P>
<P>
	   The expansion Thrashers stretched their winless streak to eight games. They
have yet to win in overtime, dropping to 0-3-7 for the season.
</P>
<P>
	   Jagr was credited with his NHL-leading 36th goal after initially believing
he was victimized on a magnificent glove save by Scott Fankhouser.
</P>
<P>
	   The rookie goalie made the initial stop on Alexei Kovalev, the puck
deflecting to Jagr in the right faceoff circle. He fired toward the open net,
but Fankhouser slid back across the crease with his glove hand to thwart Jagr,
who collapsed face-first to the ice in disgust.
</P>
<P>
	   But the video official changed the call when the replay showed Fankhouser's
glove was across the goal line as he made the stop. Dozens of angry fans, taking
advantage of "Mouse Pad Night," tossed their free gifts onto the ice, drawing a
delay of game penalty for the Thrashers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Penguins failed to take advantage of that chance, but they picked up a
second point in overtime after the Thrashers received an extra penalty during a
melee in front of the Atlanta goal.
</P>
<P>
	   After it was all sorted out, the Penguins received two penalties --
including Barraso for leaving the crease as he skated the length of the ice to
even things up -- but three Thrashers were cited, leaving the Penguins with a
4-on-3 skating advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   Jagr might have suffered a broken left thumb when slashed by a Thrashers
player in the second period. While complaining about the lack of a call, he was
given a 10-minute misconduct penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   Fankhouser made 28 saves, including eight stops in overtime before Lang
finally broke through.

</P>
<P>
	   Lewis, middle linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens, was charged after a day
of investigation into the slaying at the Cobalt lounge in Atlanta's Buckhead
neighborhood about 4 a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis, who had been thought to be en route to the Pro Bowl game in Hawaii,
was taken into custody and was expected to appear in court on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Two men were stabbed during a fight that broke out just as the party was
ending at the club.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said six men had fought and argued with the two victims. The men
fled in a black Lincoln Navigator stretch limousine, firing at least five
gunshots as they drove away.
</P>
<P>
	   Police found the vehicle, with New York license plates, in a parking lot
behind a hotel near the shooting scene, Atlanta police spokesman John Quigley
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Quigley and Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokesman John Bankhead both
said they could not release details of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Local broadcast outlets said earlier that Lewis had been questioned as a
possible witness but was not a suspect.
</P>
<P>
	   One man died at the scene and the other victim died at Grady Memorial
Hospital. The Fulton County Medical Examiner's office identified the victims as
Jacinta Baker, 21, and Richard Lollar, 24, both of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the report of shots, Atlanta police Lt. M.C. Smith said the
preliminary investigation indicated both victims were stabbed to death.

<HEADLINE> Devils Coach Suspended One Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- New Jersey coach Robbie Ftorek was suspended
for one game and fined $10,000 by the NHL on Monday for throwing part of the
team's bench onto the ice in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
	   Ftorek threw the bench during the second period of New Jersey's 3-1 loss to
the Red Wings on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   "The actions of Mr. Ftorek are unacceptable," said Colin Campbell, the NHL's
executive vice president and director of hockey operations. "All coaches must
meet a standard of decorum, and any coach who demeans the game is accountable
for his actions."
</P>
<P>
	   Ftorek was incensed that referee Stephen Walkom failed to stop play while
Devils forward Jay Pandolfo lay on the ice with serious facial cuts. While play
continued, Detroit's Kirk Maltby scored to give the Red Wings a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Pandolfo required 84 stitches to close four separate wounds on his forehead
and around his left eye. Walkom said after the game he didn't stop play because
he hadn't seen Pandolfo, Ftorek said.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistants Larry Robinson and Slava Fetisov will coach the team during
Wednesday night's game at New York against the Rangers.

<HEADLINE> Report: Radio Liberty Reporter Held  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A Russian journalist who was detained in the breakaway region
of Chechnya will remain in custody for another week, the Interfax news agency
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, U.S.-financed Radio Liberty announced that correspondent Andrei
Babitsky had disappeared on Jan. 15, when he last called his family and
colleagues from the Chechen capital, Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian Interior Ministry said Friday that Babitsky had been detained
because he did not have proper accreditation to report from the war zone.
</P>
<P>
	   Interfax quoted Russia's acting prosecutor-general, Vladimir Ustinov, as
saying Monday that Babitsky was being detained for 10 days beginning last
Thursday. He said it had taken several days to identify the reporter, Interfax
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecutor's press office could not confirm the Interfax report.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted a presidential aide Monday as
saying that Ustinov will travel to the North Caucasus region to investigate
Babitsky's case. The visit will come Tuesday or Wednesday, said Sergei
Yastrzhembsky.
</P>
<P>
	   Yastrzhembsky said the issue was not Babitsky's accreditation, but whether
he had ``permission to be on the grounds of a military unit,'' ITAR-Tass said.
Babitsky was under the protection of a rebel leader while in Grozny, the report
quoted Yastrzhembsky as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   Babitsky has angered Russian officials with his consistent criticism of the
Chechnya war. The Russian government has accused Babitsky in the past of backing
the rebels, and secret service agents raided his Moscow apartment Jan. 8 and
seized photographs he had taken of dead Russian soldiers, his wife, Lyuda
Babitskaya, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Journalists are occasionally detained by the strict military command in and
near Chechnya, but are usually released quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   Most Russian media have generally supported the war, though some have grown
more critical as the fighting has dragged on.

first-degree murder in the shooting death of Cherica Adams, who was pregnant
with their son. Carruth was released by the Panthers after the charges were
lodged.
</P>
<P>
	   Just last Friday, in his state of the NFL address, commissioner Paul
Tagliabue commented on the recent rash of criminal charges against current NFL
players.
</P>
<P>
	   "Can we separate ourselves from society? Of course not," Tagliabue said. "We
can't predict what NFL players will do any more than we can predict students
shooting other students or workers shooting fellow workers."

<HEADLINE> Magic, Nuggets Agree to Trade  </HEADLINE>
    By FRED GOODALL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The Orlando Magic continued to reshape their roster
under an extensive rebuilding plan Monday night, agreeing to a five-player trade
with the Denver Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal, which will be completed on Tuesday, sends forward Chris Gatling
and guard Tariq Abdul-Wahad, plus a future first-round draft pick to Denver for
forward Ron Mercer, guard Chauncey Billups and former Magic first-round pick
Johnny Taylor.
</P>
<P>
	   Magic general manager John Gabriel was unavailable for comment, but informed
Gatling and Abdul-Wahad of the move following Orlando's 117-113 loss to the
Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a business," said Gatling, obtained in an offseason trade from
Milwaukee in a deal that sent Danny Manning to the Bucks.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know that it's set in yet. I just played my heart out on the floor
and came in and found out I've been traded. I'm excited. Denver has a young
team. They're trying to do the same thing there that they're trying to do here."
</P>
<P>
	   Gatling and Abdul-Wahad embraced teammates and other Magic employees before
leaving the locker room. Gatling scored 10 points and had five rebounds in 25

three assists.
</P>
<P>
	   The move is part of Orlando's plan to clear up $18 million in salary cap
room for this summer, enough money to sign two free agents to maximum contracts.
San Antonio's Tim Duncan, Detroit's Grant Hill, Toronto's Tracy McGrady and
Charlotte's Eddie Jones all could be on the market this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   The Magic also have two first-round draft picks, their own and one from
Golden State, which should be a lottery selection.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nuggets were pushed to make the trade because they were concerned they
wouldn't be able to re-sign Mercer after the season.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mercer and I had an understanding from the very beginning that if I didn't
extend him before the season started, he was going to look around," Issel told
the Denver Post, which originally reported the story on it Web site Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   The first-round pick the Nuggets received was the one they gave up in a
trade for Keon Clark and Taylor with Orlando in January 1999.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Giuliani Spending Heavy  </HEADLINE>
   By SHANNON McCAFFREY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton and New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani have spent at least $8 million on what is shaping up to be a costly
U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani raised $8.8 million over the last six months, according to papers
his campaign filed Monday with the secretary of the U.S. Senate. He spent $4.6
million last year -- more than many Senate candidates have even raised so far.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani collected a total of $11.5 million last year, outpacing the first
lady, who only began fund raising in July.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton raked in $8 million. Like the mayor, she spent heavily,
shelling out $3.4 million in her six months on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
	   A detailed account of who contributed and where the campaigns spent money
was not available. That information is contained in massive reports the
campaigns must file with the Federal Election Commission that had to be
postmarked by Monday. Only summary pages were made available by the campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani had $7.4 million cash on hand at the end of 1999, according to his
filing. Mrs. Clinton trailed him with $4.7 million on hand, her report showed.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, her spokesman, Howard Wolfson, characterized her financial
filing as ``very strong.'' Mrs. Clinton plans to formally announce her candidacy
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Although it was unclear specifically where Giuliani has spent his cash,
aides have said that about $700,000 went for a television ad campaign. The
Giuliani camp also has spent money on a direct-mail campaign to solicit
donations. Many of those fund-raising letters have appealed to conservatives and
have taken shots at Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   The bulk of each candidate's contributions came from individuals. Giuliani
raised $8.7 million from individuals, and Mrs. Clinton $6.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani's campaign also raised $245,311 from political action committees --
$178,536 of that in the last six months. Mrs. Clinton brought in $219,925 from
PACs.
</P>
<P>
	   Her report also showed a $1.2 million transfer from a committee set up by
her campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Mrs. Clinton did
several joint fund-raisers with the DSCC and was required by law to open a
separate account for those contributions, Wolfson said.

<HEADLINE> Ravens' Lewis Charged With Murder  </HEADLINE>
    By JAMES PILCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Police charged Pro Bowl linebacker Ray Lewis with murder
late Monday in the slayings of two people outside an Atlanta nightclub hours
after the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis, middle linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens, was charged after a day
of investigation into the slaying at the Cobalt lounge in Atlanta's Buckhead
neighborhood about 4 a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis, thought to be en route to the Pro Bowl in Hawaii, was taken into
custody and expected to appear in court on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Two men were stabbed during a fight that broke out just as the party was
ending at the club.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said six men had fought and argued with the two victims. The men
fled in a black Lincoln Navigator stretch limousine, firing at least five
gunshots as they drove away.
</P>
<P>
	   Police found the vehicle, with New York license plates, in a parking lot
behind a hotel near the shooting scene, Atlanta police spokesman John Quigley
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Quigley and Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokesman John Bankhead both
said they could not release details of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Local broadcast outlets said earlier that Lewis had been questioned as a
possible witness but was not a suspect.
</P>
<P>
	   One man died at the scene and the other victim died at Grady Memorial
Hospital. The Fulton County Medical Examiner's office identified the victims as
Jacinta Baker, 21, and Richard Lollar, 24, both of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the report of shots, Atlanta police Lt. M.C. Smith said the
preliminary investigation indicated both victims were stabbed to death.
</P>
<P>
	   The 24-year-old Lewis, from Lakeland, Fla., became the second NFL player
this month charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
	   On Jan. 4, Carolina Panthers wide receiver Rae Carruth was charged with
first-degree murder in the shooting death of Cherica Adams, who was pregnant
with their son. Carruth was released by the Panthers after the charges were
lodged.
</P>
<P>
	   Just last Friday, in his state of the NFL address, commissioner Paul
Tagliabue commented on the recent rash of criminal charges against current NFL
players.
</P>
<P>
	   "Can we separate ourselves from society? Of course not," Tagliabue said. "We
can't predict what NFL players will do any more than we can predict students
shooting other students or workers shooting fellow workers."

<HEADLINE> Horizontal Stabilizers Explained  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines said the pilot of Flight 261, which went down off the
California coast Monday, reported problems with the ``stabilizer trim'' shortly
before the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   On an MD-80 series airplane, the horizontal stabilizer looks like a small
wing mounted on top of the tail. It includes the elevators, panels that point
the nose up and down. Stabilizer trim tabs are movable surfaces on the
horizontal stabilizer that help adjust the wing's aerodynamics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Trimming'' the stabilizer is an action a pilot uses to bring it into
balance. The trim tabs are controlled, or ``trimmed,'' via a wheel in the
cockpit.
</P>
<P>
	   If a plane lost control of its horizontal stabilizer, it would have no way
to keep the nose pointed at the proper angle up or down. Gravity would force the
plane into an uncontrollable dive.
</P>
<P>
	   A source with close knowledge of the investigation said investigators were
told that the last message controllers received was the pilot reporting that he
thought the plane had lost its horizontal stabilizer. Investigators were
gathering radar and voice tapes to verify that account.
</P>
<P>
	   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the crew was having
routine conversations with air traffic controllers and the plane was maintaining
a stable flight path until the crew reported control problems.
</P>
<P>
	   The radar track showed the plane plunging toward the ocean shortly
afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing, the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation
Safety Board were culling their records late Monday for reports of any similar
problems with the MD-80 series.

<HEADLINE> Airliner Crashes Off Coast Near L.A.  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFF WILSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OXNARD, Calif. (AP) -- An Alaska Airlines jet carrying 88 people plummeted
into the Pacific Ocean on Monday after its pilot reported mechanical problems
and was diverted to Los Angeles for an emergency landing. Several bodies were
recovered from the chilly water, but there was no sign of survivors hours after
the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   Flight 261, heading from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco and later
to Seattle, went down at 4:36 p.m. PST, the airline said.
</P>
<P>
	   A large field of debris rolled in big swells about eight miles offshore as
aircraft and small boats converged on the site just before sunset. Hours later,
the high-power lights of commercial squid boats illuminated the darkness as a
cutter and small boats continued the search.
</P>
<P>
	   Several bodies were found, Coast Guard Lt. Chuck Diorio said, but he could
not give a specific number.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every resource is out there to find people,'' said Coast Guard Capt.
George Wright. ``We're actively searching for survivors. ... In 58-degree water
temperature, people can survive. We're not going to quit until we're positive
there's absolutely no chance.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines spokesman Jack Evans said the plane was carrying 83
passengers and five crew members.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane was an MD-83, part of the MD-80 series aircraft built by McDonnell
Douglas, now part of Boeing, said John Thom, a spokesman for Boeing's Douglas
aircraft unit. The plane that crashed had been delivered to Alaska Airlines in
1992, Thom said.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline said the pilot reported having problems with the ``stabilizer
trim'' and asked to be diverted shortly before the plane crashed. ``Radar
indicates it fell from 17,000 feet and then was lost from radar,'' San Francisco
airport spokesman Ron Wilson told KRON-TV.

</P>
<P>
	   Evans said the plane had no previous stabilizer problems, and FAA spokesman
John Clabes said it had never been in an accident.
</P>
<P>
	   Evans also said the plane was serviced on Sunday, went through a low-level
maintenance check on Jan. 11 and had a more thorough routine check last January.
It was unclear what Sunday's service entailed.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines, which has a distinctive image of an Eskimo painted on the
tails of its planes, has an excellent safety record. It serves more than 40
cities in Alaska, Canada, Mexico and five Western states.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Transportation Safety Board was assembling a team of
investigators in Washington, D.C., and planned to send them to the crash site,
spokesman Pat Cariseo said. Gov. Gray Davis said he had ordered the California
National Guard to offer whatever help is needed.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather was clear at the crash site, where the water is between 300 and
750 feet deep, said Coast Guard Cmdr. Jim McPherson.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, a Kenya Airways flight crashed into the Atlantic Ocean shortly
after take off from Abidjan, Ivory Coast. The Airbus 310 carried 10 crew members
and 169 passengers. At least 10 people survived.
</P>
<P>
	   Last Oct. 31, EgyptAir Flight 990 plummeted into the ocean 60 miles south of
the Massachusetts island of Nantucket. All 217 people aboard the Boeing 767 were
killed.
</P>
<P>
	   The most recent fatal crash in the United States involving an MD-80 series
jet was last summer's American Airlines accident in Little Rock, Ark. Eleven
people were killed and 110 injured when an MD-82 landed in high wind and heavy
rain, ran off the runway, broke apart and caught fire.
</P>
<P>
	   The MD-80 is a twin-jet version of the more widely known DC-9, with a single
aisle and an engine on each side of the tail. It went into service in 1980 and
has had at least five variations that offer different ranges and seating
capacities.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines, based in Seattle, operates several flights from Puerto
Vallarta, a resort on Mexico's Pacific coast, to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
	   The airline had two fatal accidents in the 1970s, both in Alaska, according
to Airsafe.com, a Web site that tracks plane crashes.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1971, an Alaska Airlines Boeing 727-100 approaching Juneau crashed into a
mountain slope after the crew had received misleading navigational information.
All 104 passengers and seven crew members and were killed.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1976, one passenger was killed when a 727 overran the runway after
landing in Ketchikan.
</P>
<P>
	   San Francisco airport officials offered to help friends and families of the
victims Monday night, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whatever they want us to do,'' he said. ``We'll put them up for the night.
We'll feed them. We'll console them. We'll bring to them whatever they desire.''

<HEADLINE> Missionary Murder Suspect Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BHUBANESHWAR, India (AP) -- The main suspect in the burning death of an
Australian missionary and his two sons a year ago was arrested Tuesday sleeping
in a house in an eastern Indian village, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dara Singh had been sought by police throughout Orissa state since last
January, when Graham Staines, 58, and his children were burned to death as they
slept in their off-road vehicle after a Bible study meeting in the village of
Manoharpur.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite a $23,250 price on Singh's head, Hindu villagers had been protecting
and hiding him since the Jan. 23 mob attack, police have said. Staines had
worked since 1965 with leprosy patients in the area. His widow, Gladys, and
14-year-old daughter, Esther, have remained in India.
</P>
<P>
	   Police received a tip that Singh and two accomplices were sleeping in the
village of Gohira, the police inspector-general of law and order for Orissa, A.
Patnaik, told The Associated Press in the capital, Bhubaneshwar.
</P>
<P>
	   He said a police team surrounded the village and arrested Singh early
Tuesday. He was jailed overnight and then was to be transported to Baripada, the
nearest large town near Manoharpur.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Staines lives in Baripada, where she is attempting to open a hospital
for reconstructive surgery for leprosy victims.
</P>
<P>
	   The murder of the Baptist missionary and his sons -- Philip, 10, and
Timothy, 8 -- set off a national debate about the growing strength of the Hindu
militant movement. Some Hindu leaders have accused Christians -- especially
missionaries -- of fooling illiterate tribal people into converting.

Bush Nears Campaign Spending Record

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush spent almost $17.3 million -- some
$200,000 a day -- in the three months before the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire
primary and is nearing the spending record for an entire presidential campaign.
His spending total for the period between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31 was far more than
any of the other contenders for the Republican nomination, according to reports
filed Monday with the Federal Election Commission. Bush already has spent almost
as much money -- $37.3 million -- as most of the other candidates will be

'January Indicator' Ominous

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- For the first time in eight years, all of the broad stock
market indexes fell in January, an ominous sign for those market watchers who
use the so-called "January indicator" to predict the future. Market lore has it
that when the major indexes rise in January, stocks will gain over the full
year, and vice versa. But the stock market is rife with such indicators, and
most professional stock-pickers take them with a grain of salt. The Dow Jones
industrial average, the most closely watched index, ended January at 10,940.53,
down almost 5 percent from its close on Dec. 31, 1999.

Penguins on a power play, Jagr skated out of the right corner and fed a pass to
Lang parked wide open in front of the net. He buried the shot with 32 seconds
remaining in the extra period, giving Pittsburgh its fir7st overtime victory in
10 games this season. The expansion Thrashers stretched their winless streak to
eight games. They have yet to win in overtime, dropping to 0-3-7 for the season.
